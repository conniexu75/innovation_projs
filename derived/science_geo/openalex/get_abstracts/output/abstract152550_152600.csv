Fibroblast growth factor has been implicated in the definition of liver from foregut endoderm where FGFR4 is expressed and stimulation of hepatocyte DNA synthesis in vitro. Here we show that livers of mice lacking FGFR4 exhibited normal morphology and regenerated normally in response to partial hepatectomy. However, the FGFR4 (−/−) mice exhibited depleted gallbladders, an elevated bile acid pool and elevated excretion of bile acids. Cholesterol- and bile acid-controlled liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, was elevated, unresponsive to dietary cholesterol, but repressed normally by dietary cholate. Expression pattern and cholate-dependent, cholesterol-induced hepatomegaly in the FGFR4 (−/−) mice suggested that activation of receptor interacting protein 140, a co-repressor of feed-forward activator liver X receptor α, may mediate the negative regulation of cholesterol- and bile acid-controlled liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase transcription by FGFR4 and cholate. The results demonstrate that transmembrane sensors interface with metabolite-controlled transcription networks and suggest that pericellular matrix-controlled liver FGFR4 in particular may ensure adequate cholesterol for cell structures and signal transduction.

The FGF receptor kinase family consists of an extensive repertoire of alternately spliced products of four genes (fgfr1 to fgfr4), which are expressed in development in a temporal- and spatially specific mode (3.Xu X. Weinstein M. Li C. Deng C. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 33-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and in adult tissues in a cell type-specific mode (2.McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog.

Mice in which fgfr3 was disrupted are viable, but exhibit severe skeletal dysplasias due to overgrowth of long bones, which is a consequence of loss of restraints on growth of chondrocytes during endochondral ossification (6.Colvin J.S.

FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-8 have been implicated in definition of the liver from foregut endoderm where FGFR4 is expressed (8.Jung J. Zheng M. Goldfarb M. Zaret K.S. Science. 1999; 284: 1998-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). However, disruption of fgfr4 in the mouse germline resulted in no overt abnormalities (9.Weinstein M. Xu X. Ohyama K. Deng C.X. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All four fgfr genes are expressed in adult liver (10.Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Strain A. Diehl A. Liver Growth and Repair. 9. Chapman & Hall, London1998: 240-260Crossref Google Scholar), but only FGFR4 is expressed in mature hepatocytes (11.Kan M. Wu X. Wang F. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol.

External administration of FGF-7 and FGF-18, or expression of FGF-18 under control of liver specific-promoters, elicits hyperplasia in the liver (12.Housley R.M. Morris C.F. Boyle W. Ring B. Biltz R.

FGF-1 and FGF-7 elicit DNA synthesis in primary liver cell cultures enriched in hepatocytes (14.Kan M. Huang J.S. Mansson P.E. Yasumitsu H. Carr B. McKeehan W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether FGFR4 plays a role in liver in vivo, we examined the morphology of the liver and associated organs infgfr4 − /fgfr4 − mice, including the compensatory growth response after partial hepatectomy. Here we report no differences in liver architecture and kinetics or extent of restoration of liver mass between wild-type andfgfr4−/fgfr4 − animals. However, examination of liver-associated organs revealed a small, depleted gallbladder in the FGFR4-deficient mice that prompted an analysis of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. The results revealed that the FGFR4 deficiency caused a significant elevation of the excreted and total bile acid pools. Elevation of bile acid pools were coincident with constitutively elevated expression of Cyp7a, the limiting enzyme in the classical pathway for bile acid synthesis (16.Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis (17.Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). The FGFR4 knockout mice exhibited a cholate-dependent, cholesterol-induced hepatomegaly. Analysis of gene expression in the hepatomegalic livers of the mutant mice suggested points where both FGFR4 and bile acids exert negative controls on liver bile acid synthesis. These results implicate the pericellular matrix-controlled FGFR4 kinase complex in hepatocytes in control of cholesterol metabolism and bile acid synthesis in a physiological setting. Disruption of the mouse fgfr4locus was carried out in 129 Sv strain-derived ES cells as described (9.Weinstein M. Xu X. Ohyama K. Deng C.X. Development. 1998; 125: 3615-3623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type 129 Sv mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. FGFR4 (+/−) mice were generated by crossing FGFR4 (−/−) mice with wild-type 129 Sv mice, or by further crossing FGFR4 (+/−) with FGFR4 (−/−) mice. Only mice 7–8 weeks old were used in the study. Male mice were used for partial hepatectomy (PH)-induced liver regeneration experiments, and female mice were used in all other protocols. Mice were maintained in 12-h light/12-h dark cycles and were given free access to food and water. Standard rodent chow containing 0.02% (w/w) cholesterol and the standard chow supplemented with 2% (w/w) cholesterol or both 2% (w/w) cholesterol and 2% (w/w) sodium cholate was obtained from Alief Purina Feed Store, Inc. (Alief, TX). Two to four mice were employed for each experimental group, as described in the specific figure legends. After the mice were weighed, anesthetized, and exsanguinated, the livers or other tissues were harvested at 10:00 a.m., except that of the mice used in the PH-induced liver regeneration, which were harvested at the times indicated. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University System Health Science Center. Full-length murine Cyp7a (pCMV-mCyp7a), Cyp7b (phct1), and Cyp27a (pCMV-m27OH) cDNAs were gifts from Dr. David W. Russell (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Full-length murine LXRα (pCMX-mLXRα) and LXRβ (pCMX-mLXRβ) cDNAs were gifts from Dr. David J. Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Murine β-actin was amplified by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from mouse liver using sense primer 5′-GCACCAAGGTGTGATGGTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CGGTTGGCCTTCAGGGTTC-3′. Murine FGFR4 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from mouse liver using sense primer 5′-GATGGACAGGCCTTCCACGGG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGTTGCTGTTGTCCACGTGAGGTCTTC-3′. Murine HMG-CoA reductase cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from mouse liver using sense primer 5′-CGAGGAAAGACTGTGGTTTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CACGTTCCTTGAAGATCTTG-3′. Murine RIP140 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from mouse liver using sense primer 5′-CAGTCCTTGTTAAACACGTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CGATGACAGAAGTCCTTGTG-3′. Murine ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ISBT) cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from mouse small intestine using sense primer 5′-AGCATGACCACTTGCTCCAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-AAAGACGAGCTGGAAAACAG-3′. Murine intestinal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP) cDNA was amplified from mouse small intestine using sense primer 5′-ACAGGACTTCACCTGGTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GCGCTCATAGGTCACATC-3′. All products of RT-PCR were verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Riboprobes complementary to part of the cDNAs described above, which had been subcloned into pBluescript-SK, were transcribed into32P-labeled antisense riboprobes by T3 or T7 RNA polymerase using the MAXiscript kit (no. 1326, Ambion). The size of probes and the predicted protected fragments were as follows: β-actin, 197 and 139 nt; FGFR4, 267 and 198 nt; Cyp7a, 272 and 219 nt; Cyp7b , ∼200 and ∼170 nt; Cyp27a, 318 and 268 nt; HMG-CoA reductase, 248 and 192 nt; LXRα, 375 and 312 nt; LXRβ, ∼450 and ∼400 nt; RIP140, 306 and 228 nt; ISBT, 279 and 213 nt; and IBABP, 309 and 232 nt. Total RNA was isolated from livers or ileal tissue with the Ultraspec RNA Isolation System (BL-10200, Biotecx Laboratories) and specific mRNAs were measured by ribonuclease protection (RPA) using the HybSpeed RPA kit (no. 1412, Ambion). About 50 μg of liver or ileal RNA was hybridized with 1 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled specific antisense and β-actin riboprobes in the same reaction mixture. After treatment with ribonuclease, protected products were analyzed on 5% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, followed by autoradiography. Size of protection products was determined from the product of a DNA sequencing reaction parallel to the protection assays. The amount of each radiographic product was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The value of bands between samples was standardized by division of the value of the internal β-actin in each sample. Experimental values were expressed in units relative to the level of expression in wild-type mice on standard chow, which was assigned a value of one. Livers were homogenized in PBS containing 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS and centrifuged. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (no. 23225X, Pierce). A total of 25 μg of protein was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), incubated with 1/10,000 rabbit anti-mouse CYP7A antiserum (a gift from Dr. David W. Russell), washed, and then incubated with 1/20,000 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Development was carried out using the Amersham ECL-Plus detection regents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bile acids were measured enzymatically using the Bile Acids kit (no. 450-A, Sigma). To determine fecal bile acid excretion, the feces from individually housed mice were collected, weighed, and dried over a 72-h period. Then 0.5 g of dried feces was minced and extracted in 10 ml of 75% ethanol at about 50 °C for 2 h. The extract was centrifuged, and 1-ml samples of supernatant were diluted for assay to 4 ml with a 25% PBS solution. The bile acid concentration was measured enzymatically. The daily feces output (g/day per 100 g of body weight) and fecal bile acid content (μmol/g) were used to calculate the rate of bile acid excretion (μmol/day/100 g of body weight). The total bile acid pool size was determined as bile acid content of the small intestine, the gallbladder, the liver, and their contents. After the mice were weighed, anesthetized, and exsanguinated, the fresh organs were collected, minced together, and extracted in 15 ml of 75% ethanol at about 50 °C for 2 h. The extract was centrifuged, 1-ml samples of supernatant for assay were diluted to 4 ml with 75% ethanol, and then 1-ml samples were diluted to 4 ml with 25% PBS. Bile acids were determined enzymatically, and the pool size was expressed as micromoles of bile acid/100 g of body weight. To measure hepatic cholesterol level, 50 mg of fresh liver was minced, hydrolyzed, and extracted in 4 ml of 1 m KOH/methanol (diluted aqueous KOH (10 m) with 9 volumes of methanol) at 66 °C for 2 h. The extract was centrifuged, and the cholesterol concentration in the supernatant was measured using a Cholesterol kit (no. 139050, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cholesterol level was determined and expressed as milligrams of cholesterol/g of liver weight. Liver tissues were fixed overnight in Histochoice Tissue Fixative MB (no. H120–4L, Amresco), dehydrated through a series of ethanol treatments, and embedded in paraffin according to standard procedure. Sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A 70% hepatectomy, consisting of removal of the anterior and left lateral hepatic lobes, was performed on male mice at 10:00 a.m. Two hours prior to sacrifice of the animals for analysis, 50 μg/g of body weight of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was administered intraperitoneally. Remnant livers were removed and weighed at different times. BrdUrd incorporation in fixed liver sections was visualized with an anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (no. 2531, Sigma) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody. Positive hepatocytes were counted, and BrdUrd incorporation was expressed as the percentage of the number of labeled hepatocytes in four or five visual fields. Values are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) with the number of replicates described in the legends to figures. The statistical significance of differences between mean values (p < 0.05) was evaluated using the two-tailed Student's t test. A histological examination of the liver revealed no apparent abnormalities in the overall morphology, cellular content and arrangement of different compartments in wild-type (+/+) and FGFR4-deficient (−/−) mice. The knockout animals exhibited normal blood chemistry including glucose, protein, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels (data not shown). Partial hepatectomy was performed on both FGFR4 (−/−) mice and FGFR4 (+/+) mice, and both DNA synthesis and restoration of liver mass was measured periodically for up to 168 h after the operation. DNA synthesis peaked at the expected 38-h time point, and both the rate and extent of recovery of liver mass were identical in both wild-type and mutant mice (Fig. 1, A andB). Thus, FGFR4 is either not directly involved in compensatory growth of the liver in response to loss of 67% of the liver mass, or it is fully compensated for by other proliferative regulators. During surgical manipulation of livers for partial hepatectomy, we noted that the gallbladders of FGFR4 (−/−) mice, inclusive of contents, were smaller and weighed on average about 30% of those from FGFR4 (+/+) mice (Fig.1 C). The differential was maintained in mice fed a high cholesterol/cholate diet, although gallbladders exhibited an expected 4-fold increase in total weight (Fig. 1 D). Histological analysis revealed no apparent difference in gallbladder morphology and structure between mutant and wild-type mice (data not shown). Analysis of combined liver, gallbladder, and small intestine, as well as feces from both male and female FGFR4 (−/−), FGFR4 (+/−), and FGFR4 (+/+) mice, revealed that bile acids were elevated 2–3-fold in FGFR4-deficient mice (Fig. 2,A and B). Surgical ablation of the gallbladders from wild-type and FGFR4-deficient mice had no effect on the fecal bile acid excretion rate (Fig. 2 A). This suggested that an abnormality in bile acid metabolism and flow was the cause of the smaller gallbladders in mutant mice, rather than a defect in architecture and function of the gallbladders. It has been shown previously that acceleration of bile acid synthesis, by blocking bile acid feedback inhibition by blocking intestinal uptake, can accelerate gallbladder emptying and a decrease in gallbladder volume (18.Portincasa P. Di Ciaula A. Palmieri V.O. Baldassarre G. Palasciano G. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1994; 89: 909-914PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Portincasa P. Di Ciaula A. Palmieri V. Van Berge-Henegouwen G.P. Palasciano G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the bile acid pool increased by an expected 60% in FGFR4 (+/+) mice on a high cholesterol diet (20.Peet D.J. Turley S.D. Ma W. Janowski B.A. Lobaccaro J.M. Hammer R.E. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), the diet had little effect on the already elevated pool observed in the FGFR4-deficient animals (Fig. 2 C). Both newborn FGFR4 (+/+) and FGFR4 (−/−) animals exhibited a pool size of 20 μmol/100 g of body weight, which rose to 30 μmol/100 g on day 3 (Fig. 2 D). By day 6, the pool in FGFR4 (−/−) mice was 2 times that of normal at 60 μmol/100 g, and continued to increase through day 12, while pools were static in normal mice. During weaning, which causes an increase in the bile acid pools of both normal (21.Massimi M. Lear S.R. Huling S.L. Jones A.L. Erickson S.K. Hepatology. 1998; 28: 1064-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and mutant mice, the pool in FGFR4 (−/−) mice rose to 3 times (250 μmol/100 g of body weight) that of wild-type adult levels (about 80 μmol/100 g of body weight) at 21 days. Levels in mutant mice dropped to about 160 μmol/100 g after 1 month and remained static thereafter. This indicated that an elevation of bile acid pools in the FGFR-deficient mice occurs prior to maturation of mechanisms for reabsorption of bile acids in the ileum and liver (22.von Dippe P. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5942-5945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Shneider B.L. Setchell K.D. Crossman M.W. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the secondary acid pathway for synthesis of bile acids (24.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Expression of mRNA for IBABP and ISBT, whose transcription is activated and repressed by bile acids, respectively (25.Kanda T. Foucand L. Nakamura Y. Niot I. Besnard P. Fujita M. Sakai Y. Hatakeyama K. Ono T. Fujii H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26.Torchia E.C. Cheema S.K. Agellon L.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was increased and depressed, respectively, in mature FGFR4-deficient mice (Fig. 2, E and F). These observations suggested a role of FGFR4 in bile acid metabolism at the site of synthesis in the liver. Elevation of bile acids may result from accelerated conversion from cholesterol, or indirectly through increased availability of cholesterol substrate through its synthesis or deposition in the liver. Enzymes whose levels are regulated at transcription by substrates and products regulate both liver pathways (27.Rudling M. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 493-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first measured mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis in animals on standard rodent chow (≤0.02% cholesterol w/w). HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, which is repressed by sterols and activated when they are deficient (28.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Lipid. Res. 1980; 21: 505-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was elevated by 7-fold in the FGFR4 (−/−) animals, but down-regulated to near equal levels in both FGFR4 (+/+) and FGFR4 (−/−) animals fed a cholesterol-rich diet (Fig.3 A). Cyp7a, which converts cholesterol into 7α-hydroxycholesterol, is the rate-limiting enzyme in the classical route of bile acid synthesis (16.Russell D.W. Setchell K.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4737-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Cyp7a is positively regulated at transcription in a feed-forward mode by oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol (29.Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), and negatively regulated in feedback mode by bile acids. The expression of liver Cyp7a mRNA was elevated by 2.5-fold in FGFR4 (−/−) mice compared with wild-type animals (Fig. 3 B). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the elevation of the level of CYP7A protein was similar to the rise in mRNA (Fig. 3 C). Although the high cholesterol diet increased Cyp7a expression by 1.5-fold in wild-type mice, the increase failed to reach the elevated level of Cyp7a expression observed in FGFR4 (−/−) mice (Fig. 3 B). No increase over the elevated Cyp7a mRNA levels in the FGFR4-deficient animals was observed as a consequence of the high cholesterol chow. Cholate is a strong repressor of Cyp7a transcription (30.Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of cholate (2%, w/w) to the high cholesterol chow revealed that mechanisms for bile acid-mediated repression of Cyp7a expression were intact and similar to wild type. These combined results suggest that FGFR4 negatively regulates bile acid synthesis through repression of Cyp7a expression and that Cyp7a is constitutively elevated in its absence. FGFR4 (+/+) and FGFR4 (−/−) mice on a high cholesterol diet (Fig. 4, A andB) exhibited no significant difference in liver size or liver cholesterol concentration. When challenged with a diet containing both 2% (w/w) cholesterol and cholate that strongly repressed Cyp7a (Fig. 4 C), liver cholesterol concentration exhibited an expected increase of nearly 30 times in both wild-type and mutant mice. Unexpectedly, the liver weight in the FGFR4-deficient animals doubled within 2 weeks on the combined high cholesterol/cholate diet, and was 1.8 times larger than wild-type livers after 1 month (Figs.4 D and 5 A). Administration of cholate alone had no effect (data not shown). The cholesterol/cholate-induced hepatomegaly was confirmed by the 32% fewer hepatocytes per visual field in sections of livers from FGFR4 (−/−) mice (Fig. 5 B). A separate analysis of DNA synthesis by incorporation of BrdUrd (data not shown) confirmed that the hepatomegaly in FGFR4 (−/−) mice was due to hepatocyte hypertrophy rather than an increase in hepatocyte number.Figure 5Hepatomegaly in FGFR4 knockout mice on high cholesterol and cholate chow.

When Cyp7a is deficient (31.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Setchell K.D.R. Kayden H.J. Zerwekh J.E. Bjorkhem I. Herz J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18024-18031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), the secondary acid pathway of bile acid synthesis compensates by generation and disposal of potentially hepatotoxic oxysterols from cholesterol (24.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Lathe R. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23995-24001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32.Bjorkhem I. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 455-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the pathway is less stringently feedback-inhibited by bile acids than the classical pathway (33.Schwarz M. Lund E.G. Russell D.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We examined expression of cholesterol 27α-hydroxylase (Cyp27a) and oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7b), rate-limiting enzymes of the alternative acid pathway. Nuclease protection analysis revealed no difference between expression levels of Cyp27a or Cyp7b mRNA between FGFR4 (+/+) and FGFR4 (−/−) mice on standard chow. However, Cyp27a was repressed twice as effectively in mutants as in wild-type mice on the high cholesterol/cholate combination (Fig.6 A). We also observed a decrease in Cyp27a in the mutant mice fed high cholesterol without cholate. No difference in Cyp7b expression was detected under any of the conditions (data not shown). The exaggerated depression of Cyp27a in absence of FGFR4 under conditions where Cyp7a is severely repressed may contribute to the selective hepatomegaly in the FGFR4-deficient mice. The hepatomegalic phenotype in FGFR4 (−/−) mice induced by the high cholesterol/cholate combination was similar to that induced by cholesterol alone in mice devoid of the gene for the nuclear oxysterol receptor and transcription factor LXRα (20.Peet D.J.

We observed no change in the expression of LXRα or LXRβ mRNAs in all described conditions in wild-type and FGFR-deficient mice (data not shown). However, a screen for diet-dependent differences in expression of candidate co-activator/co-repressors of LXRα in the wild-type and FGFR4 knockout mice revealed that expression of the multi-functional co-activator and co-repressor RIP140 was responsive to the dietary manipulation (Fig. 6 B). Expression of RIP140 was depressed by 40% in wild-type mice fed high cholesterol, but elevated 1.8-fold in mice fed both cholesterol and cholate. RIP140 mRNA in FGFR4-deficient animals on standard chow was 30% of that in wild-type animals; the high cholesterol diet caused no further decrease, but surprisingly expression levels increased by over 10-fold in the mutant animals when cholate was added to the high cholesterol chow. RIP140 has been demonstrated to be a repressor of transcriptional activation by LXRα/retinoid X receptor (RXRα), as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α-RXRα heterodimers through interaction with LXRα or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (34.Miyata K.S.

The CTGF gene promoter has a TGF-β response element that regulates its expression in fibroblasts but not epithelial cells or lymphocytes. Recent studies have shown that the macrophage-produced cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is necessary to promote inflammation and to induce genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases, involved with the early stages of wound healing. In this study, we examined the ability of TNFα to modulate CTGF gene expression. TNFα was found to suppress the TGF-β-induced expression of CTGF protein in cultured normal fibroblasts. The activity of TNFα was blocked by NF-κB inhibitors. We showed that sequences between −244 and −166 of the CTGF promoter were necessary for both TGF-β and TNFα to modulate CTGF expression. There was a constitutive expression of CTGF by scleroderma fibroblasts that was increased by TGF-β treatment. Although TNFα was able to repress TGF-β-induced CTGF and collagen synthesis both in normal and scleroderma skin fibroblasts, fibroblasts cultured from scleroderma patients were more resistant to TNFα as TNFα was unable to suppress the basal level of CTGF expression in scleroderma fibroblasts. Thus, we suspect that the high level of constitutive CTGF expression in scleroderma fibroblasts and its inability to respond to negative regulatory cytokines may contribute to the excessive scarring of skin and internal organs in patients with scleroderma.

Collagen synthesis and accumulation are essential for normal tissue development, homeostasis, and wound repair. However, excessive collagen accumulation can lead to fibrotic disorders such as systemic sclerosis, keloids, and cirrhosis of the liver (1.Gruschwitz M. Muller P.U. Sepp N. Hofer E. Fontana A. Wick G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 197-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Peltonen J. Kahari L. Uitto J. Jimenez S.A.

Several polypeptide growth factors regulate tissue repair and fibrosis. One of these, the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β),1 is important in wound healing, being necessary for fibroblast proliferation, stimulation of granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and increasing the tensile strength of healing wounds (4.Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1137-1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.McCartney-Francis N.L. Wahl S.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TGF-β is markedly up-regulated in normal wound healing where it elevates collagen synthesis until healing is complete. It is the persistent activation of the genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins that distinguishes controlled wound repair from uncontrolled connective tissue deposition leading to pathologic fibrosis. One such fibrotic disorder is the debilitating disease scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) which is characterized by progressive skin and internal organ scarring characterized by excessive collagen deposition. The fibrotic process results in the disruption of the normal architecture of the affected organs and ultimately leads to their dysfunction and failure. TGF-β not only causes an increase in collagen expression in wound healing, but it also has diverse effects on other cell types; for example, it suppresses the growth of epithelial cells, inhibits keratinocyte proliferation, enhances neovascularization, and acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes and fibroblasts (6.Markowitz S.D.

The regulation of CTGF appears to be controlled primarily at the level of transcription, and a brief exposure of fibroblasts to TGF-β is sufficient to induce a prolonged high level of CTGF expression (13.Grotendorst G.R.

In human dermal and mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, no CTGF protein or mRNA is observed without TGF-β treatment (12.Grotendorst G.R.

CTGF mRNA is constitutively expressed in bovine aortic endothelial cells, and TNFα suppresses this expression (22.Lin J. Lilienseik B. Kanitz M. Schimaski U. Bohrer H. Walhherr R. Martin E. Kauffmann G. Zeigler R. Nawroth P.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 802-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the role of TNFα in suppressing TGF-β-induced CTGF gene and protein expression in normal fibroblasts. We found that TNFα suppressed the induction of CTGF by TGF-β in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, we determined that a sequence in the CTGF promoter was necessary both for the TGF-β induction and the TNFα suppression of CTGF gene expression. In contrast, scleroderma cells constitutively express CTGF protein, and TGF-β enhances this expression to approximately twice that of normal fibroblasts. However, scleroderma cells are more resistant to TNFα than normal dermal fibroblasts. We surmise that this defect in the TNF-mediated signaling pathway(s) might contribute to fibrosis in these patients. Human scleroderma (SSc) lesional dermal fibroblasts and normal fibroblast cell lines were established from skin biopsies of lesional (fibrotic) areas of the skin of patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, and age, sex, and anatomically site-matched healthy volunteers, respectively. All patients fulfilled the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for the diagnosis of SSc. Informed consent and ethical approval were obtained for all procedures. Fibroblasts were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (minimal essential medium) (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. At confluence, brief trypsin treatment and re-culture at a fibroblast cell dilution of one in three passaged fibroblasts. All cells lines were used between passages two and five (23.Shi-Wen X.

Human foreskin fibroblast cells (Clonetics) were grown in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown to confluence and switched to DMEM supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium. Cells were grown for an additional 18 h, and then 10 ng/ml TNFα (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. Two hours later, 25 ng/ml TGF-β2 (Celtrix) was added. No difference was observed between the abilities of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 to induce CTGF. For anti-CTGF blots, 24 h later, media were removed, and 25 μl was electrophoresed through a 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and blotted to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Alternatively, cells were harvested 24 h post-TGF-β addition and lysed in 2% SDS. 25 μg of total protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions on a 4–20% Tris/glycine gel (Novex) and then electrophoretically blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore). Filters were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. CTGF protein was detected by a 1-h incubation of a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-CTGF antibody in 1% milk, TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, followed by a 1-h incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Proteins were detected by a chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Vimentin was detected similarly, except 25 μg of cell layer, a mouse anti-vimentin antibody (1:1000 dilution; Dako), and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used. Scleroderma and normal dermal fibroblasts were similarly analyzed, except TNFα was from R & D Systems. Sodium salicylate (Calbiochem) was added 45 min prior to addition of factor and was used at concentrations shown in the figures. Cell-permeable peptide SN50 (Calbiochem) which blocks the migration of NF-κB into the nucleus was used as described (25.Liu R.Y. Fan C. Olashaw N.E. Wang X. Zuckerman R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13877-13885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human foreskin fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips to approximately 80% confluence in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were switched to serum-free DMEM for 10 h, and 10 ng/ml TNFα was added. Twelve hours later, 25 ng/ml TGF-β2 was added. Twenty four hours later, cells were washed in PBS and were fixed in absolute methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. After blocking in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, a 1:400 dilution of rabbit anti-CTGF antibody was added for 30 min. After washing in PBS, a 1:300 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody was added for 30 min (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing, nuclei were stained in 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylidone (DAPI; Molecular Probes). Cells were examined using a Nikon E800 microscope and documented by photography. A stable NIH 3T3 cell line containing the CTGF promoter coupled to the luciferase reporter gene was generated. First, a CTGF promoter containing 805 base pairs of 5′ upstream region coupled to the luciferase reporter gene (13.Grotendorst G.R. Okochi H. Hayashi N. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 469-480PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and SmaI and was subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRV sites of pcDNAneo 3.1 (Invitrogen). This resulted in a plasmid containing the CTGF promoter driving luciferase and a gene encoding G418 resistance. This plasmid was transfected into NIH 3T3 (American Type Culture Collection) cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.), and drug-resistant colonies were selected by adding 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). For luciferase assays involving this cell line, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of approximately 1.25 × 105/well and grown in DMEM with 5% calf serum and 800 μg/ml G418. The next day, cells, at 80% confluence, were changed to DMEM with no serum. Then TNFα was added, and 1 h later 10 ng/ml TGF-β2 was added. After 24 h, cells were washed in PBS, and 350 μl of reporter lysis buffer was added for 30 min (Promega), and the cell layer were scraped and pelleted for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce) and a microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Equal amounts of protein (5 μg) were analyzed using a TR717 microplate luminometer (Tropix) and a luciferase assay kit as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). By using the CTGF luciferase plasmid as template, promoter fragments of various lengths were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (Perkin-Elmer) with vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers were from Life Technologies, Inc. PCR fragments were designed so that they could be digested with KpnI and XhoI and subcloned into the SEAP basic vector (CLONTECH). The resultant constructs were sequenced using an ABI model 373 sequencer as described by the manufacturer. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE Plus, and media were assayed (SEAP Detection Kit, CLONTECH). To control for variations in transfection efficiency, CTGF promoter plasmid DNAs were cotransfected with cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase (CLONTECH), and cell layers were assayed by the Galscreen kit (Tropix). For NF-κB assays, we used pNFκBSEAP, a commercially available SEAP reporter construct driven by four copies of a site that confers NF-κB responsiveness to promoters and thus is a total readout of NF-κB and IκB activity in a cell (CLONTECH). Collagen type I levels were measured using an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (22.Lin J. Lilienseik B. Kanitz M. Schimaski U. Bohrer H. Walhherr R. Martin E. Kauffmann G. Zeigler R. Nawroth P.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 802-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, when fibroblast cultures reached confluence, the media were removed, and fresh minimal essential medium without fetal calf serum, but supplemented 1% bovine serum albumin and ascorbate acid (50 μg/ml), was added. Twenty four hours later, TNFα and TGF-β1 (R & D Systems), alone or in combination, were then added for a further 24 h. At this point, media were removed, and the amount of type I collagen was assessed (26.Rennard S.I. Berg R. Martin G.R. Foidart J.M. Robey P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Normal foreskin fibroblasts did not produce appreciable levels of CTGF in media, as judged by Western analysis unless incubated with TGF-β2 (Fig.1 A), as expected from past studies (9.Bradham D.M. Igarishi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). TNFα did not increase CTGF production (Fig.1 A). However, preincubation with 25 ng/ml TNFα for 12 h before addition of TGF-β completely abolished the ability of TGF-β to induce CTGF protein in media (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, TNFα suppressed the induction of CTGF in the cell layer (Fig. 1 B). This effect was not due to a general inhibition of protein expression, as neither the addition of TGF-β nor TNFα affected expression of vimentin protein in the cell layer (Fig.1 C), nor did they affect total protein expression, as visualized by Coomassie stain of total cell extracts (Fig.1 D). To verify these results, we used a polyclonal CTGF antibody to stain methanol-fixed fibroblasts with or without exposure to TGF-β or TNFα plus TGF-β. These studies showed that the addition of TGF-β to fibroblasts caused an increase in CTGF protein, which was largely localized to the extracellular matrix and cell surface (Fig.2 C). Conversely, addition of TNFα blocked CTGF protein accumulation in TGF-β-treated cells (Fig.2 D). TNFα often exerts its effects on cells through the NF-κB pathway, which is involved in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response (27.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that sodium salicylate selectively inhibits NF-κB by blocking the activity of IκB kinase-β, a component of IKK (28.Yin M.-J. Tamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) that blocks the induction of some TNFα-inducible genes (29.Gallois C. Habib A. Tao J. Moulin S. Maclouf J. Mallat A.

To determine if TNFα suppressed CTGF gene induction through NF-κB, we first transfected pNFκBSEAP into NIH 3T3 cells and incubated cells with or without TNFα. This construct contains the SEAP reporter driven by four copies of a NF-κB response element, and thus is a net readout of NF-κB and IκB activity in a cell. Adding TNFα for 24 h resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in reporter activity, which was reduced by sodium salicylate in a dose-responsive fashion (Fig.3 A). To determine if blocking NF-κB activity with sodium salicylate blocked the ability of TNFα to suppress CTGF induction by TGF-β, we then preincubated human foreskin fibroblasts with sodium salicylate for 1 h prior to TNFα addition. We found that sodium salicylate blocked the ability of TNFα to suppress CTGF gene induction (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were observed when adult dermal fibroblasts were used (not shown). Finally, we showed that peptide SN50, which blocks the migration of NF-κB into the nucleus, blocked the ability of TNFα to suppress CTGF induction by TGF-β (Fig.4). These results suggest that TNFα suppresses CTGF gene induction by a NF-κB-dependent mechanism.Figure 4Effect of SN-50 on TNFα-mediated suppression of TGF-β-induction of CTGF. The effect of SN50 was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CTGF antibody of media from fibroblasts treated with TNFα and/or TGF-β.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if TNFα suppressed the TGF-β-mediated increase in CTGF by inhibiting its transcription, we utilized a cell line that contained a stably integrated luciferase reporter molecule driven by a fragment of the CTGF 5′ upstream promoter (nucleotides −805 to +74). These studies showed that preincubation of cells for 2 h with TNFα before addition of TGF-β suppressed luciferase gene expression, in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.5). To identify cis-sequences necessary for the CTGF promoter to respond to TGF-β and TNFα, we generated a clone containing a truncated version of the CTGF promoter comprising nucleotides between −805 and +17 driving expression of the SEAP reporter (CTGFSEAP(−805); Fig.6). This construct was transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. This proximal promoter region of the CTGF promoter conferred responsiveness to the SEAP reporter to TGF-β (Fig. 7). We also generated additional constructs containing truncated versions of the CTGF promoter (Fig. 6). We found that removal of the sequences between −244 and −166 abolished the ability of the CTGF promoter to confer responsiveness to both TGF-β and TNFα. That is, both the TNFα and TGF-β responsive elements in the CTGF promoter lay between nucleotides −244 and −166 (Fig. 7).Figure 7Sequences in the CTGF promoter between −244 and −166 are necessary for the TGF-β and TNFα responsiveness of the CTGF promoter.Constructs containing 805, 244, and 166 base pairs of CTGF promoter were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells and standardized to an internal transfection control (cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase). Values, expressed in relative light units, represent the average of two independent experiments each performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if TNFα could suppress CTGF in scleroderma cells, we studied skin fibroblasts cultured from affected areas of four scleroderma patients and from four normal individuals. In the absence of TGF-β, we found no CTGF protein in normal dermal fibroblasts. However, abundant CTGF expression was observed 24 h after addition of TGF-β (Fig.8, top panel) that was decreased by TNFα. Conversely, CTGF protein was found to be constitutively expressed by the fibroblasts from the scleroderma lesions, even without addition of TGF-β (Fig. 8, top panel). The normal and scleroderma fibroblasts showed further elevation of CTGF protein expression upon TGF-β treatment. Addition of TNFα was less effective at suppressing CTGF induction in scleroderma fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 8,bottom panel). TNFα (500 units) did not reduce basal levels of CTGF in scleroderma fibroblasts (Fig. 8). To determine if scleroderma fibroblasts were generally less responsive to the antifibrotic effects of TNFα, we assessed the effect of TNFα on collagen synthesis in the dermal fibroblasts used in the study described above. We found that addition of TNFα (500 units) did not significantly alter the basal levels of collagen in normal dermal fibroblasts (Table I), while completely abolishing the stimulation of collagen synthesis by TGF-β (Table I). In contrast, 500 units of TNFα only reduced TGF-β-induced collagen levels by 50% in scleroderma fibroblasts (Table I). These results were consistent with our data concerning the lower sensitivity of scleroderma fibroblasts to the anti-fibrotic effects of TNFα on CTGF production. Furthermore, these results suggest that an overproduction of CTGF due to a decreased response to inhibitory factors may contribute to the overproduction of collagen by scleroderma fibroblasts.Table ITNFα regulates collagen type I secretion by normal and scleroderma fibroblasts, yet scleroderma fibroblasts are less sensitive to TNFαTreatmentCollagen type I (ng/ml/106cells) ±S.E.aAverage of five individual experiments.Normal fibroblastsScleroderma fibroblastsControl120.19 ± 15.44217.17 ± 28.64TGF-β241.34 ± 45.65340.58 ± 31.18TNFα80.98 ± 49.44181.39 ± 71.16TGF-β + TNFα103.27 ± 34.22280.85 ± 41.56a Average of five individual experiments. Open table in a new tab Collagen accumulation is the hallmark of fibrosis. The production or activation of TGF-β is thought to be up-regulated in normal wound healing and fibrotic lesions and is believed to elevate collagen synthesis. Thus agents that neutralize TGF-β have been shown to block or attenuate experimentally induced fibrosis (31.Xu X.M. Sansores-Garcia L. Chen X.M. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Du M. Wu K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

CTGF was originally detected in conditioned media of cultured endothelial cells and induces proliferation, cell migration, and collagen production (9.Bradham D.M. Igarishi A. Potter R.L.

Since CTGF is not expressed in epithelial cells or lymphocytes, other factors must control its differential expression. As shown in this report, TNFα suppresses the TGF-β-induced expression of CTGF acting at the transcriptional level. We found that the TGF-β-mediated induction of CTGF required a sequence of the CTGF promoter binding between −244 and −166 site. Removing this sequence also reduced the ability of the CTGF promoter to respond to TNFα. This sequence is upstream from the previously identified TGF-βRE (17.Ito Y. Aten J. Bende R.K.J. Oemar B.S. Rabelink T.J. Weening J.J. Goldschmeding R. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and suggests that factors binding to the CTGF promoter between −244 and −166 act with the TGF-βRE to activate gene expression. 3A. Leask and S. Sa, unpublished data. The identity of these factors is under investigation. Our results are supported by a recent report that showed that TNFα suppressed the basal levels of CTGF mRNA in bovine aortic endothelial cells (22.Lin J. Lilienseik B. Kanitz M. Schimaski U. Bohrer H. Walhherr R. Martin E. Kauffmann G. Zeigler R. Nawroth P.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 802-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, another report showed that TNFα suppressed the dexamethasone-mediated induction of CTGF mRNA in fibroblasts (36.Liu J.Y. Brass D.M. Hoyle G.W. Brody A.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1839-1847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Added to previous observations that CTGF can induce collagen gene expression, these results suggest that, at least in part, TNFα may suppress collagen gene expression by inhibiting CTGF induction by TGF-β. Previously, CTGF mRNA was detected in situ in fibrotic lesions of scleroderma patients (14.Igarashi A. Nashiro K. Kikuchi K. Sato S. Ihn H. Fujimoto M. Grotendorst G.R. Takehara K. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 729-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and was detected in a differential display analysis of normal and scleroderma fibroblasts.2 In this report, we found that scleroderma fibroblasts showed constitutive expression of CTGF protein. We also showed that these cells were less sensitive in their response to TNFα than normal fibroblasts in terms of both CTGF and collagen type I synthesis. TNFα levels are up-regulated in scleroderma (37.Hasegawa M. Fujimoto M. Kikuchi K. Takehara K. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 663-665PubMed Google Scholar). We surmise that TNFα in addition to initiating inflammatory responses, may also attenuate fibrosis by suppressing CTGF and collagen synthesis. Furthermore, our data suggest that TNFα does not act on the constitutive production of CTGF seen in fibroblasts from scleroderma lesions. We hypothesize that the excessive production of CTGF and the inability to suppress its production contribute to the fibrotic phenotype of this disease by allowing excessive scarring. These results suggest that investigating the molecular mechanism underlying the TNFα-mediated suppression of CTGF expression may yield valuable clues as to how the wound healing process is normally regulated and how this process goes awry in fibrosis. Normally, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytosol by inhibitory proteins, IκB, which may be phosphorylated by a cellular kinase complex termed IKK. TNFα stimulates this phosphorylation resulting in the degradation of IκB and the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus where it activates gene transcription (38.DiDonato T.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 39.Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhause M. Hayakawa M. Karin M.

In fact, using this inhibitor to block NF-κB reduces inflammatory responses and tissue destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (15.Bodenson J. Foxwell B. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5668-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). NF-κB may act either by directly binding to the CTGF promoter or by inducing genes that are involved with the suppression of CTGF. Further experiments will differentiate between these hypotheses. The molecular difference between normal and scleroderma fibroblasts that results in the latter's inability to respond as effectively to TNFα by suppressing CTGF and collagen gene expression may provide a molecular mechanism by which CTGF is constitutively expressed in scleroderma. These approaches should provide novel approaches to developing effective therapeutics for scleroderma, for which currently there are no effective treatments.

In CHO cells, approximately half of the internalized C6-NBD-SM, a fluorescent lipid analogue widely used as a membrane maker, recycles via the endocytic recycling compartment with a t 12 of ∼12 min (Mayor, S., Presley, J. F., and Maxfield, F. R. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 121, 1257–1269). Surprisingly, the rest returns to the plasma membrane very quickly. A detailed kinetic study presented in this paper indicates that after a brief internalization pulse, 42–62% of the internalized C6-NBD-SM returns to the plasma membrane with a t 12 of 1–2 min. Similar results are obtained using HEp2 and nonpolarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Using FM dyes of different hydrophobicity, we show that rapid recycling involves passage through an endocytic organelle that was subsequently identified as the sorting endosome by co-localization with internalized transferrin and low density lipoprotein. These results imply that the membrane internalization rate is much higher than previously estimated, with a t 12 as short as 5–10 min.

After internalization, endocytosed molecules are delivered rapidly to sorting endosomes (1.Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 2.Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), which consist of vesicles with tubular extensions that are involved in transport of recycling material (e.g.transferrin receptor) out of the sorting endosomes. A major recycling pathway involves subsequent passage through the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC),1 which in CHO cells is a collection of tubules concentrated near the centriole, from which molecules recycle back to the plasma membrane (t 12 ∼9–12 min) (3.Yamashiro D.J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 4.Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 5.Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Fluorescent lipid probes are very well suited for kinetic studies of endocytic recycling. Very bright signals can be obtained, and after internalization pulses, efficient desorption of certain lipid analogs from the plasma membrane allows accurate measurements of recycling with minimal interference from probe molecules left in the plasma membrane (6.Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After nonselective internalization, a fluorescent lipid analog, C6-NBD-sphingomyelin (C6-NBD-SM), exits sorting endosomes, enters the ERC, and then returns to the plasma membrane with kinetics indistinguishable from transferrin (Tf) in CHO cells (4.Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). After a 10-min internalization pulse with C6-NBD-SM, the efflux kinetics from CHO cells suggested the existence of a second, faster recycling pathway, in addition to the pathway through the ERC with a t 12 of ∼12 min (7.Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taking full advantage of the properties of lipid analogs, we have now characterized rapid kinetics of membrane recycling in various cell types, and we found that nearly half of the internalized membrane recycles with at 12 of about 1.5 min. This surprisingly rapid recycling requires internalization of the lipids with at 12 of 5–10 min in order to maintain membrane balance. These results imply that in most cells the exchange of membrane between the plasma membrane and the endosomes is much more extensive than formerly estimated. Rapid recycling was previously thought to be unique to specialized cells, and lipid analogs (e.g. C6-NBD-SM) have been used to study rapid recycling in cells such as erythroblasts, showing a recyclingt 12 of 2 min (8.Vidal M. Mangeat P. Hoekstra D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1867-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings, however, indicate that rapid recycling exists in many cell types. This has important consequences for processes such as nutrient uptake, cholesterol efflux, and regulation of surface expression of receptors. We confirmed the rapid recycling using another series of fluorescent lipophilic dyes, the FM dyes (Fig. 1), having a dicationic head group that prevents flip-flop across the bilayers (9.Betz W.J. Mao F. Smith C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The partition of the FM dyes between the aqueous phase and the lipid is determined by the tail length, and the quantum yield increases up to 2 orders of magnitude when FM dyes are transferred from water into membranes (9.Betz W.J. Mao F. Smith C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of these properties, we could determine whether rapid recycling involved fusion with a larger endosomal structure (e.g. a sorting endosome), followed by budding of recycling membrane (see Fig. 7). When the amphiphilic FM dyes enter an endocytic organelle, they distribute between membrane and aqueous volume according to their partition coefficients. As a consequence, a higher fraction of the less hydrophobic probes would be left behind when recycling membrane buds out from a parent organelle such as a sorting endosome. On the other hand, if rapid recycling involves direct return of vesicles that pinch from the plasma membrane, there should be no difference in recycling efficiency of various probes, because all internalized contents are released upon fusion.Figure 7Schematic diagrams of two models of the rapid recycling pathway. The “direct return model” is shown at thetop, and the “indirect return model” is shown at thebottom. In A, internalized vesicles fuse back with the plasma membrane without going through sorting endosomes. Therefore, the number of molecules recycled back to the plasma membrane should be exactly the same as the number internalized, independent of partition between the membrane and the aqueous content. In contrast, inB, internalized vesicles fuse with sorting endosomes, and recycling membrane subsequently buds from sorting endosomes to return to the plasma membrane. The fusion and budding process results in a difference in the percentage of molecules recycled back through rapid recycling, and the difference is related to the partition coefficient of each molecule. FM dyes are represented by filled circles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using three FM dyes of different hydrophobicity, we show that the rapid recycling pathway involved an organelle that was subsequently identified as the sorting endosome by double labeling with LDL. C6-NBD-SM, FM 2–10, FM 1–43, and FM 1–84 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The Cy5 labeling kit was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human Tf was from Sigma. Iron-loaded Tf was passed through a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration system as described previously (5.Yamashiro D.J. Tycko B. Fluss S.R. Maxfield F.R. Cell. 1984; 37: 789-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Cy5 was then conjugated to iron-loaded Tf following the manufacturer's instructions. Unbound dye was removed first by passage through a sizing column and then by overnight dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline. DiI-LDL (LDL labeled with 3,3′-dioctadecylindocarbocyanine) was a gift from Dr. Ira Tabas (Columbia University, New York). All tissue culture supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine was from Avanti Polar lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). All other chemicals were from Sigma. TRVb-1 is a modified CHO cell line that lacks endogenous Tf receptor and expresses the human Tf receptor (10.McGraw T.E. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). MDCK type II and HEp2 cells were from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. TRVb-1 cells were grown in bicarbonate-buffered Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 200 mg/ml Geneticin as a selection for the transfected Tf receptors, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 g/liter glucose; MDCK and HEp2 cells were grown in bicarbonate-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells to be labeled with DiI-LDL were transferred to a similar Ham's F-12 medium but with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum in place of fetal bovine serum to up-regulate the cells' LDL receptors (11.Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Cells for microscopy were plated 24 h before the experiments in 35-mm plastic tissue culture dishes with a 7-mm hole in the bottom covered by poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (12.Salzman N.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2097-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To create the C6-NBD-SM labeling solution, a mixture (2:3 mol/mol) of C6-NBD-SM and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (both stocks in ethanol) was dried down under argon and redissolved in ethanol (20 mm total lipid concentration). This ethanol solution was injected into medium 1 (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) while vortexing and dialyzed at 4 °C overnight against excess phosphate-buffered saline to remove ethanol present in the solution (initially <8%). It was then diluted in medium 1 (M1) to a final total lipid concentration of 50 μm to make the labeling solution. Cells were plated in 28-cm2 tissue culture dishes 24 h before the experiment. Kinetic measurements were made as described previously (7.Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with a few exceptions. In brief, cells were incubated in M1-glucose (medium 1 with 2 g/liter glucose) for 5 min and pulsed with C6-NBD-SM labeling solution for 2–10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then immediately washed with ice-cold M1-glucose and incubated with back-exchange medium (5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in M1-glucose) on ice for 1 h, during which six washes of ice cold back-exchange medium with 10-min intervals were applied. After the back-exchange process, cells were washed with 37 °C M1-glucose, and 6 ml of 37 °C chase medium (1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in M1-glucose) was added to the cell dish. This was defined as chase time 0. Cells were chased in the chase medium at 37 °C for up to 60 min. At each time point, 600 μl of chase medium was taken from the cell dish, and 600 μl of fresh prewarmed chase medium was added back to the dish. At the end of the 60-min chase, the remaining chase medium was removed, and cells were incubated in 2.5 mm EDTA on ice for 15 min. Cells were then harvested with a cell scraper to determine cell-associated fluorescence. Chase medium aliquots taken at each time point, and the remaining chase medium, EDTA wash, and harvested cells were all extracted with butanol. Fluorescence of butanol solutions was measured with a spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog 2, Spex Industries Inc., Edison, NJ). Excitation wavelength was 465 nm, and fluorescence was quantified by integrating peak area from 518 to 558 nm. Unlabeled chase medium was used for background correction. To obtain the kinetic curves in Figs. 2and 3, the following calculations were made: (a) total lipid = cell-associated fluorescence + fluorescence remaining in chase medium + fluorescence in chase aliquots; (b) fraction of total lipid in the chase medium at each time point (f) = (10 × (lipid in chase aliquot) + lipid removed in previous chase aliquots)/total lipid; (c) fraction of lipid that was cell-associated (l) = 1 − f.Figure 3Exit of C6-NBD-SM in other cell lines. Efflux of C6-NBD-SM was measured in HEp2 cells (A), nonpolarized MDCK cells (B), and CHO cells where clathrin-mediated endocytosis was blocked (C). Double and single exponential decay fits are plotted as solid anddotted lines, respectively. See the legend to Fig. 2 for experimental procedures. Kinetic parameters from Fig. 3 are listed in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The fraction of lipid that was cell-associated at each chase time point, l, was fit to a double exponential decay,l = a·e −bt +c·e −dt + e by SigmaPlot Scientific Graphing Software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). To test back-exchange efficiency, two methods were used. The overall strategy was to measure the amount of surface-bound fluorescence at the end of the back-exchange procedure, without interference from exocytosis. This was accomplished by either keeping cells on ice at all times, thereby preventing endocytosis and exocytosis, or fixing cells to prevent exocytosis. In the first assay for measuring back-exchange efficiency, cells were labeled on ice for 30 min to ensure incorporation of C6-NBD-SM into the plasma membrane and back-exchanged on ice for 1 h, saving all of the washes. Cells were then incubated in EDTA and harvested, as described above, to determine cell-associated fluorescence. To test whether labeling at 37 °C had any effect on the incorporation of C6-NBD-SM that could have altered the back-exchange efficiency, we pulsed the cells at 37 °C for 2 min, fixed them with 2% paraformaldehyde, and then applied the normal back-exchange procedure. At the end of this procedure, 37 °C chase medium was added to the fixed cells, and aliquots of chase medium were taken for the first 10 min afterwards. To measure the release rate of C6-NBD-SM by the chase medium, cells were labeled on ice for 30 min, washed with ice-cold M1-glucose, and incubated in chase medium at 37 °C. Aliquots of chase medium were taken at times from 10 s to 5 min. Fluorescence from these aliquots and cell-associated fluorescence were obtained to calculate fractions of C6-NBD-SM removed at different chase times. Cells were labeled with one of the FM dyes (FM 2–10 2 mm, FM 1–43 15 μm, FM 1–84 2 μm) for either 30 s or 15 min at 37 °C. These concentrations were chosen to give similar initial intensities. The cells were then washed with ice-cold M1-glucose, kept on ice for 15 min in M1-glucose, and rinsed repeatedly with ice-cold M1-glucose. Since uninternalized FM dye molecules readily dissociate from the plasma membrane, a back-exchange acceptor was not necessary for these dyes. The release rates of the FM dyes from the plasma membrane were determined to be on the order of a few seconds at 24 °C (13.Ryan T.A. Smith S.J. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5567-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and we verified that essentially all dye molecules were released from the membrane by our rinse procedure. The same washes were applied to all three FM dyes. Immediately prior to image acquisition, 37 °C M1-glucose was added to the cells. To see whether a temperature shift at the beginning of the efflux experiments had any effect on the rapid recycling process, we also performed measurements using FM 2–10 and FM 1–43 without the temperature change. Cells were labeled with either FM 2–10 or FM 1–43 for 30 s at 37 °C, rinsed several times with 37 °C M1-glucose, and taken to the microscope for efflux measurements. The cell dish was kept on a temperature-controlled microscope stage maintained at 33–34 °C throughout acquisition. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using a Leica DMIRB microscope (Leica Mikroscopie und Systeme GmbH, Germany) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Frame Transfer Pentamax camera with a 512 × 512 back-thinned EEV chip, model no. 512EFTB; Princeton Instruments) driven by Image-1/MetaMorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Images were acquired using × 25 oil immersion objective (0.75 NA) to include a large number of cells in one field and to acquire fluorescence from entire cell thickness. All FM dyes were imaged using a standard fluorescein filter set. The first image of each chase experiment was acquired within 40 s after warming up the cells. Unlabeled cells were used to examine autofluorescence. Under the acquisition conditions used in kinetic experiments, autofluorescence was negligible. Image background was corrected as follows. Two or three regions were selected from cell-free areas in a field, and an average intensity from those regions was taken as the background value for that field. This background value was then subtracted from every pixel in the field. An integrated fluorescence power reading of each image was recorded after background correction. Normalized fluorescence power was determined by dividing the power in each image by that of the first reading at the beginning of the chase. Cells grown in coverslip bottom dishes were incubated with M1-glucose at 37 °C before labeling. For double label experiments with DiI-LDL and FM dyes, LDL-receptor up-regulated cells were first pulsed with 6 μg/ml DiI-LDL for 4 min at 37 °C to label endosomes. For double label experiments with Cy5-Tf and FM dyes, cells were first pulsed with 20 μg/ml Cy5-Tf for 2 min at 37 °C. In both cases, cells were then washed and pulsed with one of the FM dyes for 30 s at 37 °C. To be consistent with kinetic experiments, cells were kept on ice for 15 min in M1-glucose while washes were applied. Confocal images were taken either immediately after warming the cells up to 37 °C for DiI-LDL labeled cells or after a 15-min chase at 37 °C for Cy5-Tf-labeled cells. Live cells were kept on a temperature-controlled microscope stage maintained at 33–34 °C throughout acquisition. Confocal microscopy was performed using an Axiovert 100M inverted microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser-scanning unit and a 63 × 1.4 NA plan Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Since FM dyes have broad emission spectra, filter sets were selected carefully to maximize true signal while minimizing crossover of signal from one channel to the other. Samples double-labeled with DiI-LDL and FM dyes were excited with a 25-milliwatt argon laser emitting at 488 nm for FM and a 1.0-milliwatt helium/neon laser emitting at 543 nm for DiI. A 585–615-nm band pass filter was used for collecting DiI emissions, and a 650-nm long pass filter was used for FM emissions. Samples double-labeled with Cy5-Tf and FM dyes were excited with the argon laser emitting at 488 nm for FM and a helium/neon laser emitting at 633 nm for Cy5. A 530–600-nm band pass filter was used for collecting FM emissions, and a 650-nm long pass filter was used for Cy5 emissions. The two channels were scanned alternately in a line-by-line fashion, having only one laser line and one detector channel on at each time. Fraction of cross-over was measured to be less than 10% using single-labeled samples of each probe. Images were corrected for background (as described above for FM dyes) and crossover (14.Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine was purchased as a chloroform solution. It was dried first under argon and then in vacuoovernight and dissolved in M1, forming multilamellar vesicles (final lipid concentration was 3.5 mm). This suspension was sonicated for 30 min to break up large multilamellar vesicles. The solution cleared after sonication by forming unilamellar vesicles. The method for measuring partition coefficients was adapted from Huang and Haugland (15.Huang Z.J. Haugland R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The solution containing unilamellar vesicles was diluted in M1 to make solutions containing different concentrations of liposomes. For each experiment, fluorescence resulting from titration of liposomes against a constant dye concentration was measured with a spectrofluorometer. Two concentrations of each dye were used for two parallel runs: FM 2–10 (0.2 mm, 0.15 mm), FM 1–43 (6 μm, 4 μm), and FM 1–84 (4 μm, 2 μm). The excitation wavelength for FM 2–10, FM 1–43, and FM 1–84 were 465, 468, and 468 nm, respectively, and the emission wavelengths were 608, 593, and 590 nm, respectively. Inner filter effect was corrected for the case of FM 2–10, where the correction was meaningful, using the equation,Fcorrected=Fmeasured·10Aex+Aem2Equation 1 where A ex and A emare absorption readings at excitation and emission wavelength, respectively (16.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 40Google Scholar). Equations used to obtain partition coefficients were described by Huang and Haugland (15.Huang Z.J. Haugland R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The partition coefficient of a membrane probe,K p, was defined as follows,Kp=(Pm/M)(Pf/W)Equation 2 where (P m/M) and(P f/W) refer to molar ratios of membrane-bound probe (P m) to membrane lipids (M) and of fluid phase probe (P f) to water (W), respectively. The experiments reported here required highly efficient removal of fluorescent lipids from the plasma membrane by back-exchange. To determine the back-exchange efficiency, two methods were employed. When cells were labeled and back-exchanged on ice, less than 2% of total fluorescence was found to be cell-associated at the end of the back-exchange. This was consistent with previous findings (7.Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17.Chen C.S. Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 37-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We also tested whether labeling at 37 °C had any effect that might give a different back-exchange efficiency. We fixed cells after incubation with C6-NBD-SM at 37 °C, back-exchanged on ice, and then monitored the release of C6-NBD-SM from cell surface into prewarmed chase medium. Since the fixed cells were incapable of undergoing exocytosis, what was released into the chase medium was presumably membrane-bound probes left at the end of the back-exchange procedure. Aliquots taken from the chase medium did not show fluorescence above background. These results indicated that the release of C6-NBD-SM measured in our kinetic studies after back-exchange was due to exit of recycled C6-NBD-SM from cells, rather than release of uninternalized probes from the cell surface. The validity of our C6-NBD-SM efflux measurements also depended on the release rate of C6-NBD-SM from the cell surface into the chase medium. Our control experiments showed that 50% of recycled C6-NBD-SM reaching the plasma membrane was removed by the chase medium within 40 s, and more than 90% was removed within 2 min. This desorption from the membrane is faster than the fastest recycling process we measure, but the exocytic rate constants measured with C6-NBD-SM may be slightly underestimated, since we ignored the rate of extraction from the plasma membrane. Because the release process was kinetically complex, we decided that it would only introduce more errors if we were to correct the rate of rapid recycling with a calculated release rate. The exit kinetics of C6-NBD-SM were determined from the amount of C6-NBD-SM recycled back to the plasma membrane and released into the chase medium. With a pulse time shorter than 10 min, there was very little hydrolysis of C6-NBD-SM to C6-NBD-Cer (7.Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), which could subsequently be transported to the cell surface via nonvesicular transport. Plots of fraction of cell-associated fluorescenceversus chase time are given in Fig. 2. The fraction of lipid that was cell-associated at each chase time point (open circles) was fit with a double exponential decayl = a·e −bt +c·e −dt + e. Theoretical fits were then plotted as solid lines in Fig. 2. If C6-NBD-SM efflux occurred by a single component, first-order kinetic process, a single exponential decay would be expected to fit the data points. However, this was not the case. To illustrate this point, a single exponential best fit was added to Fig.2 A. Represented by a dotted line, the single exponential decay could not account for the rapid decrease of fluorescence during the first 10 min of chase time. It could, however, provide a good fit for the slower process dominating the second half of the chase time. A double exponential decay, on the other hand, very well accounted for all of the data. A double exponential decay fit to data points obtained from 2-min pulse, 60-min chase experiments of C6-NBD-SM gave a rapid recycling component with a half-time of 1–2 min and a slow recycling component with a half-time of ∼12 min (Fig. 2 A, TableI). The rapid recycling component was found to account for 42% of the recycling population. As the length of pulse time increased to 5 and 10 min, the relative percentage of rapid recycling component decreased to 28 and 23%, respectively (Fig. 2,B and C; Table I). The best fit rate constant for each component, however, remained approximately constant regardless of the pulse length.Table ISummary of kinetic parameters of the recycling pathways in CHO cellsab(min−1)cd(min−1)eC6-NBD-SM (2-min pulse) in CHO cells0.42 ± 0.150.48 ± 0.08 (1.4)0.58 ± 0.150.057 ± 0.08 (12.1)0C6-NBD-SM (2-min pulse) in HEp2 cells0.33 ± 0.190.77 ± 0.09 (0.9)0.65 ± 0.180.088 ± 0.11 (7.8)0.02C6-NBD-SM (2-min pulse) in nonpolarized MDCK cells0.43 ± 0.160.49 ± 0.1 (1.4)0.52 ± 0.170.051 ± 0.1 (13.6)0.05C6-NBD-SM (2-min pulse) in CHO cellsaCHO cells in which clathrin-mediated endocytosis was blocked.0.52 ± 0.180.53 ± 0.12 (1.3)0.41 ± 0.20.034 ± 0.14 (20.3)0.07C6-NBD-SM (5-min pulse) in CHO cells0.28 ± 0.120.46 ± 0.07 (1.5)0.72 ± 0.120.058 ± 0.1 (11.9)0C6-NBD-SM (10-min pulse) in CHO cells0.23 ± 0.130.45 ± 0.1 (1.5)0.77 ± 0.130.058 ± 0.1 (11.9)0FM 2–10 (30-s pulse) in CHO cells0.39 ± 0.16bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.059 ± 0.09 (11.7)bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.61 ± 0.16bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.40 ± 0.14cCells did not go through a temperature shift.0.054 ± 0.07 (12.9)cCells did not go through a temperature shift.0.58 ± 0.18cCells did not go through a temperature shift.FM 1–43 (30-s pulse) in CHO cells0.46 ± 0.11bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.31 ± 0.08 (2.2)bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.29 ± 0.14bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.061 ± 0.05 (11.3)bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.25 ± 0.14bCells were chilled and rewarmed prior to efflux measurement.0.50 ± 0.13cCells did not go through a temperature shift.0.43 ± 0.11 (1.6)cCells did not go through a temperature shift.0.31 ± 0.15cCells did not go through a temperature shift.0.055 ± 0.07 (12.6)cCells did not go through a temperature shift.0.18 ± 0.12cCells did not go through a temperature shift.FM 1–84 (30-s pulse) in CHO cells0.49 ± 0.130.36 ± 0.06 (1.9)0.33 ± 0.120.069 ± 0.07 (10)0.18 ± 0.13Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting data points to a double exponential decay equation, l =a·e− bt +c·e− dt + e.

The latter includes enhanced membrane permeability, fall in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Gelsolin, an actin regulatory protein, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, but when cleaved by caspase-3, a fragment that is implicated as an effector of apoptosis is generated. The mechanism by which the full-length form of gelsolin inhibits apoptosis is unclear.

These effects were corroborated in vitro using recombinant gelsolin protein on isolated rat mitochondria stimulated with Ca2+, atractyloside, or Bax. This protective function of gelsolin, which was not due to simple Ca2+ sequestration, was inhibited by polyphosphoinositide binding.

An important role of mitochondria in apoptotic signaling is the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane compartment into the cytosol. Once released, cytochromec binds to APAF-1 in the presence of ATP or dATP and forms a complex that processes and activates pro-caspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates the executioner caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7 (13.Green D.R.

It inhibits the loss of Δψm and cytochromec release into the cytosol, resulting in the lack of activation of caspases. We also show that this effect is not due to Ca2+ sequestration and that binding to polyphosphoinositide can regulate this process.DISCUSSIONThe caspase proteolytic cascade is a central component of the cellular machinery of the apoptotic process (5.Wolf B.B.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that the lack of activation of caspases seen in gelsolin-transfected cells is due to the block of cytochromec release at the mitochondrial level. A similar mechanism of inhibition of apoptosis is seen with anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (13.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 399: 483-487Crossref Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 37.Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W.

Diverse apoptotic stimuli induce signaling pathways that converge at the mitochondria, which serve as sensors and amplifiers of the apoptotic process, and recent discoveries point out the importance of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex in this process (15.Petit P.X. Zamzami N. Vayssiere J.L. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. Castedo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 174: 185-188Google Scholar, 17.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y.

The opening of this megachannel has been linked to enhanced permeability and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In addition, a model proposed for the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, such as AIF or cytochromec, is based on the opening of the PT pore and its consequences (17.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 399: 483-487Crossref Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 18.Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Our data show that gelsolin blocks apoptosis induced by anti-Fas, staurosporine, thapsigargin, and protoporphyrin IX. All of these apoptosis inducers are known to utilize mitochondria in their apoptotic signaling. Protoporphyrin IX has been reported to induce mitochondrial changes directly by binding to the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, a putative component of the permeability transition megachannel, suggesting that the effect of gelsolin implies a mechanism of direct inhibition of the Δψm loss. Thapsigargin causes a rise in the intracellular calcium concentration through an initial depletion of calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum by its selective inhibitory effect on Ca2+-ATPase. In this situation, the calcium overload on mitochondria induces the opening of the PT pore. In addition, we showed that gelsolin blocks the effect of Ca2+overload, atractyloside, and Bax on isolated mitochondria. Atractyloside is a ligand for the adenine nucleotide translocator, another component of the PT pore complex that causes its opening. Bax also causes the opening of this megachannel, although an intrinsic channel activity or an independent mechanism has been proposed. Taken together, these findings indicate that gelsolin counteracts apoptotic signals that converge at the mitochondrial PT pore or at a mitochondrial step necessary for the release of cytochromec.The inhibition of apoptosis by gelsolin through its effects on mitochondria is possibly associated with cellular systems that necessarily depend on mitochondrial changes to initiate the apoptotic process. It has been demonstrated that apoptotic signals induced by Fas receptor stimulation can be transmitted through two pathways, depending on the cell type (44.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar). In type I cells, caspase-8 activated at the Fas receptor-FADD complex can activate downstream caspases independent of mitochondria, whereas in type II cells, caspases are only fully activated after cytochrome c release. So it is reasonable to speculate that gelsolin could inhibit only apoptosis of type II cells but not type I cells, similar to what occurs with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (44.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar).Gelsolin is an ubiquitously expressed, founding member of the actin-severing/capping family of proteins (21.Sun H.Q. Yamamoto M. Mejillano M. Yin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33179-33182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Although the full-length form of gelsolin inhibits apoptosis, gelsolin is also a substrate for caspase-3, which cleaves it between Asp352and Gly353 sequences, generating an N-terminal fragment that contributes to morphological changes associated with apoptosis (32.Kothakota S. Azuma T. Reinhard C. Klippel A. Tang J. Chu K. McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Koths K. Kwiatkowski D.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1997; 278: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). A similar scenario of opposite functions promoting life and death in the same protein has been demonstrated with the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which when cleaved by caspase-3 release a C-terminal product that lacks the BH4 homology domain and potently induces cell death (53.Grandgirard D. Studer E. Monney L. Belser T. Fellay I. Borner C. Michel M.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 54.Clem R.J. Cheng E.H. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K.

Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar).Physiologically, in resting cells, the cytosolic Ca+2concentration is maintained at about 100 nm, but after certain hormonal stimuli, it can rise to 500–1000 nm. However, besides the global increases in cytosolic Ca+2concentration, recent reports indicate that localized increases in Ca+2 concentration, for example, in microdomains between clusters of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum and the outer mitochondrial membrane, the local Ca+2 concentration can reach 10–20 μm (56.Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar,57.Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The opening of the PT pore is facilitated by Ca2+signals evoked by addition of large Ca2+ pulses or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ spikes (20.Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar,56.Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that localized increases in Ca2+ concentration in these mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum junctions can transmit pro-apoptotic signals, causing Δψm loss and cytochrome c release from mitochondria (56.Szalai G. Krishnamurthy R. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6349-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The doses we used for the isolated mitochondrial experiments mimic the conditions found at the cellular level for transmission of pro-apoptotic signals by Ca2+. Lowering of the concentration of Ca2+ around mitochondria could contribute to the block of Δψm loss and cytochromec release, but as demonstrated above, the Ca2+binding activity of gelsolin cannot explain these findings. This indicates a more specific action of gelsolin on mitochondria. Some Bcl-2 family members can interact with and regulate specific PT pore components; Bax has been shown to interact with adenine nucleotide translocator (18.Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G. Science. 1998; 281: 2027-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar) or voltage-dependent anion channel (17.Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 399: 483-487Crossref Scopus (1910) Google Scholar,34.Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1997; 399: 483-487Crossref Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Because the effect of gelsolin was dose-dependent and saturable, it is probable that gelsolin targets specifically an effector on mitochondria. Furthermore, the fraction of intracellular gelsolin that is associated with mitochondrial membranes can interact with and regulate voltage-dependent anion channel. 2H. Kusano, S. Shimizu, R. C. Koya, H. Fujita, S. Kamada, N. Kuzumaki, and Y. Tsujimoto, submitted for publication.It has been reported that gelsolin modulates ion channel functionin vivo (35.Furukawa K. Fu W. Li Y. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8178-8186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as demonstrated by its regulatory function on the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel and NMDA receptor-coupled activity (35.Furukawa K. Fu W. Li Y. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8178-8186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The findings presented here indicate that gelsolin also regulates the function of another channel, the mitochondrial PT pore, with important repercussions in the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death is a fundamental process of normal development and tissue homeostasis of multicellular organisms (1.Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C.

It is characterized by typical structural changes including cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and nuclear DNA fragmentation (3.Kerr J.F.R. J.

Deregulated apoptosis can lead to human diseases such as cancer and degenerative disorders (2.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6173) Google Scholar). There is much evidence suggesting that apoptotic signaling is processed by highly regulated and specific proteolysis via caspases (5.Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Caspases are an evolutionarily conserved family of aspartic acid-specific cysteine proteases (6.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem.

Cleavage of specific substrates has been proposed to activate death effector molecules or induce structural changes characteristic of apoptotic cells (8.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Long prodomain caspases containing sequence motifs that promote their interaction with activator molecules (caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10) function as apoptotic initiators, generally acting upstream of small prodomain executioner caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) (10.Cohen G.M.

Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that mitochondria play a prominent role in cell death as a central organelle involved in the signal transduction and amplification of the apoptotic response (13.Green D.R.

It is characterized by an increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability and loss of membrane potential that is regulated by the permeability transition (PT)1 pore complex, an elusive multiprotein channel composed of voltage-dependent anion channel, adenine nucleotide translocator, cyclophilin D, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, and probably others (13.Green D.R.

An important role of mitochondria in apoptotic signaling is the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane compartment into the cytosol. Once released, cytochromec binds to APAF-1 in the presence of ATP or dATP and forms a complex that processes and activates pro-caspase-9, which in turn cleaves and activates the executioner caspases, such as caspase-3 and -7 (13.Green D.R.

Green D.R. EMBO J. 1997; 17: 37-49Crossref Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Probably Δψm-dependent and -independent mechanisms exist, differing with specific apoptotic stimuli (19.Bossy-Wetzel E.

PT pores are controlled by pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which can bind to this channel and regulate the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (17.Shimizu S.

Antiphospholipid antibodies may also recognize epitopes occurring as a consequence of the formation of adducts between β2GPI and oxidized cardiolipin (32.Palinski W. Horkko S. Steinbrecher U.P.

Binding of β2GPI to these cells has been assumed to result from its interaction with membrane phospholipid. However, although β2GPI binds with high affinity to purified anionic phospholipids (34.Wurm H. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 35.Polz E. Kostner G.M.

In addition, human anti-β2GPI antibodies have not been convincingly shown to induce platelet activation (41.Galli M. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In the nonactivated state, several anticoagulant moieties that play a central role in the maintenance of blood fluidity are expressed on the endothelial cell (42.Rosenberg R.D.

Fukudome K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, a variety of stimuli may induce endothelial cell activation, a process in which numerous transcriptional and posttranscriptional events occur that lead to the expression of adhesion molecules and procoagulant activity on the endothelial surface (44.Esmon C.T.

That endothelial activation contributes to the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid antibody-associated thrombosis is suggested by the presence of increased levels of endothelial-derived proteins and microparticles in the plasma of patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (47.Combes V.

Furthermore, in contrast to platelets, anti-β2GPI antibodies have been convincingly shown to activate endothelial cells in a β2GPI-dependent manner (50.Del Papa N. Guidali L. Spatola L. Bonara P.

As an initial step in evaluating this hypothesis, we have characterized the binding of β2GPI to endothelial cells. β2GPI bound to endothelial cells through a high affinity interaction with annexin II, an endothelial cell receptor for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (52.Hajjar K.

Preliminary studies also suggest a potential role for annexin II in mediating anti-β2GPI antibody-mediated endothelial cell activation.DISCUSSIONThese studies demonstrate that annexin II mediates the binding of β2GPI to endothelial cells. This conclusion is supported by 1) the affinity purification of annexin II from endothelial cells using β2GPI-Affi-Gel, 2) the near-complete inhibition of β2GPI binding to endothelial cells by anti-annexin II antibodies, 3) enhanced binding of β2GPI to annexin II-transfected HEK 293 cells, and 4) the direct demonstration of high affinity binding of annexin II to β2GPI using surface plasmon resonance.Identification of annexin II (M r ∼ 36) as the primary β2GPI binding site on unactivated endothelial cells is consistent with the pattern of protein bands affinity-purified using β2GPI-Affi-Gel. Mass spectrometric sequencing of tryptic peptides from the ∼36- and ∼78-kDa bands isolated in both the small and large-scale affinity purification procedures confirmed that each of these contained annexin II. The ∼78-kDa band most likely represented an annexin II homodimer, because it migrated identically to a spontaneously forming homodimer present in preparations of recombinant annexin II. Mass spectrometric sequencing of tryptic peptides from the ∼60-kDa band also yielded sequences identical to those within annexin II, as well as heat shock protein 27 (M r ∼ 22.3) (71.Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Potter R. Stein G. Stein J. Weber L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4127-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and human DNA-binding protein A (M r ∼ 38.6) (72.Kudo S. Mattei M.G. Fukuda M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Hence, this band may represent a partially degraded annexin II homodimer or, more likely, a complex between annexin II and an additional, intracellular protein. Finally, the ∼98-kDa band observed only in the small scale affinity purification procedure may represent an annexin II heterotetramer (AIIt) containing 2 molecules of annexin II and 2 molecules of p11 (11 kDa) (70.Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.-S. Kang H.-M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Luoie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 73.Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), although the inability to detect this band in the large scale procedure precluded its definitive identification.An additional high molecular mass β2GPI-binding protein was observed only in extracts of cell surface biotinylated EAHY.926 cells and thus was most likely derived from A549 carcinoma cells (the non-HUVEC fusion partner used to create the EAHY.926 cell line). We speculate that this protein may be megalin, a low density lipoprotein receptor family member recently shown to bind β2GPI (74.Moestrup S.K. Schousboe I. Jacobsen C. Leheste J.R. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), or perhaps another low density lipoprotein receptor family member. Taken together with the endothelial cell studies, however, these results suggest that β2GPI may interact with unique cell surface proteins differentially expressed on specific cell types. However, we would emphasize that our studies do not exclude a biologically important interaction of β2GPI with cellular phospholipids under some circumstances (75.Rand J.H. Wu X.-X. Andree H.A.M.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).The annexins are a family of structurally related proteins, each of which consists of an N-terminal “tail” and C-terminal “core” domain (77.Rand J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The core domains of different annexins share 40–70% homology (78.Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and consist of a series of 70 amino acid endonexin repeats (78.Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). In contrast, the length and amino acid composition of the tail domains are highly variable among different family members (78.Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of a hydrophobic signal peptide, the presence of annexin II on cell surfaces is well established (78.Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), and approximately 4.3% of total endothelial annexin II is associated with the external plasma membrane (79.Hajjar K.A. Guevara C.A. Lev E. Dowling K. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21652-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Annexin II mediates the binding of t-PA to endothelial cells through interactions with an LCKLSL sequence in the tail domain (53.Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and is also an endothelial cell receptor for Glu and Lys-plasminogen (54.Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasminogen binding may result from exposure of a C-terminal lysine (Lys307) in the core domain following cleavage of the Lys307-Arg308 bond (52.Hajjar K. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.-M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S. Toba M. Shinomiya A. Waisman D.M. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 811: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although others have presented compelling evidence for an important role of the N-terminal lysine residues of the p11 polypeptides in mediating the binding of plasminogen to the annexin II heterotetramer (70.Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.-S. Kang H.-M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Luoie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Regardless, annexin II greatly enhances the catalytic efficiency of t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation on cell surfaces (54.Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56.Hajjar K.A. Menell J.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with even more potent enhancement mediated by the heterotetramer (55.Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.-M. Fitzpatrick S.L.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Given the abundance of β2GPI in plasma (plasma concentration, 2–4 μm) and the affinity with which it binds to annexin II, we would expect most endothelial cell surface annexin II molecules to be occupied by β2GPI under normal conditions. This hypothesis is supported by recent immunohistochemical studies demonstrating an association of β2GPI with endothelial cells in vivo (81.George J. Harats D. Gilburd B. Afek A. Levy Y. Schneiderman J. Barshack I. Kopolovik J. Shoenfeld Y. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2227-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that this interaction may be of particular importance in the presence of circulating anti-β2GPI antibodies. These antibodies, which are strongly associated with thrombosis, activate endothelial cellsin vitro only in the presence of β2GPI (50.Del Papa N. Guidali L. Spatola L. Bonara P. Borghi M.O.

Arthritis Rheum. 1995; 314: 25Google Scholar) and von Willebrand factor (49.Schinco P. Borchiellini A. Tamponi G. Montaruli B. Garis G. Bazzan M. Pannochia A. Modena V. Pileri A. Clin. Exp.

Med. 1985; 145: 1389-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies/anti-β2GPI antibodies suggest that these antibodies may also disrupt endothelial functionin vivo. We have observed that the same annexin II monoclonal antibodies that block β2GPI binding to endothelial cells directly induce endothelial cell activation, as measured by the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. 2R. Simanov and J.-C. Zhang, unpublished observations. These results suggest that annexin II cross-linking induces signaling responses in endothelial cells that lead to cellular activation and the development of a proadhesive and procoagulant phenotype. Because annexin II does not span the cell membrane, this interaction may require an “adaptor” protein, the identity of which is under investigation. However, we hypothesize that “indirect” cross-linking of cell surface annexin II through ligation of bound β2GPI by anti-β2GPI antibodies might induce a similar response, and hence our studies may provide an explanation for β2GPI-dependent endothelial cell activation by anti-β2GPI antibodies. Alternatively, it has been suggested that annexin II might be capable of initiating signaling responses by mediating calcium channel activity (80.Chung C.Y. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). If so, the binding of β2GPI and anti-β2GPI antibodies might induce a conformational change in annexin II that stimulates this effect. At present, however, this hypothesis remains speculative.Although the β2GPI binding site on annexin II has not yet been determined, the anti-annexin II mAb Z014, as well as previously described anti-annexin II polyclonal antibodies (52.Hajjar K. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21191-21197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), blocked binding of both t-PA and annexin II to endothelial cells. Although these studies suggested that the β2GPI binding site may reside within the LCKLSL t-PA binding sequence (amino acids 8–13) in the tail domain of annexin II (53.Hajjar K.A. Mauri L. Jacovina A.T. Zhong F. Mirza U.A. Padovan J.C. Chait B.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9987-9993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), β2GPI itself did not inhibit the binding of 125I-t-PA to endothelial cells (not shown). Hence, the t-PA and β2GPI binding sites within annexin II are likely to be distinct, although spatially near one another in the tertiary structure of the molecule.In summary, the demonstration that β2GPI binds with high affinity to endothelial cell annexin II suggests that the paradigm in which the interaction of β2GPI with endothelial cells is assumed to occur solely through binding to membrane phospholipid should be reconsidered. Further characterization of the β2GPI-annexin II binding interaction, as well as definition of the role of annexin II in endothelial cell activation, may provide additional insight into the physiologic and pathophysiologic roles of these abundant proteins. β2-Glycoprotein I (β2GPI)1 is an abundant plasma glycoprotein that consists of five homologous domains of approximately 60 amino acids each (1.Schlutze H.E. Heide H. Haput H. Naturwissenschaften. 1961; 48: 719-724Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 2.Polz E. Kostner G.M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The first four of these are classical short consensus repeat domains, with extensive homology to those found in the complement-type repeats of Factor H (3.Reid K.B.M. Day A.J. Immunol. Today. 1989; 10: 177-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Each of these contains four conserved cysteines with a characteristic C1–3, C2–4 disulfide bonding pattern, whereas domain 5 contains six cysteines, with C1–4, C2–5, and C3–6 disulfide linkages (4.Kato H.

Therefore, RyR-driven rises of [Ca2+]mappear to result from large and rapid increases of perimitochondrial [Ca2+]. The falling phase of [Ca2+]c spikes was followed by a rapid decay of [Ca2+]m. CGP37157 slowed down relaxation of [Ca2+]mspikes, whereas cyclosporin A had no effect, suggesting that activation of the mitochondrial Ca2+ exchangers accounts for rapid reversal of the [Ca2+]m response with little contribution from the permeability transition pore.

Furthermore, RyR-dependent increases of [Ca2+]m were relatively insensitive to buffering of [Ca2+]c by EGTA. Therefore, RyR-driven rises of [Ca2+]mappear to result from large and rapid increases of perimitochondrial [Ca2+]. The falling phase of [Ca2+]c spikes was followed by a rapid decay of [Ca2+]m. CGP37157 slowed down relaxation of [Ca2+]mspikes, whereas cyclosporin A had no effect, suggesting that activation of the mitochondrial Ca2+ exchangers accounts for rapid reversal of the [Ca2+]m response with little contribution from the permeability transition pore. Thus, rapid activation of Ca2+ uptake sites and Ca2+exchangers evoked by RyR-mediated local [Ca2+]c signals allow mitochondria to respond rapidly to single [Ca2+]c spikes in cardiac cells. dihydropyridine receptors ryanodine receptor mitochondrial matrix [Ca2+] cytosolic [Ca2+] inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate perimembrane [Ca2+] 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N 1,N 1-tetraacetic acid polymerase chain reaction vasopressin tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester Excitation-contraction coupling involves local interactions between dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR)1 located in the plasma membrane and ryanodine receptor Ca2+ release channels (RyR) located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. The mechanism for excitation-contraction coupling differs between skeletal and cardiac muscle. Conformational coupling between DHPR and RyR is utilized in skeletal muscle, whereas RyR respond to local [Ca2+] signals established by Ca2+ entering through DHPR in cardiac muscle. RyR-mediated [Ca2+] signals lead to activation of the contractile machinery (for review see Ref. 1.Bers D.M. Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Cardiac Contractile Force. Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht, Netherlands1991Google Scholar) and may also be utilized to activate mitochondrial energy metabolism to meet the ATP requirements of muscle contraction (2.Crompton M. Langer G.A. Calcium and the Heart. Raven, New York1990: 167-198Google Scholar, 3.McCormack J.G. Halestrap A.P. Denton R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 391-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 4.Hansford R.G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 823-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This regulatory pathway depends on propagation of [Ca2+]c signals to the mitochondria and, in turn, activation of the Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases. However, significant mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake does not occur until [Ca2+]c exceeds 1 μmin studies carried out with permeabilized cardiac myocytes (5.Fry C.H. Powell T. Twist V.W. Ward J.P. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1984; 223: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the threshold [Ca2+]c for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is 300–500 nm in intact myocytes (6.Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Moreover, the rate of activation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is slow at submicromolar [Ca2+] levels (7.Kröner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8.Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C755-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, RyR-mediated increases of global [Ca2+]c that peak in the submicromolar range are not expected to yield rapid rises of [Ca2+]m. Importantly, [Ca2+] peaks at substantially higher levels in the vicinity of activated RyR than the peak of the global [Ca2+]c rise (9.Rios E. Stern M.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 47-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10.Neher E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Therefore, if mitochondria are located in sufficient proximity to experience the local [Ca2+] gradients, propagation of RyR-mediated [Ca2+] signals to the mitochondria may result from local coupling between these sites. Recent data on the distance between mitochondria and adjacent Ca2+ release units in cardiac myocytes are in support of the idea that RyR and mitochondria are sufficiently close to each other to establish local [Ca2+] communication (11.Ramesh V. Sharma V.K. Sheu S-S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Significantly, local [Ca2+] signaling between IP3 receptor Ca2+ release channels and mitochondria has also been shown in many cell types (12.Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 13.Rizzuto R. Bastianutto C. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. J.

Most of the studies carried out in recent years to investigate propagation of RyR-mediated [Ca2+]c responses to the mitochondria used fluorescence measurements of [Ca2+]m in intact cardiac cells. Some reports showed that changes of [Ca2+]m appear in association with changes in the frequency of [Ca2+]c spiking (6.Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17.Bassani R.A. Bassani J.W. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 591-608Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 18.Griffiths E.J.

Physiol. 1991; 261: H1123-H1134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other studies showed beat-to-beat control of [Ca2+]m in myocytes (20.Sheu S-S. Jou M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21.Chacon E. Ohata H. Harper I.S. Trollinger D.R. Herman B. Lemasters J.J.

Biomembr. 1998; 30: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In smooth muscle cells, [Ca2+]m was also demonstrated to closely follow the kinetics of [Ca2+]c rise evoked by activation of RyR (24.Drummond R.M. Tuft R.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 139-147Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Though strategies have been developed for loading of the mitochondria with Ca2+-sensitive probes, it is difficult to eliminate the cytosolic tracer component in many cell types, particularly in cardiac myocytes. Thus, the concern was raised that the cytosolic contribution from Ca2+-sensitive dyes could contribute to the beat-to-beat fluctuations reported in [Ca2+]m (e.g. Ref. 6.Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Studies that evaluated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by investigating the effect of mitochondrial inhibitors on RyR-linked [Ca2+]c signals also provided conflicting data on the contribution of mitochondria to single [Ca2+]c transients (Refs. 6.Zhou Z. Matlib M.A. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 379-403Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17.Bassani R.A. Bassani J.W. Bers D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 453: 591-608Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar versus 25). Electron probe microanalysis studies carried out to determine the changes of total mitochondrial calcium showed the presence (26.Wendt-Gallitelli M.F. Isenberg G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1991; 435: 349-372Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as the absence of changes (27.Moravec C.S. Bond M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H989-H997PubMed Google Scholar) during the contractile cycle. Nevertheless, membrane potential (ΔΨm) and mitochondrial NAD(P)H responses, which depended on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, have been reported during RyR-mediated [Ca2+]c spikes (28.Brandes R. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29.Duchen M.R. Leyssens A. Crompton M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This suggests that propagation of [Ca2+]c increases to the mitochondria can regulate Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial functions. The present study was undertaken to determine whether a privileged Ca2+ transfer is involved in the Ca2+ coupling between RyR and mitochondria and to address how mitochondrial Ca2+ transport is controlled during RyR-mediated [Ca2+] transients. To avoid complexities resulting from heterogeneous compartmentalization of Ca2+-sensitive tracers and to have direct access to the cytosolic domain of intracellular [Ca2+] transport mechanisms, we established imaging measurements of [Ca2+]c, [Ca2+]m, NAD(P)H, and ΔΨm in permeabilized single H9c2 cells. In differentiated H9c2 cells, our experiments confirm expression of DHPR and RyR and demonstrate RyR-mediated [Ca2+]c oscillations. Using this model we show highly efficient propagation of RyR-mediated [Ca2+]c spikes to the mitochondria and provide evidence that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites are exposed to [Ca2+]c, which is much higher than the global [Ca2+]c. Furthermore, our data show rapid decay of [Ca2+]m spikes and suggest that activation of the mitochondrial Ca2+exchanger plays a major role in the decline of [Ca2+]m. Taken together, the data suggest that rapid activation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ efflux by local [Ca2+] spikes may allow generation of [Ca2+]mtransients in response to single [Ca2+]c spikes mediated by the RyR. H9c2 cells (obtained from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm pyruvate in humidified air (CO2 5%) at 37 °C. For imaging experiments cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and for PCR assays cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks. Cells were grown for 3–5 days for studies with myoblasts (subconfluent cultures), whereas cells were grown to reach confluency (1 week on average) and subsequently for an additional 3–7 days to allow differentiation for studies with myotubes. Cells plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were transfected with plasmid DNA (1 μg/ml of pCMV/myc/mito/GFP for 7 h, Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE (10 μg/ml) and OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies). Cells were observed 24 h after transfection. Prior to loading with fluorescent dyes, the cells were preincubated for 30 min in an extracellular medium (2% bovine serum albumin/ extracellular medium) consisting of 121 mm NaCl, 5 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. To measure [Ca2+]c in intact cells, cells were loaded with 5 μm fura2/AM for 20–30 min in the presence of 200 μm sulfinpyrazone and 0.003% (w/v) pluronic acid at room temperature. To detect [Ca2+]m and ΔΨm in permeabilized cells, intact cells were loaded with 2 μm rhod-2/AM for 50–70 min or with 100 nm TMRE, for 15 min, respectively at 37 °C. Intact cell experiments were carried out in 0.25% bovine serum albumin/ extracellular medium supplemented with 200 μmsulfinpyrazone to minimize dye loss at 35 °C. For permeabilized cell measurements the dye-loaded cells were washed three times with a Ca2+-free extracellular buffer, containing 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 0.2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, and then permeabilized with 20 μg/ml digitonin for 4 min in an intracellular medium composed of 120 mmKCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.2, supplemented with 2 mmMgATP, 20 μm EGTA/Tris, and 1 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin. The intracellular medium was passed through a Chelex column prior to the addition of protease inhibitors to reduce ambient Ca2+. To detect perimembrane [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]pm), cells were labeled with 0.5–4 μm fura-C18 during the permeabilization. After permeabilization the cells were washed with the same buffer without digitonin. Measurements were performed in intracellular medium that contained ∼300 nm [Ca2+] after the addition of 2 mm ATP, 2 mm succinate, and protease inhibitors. During measurements of ΔΨm, 20 nm TMRE was present in the buffer to maintain the fluorescence labeling achieved during the loading with TMRE. Images were acquired using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (40×, UApo340, NA 1.35 oil immersion objective) fitted with a cooled CCD camera (PXL, Photometrics) under computer control. The computer also controlled a scanning monochromator (DeltaRAM, PTI) to select the excitation wavelength. Excitation at 340 and 380 nm was used for fura2 and fura-C18, 380 nm was used for mitoGFP, 360 nm was used for NAD(P)H, and 545 nm was used for rhod2 and TMRE. Using multiwavelength beamsplitter/emission filter combinations (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) simultaneous detection of fura-C18 and rhod2 fluorescence or NADH and rhod2 fluorescence was achieved. Experiments were carried out with at least three different cell preparations, and 20–60 cells were monitored in each experiment. Traces represent single cell responses unless indicated otherwise. Total RNA was prepared from H9c2 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5–1 μg of RNA using MuLV reverse transcriptase (Perkin-Elmer). cDNAs were amplified using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). PCR reactions (100 μl) contained first strand cDNA template, 150 nm of each primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 2 mm MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer II, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. Reactions were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600 for 35 cycles, after an initial 105 s at 95 °C, melting for 15 s at 95 °C, and anneal-extending for 30 s at the appropriate temperature (50–60 °C). This was followed by a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. Primers to distinguish between rat cardiac and skeletal muscle α1subunits were selected by (GCG Prime program) and corresponded to a region in the fourth domain. The cardiac forward primer (3955–3973) was as follows: 5′-TCCTCATCCTGCTCAACAC-3′. The cardiac reverse primer (4403–4420) was as follows: 5′-AATACCTGCATCCCAATC-3′. The skeletal forward primer (1297–1314) was as follows: 5′-ATGAACCACATATCGGAC-3′. The skeletal reverse primer (1665–1682) was as follows: 5′-ATCAGCAAAGCCACATAC-3′. Degenerate primers were used to detect the three RyR isoforms and corresponded to a region in the membrane-spanning domains M3 and M4 (30.Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). RyR forward primer (RyR1, 14419–14441; RyR2, 14230–14252; RyR3, 14008–14030) was as follows: 5′-CA(C/T)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)(C/T)T(A/C/G/T)GA(C/T)AT(A/C/T)GCIATGGG-3′. RyR reverse primer (RyR1, 14929–14951; RyR2, 14740–14762; RyR3, 14518–14540) was as follows: 5′-A(A/G/T)(A/G)TA(A/G)TT(A/C/G/T)GCIA(A/G)(A/G)TT(A/G)TG(C/T)TC-3′. 100 μl of PCR product was fractionated on a 1–2% low melting temperature agarose gel (Life Technologies, Inc.), and individual bands were purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR product was sequenced by the Molecular Core Facility at UMDNJ. In subconfluent cultures, H9c2 myoblasts displayed a spindle or polygonal shape, and multinucleated myotubes were not present (Fig.1, upper row of images). Depolarization by high [K+] (60 mm KCl) or activation of RyR with caffeine did not elicit a [Ca2+]c signal, whereas an IP3-linked agonist, vasopressin (VP), induced large [Ca2+]c spikes in most of the cells (Fig. 1, i–v). Myoblast cultures grown to reach confluency and subsequently for an additional 3–7 days to allow differentiation contained a number of long, multinucleated myotubes (Fig. 1, lower row of images). Depolarization resulted in a rise in [Ca2+]c in all of the cells in these differentiated cultures (Fig. 1, vii). This [Ca2+]c rise was prevented by the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel inhibitor, nifedipine (10 μm, not shown). The addition of caffeine also caused a [Ca2+]c rise, which was particularly large in the multinucleated cells (Fig. 1,viii). The rise in [Ca2+]c evoked by VP added after caffeine was relatively small in differentiated cells (Fig. 1,iv–v versus ix–x). In these experiments, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores evoked by caffeine before the addition of VP might explain the decreased VP-dependent [Ca2+]cresponse in the differentiated cells. However, the relatively small effect of VP was also apparent when the hormone was added to naive cells (data not shown). To identify the Ca2+ channels that were involved in the depolarization- and caffeine-induced [Ca2+]c responses in myotubes, the expression of voltage-operated l-type Ca2+channels and RyR were examined by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Isotype-specific regions of the α1 subunit ofl-type Ca2+ channel mRNA were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Fig. 2 shows that differentiation of the myoblasts was associated with substantial increases in the mRNA encoding both cardiac and skeletal isoforms of the l-type channels. This is consistent with previous studies (31.Hescheler J. Meyer R. Plant S. Krautwurst D. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 32.Sipido K.R. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1487-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33.Mejia-Alvarez R. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 478: 315-329Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RyR mRNA was not detected in myoblasts but it appeared after differentiation (Fig. 2). The reverse transcriptase-PCR results suggest the presence of one isotype that shows 85, 76, and 80% sequence identity to human RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, respectively. Taken together, these data provide evidence for expression of the Ca2+ channels that are hallmarks of the myotube phenotype in differentiated H9c2 cells and also suggest that up-regulation of the expression of these Ca2+ channels occurring during differentiation accounts for the appearance of [Ca2+]c signals in response to depolarization and to RyR activators in differentiated cells. To study whether the Ca2+ signals mediated by the activation of RyR are relayed to the mitochondria, [Ca2+]m was studied in rhod2-loaded, permeabilized H9c2 cells. Compartmentalization of rhod2 in the mitochondria is facilitated by the net positive charge of the dye, and the cytosolic dye component is eliminated during cell permeabilization. In myoblasts, ryanodine or caffeine caused no rise in [Ca2+]rhod2, whereas the addition of IP3 yielded large responses in most of the cells (Fig.3 A, upper row). By contrast, myotubes displayed large increases of [Ca2+]rhod2 in response to ryanodine (Fig.3 A, v) or caffeine (viii). Images obtained at higher spatial resolution revealed a pattern of [Ca2+]rhod2 similar to the distribution of GFP targeted to the mitochondria (Fig. 3, B versus C). Moreover, the decrease of [Ca2+]rhod2 resulting from uncoupler-induced dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential was also associated with the structures that displayed the caffeine-induced [Ca2+]rhod2 rise (Fig. 3 B,iii versus iv). These data suggest that activation of RyR in the myotubes brings about increases of [Ca2+]m. Several intramitochondrial dehydrogenases are activated by elevated [Ca2+]m, and this activation can be monitored fluorometrically through changes in the pyridine nucleotide redox state. Caffeine-induced increases of [Ca2+]rhod2 were associated with an increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence, reflecting the activation of Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases (Fig.4 A). The increase in NAD(P)H fluorescence was transient, but the addition of Ca2+ to the permeabilized cells elicited a further rise of [Ca2+]rhod2 and a second transient in NAD(P)H. The fluorescence increase associated with maximal reduction of pyridine nucleotides was obtained by the addition of rotenone to block oxidation of NADH by the respiratory chain. These data provide evidence that the rise of [Ca2+]m coupled to activation of RyR exerts control over the Ca2+-sensitive steps of mitochondrial metabolism in permeabilized myotubes. To further investigate the signal transmission machinery between RyR and mitochondria, rhod2-loaded permeabilized cells were exposed to fura-C18, a dye that allows measurements of [Ca2+] immediately adjacent to cellular membranes (16.Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 34.Tanimura A. Turner R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The addition of a submaximal dose of caffeine caused spiking of [Ca2+]pm, and each spike of [Ca2+]pm was associated with a spike of [Ca2+]m (Fig.4 B). Relaxation of the [Ca2+]m spikes was slower than the fall of [Ca2+]pm, and in some cells an effectively sustained rise of [Ca2+]m was coupled to a baseline-spike pattern of the caffeine-induced [Ca2+]pm oscillations (Fig.4 D and presumably, C). Treatment with supramaximal caffeine caused spikes in [Ca2+]pm and [Ca2+]m displaying a prolonged decay phase (Fig. 4, B and D). The addition of mitochondrial uncoupler caused a small increase in [Ca2+]pm but induced a rapid decay of the caffeine-induced elevation of [Ca2+]m (Fig. 4 B). Rapid reversal of the caffeine-induced rise of [Ca2+]m was also evoked by Ru360, a drug reported to inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake without inhibition of RyR (36.Matlib M.A. Zhou Z. Knight S. Ahmed S. Choi K.M. Krause-Bauer J. Phillips R. Altschuld R. Katsube Y. Sperelakis N. Bers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10223-10231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, the Ru360-induced decay of [Ca2+]m was observed in the absence of inhibition of RyR-mediated [Ca2+]pm oscillations (Fig.4 D). Furthermore, Ru360 added before supramaximal caffeine did not affect the magnitude of the [Ca2+]pm increase but abolished the rise in [Ca2+]m (Fig. 4,E and F). Coupled oscillations of [Ca2+]pm and [Ca2+]m also occurred in permeabilized myotubes exposed to other activators of the RyR, such as Ca2+ and ryanodine (Fig. 5,A and B). Taken together, these data show that activation of RyR in permeabilized myotubes yields oscillatory Ca2+ release and reuptake that is associated with rapid activation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake to yield [Ca2+]m signals. Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum was expected to yield small elevations of [Ca2+] in the bulk cytosolic medium surrounding permeabilized adherent myotubes, because the volume of this is very large. At maximal cell density (using completely confluent cultures), global [Ca2+] was measured to rise to ∼500 nm after the addition of 20 mm caffeine (530 ± 25 nm, n = 18). 2P. Pacher and G. Hajnóczky, unpublished data. To reproduce the magnitude of caffeine-induced increases of [Ca2+]m by direct addition of Ca2+ to the medium, it was necessary to establish much larger [Ca2+] (see below). A mechanism to underlie the large effect of caffeine on [Ca2+]m could be that caffeine facilitates mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake independent of the Ca2+ release, but when sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores were discharged with thapsigargin pretreatment to prevent caffeine-induced Ca2+ release, caffeine failed to increase [Ca2+]m (not shown). A more likely explanation is that the RyR elicits [Ca2+]m elevations via generation of local [Ca2+]c transients in the vicinity of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites. To ensure that no global [Ca2+]c rise is associated with RyR-mediated Ca2+ release, bulk [Ca2+]c was clamped at the resting level ([Ca2+] ≈ 250 nm) by the addition of 200 μm EGTA and 140 μm CaCl2prior to the application of caffeine. Fig.6 shows that increases of [Ca2+]m were observed in the absence of any caffeine-induced [Ca2+]pm increase. After washout of the Ca2+ buffer, the caffeine-induced Ca2+release brought about a [Ca2+]pmrise and an augmented [Ca2+]mincrease (Fig. 6). In the presence of 200 μm EGTA and 140 μm CaCl2, only 21% of the cells displayed a [Ca2+]pm response (12 of 57 cells), whereas 67% showed a [Ca2+]m increase (57 of 85 cells). As measurements of global cytosolic [Ca2+] with fura2-free acid showed complete inhibition of the caffeine-induced [Ca2+] rise by the EGTA/Ca2+ buffer (not shown), the small and rapidly decaying [Ca2+]pm response observed in 21% of the cells was presumably because of the detection of the local [Ca2+] rise in the close vicinity of activated RyR by the perimembrane probe. Similar to the EGTA/Ca2+ buffer, BAPTA (≈400 μm free), which is a faster [Ca2+] buffer than EGTA, also failed to prevent the caffeine-induced [Ca2+]m increase (data not shown). Because elimination of the global cytosolic and perimembrane [Ca2+] signals did not prevent mitochondria from sensing the Ca2+ release, we concluded that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is driven by local [Ca2+] transients generated by the activated RyR. Importantly, complete inhibition of the [Ca2+]m signals was achieved in the presence of 1–10 mm EGTA (not shown). Prevention of the [Ca2+]m response by a slow Ca2+ buffer like EGTA suggests that the spatial separation between RyR and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites is probably in the range of 100 nm rather than <20 nm (10.Neher E.

This conclusion is in agreement with recent measurements of the distances between Ca2+ release units and mitochondria in ventricular myocardium (11.Ramesh V. Sharma V.K. Sheu S-S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In an effort to assess the magnitude of the local [Ca2+] increases to which the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites are exposed during RyR-mediated Ca2+ release, rates of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake were measured with varying concentrations of added medium Ca2+ and compared with the rate of Ca2+ uptake obtained during caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. Fig. 7 shows that the addition of Ca2+ led to dose-dependent increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake rates. Half-maximal stimulation was attained at ≈20 μm[Ca2+]c, and maximal activation appeared to require at least 50 μm[Ca2+]c. Importantly, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was not limited by the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) under the substrate conditions used in these experiments (2 mmsuccinate, 2 mm MgATP), because only very small depolarizations were evoked by the addition of large pulses of Ca2+ (Fig. 7, left panel). When caffeine-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was studied under the same conditions in permeabilized myotubes, the Ca2+ uptake rate was similar to that achieved with 30 μm added free [Ca2+] in the bulk medium (Fig. 7). Thus, the local [Ca2+]c rise sensed by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites appears to be in the range of 30 μm. Although the demonstration of efficient Ca2+ transfer from RyR to the mitochondrial matrix in H9c2 myotubes does not prove that the same functional organization occurs in myocytes of the beating heart, there are a number of observations that suggest that mitochondria are exposed to local [Ca2+] gradients generated by RyR in cardiac myocytes. The distance between mitochondria and RyR estimated from our [Ca2+] flux studies in the presence of EGTA/Ca2+ buffer as well as the large magnitude of perimitochondrial [Ca2+] rises are consistent with the data from morphological measurements in cardiac myocytes showing proximity of mitochondria and calcium release units (11.Ramesh V. Sharma V.K. Sheu S-S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 853: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study demonstrated large [Ca2+]m elevations in association with caffeine-induced [Ca2+]cspikes in skinned myocytes. 3S.-S. Sheu, personal communication.Therefore, it is likely that a privileged pathway of calcium signaling also exists between RyR and mitochondria in cardiac myocytes. Calcium signals evoked by activators of RyR frequently appeared as [Ca2+] oscillations (caffeine, Fig. 4; [Ca2+] and ryanodine, Fig. 5). We compared the pattern of [Ca2+]c and [Ca2+]m signals in relation to changes of RyR activity induced by different doses of caffeine. At low concentrations of caffeine (0.5–3.5 mm), the permeabilized cells displayed brief, uniform, and often repetitive [Ca2+]pm spikes (Fig.8 A). At higher caffeine concentrations, the interspike period decreased (Fig. 8, Band F), and the fraction of cells showing more prolonged [Ca2+]pm transients increased (Fig. 8, C and E). The prolonged responses at high levels of caffeine presumably reflect sustained activation of RyR, and the decay phase was because of depletion of the caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ store. The gradual decrease in the amplitude of spikes during [Ca2+]pm oscillations observed in a few cells (e.g. Figs. 8 B and9 A) may also reflect depletion of the Ca2+store. Moreover, bleaching of the fluorescent probe or dissociation from the membranes that occurred during the measurements may also contribute to the decrease in spike amplitudes during [Ca2+]pm oscillations. In most cells, spikes of [Ca2+]pm were associated with transients of [Ca2+]m that displayed a cell-specific pattern of the decay phase. Increases in the oscillation frequency established by successive caffeine additions did not affect the amplitude and upstroke kinetics of the individual spikes (Fig.8 D). Thus, the [Ca2+]pmand [Ca2+]m spiking triggered by activators of the RyR display the fundamental features of the frequency modulation. Interestingly, in a few cells the [Ca2+]m oscillations associated with uniform [Ca2+]pm oscillations were found to begin with a relatively small initial [Ca2+]m spike (e.g.Fig. 9 B; spike at 200 sversus spikes at 250 and 300 s). This result suggests that the Ca2+ coupling between RyR and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites was optimized during the first spikes, and this process may include a decrease in the distance between RyR and mitochondria or sensitization of the mitochondrial Ca2+uptake sites.Figure 9Decay of RyR-mediated [Ca2+]m signals.

In particular, the decay phase of the [Ca2+]m spikes showed cell-to-cell variability. To identify the mechanisms that are responsible for the decay phase, the effect of inhibitors of the two main mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux pathways (Ca2+ exchanger, permeability transition pore) (37.Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on [Ca2+]m oscillations was studied (Fig. 9). Both pathways have been suggested to play a role in physiological Ca2+ regulation in cardiac myocytes (38.Altschuld R.A. Hohl C.M. Castillo L.C. Garleb A.A. Starling R.C. Brierley G.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1699-H1704PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Griffiths E.J. Wei S.K. Haigney M.C. Ocampo C.J. Stern M.D. Silverman H.S. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). An inhibitor of the Ca2+ exchanger, CGP37157, did not affect the shape of the [Ca2+]pmspikes or the frequency of [Ca2+]pm and [Ca2+]m spikes but slowed the decay phase of [Ca2+]m spikes (Fig. 9, A and C). In contrast, an inhibitor of the permeability pore, cyclosporin-A, failed to affect the decay phase of the [Ca2+]m spikes (Fig. 9,B and C). Thus, the Ca2+ exchanger appears to be important in relaxation of the RyR-mediated [Ca2+]m spikes, whereas activation of the permeability transition pore does not contribute to mitochondrial Ca2+ egress. Importantly, the decay of [Ca2+]m spikes recorded in permeabilized cardiac cells is considerably faster than the relaxation of the [Ca2+]m spikes measured in permeabilized hepatocytes and mast cells under similar conditions (16.Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar,35.Hajnóczky G. Hager R. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14157-14162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Because mitochondria are exposed to high frequency [Ca2+]c spiking in cardiac cells, rapid re-establishment of the prestimulation [Ca2+]m may be particularly important to avoid overloading the mitochondria with Ca2+. Nevertheless, if each heartbeat is associated with a [Ca2+]m rise, complete reversal between consecutive [Ca2+]c spikes would require that the relaxation of [Ca2+]m be at least an order of magnitude faster than that which occurs in caffeine-stimulated permeabilized H9c2 myotubes. Interestingly, the relaxation phases shown in our study display cell-specific differences and increases in the oscillation frequency are not associated with major changes in the relaxation rate of [Ca2+]m spikes. Although inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux did not result in any major changes in the pattern of RyR-driven [Ca2+]c spiking, a plethora of data suggests that mitochondrial uptake and release of Ca2+is important in IP3-linked cytosolic Ca2+signaling (35.Hajnóczky G.

As such, rapid extrusion of Ca2+from mitochondria may contribute to the control of cytosolic effector systems and may also contribute to the refilling of the RyR-sensitive Ca2+ store. Thus, translation of RyR-driven [Ca2+]c signals into brief [Ca2+]m transients may have multiple roles in mitochondrial and cytosolic [Ca2+] regulation. This study provides direct evidence that calcium signal propagation from RyR to the mitochondria may occur without significant changes in global [Ca2+]c. Thus, it appears that this signaling pathway, which is sufficient to yield an essentially maximal activation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, is established by local communication between the RyR and mitochondrial uptake sites. Remarkably, the physiological regulatory cascade initiated by plasma membrane depolarization in the heart includes privileged communication between DHPR and RyR as well as between RyR and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites, albeit with lesser proximity in the latter case. One function of this pathway is to enhance mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to increase ATP formation, as demonstrated by our finding that the RyR-mediated [Ca2+]m signal yields activation of Ca2+-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases. It appears to be characteristic to the mitochondrial calcium signaling displayed by heart cells that the RyR-driven large spikes of [Ca2+]m can be reversed very rapidly owing to activation of the mitochondrial Ca2+exchanger. The rapid mitochondrial turnover of Ca2+ may protect against sequestration of large amounts of Ca2+ in the mitochondria under physiological conditions and may also contribute to cytosolic calcium signaling on a beat-to-beat basis. All these properties of the signal detection and processing by the mitochondria suggest that the mitochondrial calcium signaling pathway may have an important role in adjusting the activity of energy metabolism to the needs of the contractile machinery."

Understanding the mechanisms underlying islet growth and differentiation is essential not only from a physiologic and developmental standpoint, but is also likely to be important for the development of new treatment approaches to diabetes.A number of factors have been implicated in the regulation of islet mass. These include glucose itself, gastrin, transforming growth factor-α, insulin-like growth factor-1, pancreatic stone peptide and the reg family of gene products, glucagon-like peptide, islet neogenesis-associated protein, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP),1 hepatocyte growth factor, growth hormone, prolactin, and the placental lactogens (PL) (1.Finegood D.T.

PL-I is normally made in the trophoblast giant cells of the placenta, with circulating PL-I reaching peak levels during mid-gestation (14.Brelje T.C. Scharp D.W. Lacy P.E. Ogren L. Talamantes F.

Instead, in rodents, PL interacts on islet cells with the prolactin receptor, a member of the cytokine family of receptors, which signals through the Janus kinase pathway (14.Brelje T.C. Scharp D.W.

To directly examine the role of PL-I on islets in vivo, a transgenic mouse model was created in which the murine placental lactogen-I (mPL-I) cDNA was targeted to and expressed in beta cells under the control of the rat insulin-II promoter (RIP). These RIP-mPL-I transgenic mice were characterized for the expression of the transgene, and the long term effect of mPL-I on islet cell physiology, beta cell proliferation, and islet mass in vivo. RIP-mPL-I mice display a marked increase in islet mass, which results from both islet hyperplasia as well as hypertrophy. These changes are associated with hypoglycemia. These findings may have relevance to strategies aimed at enhancing islet mass and function in diabetes.DISCUSSIONThese studies demonstrate that the long term in vivoexpression of mPL-I in the islets of RIP-mPL-I transgenic mice directly results in accelerated beta cell proliferation, islet hyperplasia and hypertrophy, an increase in islet mass, inappropriate hyperinsulinemia with resultant hypoglycemia, and resistance to the diabetogenic effects of streptozotocin. These in vivoresults support the findings of previous in vitro studies in which mPL-I was found to increase beta cell proliferation, insulin content, and insulin secretion (14.Brelje T.C. Scharp D.W.

Finally, these studies corroborate reports demonstrating that the mid-gestational rise in islet proliferation correlates temporally with the transient mid-gestational appearance of mPL-I (15.Brelje T.C.

Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that PL is responsible for the second trimester increase in beta cell mass and function that occurs in pregnancy (15.Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 17.Parsons J.A. Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).The phenotype of the RIP-mPL-I mouse appears to be a direct consequence of mPL-I expression in the pancreatic islet, rather than an effect of a random integration event of the transgene, since three independent transgenic lines exhibited the same phenotype. That all three lines of transgenic mice expressed the transgene in their islets was documented using pancreatic mRNA analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunoassay of extracts of isolated islets. One of the three lines, line 60, expressed the transgene at approximately 10-fold higher levels than the other two transgenic lines, but it is important that all three lines were demonstrated to express both the protein and the mRNA, and that the phenotype, including relative hypoglycemia, an increase in islet mass, and accelerated beta cell proliferation, was observed in each of the three lines.A tissue survey demonstrated that the RIP-II promoter used herein led to low but detectable expression of the transgene in sites other than the pancreatic beta cell. These included the liver, kidney, heart, and intestine in line 60, the brain in line 64, and no other site in line 48. These findings are typical of findings reported by others (29.Lo D. Burkly L.C. Widera G. Cowing C. Flavell R.A. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1988; 53: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 30.Picarella D.E. Kratz A. Li C.-B. Ruddle N.H. Flavell R.A. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10036-10040Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), using less sensitive techniques such as Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry, as well as RNase protection analysis as used herein. From a pathophysiologic standpoint, four important points should be made here. First, line 48 expressed the transgene only in the beta cell and yet displayed the full spectrum of the phenotype, so it is reasonable to conclude that the phenotype is a direct result of mPL-1 expression in the islet, and not of “leaky” expression in other organs. Second, in line 64, leaky expression was observed only in the brain, supporting the conclusions described in the preceding sentence. Third, it is difficult to construct a pathophysiologic scenario for line 60 in which expression of the transgene, not in the islet but in the liver, kidney, intestine, and heart could produce hypoglycemia, an increase in islet mass and proliferation, and in pancreatic insulin content. Fourth, it is important to note that in the organs and transgenic lines in which leaky expression was observed, the levels of expression in sites outside the pancreas were dramatically lower than in the pancreas. As islets comprise only 2–3% of pancreatic mass, the level of expression of mPL-1 mRNA in the pancreatic islet of lines 60 and 64 is likely to be some 50–100 times higher than in the other tissues. These findings collectively make the critical point that mPL-1 expression in the islet, and not in other tissues, is responsible for the phenotype.Systemic mPL-I was not detected in the circulation of the RIP-mPL-I mice. This suggests that the islet phenotype was the result of local mPL-I actions within the islet. Moreover, it suggests that systemic consequences of mPL-1, such as insulin resistance, should not occur in the RIP-mPL-I mouse. The reason for the lack of measurable systemic mPL-I is not clear, but most likely reflects secretion at low levels, and/or effective clearance from the portal circulation by the liver.Histomorphometric analysis of islet mass and number in the RIP-mPL-I mouse lines demonstrated a 2-fold increase in total islet mass, with a lesser (1.45-fold) but significant increase in islet number. Importantly, the increase in islet mass and number was observed in each of the three transgenic lines. Whether the increase in islet number is real or is a histomorphometric reflection of an increase in islet size remains to be determined. The increase in islet mass was anticipated from the experience with mPL-1 in vitro and from events occurring in pregnancy as discussed above, as well as from the increased beta cell proliferation and islet cell hypertrophy observed in the RIP-mPL-I mouse.Less clear is the mechanism responsible for the inappropriate hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia in the RIP-mPL-I mouse. The inappropriate hyperinsulinemia in the RIP-mPL-I mouse is presumably in part a result of the islet hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and overall increase in islet mass observed. Whether a 2-fold increase in islet mass should lead on its own to increased insulin secretion and hypoglycemia is unsettled. The closest examples of this phenotype of which we are aware are the RIP-PTHrP and RIP-HGF transgenic mouse models (11.Vasavada R. Cavaliere C. D'Ercole A.J. Dann P. Burtis W.J. Madlener A.L.

Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), where a similar increase in islet mass was also accompanied by inappropriately normal insulin concentrations in plasma. Thus, it may be possible that a minor increase in islet mass could, independent of individual beta cell function, lead to hyperinsulinemia. Alternatively, or in addition, hyperinsulinemia could reflect the abnormal functioning of individual islet cells, resulting in increased insulin synthesis, and/or a lowered glucose-stimulated insulin secretion threshold with resultant increases in insulin secretion. Placental lactogen has been shown to have all of the above effects on islets or on the isolated perfused pancreas in vitro (14.Brelje T.C. Scharp D.W. Lacy P.E. Ogren L. Talamantes F. Robertson M. Friesen H.G. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar,15.Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Horm. Metab.

We presume that the inappropriate hyperinsulinemia in the RIP-mPL-I mouse is attributable to a combination of the above factors. Finally, it is formally possible that placental lactogen secreted into the portal circulation may contribute to the hypoglycemia observed, perhaps by altering hepatic glucose uptake or glucose production. This cannot be the primary pathophysiologic feature of the phenotype, as it would not explain the increase in insulin production and the increase in islet mass and proliferation. These considerations support the concept that the primary action of placental lactogen is a direct effect on the beta cell to increase its mass and function.One might postulate that the hypoglycemia in the RIP-mPL-1 mouse could be due to increased periperal insulin sensitivity, since hypoglycemia is present in the presence of normal insulin concentrations. At least two considerations make this hypothesis unlikely. First, there is no plausible reason for there to be increased insulin sensitivity. If anything, placental lactogen is believed to be associated with peripheral insulin resistance. Second, if this mechanism were operative, one would still expect a reduction in circulating insulin concentrations and in islet mass and pancreatic insulin content, as occurs, for example in the non-involved islets in patients and rats with insulinomas, or as occurs during prolonged fasting. These are not a feature of the RIP-mPL-1 mouse.Previous reports describe a leftward shift in the insulin secretory response curve in the pregnant pancreas (14.Brelje T.C. Scharp D.W. Lacy P.E. Ogren L. Talamantes F. Robertson M. Friesen H.G. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15.Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 17.Parsons J.A. Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). One might therefore have predicted that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion might be enhanced in isolated perfused RIP-mPL-I islets. On the other hand, one might have imagined that proliferation induced by mPL-I would be accompanied by de-differentiation of beta cells and an associated decline in insulin secretory responses to glucose. In fact, when the insulin secretory response of isolated RIP-mPL-I islets was examinedin vitro, there was no obvious difference between the insulin secretion profile of islets from transgenic mice compared with their normal littermates at the three glucose concentrations tested. Whether glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitroreflects the functioning of mPL-I islets in vivo is uncertain. Most previous studies examining the influence of PL or PRL on insulin secretion in vitro have employed the perfused rat pancreas (15.Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The few studies performed on isolated islets indicate that a minimum concentration of mPL-I of 50–60 ng/ml is required, over a period of 4 days, to observe any effects of mPL-I on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro (14.Brelje T.C. Scharp D.W. Lacy P.E. Ogren L. Talamantes F. Robertson M. Friesen H.G. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 15.Brelje T.C. Sorenson R.L. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It seems possible, therefore, that the mPL-I concentration in the RIP-mPL-I islets is too low to cause a change in their insulin secretion profile in vitro. It is also possible that the lack of change in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion reflects a balance of two opposing effects: de-differentiation induced by mPL-I on the one hand, neutralized or balanced by a leftward shift in the insulin response to glucose on the other hand. Additionally, it is possible that the islet isolation process injures or alters the insulin secretory response to glucose. Based on what is known to occur in pregnancy and in vitro with mPL-1, we would anticipate that more extensive studies using larger numbers of islets, a broader range of glucose concentrations, a different array of insulin secretagogues, and/or in vivo studies with the perfused mouse pancreas orin vivo glucose clamp studies in the RIP-mPL-I mouse may very well demonstrate differences in the dynamics of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by RIP-mPL-I mouse islets as compared with normal islets.The primary rationale for preparing the RIP-mPL-I mouse was to explore the potential therapeutic role for PL in enhancing islet mass and/or function in diabetes. With this idea in mind, streptozotocin was employed to induce diabetes. The RIP-mPL-I mouse was found to be streptozotocin-resistant, whereas their normal littermates exposed to the same dose of streptozotocin developed frank diabetes. The underlying physiology resulting in the maintenance of euglycemia remains to be defined. It may simply reflect the increase in islet mass in the RIP-mPL-I mouse, or may reflect proliferative or other functional changes in the RIP-mPL-I islets. Further studies will be required to define the physiology underlying this phenomenon.The RIP-mPL-I mouse, the RIP-HGF mouse, and the RIP-PTHrP mouse represent three in vivo transgenic mouse models of increased islet mass leading to inappropriate hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. The three islet-targeted proteins, mPL-I, HGF, and PTHrP, act via different receptors coupled to different intracellular signaling pathways (protein kinases A and C in the case of PTHrP (32.Vasavada R.C. Garcia-Ocaña A. Massfelder T. Dann P. Stewart A.F. Rec. Prog. Hormone Res. 1998; 53: 305-340PubMed Google Scholar), MAP kinase in the case of HGF (31.Garcia-Ocaña A. Takane K. Syed M.A. Philbrick W.M. Vasavada R.C. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and Janus kinase in the case of mPL-I (18.Bole-Feysot C. Goffin V. Edery M. Binart N. Kelley P.A. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 225-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar,19.Stout L.E. Svensson A.M. Sorenson R.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1592-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar)). Whereas they result in what appear to be superficially similar phenotypes, the mechanisms by which PTHrP, HGF and mPL-I increase islet mass in their respective transgenic mouse models are quite different; mPL-I and HGF cause accelerated beta cell proliferation (with a component of islet cell hypertrophy as well in the case of mPL-I), whereas PTHrP seems to affect neither, and instead likely acts by slowing the normal rate of beta cell turnover (11.Vasavada R. Cavaliere C. D'Ercole A.J. Dann P. Burtis W.J. Madlener A.L. Zawalich K. Zawalich W. Philbrick W.M. Stewart A.F. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3743-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These differences in signaling pathways and phenotypes may suggest that delivery of two or more of these proteins simultaneously to the beta cell might have synergistic effects. Such studies are under way.Finally, at one level, the targeted delivery of mPL-I to the beta cell may seem pedestrian in the sense that the phenotype was largely predictable from prior in vitro studies. On the other hand, the finding that tissue-specific delivery to the beta cell of factors such as PTHrP, HGF, and mPL-I, which enhance islet mass and function, has clear implications for strategies aimed at enhancing islet mass and function in patients with diabetes. It is well documented that pancreatic islet mass does not remain constant during life, but adapts to changing physiologic conditions. For example, there is a marked increase in islet proliferation during pregnancy, glucose infusion, or recovery from pancreatic resection (1.Finegood D.T. Scaglia L. Bonner-Weir S.

Today. 1999; 20: 278-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).We have recently shown that a soluble form of the L1 cell adhesion molecule can be released from mouse and human tumor cells by membrane proximal cleavage (29.Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L1 is a 200–220-kDa type I membrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily expressed in neural, hematopoietic and certain epithelial cells (30.Kadmon G. Altevogt P. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31.Hortsch M.

L1 supports homophilic and integrin-mediated cell binding and can interact with high affinity with neurocan, a proteoglycan that occurs in the brain and activated T lymphocytes (34.Friedlander D.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). L1 shed from B16F10 melanoma cells remained intact and could serve as substrate for integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration (29.Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the cell surface localization, L1 occurs in the extracellular matrix of brain and tumor cells (37.Montgomery A.M. Becker J.C. Siu C.H. Lemmon V.P. Cheresh D.A. Pancook J.D. Zhao X. Reisfeld R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 38.Martini R. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2439-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A recent study has shown that L1 offered in solution or as substrate can deliver survival signals to growing neurons (39.Chen S. Mantei N. Dong L. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 38: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, the release of L1 from the cell surface could play an important biological role and could be a prerequisite for matrix integration. However, the enzyme(s) involved in the release process and the regulation are still unknown.We showed before that L1 release was inhibited by the hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI (Immunex compound 3) (29.Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This compound cannot distinguish between conventional matrix metalloproteinases and ADAMs. Moreover, a common feature of ectodomain shedding by ADAMs is the strong up-regulation by substances such as PMA or pervanadate. In contrast, L1 shedding was only poorly up-regulated by PMA when cells were in suspension (29.Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In search of the enzymatic activity, we have now analyzed the regulation of L1 release and investigated a possible role of cell attachment in PMA and pervanadate up-regulation. We find that up-regulation of L1 shedding is observed in attached cells but not when in suspension. Detachment by EDTA and the rounding up of cells induced by pervanadate strongly enhances L1 release and were accompanied by Fyn activation. The pervanadate-induced effects on cell morphology and L1 release were blocked by the Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Additionally, our data provide evidence that L1 cleavage is mediated by an ADAM and that released L1 can be immobilized by binding to neurocan and becomes an integrin substrate. These findings establish a mechanism by which L1 can be converted from a membrane bound into a matrix-associated form.DISCUSSIONThe present paper sheds new light on the membrane proximal cleavage of L1 adhesion molecule by showing that (i) L1 release is mediated by a member of the ADAM metalloproteinase family; (ii) it is up-regulated by PMA, pervanadate, and EDTA/PBS-mediated detachment of cells; (iii) in AR cells activation of Fyn together with the induction of morphological changes are common features of pervanadate and EDTA/PBS-induced L1 shedding; and (iv) that released L1 can interact with neurocan and serve as substrate for integrin-mediated adhesion and migration.ADAMs appear to play a prominent role in the membrane proximal release of many shed molecules; however, it is difficult to discriminate between conventional matrix metalloproteinases and ADAMs. Inhibition analysis with recombinant TACE/ADAM17 have revealed that a variety of hydroxamate-based compounds as well as TIMP-3 but not TIMP-1, -2, or -4 could block cleavage of a TNF-α peptide bearing the TACE cleavage site (49.Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). TIMP-3 was also able to block the PMA-induced release ofl-selectin from human leukocytes (50.Borland G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2810-2815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have shown before that L1 release appeared to be independent of TACE as it was not impaired in TACE-deficient CHO cells (29.Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in fibroblasts from TACE −/− mice. 2S. Mechtersheimer and S. Beer, unpublished results. We present now suggestive evidence that L1 release is mediated by another member of the ADAM family. The failure of TIMP-1 and -2 to affect release and the strong blocking observed with hydroxamate inhibitors like Ro 31–9790 or BB-3103 are in support of this notion. Unfortunately, TIMP-3 was not available for our analysis. We also demonstrate that shedding can be activated by PMA in AR cells or L1-CHO transfectants but only when attached to their matrix. Interestingly, a recent study on PMA-induced shedding of membrane-anchored HB-EGF has also shown that shedding occurred only when cells were attached (22.Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to our findings, no shedding was seen when cells were in suspension, but the PMA inducible release was restored when cells had attached again (22.Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The reasons for these disparate findings are not known. As in many other systems, the release of L1 was also up-regulated in cells treated with pervanadate. Pervanadate is a strong inhibitor of phosphatases, which can activate kinases normally kept in an inactive form by phosphatases. Again, up-regulation of L1 shedding was only seen when cells were attached, and only marginal enhancement was observed in suspension cells. The pervanadate- or PMA-induced up-regulation of L1 shedding followed distinct pathways as revealed by inhibition analysis. The PMA-induced shedding was blocked only by protein kinase C inhibitors, whereas the pervanadate-induced shedding of L1 was inhibited by PP2, a potent and selective inhibitor of the Src family of protein Tyr kinases. Pervanadate treatment of AR cells caused Tyr phosphorylation of L1, which was not seen in PMA-treated cells. Moreover, attached Kelly cells did not up-regulate L1 release in response to PMA but did so in response to pervanadate. These findings already indicated that the PMA- and pervanadate-mediated signaling pathways leading to enhanced L1 shedding were distinct.An important observation was that up-regulation of L1 shedding occurred in cells that were detached from the substrate by EDTA/PBS. Similar observations have been made before for the metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of the cell surface proteoglycan syndecan (48.Reiland J. Ott V.L. Lebakken C.S. Yeaman C. McCarthy J. Rapraeger A.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 51.Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The induction of L1 shedding by pervanadate and the EDTA-mediated detachment were similar as they were accompanied with drastic changes of the cytoskeleton and activation of the Src kinase Fyn in AR cells. Importantly, the PP2 inhibitor could block the morphological changes as well as the L1 shedding only in attached cells, whereas it was ineffective in suspension cells. This suggested that activation of Fyn was an early event in the signaling cascade leading to up-regulated L1 release. An involvement of Src kinases in the regulation of shedding processes has not been reported so far. Our observation that Fyn activation and morphological changes can induce up-regulation of L1 release established a link between the activity of ADAMs and the status of cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Indeed, an important relationship between Src kinases, integrins, and the cytoskeleton is increasingly recognized (for review see Ref. 52.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar). Src family tyrosine kinases bind to components of the focal-adhesion complex, where their activity is regulated by integrin-ligand binding (53.Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Moreover, Src kinases were found to be necessary for integrin but not platelet-derived growth factor receptor signal transduction (54.Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Felsenfeld et al. (55.Felsenfeld D.P. Schwartzberg P.L. Venegas A. Tse R. Sheetz M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) reported a regulation of integrin-cytoskeleton interaction by the Src kinase, which was selective for the vitronectin receptor but not for the fibronectin receptor α5β1. Also c-Src overexpression enhances cell matrix adhesion and migration (56.Verbeek B.S. Vroom T.M. Rijksen G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). How Src kinase activation and cytoskeletal changes can activate ADAM-mediated release of substrate molecules is presently unknown.Several recent studies have addressed the signaling pathway leading to the shedding of transmembrane molecules. Gechtman et al.(22.Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) studied the release of HB-EGF transfected in CHO cells and found that PMA-induced shedding was blocked by the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059. Fan and Derynck (45.Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that TGF-α shedding induced by PMA, serum addition, or via growth factor receptors involved the MAP kinase pathway. In addition, the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced shedding of l-selectin from neutrophils was blocked by inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase signaling (45.Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the basal level of TGF-α release in CHO cells involved the p38 MAP kinase signaling because it could be blocked with the specific inhibitor SB202190. It was concluded that the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways might represent a general physiological mechanism to induce shedding (45.Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, Izumi et al. (21.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara F.A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) reported that protein kinase C-δ is involved in the PMA-induced ectodomain shedding of HB-EGF in Vero-H green monkey kidney cells. It was proposed that protein kinase C-δ and MDC9 (ADAM9) could directly interact and thereby regulate shedding (21.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara F.A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between these findings could be because of alternative signaling pathways. Our results on L1 shedding support this notion. The PMA-induced shedding of L1 was partially blocked by the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 and is therefore in agreement with the first two studies. However, the induction of L1 shedding by pervanadate involved Fyn activation and was independent of MAP kinases. In this context it is interesting to note that a novel regulatory pathway of Src family kinase activity by protein kinase C-δ has been reported in a mast cell line (57.Song J.S. Swann P.G. Szallasi Z. Blank U. Blumberg P.M. Rivera J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We can at present not exclude the possibility that Fyn and protein kinase C-δ cooperate in the induction of L1 shedding by this second pathway.It is generally believed that the cleavage of membrane proteins by ADAMs requires the presence of the membrane-anchored enzyme and its substrate in cis in the same membrane (18.Black R.A. White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A still open question is how the protease selects the substrate and how both are brought together. The shedding of L1 has certain features that are not shared by other release mechanisms. One important difference is the amount of released molecules. In many examples, shedding can be followed at the cell surface after treatment with substances like PMA or more physiological stimuli. For example, PMA-induced cleavage of HB-EGF, which appears to involve ADAM9 (21.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara F.A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), can be followed by cell surface fluorescence, and nearly 80% of material is lost within 1 h of incubation (21.Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara F.A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made for the inducedl-selectin (49.Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) or syndecan cleavage (50.Borland G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2810-2815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which appear also to be quite rapid. In contrast, PMA-induced L1 release cannot be followed at the cell surface using for example FACS staining, implicating that the number of newly synthesized molecules reaching the cell surface is similar to the number of released molecules. On the other hand, it is clear from our previous work using cell surface iodinated cells that cleavage indeed occurs at the cell surface as iodinated molecules can be recovered from the medium (29.Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This points to a rate-limiting element in the enzymatic release process of L1, which is distinct from the examples given above. Our present observation that the rate of shedding in suspension was only marginally augmented by PMA or pervanadate is in support of this notion. One possibility is that ADAM and substrate have to meet in a membrane compartment and that access to this compartment is limited. Our results suggest that the cytoskeleton and cell adhesion play an important role in regulation the rate of cleavage.Finally, we addressed the question whether a biological role for released L1 can be found. We present evidence that shed L1 of human tumor cells could bind to neurocan and in its bound form could still serve as integrin substrate. Thus, masking of the sixth domain containing RGD sites because of sterical hindrance can be excluded. This is interesting in light of previous reports showing that neurocan binding can interfere with homophilic L1-L1 binding (34.Friedlander D.R. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 35.Grumet M. Flaccus A. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Given the high affinity of L1-neurocan binding it is conceivable that L1 can be trapped and presented by neurocan. Previously, released L1 has been detected in association with the extracellular matrix of the murine sciatic nerve (38.Martini R. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2439-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and within intratumor laminin strands of human tumors growing in nude mice (37.Montgomery A.M. Becker J.C. Siu C.H. Lemmon V.P. Cheresh D.A. Pancook J.D. Zhao X. Reisfeld R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It seems possible that extracellular matrix proteins like laminin and proteoglycans like neurocan can capture and retain released L1. These findings establish a mechanism by which L1 can be converted from a membrane bound into a matrix-associated form. It remains to be addressed in which biological settings extracellular matrix-retained L1 is of significance. Many transmembrane proteins can undergo cleavage and release of their ectodomain into the medium (for review see Refs. 1.Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 2.Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3.Schlöndorff J.

Cytogenet. 1988; 30: 151-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), suggesting that loss or altered expression of p73 in vivo may be a determinant of the undifferentiated phenotype of neuroblastoma. Moreover, neurons from p53 null mice and neurons from wild type mice cultured with p53 antisense oligonucleotidesin vitro show accelerated spontaneous differentiation (14.Ferreira A. Kosik K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests the hypothesis that loss of the p53 heterodimeric partner of p73 may liberate more uncomplexed or homodimerized p73 and allow expression of its differentiation-inducing function. Accordingly, we have investigated the role of p73 in the differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines, a well studied model of neuronal differentiation and death (15.Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P.

N1E-115 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1.2 g of bicarbonate per liter, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 15 mm N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. Cells were differentiated by reduction of serum to 2.5% and addition of 1 μmall-trans-retinoic acid (RA)1 to the culture medium. Cells were transfected using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with 1.5 mg of p53 or p73 isoform expression vectors, together with 0.5 mg of a LacZ (cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase marker vectorCLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) or GFP-spectrin fusion protein (18.Kalejta R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) expression vector. Cells were then cultured for 96 h in normal growth medium and then fixed on the dishes, stained for β-galactosidase activity, and photographed. Cell differentiation was evaluated by counting 150 β-galactosidase-positive cells. Cells were scored as differentiated if the length of the neurite extensions was at least three times the diameter of the cell body. Human p73 isoforms and p53cDNAs in pCDNA3 have been described (2.De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). p73transcription inactive mutants were obtained by mutating alanine 156 into valine by site directed mutagenesis performed on all fourp73 cDNAs (α, β, γ, and δ) with the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mutation of the corresponding alanine into valine in p53 has been reported to have a dominant negative function (19.Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cook A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All four p73 A156V mutants were inactive forp21 promoter transcription (data not shown). The p73β-Δ84 mutant of p73, lacking the amino-terminal transcription activation domain, was generated by amplifying the β isoform using a 5′ primer from base pair 363 to 385 containing an in-frameNheI restriction site and an Sp6 primer as 3′ primer and then cloned into pCDNA-3 in-frame with a hemagglutinin tag into pcDNA-hemagglutinin (2.De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A. Falco M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Levrero M. Melino G. J. Exp.

Walsh F.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (nucleotides –1274 to 107) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA. The amplified product was cloned into the pGL2 basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using standard methods and checked by dideoxy sequencing. The GFP-spectrin expression vector was a kind gift of Drs. R. Kalejta and A. J. Beavis (18.Kalejta R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To estimate DNA fragmentation, cells transfected with either the control vector or p73 isoforms and p53, together with a GFP-spectrin expression vector at a 1 to 5 ratio, were collected at 800 × g for 10 min and fixed with a 1:1 phosphate-buffered saline and methanol-acetone (4:1 (v/v)) solution at −20 °C. Hypodiploid events and cell cycle of GFP-positive cells was evaluated by flow cytometry using a propidium iodide staining (40 mg/ml) in the presence of 13 kilounits/ml ribonuclease A (20-min incubation at 37 °C) on a FacsCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cells were excited at 488 nm using a 15-mW argon laser, and the fluorescence was monitored at 578 nm at a rate of 150–300 events/s. Ten thousand events were evaluated using the Cell Quest program (Becton Dickinson). Electronic gating of forward scatter-a versus forward scatter-h was used, when appropriate, to eliminate cell aggregates. N1E115 cells were co-transfected with p73 isoforms, p53, or pcDNA3 expression vectors together with the GFP-spectrin vector at a ratio of 5:1 by the calcium phosphate method, as described (21.Raschella G.

Four days after transfection, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was carried out using monoclonal antibodies against a 160-kDa neurofilament (Sigma clone NN18) or against N-CAM (Sigma clone N-CAM-0811) and a secondary antibody to mouse IgG conjugated with R-phycoerytrin. Slides were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (excitation wavelength, 488 nm), and images were acquired with a CCD camera (Bio-Rad). N1E-115 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate as described (21.Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Negroni A. Claudio P.P. Baldi A. Amendola R. Calabretta B. Giordano A. Paggi M.G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with a reporter plasmid containing luciferase cDNA under control of N-CAM promoter (20.Barton C.H. Mann D.A. Walsh F.S. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or of the of the p21 Waf1/Cip1 promoter (22.Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), together with p53 or p73 isoform expression vectors at a ratio of 1:2. In all transfections, a cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase control plasmid was used to normalize the transfection yield. Luciferase assays were carried out after 36 h from transfection with the luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After differentiation, treatment cells were mechanically removed from flasks and pelleted. After transfection with the different vectors and the spectrin-GFP expression plasmid at a ratio of 5:1 by the calcium phosphate method, as described (21.Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Negroni A. Claudio P.P. Baldi A. Amendola R. Calabretta B. Giordano A. Paggi M.G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), GFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry (FacsCalibur, Becton Dickinson) and pelleted. Pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated in lysis buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were normalized to 80 μg/lane, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride sheets. Filters were washed twice with Tween-Tris-buffered saline before blocking nonspecific binding with 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The antibodies were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Filters were washed five times, and detection was performed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary monoclonal antibody (1:2500) for 1 h at room temperature and using the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-p73 is a monoclonal antibody (ER15) (23.Marin M.C. Jost C.A. Irwin M.S. DeCaprio J.A. Caput D. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6316-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (the kind gift of Dr. W.G. Kaelin, Jr., or from Neomarkers Inc., Union City, CA), that recognizes both α and β isoforms of p73. pRB was detected with the G3–245 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), N-MYC with the Ab-1 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Science Inc., Cambridge, MA), and β-actin with the JLA20 monoclonal antibody (Sigma); N-CAM with the Santa Cruz Biotechnology clone C-20 goat polyclonal antibody. To detect p53, the goat polyclonal antibody clone FL-393-G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody that recognizes wild type p53 was used. N1E-115 murine neuroblastoma cells induced to differentiate with 1 μm RA (17.Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21.Raschella G. Tanno B. Bonetto F. Negroni A. Claudio P.P. Baldi A. Amendola R. Calabretta B. Giordano A. Paggi M.G. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showed a time-dependent accumulation of p73 proteins that parallels their morphological differentiation (Fig.1), suggesting that some p73 functions are recruited during neuronal differentiation. In contrast, p53 levels were unchanged along the entire time course of neuronal differentiation (Fig. 1). To directly assess the activity of p73 isoforms in neuroblastoma cells, N1E-115 cells were transiently transfected to express each of the four p73 isoforms or p53. N1E-115 cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of p53 or the different p73 isoform expression vectors, together with 0.5 μg of a LacZ reporter (the cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase vector from CLONTECH) or a GFP-spectrin fusion protein expression vector (18.Kalejta R.F. Shenk T. Beavis A.J. Cytometry. 1997; 29: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) in order to follow the fate of transfected cells (Fig. 2). After 3–4 days, cells transfected with all the four p73 isoforms showed morphological changes characteristic of neuronal differentiation, i.e. increased number of cells with neurites, increased neurite length, and increased number of neurites per cell (Fig. 2). The p73 isoforms showed different abilities to induce differentiation (Fig. 2,d–g), with the β isoform producing the most pronounced changes (Fig. 2, a and e). Cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 2 b) or p53 (Fig.2 c) displayed no signs of differentiation. As expected, a proportion of p53 transfectants showed apoptotic features (Figs. 2 c and3 b). Thus, neuronal differentiation in vitro can be triggered by p73 overexpression alone, in the absence of any differentiation inducer, and this activity is not shared by p53. Under the same conditions, transcriptionally inactive p73 mutants (A156V) have proven incapable of inducing differentiation (Fig. 2, h and i), showing that the transactivating ability of p73 is required and also suggesting that transcription of downstream targets specific for p73, and not p53, is necessary to induce differentiation. A quantitative analysis of p73, p73 mutants, and p53 (differentiative potential) activity is shown in Fig. 2 i. Up to 60% of the cells expressing the p73 isoforms displayed differentiated features, whereas less than 15% of the cells differentiate when either the control plasmid (C), p53, or the transcriptionally inactive mutants (p73m) are transfected. Only a small percentage of the cells transfected with the p73 isoforms undergo apoptosis (Fig. 3 B), but as expected, similarly to p53, p73 is capable of blocking cells in G0/G1phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 3 C). The effect on the cell cycle is likely mediated by the induction of p21 (Fig. 3, Dand E). Cells differentiated with RA show a similar induction of p21 (Fig. 3 D).Figure 3Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. A, anti-hemagglutinin (anti-HA) immunoblot showing the expression of transfected p53 and p73 isoforms. In B and C, cells were cotransfected with the different plasmids and a GFP-spectrin fusion protein, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide. GFP-positive cells were analyzed for DNA content to evaluate: apoptosis (hypodiploid events) (B) and cell cycle phases (C). Apoptosis is expressed as fold over control. The percentage of hypodiploid events in control pCDNA-transfected cells was 14%.

The cotransfection of p73β-Δ84 acts as a dominant negative both on the p73 isoforms and p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next evaluated the ability of the p73 isoforms to regulate the expression of differentiation-related genes. N1E115 cells were co-transfected with p73, p53, or pcDNA3 expression vectors together with the GFP-spectrin vector. Four days after transfection, cells were fixed, and indirect immunofluorescence staining was carried out using monoclonal antibodies against the 160-kDa neurofilament or against N-CAM and a R-phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody to mouse IgG. As shown in Fig. 4, N1E-115 cells cotransfected with a GFP expression plasmid and the p73 isoforms were positively stained with antibodies against both neurofilaments (Fig.4 A) and N-CAM (Fig. 4 B), whereas cells transfected with the control vector or p53 were either completely negative or slightly positive. Thus, in addition to inducing morphological changes, exogenously expressed p73 isoforms were also sufficient to drive the expression of biochemical markers characteristic of the neuronal differentiation program. Co-transfection of vectors expressing the different p73 isoforms together with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the N-CAMpromoter confirmed the activation of the N-CAM gene transcription in N1E-115 cells induced to differentiate by p73 isoforms. A significant increase in luciferase activity was observed with all the p73 isoforms reaching 12-fold over control with the β form (Fig. 4 C). Co-transfection of all the possible p73 dimeric combinations showed a similar enhancement of promoter activity. In contrast, although p53 strongly up-regulated the p21promoter (Fig. 3 E), under the same experimental conditions, it was unable to up-regulate the N-CAM promoter (Fig.4 C), further underscoring the different role of p53 and p73 isoforms in neuronal differentiation and the existence of differences in p53 and p73 target genes. Induction of neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro is accompanied by N-MYC down-regulation (15.Thiele C.J. Reynolds C.P. Israel M.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) and an increase of pRB levels (17.Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. Van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the effects of p73 on N-MYC and pRB levels with that of treatment with 1 μm RA (Fig.5). After transfection with p73β, N-MYC protein levels decreased to levels similar to those of RA-treated cells (Fig. 5). No changes were observed in cells transfected with vector alone or the p53 plasmid. Under the same conditions, an increase of pRB was seen. Immunoblot analysis also confirmed the increase of N-CAM in cells transfected with p73β but not in those transfected with p53 to levels comparable to those obtained with RA-induced differentiation (Fig. 5). In order to demonstrate that p73 is not only sufficient but is indeed required for neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro, we evaluated the effect of blocking p73 functions with the p73β-Δ84 dominant negative mutant, lacking the amino-terminal transcription activation domain, on RA-induced neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 cells. p73β-Δ84 acts as a dominant negative mutant for p73 transcriptional activity on the p21 promoter (Fig. 3 E). As shown in Fig.6 A, differentiation of N1E-115 cells with 1 μm RA is accompanied by a 3-fold increase inN-CAM promoter-driven luciferase expression at 24 h. Transfection with p73β results in a 12.5-fold activation, and the co-treatment of p73β-transfected cells with RA results in a greater than 28-fold increase of luciferase activity, showing a cooperative positive effect of p73 expression and RA on theN-CAM promoter (Fig. 6 A). When cells were co-transfected with p73β-Δ84, induction of the promoter by RA was completely blocked at all concentrations (Fig.6 B). Because the N-CAM promoter is not induced by p53 in these cells (Fig. 5 C) and there is no potentiation of the RA effect by p53 (data not shown), the observed changes in N-CAM activation after RA treatment may be attributed to a selective interference on endogenous p73 functions by the mutant. Thus, p73 transcriptional functions appear to be required for RA to induce N-CAM activation and neuronal differentiation. Our results indicate that endogenous p73 is induced during neuroblastoma cell differentiation, that overexpression of the p73 isoforms in neuroblastoma cells is per se sufficient to cause neuronal differentiation, and that p73 transcriptional functions are required for RA-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro. Recent evidence indicates that another p53 homologue, p63, is also involved in the control of mammalian cell differentiation in a tissue-specific manner (24.Mills A.A. Zheng B. Wang X.J. Vogel H. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 25.Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F. Nature. 1999; 398: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). p63 null mice fail to maintain the apical ectodermal ridge essential for limb development and have truncated limbs. They also have defective epidermal differentiation, with no hair follicles, teeth, or mammary, lachrymal, or salivary glands. Our data show that, at least in neuroblastoma cells, p73 determines neuronal differentiation. The absence of p73 due to deletion and monoallelic expression in human neuroblastomas, albeit not the primary cause of transformation, could determine the dedifferentiated phenotype of neuroblastomas. p73 expression from its normally silent allele in stage IV-S cases withoutN-MYC amplification may be involved in the induction of spontaneous regression often observed in this subset of neuroblastoma patients. Although structurally related to p53, p73 also has distinct cellular functional activities (26.Arrowsmith C.H. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1169-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27.Lohrum M.A. Vousden K.H.

Both cause growth arrest by acting on similar targets, such as p21 (per sealso involved in differentiation (30.Di Cunto F. Topley G. Calautti E. Hsiao J. Ong L. Seth P.K. Dotto G.P. Science. 1998; 280: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)), and both are recruited, although through partially nonoverlapping pathways, in apoptotic responses to DNA damage. However, p73 responds to specific differentiation inducers and contributes to neuronal differentiation. While this article was in preparation, Yang et al. (31.Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M.

Because Ca2+ is a major second messenger of ET-1, the role of Ca2+ in ET-1-induced hypertrophic responses in cultured cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats was examined. ET-1 activated the promoter of the β-type myosin heavy chain gene (β-MHC) (−354 to +34 base pairs) by about 4-fold. This activation was inhibited by chelation of Ca2+ and the blocking of protein kinase C activity. Similarly, the β-MHC promoter was activated by Ca2+ionophores and a protein kinase C activator. β-MHCpromoter activation induced by ET-1 was suppressed by pretreatment with the calmodulin inhibitor, W7, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor, KN62, and the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A. β-MHC promoter activation by ET-1 was also attenuated by overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of CaMKII and calcineurin. ET-1 increased the activity of CaMKII and calcineurin in cardiac myocytes. Pretreatment with KN62 and cyclosporin A strongly suppressed ET-1-induced increases in [3H]phenylalanine uptake and in cell size. These results suggest that Ca2+ plays a critical role in ET-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by activating CaMKII- and calcineurin-dependent pathways.

For this reason, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the development of cardiac hypertrophy. A variety of factors such as mechanical load and neurohumoral factors induce hypertrophic responses in the ventricular myocardium (2.Chien K.R. Grace A.A. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 211-250Google Scholar). The hypertrophic responses are characterized by an increase in size of the individual ventricular myocyte, reexpression of genes normally expressed in the embryonic ventricle, and sarcomere assembly (2.Chien K.R. Grace A.A. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 211-250Google Scholar, 3.Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol.

Up-regulation of fetal genes, including the β-type myosin heavy chain (β-MHC)1gene is a well established genetic marker of ventricular hypertrophy (4.Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which hypertrophic stimuli induces reprogramming of gene expression during the development of cardiac hypertrophy is unclear. The 21-amino acid vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) induces hypertrophic responses both in vivo and in vitro(5.Ito H. Hirata Y. Hiroe M. Tsujino M. Adachi S. Takamoto T. Nitta M.

The activated receptor induces hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol, resulting in the accumulation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (6.Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U.

Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) and reports suggest that Ca2+ is involved in the generation of cardiac hypertrophy (6.Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M.

It has been reported that transgenic mice that overexpress calmodulin or the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin in the myocardium develop cardiac hypertrophy (12.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R.

Goldstein M.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We, therefore, have examined in this study the question of whether the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent signaling pathways are involved in ET-1-induced hypertrophy in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The present work demonstrates that both calmodulin effectors, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin, play a critical role in ET-1-induced development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and activation of the β-MHC promoter. The culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Primary cultures of cardiac myocytes were prepared from ventricles of 1-day-old Wistar rats as described previously (14.Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were plated at a field density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on 35-mm culture dishes with 2 ml of culture medium. Twenty-four hours after culture in serum-containing medium, the cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (15.Shiojima I. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Oka T. Yamazaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rat δ CaMKII coding region was obtained by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction using RNA from cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the EcoRI andBamHI site of the plasmid vector pcDNA3 and verified as the δB isoform by sequence analysis. A two-step polymerase chain reaction was used to generate the dominant-negative K43A mutant CaMKII as reported previously (16.Abraham S.T. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative CaMKII and dominant-negative calcineurin (H160Q)(17) were used as effectors. Firefly luciferase cDNA ligated to a 388-bp fragment of the rat β-MHC promoter (−354 to +34 bp) was used as a reporter gene (18.Thompson W.R. Nadal G.B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase was also transfected as an internal control. Following transfection, cells were washed extensively and maintained in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 0.1 μm ET-1. Cells were incubated for 24 h and then harvested in a 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities of lysates were measured as reported previously (15.Shiojima I. Komuro I. Mizuno T. Aikawa R. Akazawa H. Oka T. Yamazaki T. Yazaki Y. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The activity of CaMKII was assayed by measuring the phosphorylation of the synthetic peptide autocamtide-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), a peptide substrate for CaMKII (19.Gringhuis S.I. de Leij L.F.M.H. Wayman G.A. Tokumitsu H. Vellenga E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31809-31820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In brief, CaMKII was immunoprecipitated using an anti-CaMKII polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and the immune complex was incubated with 15 μg of autocamtide-2 and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 and 6.7 μm calmodulin for 20 min at 30 °C. After incubation, the supernatants were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the phosphorylated substrate bands were visualized by autoradiography. Western blot analysis using anti-CaMKII polyclonal antibody verified that the amount of immunoprecipitated CaMKII was equal at each time point. The activity of calcineurin was determined as described previously (17.Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For the phosphatase assay, a calcineurin substrate glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RII fusion protein, fixed to glutathione-cellulose beads, was first phosphorylated by protein kinase A in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 24 h at 4 °C. The phosphorylated GST-RII protein was eluted by glutathione and incubated with the cell lysates in dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 μmCaM, and 0.5 μm okadaic acid) for 30 min at 30 °C. The radioactivity of liberated 32P from phosphorylated GST-RII was determined by Cerenkov counting. Protein synthesis was determined by assessing the incorporation of labeled [3H]phenylalanine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein (14.Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were stimulated by ET-1 for 48 h and [3H]phenylalanine (1 μCi/ml) was added 2 h before harvest. Total radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Statistical comparison of the control group with treated groups was carried out using a one-way analysis of variance test and the Dunnett's t test. The accepted level of significance was p < 0.05. Reexpression of fetal genes is the genetic response of cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic stimuli. Up-regulation of β-MHC gene expression is a well established genetic marker of ventricular hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo (4.Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanism of ET-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, we first examined whether ET-1 activates the β-MHC promoter in cultured cardiac myocytes. The reporter gene containing the β-MHC promoter fragment (−354 to +34 bp), which was reported to play a critical role in response to hypertrophic stimuli (18.Thompson W.R. Nadal G.B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was transfected into cultured cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats, and cells were exposed to ET-1(0.1 nm–1 μm) for 24 h. The activity of the β-MHC promoter was increased by ET-1 in a dose-dependent manner. A significant increase in the activity of the β-MHC promoter was detected from 1 nm ET-1, and maximal activation was obtained by 0.1 μm (Fig. 1). Because ET-1 induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and activation of PKC (7.Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar, 8.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar), we examined Ca2+ and PKC involvement in the ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter. The transfected cardiac myocytes were exposed to ET-1 after pretreatment with an extracellular Ca2+ chelator, EGTA (3 mm), for 2 min or an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA (4 μm), for 30 min. Both treatments with EGTA and BAPTA strongly suppressed ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter (Fig.2 A). Down-regulation of PKC by pretreatment with 0.1 μm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 24 h and inhibition of PKC with a specific PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (0.1 μm), for 30 min also strongly suppressed β-MHC promoter activation by ET-1 (Fig. 2 A). When cells were exposed to Ca2+ ionophores A23187 and ionomycin, the β-MHC promoter was slightly but significantly activated (Fig. 2 B). The PKC activator, TPA, strongly increased the activity of the β-MHC promoter (Fig. 2 B). When cells were incubated with TPA and A23187 or ionomycin, the β-MHC promoter activity showed an additive increase in activation (Fig. 2 B). To further elucidate the relationship between Ca2+ and PKC on the activation of the β-MHC promoter, cells were either incubated with A23187 after pretreatment with TPA (0.1 μm) for 24 h or calphostin C (0.1 μm) for 30 min or incubated with 0.1 μm TPA after pretreatment with EGTA (3 mm) for 2 min or BAPTA (4 μm) for 30 min. Pretreatment with TPA or calphostin C partly inhibited A23187-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter, and pretreatment with EGTA or BAPTA partially inhibited TPA-induced activation of the β-MHCpromoter (Fig. 2 C). These results suggest that both Ca2+ and PKC are necessary and cooperatively involved in ET-1-induced activation of β-MHC promoter in cardiac myocytes. It has been reported that increased intracellular Ca2+ binds to a large number of different Ca2+-binding proteins, including calmodulin, and activates effectors such as CaMKII and calcineurin (16.Abraham S.T. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20.Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether these Ca2+-dependent proteins are involved in ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter, we examined the effects of specific inhibitors on β-MHC promoter activity. Pretreatment with the calmodulin inhibitor W7 (0.1 μm) strongly suppressed ET-1-induced activation of β-MHC promoter (Fig.3 A), suggesting that calmodulin is required for ET-1-induced β-MHC promoter activation. Pretreatment with the CaMKII inhibitor KN62 or the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CyA) also significantly suppressed ET-induced activation of β-MHC promoter (Fig.3 A). Pretreatment with another CaMKII inhibitor KN93 also suppressed the activation of the β-MHC promoter, whereas its inactive analogue KN92 did not show any inhibitory effect on ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter (data not shown). Similarly, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 suppressed ET-1-induced β-MHC promoter activation (data not shown). When both CaMKII and calcineurin were inhibited by KN62 and CyA, the promoter activity of β-MHC was suppressed to a greater degree (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the pretreatment with these inhibitors showed similar inhibitory effects on A23187 and TPA-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter (Fig. 3 B). To further verify that CaMKII and calcineurin are involved in ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter, we co-transfected the β-MHC promoter gene with dominant-negative CaMKII or dominant-negative calcineurin. Although overexpression of dominant-negative CaMKII or dominant-negative calcineurin had no significant effect on the basal promoter activity of β-MHC, overexpression of both mutant constructs strongly suppressed the activation of the β-MHC promoter induced by ET-1 (Fig. 3 C). We then examined whether ET-1 activates CaMKII and calcineurin in cardiac myocytes. After stimulation with ET-1, CaMKII was immunoprecipitated using an anti-CaMKII antibody, and the activity was measured using autocamide-2 as a substrate (16.Abraham S.T. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). ET-1 significantly increased the activity of CaMKII (Fig. 4 A). The activity of CaMKII was increased very rapidly, within 0.5 min, and decreased to basal levels within 15 min. The activity of calcineurin was measured using the GST-RII fusion protein as a substrate (17.Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). ET-1 rapidly and transiently activated calcineurin in cardiac myocytes (Fig.4 B). The activity of calcineurin was increased from 0.5 min, peaked at 1 min, and decreased thereafter. We and others have previously reported that ET-1 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (5.Ito H. Hirata Y. Hiroe M. Tsujino M. Adachi S. Takamoto T. Nitta M. Taniguchi K. Marumo F. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 6.Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). In the present study, CaMKII or calcineurin involvement in ET-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was determined by measuring the relative amount of protein synthesis using [3H]phenylalanine. Stimulation of cultured cardiac myocytes with 0.1 μm ET-1 for 48 h caused a significant increase (204% of unstimulated control) in phenylalanine incorporation (Fig. 5), consistent with prior studies (14.Yamazaki T. Komuro I. Kudoh S. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Maemura K. Kurihara H. Aikawa R. Takano H. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3221-3228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This increase was partially suppressed by 0.5 μm KN62 (150% of control) or 0.5 μm CyA (134% of control) (Fig. 5). When cardiomyocytes were pretreated with both KN62 and CyA, the increase was abolished (105% of control) (Fig.5). These results suggest that ET-1 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through two distinctive pathways, CaMKII or calcineurin. The role of CaMKII and calcineurin in ET-1-induced morphological changes in cardiac myocytes was then examined. Control cells cultured in serum-free medium for up to 48 h were small and irregularly shaped, and the myofilaments were poorly organized (Fig.6 a). From as early as 4 h after the addition of 0.1 μm ET-1, cardiac myocytes became rod- or triangle-shaped and myofibrils were well organized (Fig.6 b). Pretreatment with KN62 (0.5 μm) or CyA (0.5 μm) for 30 min did not inhibit these morphological changes induced by ET-1 for 4 h (Fig. 6, c andd), indicating that CaMKII and calcineurin had no effect on ET-1-induced rapid morphological changes, such as myofibrillar organization and change of cell shape. When exposed to ET-1 for 48 h, cardiac myocytes became larger (∼2.5-fold versus control) (Fig.7, A and B, c) and myofibrils were well organized (Fig. 7 B, d). The pretreatment with KN62 and/or CyA inhibited the increase in cell size and myofibrillar organization induced by ET-1 (Fig. 7, A andB, e–j). These results suggest that the increase in cell size and myofibrillar organization induced by ET-1 at 48 h is accomplished by newly synthesized proteins, and that CaMKII and calcineurin are involved in ET-1-induced protein synthesis. This study has examined whether intracellular Ca2+ is involved in ET-1-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Our pharmacological studies using specific inhibitors and genetic studies using mutant DNA reveal that both CaMKII and calcineurin play critical roles in ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter and an increase in protein synthesis accompanied by sarcomere assembly in cultured cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats. The signaling pathways regulating hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes are summarized in Fig. 8. One of the central features of ventricular hypertrophy is the activation of a fetal program of gene expression (2.Chien K.R. Grace A.A. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 211-250Google Scholar, 3.Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol.

For example, the β-isoform of MHC and the skeletal isoform of α-actin are expressed in the fetal ventricle and are replaced by the respective adult isoform, α-MHC and cardiac α-actin, after birth. When the heart is exposed to hemodynamic overload, β-MHC and skeletal α-actin are re-expressed during the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Because induction of β-MHC gene expression occurs in response to diverse hypertrophic stimuli in many mammalian species (3.Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3775-3782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 18.Thompson W.R.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), β-MHC is one of the most thoroughly studied genetic markers of the hypertrophic response. In the present study, ET-1 up-regulated the promoter activity of β-MHC in cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats. Chelation of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ by EGTA and BAPTA, respectively, suppressed ET-1-induced activation of β-MHCpromoter, suggesting that Ca2+ is critically involved in its activation. Of the many types of Ca2+-binding proteins, calmodulin is of major importance in cardiomyocytes (22.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The calmodulin specific inhibitor, W7, strongly inhibited ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter. Ca2+/calmodulin regulates functional proteins such as CaMKII and calcineurin (22.Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 23.Klee C.B.

Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). We next examined the role of CaMKII and calcineurin in ET-1-induced β-MHCpromoter activation. Both CaMKII inhibitors KN62 and KN93 and the calcineurin inhibitors CyA and FK506 strongly inhibited promoter activation. Moreover, overexpression of dominant-negative CaMKII and dominant-negative calcineurin suppressed ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter. All of these results strongly suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin plays a critical role in ET-1-induced β-MHC promoter activation through CaMKII and calcineurin. A major question concerns the mechanism of how these Ca2+/CaM-dependent second messengers are involved in ET-1-induced β-MHC promoter activation in cardiac myocytes. The nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) family of transcription factors is known to be activated by calcineurin in the immune system (27.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). Following its activation, NF-AT is translocated into the nucleus where it binds either directly to DNA or in a complex with members of the bZIP transcription factor family such as AP-1 (Fos/Jun) and subsequently activates gene transcription (27.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar,28.Nolan G.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 795-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). So far, four members of the NF-AT gene family are known,NF-ATc, NF-ATp, NF-AT3, and NF-AT4 (27.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the Ca2+/calcineurin/NF-ATc signaling pathway is essential for normal cardiac valve and septum morphogenesis (29.de la Pompa J.L. Timmerman L.A. Takimoto H. Yoshida H. Elia A.J. Samper E. Potter J. Wakeham A. Marengere L. Langille B.L. Crabtree G.R. Mak T.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar,30.Ranger A.M. Grusby M.J. Hodge M.R.

(12.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the Ca2+/calcineurin/NF-AT3 signaling pathway might play an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy bothin vivo and in vitro. These observations suggest that NF-AT3 may mediate calcineurin-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter. Overexpression of the NF-AT3gene increased the transcriptional activity of the β-MHCpromoter 2W. Zhu and I. Komuro, unpublished observations. (Fig. 8). CaMKII has been reported to mediate the transcription ofc-fos (31.Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the Fos/Jun heterodimer complex AP-1 has been shown to be involved in expression of the skeletal α-actin and the atrial natriuretic peptide genes in the heart (32.Kovacic M.B. Wong V.S. Gardner D.G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33.Paradis P. MacLellan W.R. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10827-10833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is possible that CaMKII and calcineurin activate AP-1 and NF-AT3 expression, respectively, and that AP-1 and NF-AT3 stimulate the β-MHCpromoter in concert with each other (Fig. 8). Alternatively, because it has been reported that the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA4 interacts with NF-AT3 and that GATA4 binding sequences in the β-MHC promoter are important for overload-induced up-regulation (12.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar, 21.Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), GATA4 may play a critical role in ET-1-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter with NF-AT3 (Fig. 8). Sequences −303/−197 of the β-MHC promoter contain the GATA and AP-1-like motif (TGCTTCA) (18.Thompson W.R. Nadal G.B. Mahdavi V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22678-22688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, deletion from −303 to −203 bp of the β-MHC promoter resulted in complete loss of inducible expression (21.Hasegawa K. Lee S.J. Jobe S.M. Markham B.E. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although overexpression of theNF-AT3 gene induced the transcriptional activation of the β-MHC promoter2, a typical NF-AT binding motif was not found in the β-MHC promoter, suggesting that NF-AT3 may activate the β-MHC promoter through binding with GATA4 or AP-1. Further study is necessary to determine this possibility. α1-Adrenergic agonists have been reported to activate β-MHC transcription during cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through PKC (34.Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC also mediates ET-1-induced cardiac hypertrophy (6.Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Glembotski C.C. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, the down-regulation of PKC by TPA and the pretreatment with calphostin C partially inhibited ET-1-stimulated β-MHC promoter, and TPA conversely enhanced the activity of β-MHC promoter. Addition of TPA and Ca2+ionophores A23187 or ionomycin more strongly activated the β-MHC promoter than single administration. In addition, TPA-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter was partly inhibited by pretreatment with EGTA or BAPTA, and A23187-induced activation of the β-MHC promoter was partly suppressed by pretreatment with TPA for 24 h or calphostin C. These results suggest that PKC also plays a critical role in the ET-1-induced activation of the fetal gene program in concert with Ca2+. Because PKC activates AP-1 in many cell types (4.Komuro I. Yazaki Y. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 55-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 35.Baier B.G. Uberall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ca2+and PKC may up-regulate expression of β-MHC gene through NF-AT and AP-1, respectively, in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 8). It is well known that the Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway and the PKC pathway play a pivotal role in concert in lymphocyte activation including gene expression and cytokine production (36.Ghaffari T.N. Bauer B. Villunger A. Baier B.G. Altman A. Utermann G. Uberall F. Baier G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is of interest to elucidate whether this is also true in cardiac myocytes. Sarcomere organization is one of the features of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes (2.Chien K.R. Grace A.A. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 211-250Google Scholar). In the present study, ET-1-induced hypertrophic response was also verified by morphological changes. After treatment with ET-1 for 48 h, the myocytes displayed ∼2.5-fold increase in cell size when compared with the control cells. However, the pretreatment with KN62 and/or CyA strongly inhibited the increase in cell size induced by ET-1. Double labeling of myocytes with phalloidin-rhodamine and MF-20-fluorescein isothiocyanate revealed that although actin was organized in the sarcomere to some extent, myosin was not assembled in the sarcomere and existed at the perinuclear region, 48 h after serum deprivation. These results suggest that most of control myocytes were at the nascent myofibril stage as reported previously (37.Komiyama M. Maruyama K. Shimada Y. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Komiyama et al. (37.Komiyama M. Maruyama K. Shimada Y. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1990; 11: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrate that in the development of the heart, actin appears prior to myosin and that the phalloidin-positive fibrils appear to constitute nascent myofibrils. From as early as 4 h after addition of ET-1, myocytes displayed the mature myofibril formation, where both actin and myosin were linearly arranged and strongly stained (Fig. 6). Pretreatment with KN62 or CyA had no effect on ET-1-induced sarcomere assembly at this time point (Fig. 6). However, when treated with KN62 or CyA for 48 h, cardiac myocytes failed to become large or to form well organized sarcomeres (Fig. 7). These results are consistent with the observations of Ramirez et al. (25.Ramirez M.T. Zhao X.L. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) who reported that pretreatment with KN93 blocked phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic changes; and of Molkentin et al. (12.Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2219) Google Scholar), who reported that pretreatment with CyA blocked angiotensin II- or phenylephrine-induced morphological changes in cultured cardiac myocytes. These results and observations suggest that both CaMKII and calcineurin are involved in ET-1-induced sarcomere assembly at the later stage, but not at the early stage, through an increase in newly synthesized proteins."

The present study demonstrates that GSH2expression is also regulated by Yap1p under oxidative stress-induced conditions. In addition to oxidative stress, expression ofGSH1 and GSH2 was induced by heat shock stress in a Yap1p-dependent manner with subsequent increases in intracellular glutathione content. Oxygen respiration rate increased when cells were exposed to higher temperatures, and as a result, intracellular oxidation levels were increased. The heat shock-induced expression of GSH1 and GSH2 did not occur under anaerobic conditions. Furthermore, even under aerobic conditions, the heat shock response of these genes was not observed when cells were pretreated with KCN to block oxygen respiration. We speculate that heat shock stress enhances oxygen respiration, which in turn results in an increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.

When the temperature of Escherichia coli cells is increased from 30 to 42 °C, the intracellular concentration of sigma factor ς32 increases 15–20-fold. The sigma factor is one of the components of E. coli RNA polymerase, and substitution of a vegitative sigma factor (ς70) by ς32 modifies the RNA polymerase to specifically recognize the promoter of HSP genes. In higher eukaryotes, a heat shock transcription factor is trimerized, phosphorylated, and translocated into the nucleus by heat shock stress and binds to the heat shock element (HSE) on the promoter of HSP genes to activate transcription (for a review, see Ref. 1.Morimoto R.I.

Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Yap1p resides both in the cytoplasm and nucleus under nonstressed conditions. Upon oxidative stress, Yap1p is concentrated in the nucleus where it activates the transcription of its target genes (8.Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A.

Because theGSH1 gene encoding the former enzyme is one of the targets for Yap1p (14.Wu A-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2127108195,"The cell surface molecules CD4 and CD8 greatly enhance the sensitivity of T-cell antigen recognition, acting as co-receptors by binding to the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules as the T-cell receptor (TCR). Here we use surface plasmon resonance to study the binding of CD8alphaalpha to class I MHC molecules. CD8alphaalpha bound the classical MHC molecules HLA-A*0201, -A*1101, -B*3501, and -C*0702 with dissociation constants (K(d)) of 90-220 microm, a range of affinities distinctly lower than that of TCR/peptide-MHC interaction. We suggest such affinities apply to most CD8alphaalpha/classical class I MHC interactions and may be optimal for T-cell recognition. In contrast, CD8alphaalpha bound both HLA-A*6801 and B*4801 with a significantly lower affinity (>/=1 mm), consistent with the finding that interactions with these alleles are unable to mediate cell-cell adhesion. Interestingly, CD8alphaalpha bound normally to the nonclassical MHC molecule HLA-G (K(d) approximately 150 microm), but only weakly to the natural killer cell receptor ligand HLA-E (K(d) >/= 1 mm). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that variation in CD8alphaalpha binding affinity can be explained by amino acid differences within the alpha3 domain. Taken together with crystallographic studies, these results indicate that subtle conformational changes in the solvent exposed alpha3 domain loop (residues 223-229) can account for the differential ability of both classical and nonclassical class I MHC molecules to bind CD8."

This homology is due to the presence of highly conserved cysteine residues in so-called cysteine-rich pseudo-repeats, a hallmark of this family. The cytoplasmic domains of the various TNFR family members, on the other hand, differ greatly not only in their sequence but also in their length. Some of the apoptosis-inducing members of this family, such as TNFR1, CD95/Fas/APO-1, DR3/TRAMP/APO-3, DR4/TRAIL/APO-2, and DR5/TRAIL-R2, contain a conserved domain of approximately 80 amino acids, called a death domain, which is essential for mediation of cell death (2.Tartaglia L.A.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 629-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), the cell surface receptors regulating this process remain to be identified. Members of the TNFR family are well known for their role in the mediation of cell death in adult tissues. Based on its unique expression profile during development, TAJ may play a similar role during embryogenesis.In addition to its full-length isoform, we have isolated two alternative spliced forms of murine TAJ that are likely to act as decoy and soluble receptors, respectively. Such receptors have been previously identified for other members of the TNFR family and shown to block signaling via the full-length receptors (14.Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.F., Yu, G. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 277: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 21.Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Ramakrishnan L. Gray C.L. Baker K. Wood W.I.

Nature. 1998; 396: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether the mTAJ-αS and mTAJ-β isoforms play a similar role in regulating signaling via the full-length TAJ receptor.Despite sharing significant sequence homology with TNFR family members in the extracellular ligand-binding domain, TAJ possesses a unique cytoplasmic domain, which suggests that it utilizes novel signal transduction pathways for the activation of JNK and cell death pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis, TAJ-induced JNK activation was not blocked by dominant-negative inhibitors of TRAF2, TRAF5, or ASK1, which have been previously implicated in JNK activation via TNFR1 and CD40. However, coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that TAJ is capable of binding a number of different TRAF family members, and it is possible that TAJ-induced JNK activation is mediated by an as yet untested TRAF homolog, such as TRAF6. Similarly, in addition to ASK1, alternative pathways for JNK activation via TNFR family members have been described (23.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24.Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen whether TAJ utilizes one of these alternative pathways.A surprising result of this study was the ability of TAJ to induce cell death since it does not possess a death domain. Our results indicate that TAJ induces cell death by a mechanism independent of the classical death domain receptor-FADD-caspase 8/10 pathway. Although, caspase-mediated cell death is the best characterized form of apoptosis, several caspase-independent forms of death are also known in the literature. For example, FADD, in addition to its role in the activation of caspases, can also induce caspase-independent cell death (26.Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This death is resistant to caspase inhibitors and is accompanied by cellular swelling without apoptotic bodies or fragmentation of chromatin (26.Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Similar forms of caspase-independent death have been previously reported for both Fas and TNFR1 as well (27.Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P.

First, Bax and Bax-like proteins have been known to kill mammalian cells even in the presence of caspase inhibitors, provoking chromatin condensation and membrane alterations but without caspase activation or DNA degradation (38.Xiang J.

It has been proposed that Bax and Bax-like proteins might mediate caspase-independent death via their channel forming ability that could promote mitochondrial permeability transition or puncture the outer mitochondrial membrane (41.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). Second, nitric oxide, like Bax, also induces cell death accompanied by chromatin condensation, nuclear compaction, and mitochondrial swelling but without caspase activation or DNA fragmentation (42.Okuno S. Shimizu S. Ito T. Nomura M. Hamada E. Tsujimoto Y. Matsuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34272-34277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The recent isolation of apoptosis-inducing factor may provide an additional mechanism for caspase-independent cell death induction by TAJ (43.Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. Penninger J. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 44.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M.

Apoptosis-inducing factor is a flavoprotein of approximately 57 kDa that is normally confined to mitochondrial intermembrane space but translocates to the nucleus when apoptosis is induced. Apoptosis-inducing factor can induce chromatin condensation in isolated nuclei, dissipation of mitochondrial Δψm, and exposure of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane. None of these effects are blocked by treatment with broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (43.Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. Penninger J. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 44.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M.

We are currently testing the contribution of the above mediators to TAJ-induced cell death.The ligand for TAJ has not been identified yet. Recently, two novel ligands belonging to the TNF family, designated APRIL (45.Hahne M. Kataoka T. Schroter M. Hofmann K. Irmler M. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Bornand T. Holler N. French L.E. Sordat B. Rimoldi D. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1185-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) and THANK/BlyS (46.Mukhopadhyay A. Ni J. Zhai Y., Yu, G.L. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol.

Besides Blys/THANK, TAJ could also be a receptor for VEGI, another member of the tumor necrosis factor family for which receptor has not been identified. Studies are in progress to test whether one of these represents the ligand for TAJ. Members of the TNFR1 superfamily play an important role in regulating diverse biological activities, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death or apoptosis. The majority of TNFR family members are type I membrane proteins that share significant sequence homology in their extracellular domains (1.Gruss H.J. Dower S.K. Blood. 1995; 85: 3378-3404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This homology is due to the presence of highly conserved cysteine residues in so-called cysteine-rich pseudo-repeats, a hallmark of this family. The cytoplasmic domains of the various TNFR family members, on the other hand, differ greatly not only in their sequence but also in their length. Some of the apoptosis-inducing members of this family, such as TNFR1, CD95/Fas/APO-1, DR3/TRAMP/APO-3, DR4/TRAIL/APO-2, and DR5/TRAIL-R2, contain a conserved domain of approximately 80 amino acids, called a death domain, which is essential for mediation of cell death (2.Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 3.Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol.

Although death domains are absent in other members of the TNFR family, some of these non-death domain-containing receptors, such as TNFR2, CD30, and LT-βR, are nevertheless capable of inducing cell death under certain circumstances (5.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6.Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vanhaesebroeck B. Grooten J. Fiers W. J.

In the present report, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel member of the TNFR family, designated TAJ (forToxicity And JNK inducer). We present evidence that, based on its unique expression profile and signaling activities, TAJ may be a key regulator of cell activation and death during embryonic development. DISCUSSIONProgrammed cell death or apoptosis plays an important role in the development and morphogenesis of multicellular organisms by controlling cell number and removing mutated or defective cells (19.Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar).

Such receptors have been previously identified for other members of the TNFR family and shown to block signaling via the full-length receptors (14.Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.F., Yu, G. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 277: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 21.Sheridan J.P. Marsters S.A. Pitti R.M. Gurney A. Skubatch M. Baldwin D. Ramakrishnan L. Gray C.L. Baker K. Wood W.I.

Nature. 1998; 396: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen whether the mTAJ-αS and mTAJ-β isoforms play a similar role in regulating signaling via the full-length TAJ receptor. Despite sharing significant sequence homology with TNFR family members in the extracellular ligand-binding domain, TAJ possesses a unique cytoplasmic domain, which suggests that it utilizes novel signal transduction pathways for the activation of JNK and cell death pathways. Consistent with this hypothesis, TAJ-induced JNK activation was not blocked by dominant-negative inhibitors of TRAF2, TRAF5, or ASK1, which have been previously implicated in JNK activation via TNFR1 and CD40. However, coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that TAJ is capable of binding a number of different TRAF family members, and it is possible that TAJ-induced JNK activation is mediated by an as yet untested TRAF homolog, such as TRAF6. Similarly, in addition to ASK1, alternative pathways for JNK activation via TNFR family members have been described (23.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 24.Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen whether TAJ utilizes one of these alternative pathways. A surprising result of this study was the ability of TAJ to induce cell death since it does not possess a death domain. Our results indicate that TAJ induces cell death by a mechanism independent of the classical death domain receptor-FADD-caspase 8/10 pathway. Although, caspase-mediated cell death is the best characterized form of apoptosis, several caspase-independent forms of death are also known in the literature. For example, FADD, in addition to its role in the activation of caspases, can also induce caspase-independent cell death (26.Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This death is resistant to caspase inhibitors and is accompanied by cellular swelling without apoptotic bodies or fragmentation of chromatin (26.Kawahara A. Ohsawa Y. Matsumura H. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1353-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Similar forms of caspase-independent death have been previously reported for both Fas and TNFR1 as well (27.Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 28.Vercammen D. Beyaert R. Denecker G. Goossens V. Van Loo G. Declercq W. Grooten J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp.

Several non-death domain-containing members of the TNFR family have been shown to induce cell death under certain conditions (5.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30835-30840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6.Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Vanhaesebroeck B. Grooten J. Fiers W. J.

Science. 1993; 261: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar), and it remains to be seen whether TAJ shares a common caspase-independent mechanism of cell death induction with these receptors. Several additional examples of caspase-independent cell death have been recently reported as well (31.Pettersen R.D. Gaudernack G. Olafsen M.K. Lie S.O. Hestdal K. J.

There are several potential mediators of caspase-independent cell death via TAJ. First, Bax and Bax-like proteins have been known to kill mammalian cells even in the presence of caspase inhibitors, provoking chromatin condensation and membrane alterations but without caspase activation or DNA degradation (38.Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 39.McCarthy N.J. Whyte M.K. Gilbert C.S. Evan G.I. J.

It has been proposed that Bax and Bax-like proteins might mediate caspase-independent death via their channel forming ability that could promote mitochondrial permeability transition or puncture the outer mitochondrial membrane (41.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4779) Google Scholar). Second, nitric oxide, like Bax, also induces cell death accompanied by chromatin condensation, nuclear compaction, and mitochondrial swelling but without caspase activation or DNA fragmentation (42.Okuno S. Shimizu S. Ito T. Nomura M. Hamada E. Tsujimoto Y. Matsuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34272-34277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The recent isolation of apoptosis-inducing factor may provide an additional mechanism for caspase-independent cell death induction by TAJ (43.Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. Penninger J. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 44.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M.

Apoptosis-inducing factor is a flavoprotein of approximately 57 kDa that is normally confined to mitochondrial intermembrane space but translocates to the nucleus when apoptosis is induced. Apoptosis-inducing factor can induce chromatin condensation in isolated nuclei, dissipation of mitochondrial Δψm, and exposure of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane. None of these effects are blocked by treatment with broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (43.Lorenzo H.K. Susin S.A. Penninger J. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 44.Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M.

We are currently testing the contribution of the above mediators to TAJ-induced cell death. The ligand for TAJ has not been identified yet. Recently, two novel ligands belonging to the TNF family, designated APRIL (45.Hahne M. Kataoka T. Schroter M. Hofmann K. Irmler M. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Bornand T. Holler N. French L.E. Sordat B.

Besides Blys/THANK, TAJ could also be a receptor for VEGI, another member of the tumor necrosis factor family for which receptor has not been identified.

https://openalex.org/W2046031000,"The pre-existence of α2→8-linked disialic acid (di-Sia) and oligosialic acid (oligo-Sia) structures with up to 7 Sia residues was shown to occur on a large number of brain glycoproteins, including neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAMs), by two highly sensitive chemical methods (Sato, C., Inoue, S., Matsuda, T., and Kitajima, K.

This unexpected finding was also confirmed using a newly developed antibody prepared using a copolymer of α2→8-linked N-acetylneuraminylp-vinylbenzylamide and acrylamide as an immunogen and known antibodies whose immunospecificities were determined to be di- and oligo-Sia residues with defined chain lengths. The major significance of the new finding that di- and oligo-Sia chains exist on a large number of brain glycoproteins is 2-fold. First, it reveals a surprising diversity in the number and M r of proteins distinct from N-CAM that are covalently modified by these short sialyl glycotopes. Second, it suggests that synthesis of di- and/or oligo-Sia units may be catalyzed by α2→8-sialyltransferase(s) that are distinct from the known polysialyltransferases, STX and PST, which are partially responsible for polysialylation of N-CAM.

These Sia residues are known to function in cell adhesion, differentiation, signal transduction, and surface expression of stage-specific developmental antigens (1.Kopitz J. Gabius H.J. Gabius S. Glycosciences. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 163-189Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the occurrence of such short sialyl oligomers on glycoproteins (2.Finne J.

(2.Finne J. Krusius T. Rauvala H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3.Finne J. Krusius T. Rauvala H. Hemminki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DiNeu5Ac and diNeu5Gc structures were later shown to be linked to a GalNAc residue onO-linked glycopeptides from chromogranins, a class of related acidic glycoproteins in chromaffin granules from bovine adrenal medulla (5.Kiang W.K. Krusius T. Finne J. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1651-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycopeptides from human erythrocyte glycophorin and umbilical cord erythrocyte Band 3 were also shown to contain diNeu5Ac residues on both O-linked and N-linked glycan chains, respectively (6.Fukuda M.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11952-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown, however, that di- and oligo-Sia-containing glycoproteins occur in fish ovarian fluid (8.Funakoshi Y. Taguchi T. Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and in various mammalian cells and tissues (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal.

We hypothesize that di- and oligo-Sia moieties on glycoproteins occur more frequently than recognized, and that these glycotopes may have similar important biological functions in common with those proposed for the gangliosides (1.Kopitz J. Gabius H.J. Gabius S. Glycosciences. Chapman and Hall, Weinheim, Germany1997: 163-189Google Scholar). In mammalian brains, neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAM) (12.Finne J. J. Biol.

Catterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are the only poly-Sia-containing glycoproteins thus far identified. The chain length or degree of polymerization (DP) of poly-Sia chains on the embryonic form of N-CAM on human neuroblastomas was shown to contain >55 Sia residues (15.Livingston B.D. Jacobs J.L. Glick M.C. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9443-9448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chain length of poly-Sia on N-CAM was shown to dramatically decrease in adult brain, although the precise DP of the oligo-Sia structures has not been determined. No other brain glycoproteins than N-CAM have been reported to contain di- and oligo-Sia structures. However, we have recently reported that di- and oligo-Sia structures are expressed on some glycoproteins in embryonic pig brain (10.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This finding led us to hypothesize that this novel modification may be more prevalent than previously recognized. To challenge this hypothesis, we initiated the present studies to search for di- and oligo-Sia structures in glycoproteins from embryonic and adult mammalian brains. For this purpose, we have developed two highly sensitive chemical methods to detect α2→8-linked di- and oligo-Sia structures in glycoproteins blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The first was the fluorometric C7/C9 method that can detect the presence of periodate oxidation-resistant internal Neu5Acyl residues in α2→8-linked di- and oligo-Neu5Acyl chains (10.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The second was the mild acid hydrolysis-fluorometric method in which di-Sia and oligo-Sia released from glycoproteins by mild acid treatment are detected after labeling with a fluorescent dye by fluorometric high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (16.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study we first analyzed glycoproteins from adult and embryonic pig brains for the presence of di- and oligo-Sia structures using these two methods, and showed that a surprisingly large number of glycoproteins contained these glycotopes, including N-CAM. To gain further insight into the nature of glycoproteins containing di- and oligo-Sia residues, immunochemical detection experiments were carried out using a series of antibodies that recognize di-, oligo-, and/or poly-Sia structures. Antibodies that specifically recognize the di- and oligo-Sia determinants are required to elucidate not only the occurrence, but also ultimately the function of these glycotopes in various biological processes. Over the last two decades a number of different antibodies that recognize the α2→8-linked poly-Sia glycotope have been developed (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol.

These studies used a series of lipid-linked homo-oligo/polymers of Neu5Ac as test antigens, and revealed that the antibodies had different immunospecificities since the minimum chain lengths required for antibody recognition were different. It will be productive in future studies to extend this approach because there remain many other anti-poly-Sia antibodies whose immunospecificities are unknown. Moreover, no antibody that recognizes short sialyl oligomers with DP 2–4 has been described. Because of the importance in determining chain length as it may relate to biological function, our present studies sought to develop a new monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for detecting the diNeu5Ac structure. For this purpose, we chemically synthesized a copolymer of α2→8-linked Neu5Ac p-vinylbenzylamide and acrylamide, and used this as an immunogen. We also screened the available anti-oligo/poly-Sia antibodies for their ability to recognize short oligo-Sia structures, and found that mAb.S2-566 specifically recognized Neu5Acα2→8Neu5Acα2→3Gal-, a structure hypothesized to be present on both N- and O-linked glycoproteins. Importantly, we have used two new anti-di-Sia antibodies, together with the known anti-oligo/poly-Sia antibodies, in Western blotting analysis of embryonic and adult pig and mouse brains. The results of these studies show an unexpectedly large diversity in the DP of oligo/poly-Sia chains that are expressed on adult and embryonic N-CAMs. Surprisingly, they also show the presence of pre-existing di- and oligo-Sia residues on a large number of brain-derived glycoproteins. To our knowledge this is the first description of the frequent occurrence of pre-existing di- and oligo-Sia residues in various brain glycoproteins, including N-CAM.

Embryonic and adult pig brains were purchased from Tokyo Shibaura Zouki, Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Pig embryo brains were obtained from pregnant pigs 1 or 2 weeks to 2 months before birth. Brains (100 g) were homogenized on ice in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl (PBS), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin in a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland). The homogenate was left on ice for 1 h before centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the BCA method.

Similar results were obtained with mAb. S2-566 and OL28 when pig embryonic and adult brain homogenates were prepared under both conditions. before SDS-PAGE (7.5% PAGE) and blotting on the PVDF membrane, as described previously (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Brain glycoproteins blotted on PVDF membranes were analyzed by the fluorometric C7/C9 method for internal sialyl residues after alkali treatment and chloroform/methanol (C/M) extraction, as described previously (10.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The internal Sia residues in α2→8-linked oligo/poly-Sia chains were determined after sequential periodate oxidation, borohydride reduction, and mild acid hydrolysis, following a modification of a procedure originally described by van Lenten and Ashwell (30.van Lenten L. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1889-1894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basis of the method was described in Ashwell et al. (31.Ashwell G. Berlin W.K. Gabriel O. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The only periodate-sensitive bonds in α2→8-linked oligo/poly-Sia chains are in the nonreducing termini (32.Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, after complete hydrolysis of the oxidized and reduced polymers by mild acid, the ratio between C7 and C9 reflects the DP. The C7 and C9 derivatives were quantitated by the fluorometric HPLC method after labeling with DMB (10.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Glycoproteins on the PVDF membrane were also analyzed by the mild acid hydrolysis-fluorometric method for the presence of di- and oligo-Sia residues (16.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This procedure involved the liberation of di- and oligo-Sia residues from the oligo/polysialylated glycoproteins on the PVDF membrane by mild acid, labeling of the liberated di-/oligo-Sia with DMB, and their quantitation by the fluorometric HPLC method. This method can thus determine the minimum DP of oligo-Sia on the glycoproteins. N-CAM was immunopurified from adult mouse brain homogenates with H.28-conjugated Affi-Gel-10, as described previously (33.Murray B.A. Jensen J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunopurified N-CAM was subjected to SDS-PAGE and the gel was blotted on the membrane as described above. The DP of the oligo-Sia chains on N-CAM was determined by the fluorometric C7/C9 method after blotting on a PVDF membrane, as described above. A copolymer ofp-vinylbenzylamide conjugated with Neu5Acα2→8 Neu5Ac and acrylamide in a 1:19 molar ratio, designated diNeu5Ac-PV, was prepared as described previously (34.Kobayashi K. Koshino R. Nishida Y. Polym. Prep. Jpn. 1996; 45: 2651-2652Google Scholar). In brief, the α2→8Neu5Ac dimer (0.25 mmol), kindly provided by Japan Insulators Co., was condensed withp-vinylbenzylamine (0.75 mmol) in the presence of the peptide coupling reagents, benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytris(dimethylamino)phophonium hexafluorophosphate (0.75 mmol; Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (0.75 mmol) in 2 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide. A carboxyl group at the reducing, but not non-reducing terminal Neu5Ac residue was shown to be involved in the amide linkage to an amino group ofp-vinylbenzylamine, and the anomeric configuration of the Neu5Ac residues was β, based on 300 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy (34.Kobayashi K. Koshino R. Nishida Y. Polym. Prep. Jpn. 1996; 45: 2651-2652Google Scholar). The resulting styrene monomer (50 mg, 0.07 mmol) was copolymerized with acrylamide (molar ratio, 0.05:0.95) using ammonium peroxodisulfate (0.035 mmol) and Temed (0.16 mmol) as initiators at 30 °C for 2 h. The solution was poured into methanol and the resulting precipitate dissolved in a small amount of water, and reprecipitated with methanol to give a white powder (57 mg, 38% yield). The M r of diNeu5Ac-PV was determined to be 7.8 × 104 by size exclusion chromatography using pullulan standards (34.Kobayashi K. Koshino R. Nishida Y. Polym. Prep. Jpn. 1996; 45: 2651-2652Google Scholar). The structure of diNeu5Ac-PV is shown in Structure FsI. Neu5Ac-PV was prepared by the same procedure (34.Kobayashi K. Koshino R. Nishida Y. Polym. Prep. Jpn. 1996; 45: 2651-2652Google Scholar). The solid phase ELISA method was carried out as described previously (27.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Seki T. Troy F.A., II Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18923-18928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the secondary antibody, 2 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM and IgG and 0.4 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated anti-horse IgM diluted with PBS containing 1% BSA, was used. All ELISA experiments were carried out in triplicate. NZB autoimmune mice (SLC, Japan) were immunized by intraveneous injections at days 0, 14, 28, and 33 with 5.0 μg (as Neu5Ac) of diNeu5Ac-PV noncovalently adsorbed to 50 μg of acid-treated Salmonella minnesota, as described previously (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On day 36, spleen cells (4.2 × 108) were fused with 5.6 × 107 P3-X63 Ag8.U1 (P3U1) mouse myeloma cells, and the hybridoma cells were screened for anti-oligo-Sia production by ELISA, using oligo/poly-Neu5Ac-PE as antigen. A monoclonal hybridoma cell line was obtained by repeated subclonings by the limiting dilution method (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and designated 1E6. The hybridoma cells were further cultured in a serum-free medium (Cos-001, Cosmobio, Japan) and the antibody was purified as described previously (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Periodate oxidation of α2→8-linked oligo/poly-Sia structures results in conversion of the nonreducing terminal Sia residue (C9) to the corresponding hepturosonic acid derivative (C7), as described above (10.Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 32.Rohr T.E. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2332-2342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the requirement for an intact nonreducing terminal Sia residue in antibody recognition could be evaluated by the ELISA method, using periodate-oxidized antigens. Wells of the microtiter plates were coated with each sample of oligo/poly-Sia-PE (31–125 ng as Sia/well) or GD3 (58 ng as ganglioside/well) by incubating at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing the wells with water, 100 μl of 2.5 mmsodium periodate in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) were added and incubated on ice in the dark for 3 h. The wells were washed three times with water before adding 100 μl of 0.2 m sodium borohydride in 0.1 m sodium borate buffer (pH 8.0), and incubation at 25 °C for 3 h. After washing with water, each well was blocked with 100 μl of 1% BSA in PBS and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Subsequent steps were carried out as described previously (27.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Seki T. Troy F.A., II Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18923-18928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and blotting on the PVDF membrane was carried out as described above. Immunoblotting with the different antibodies was carried out as described previously (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, the blotted membrane was washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and treated with 0.1 m NaOH at room temperature for 30 min. After washing three times with PBST, the membrane was treated first with C/M (2:1, v/v), then with C/M (1:2, v/v), both extractions being carried out for 15 min at room temperature. After C/M treatment, the PVDF membrane was soaked briefly with methanol. The blotted membranes were subjected to the alkali and C/M treatments before incubation with primary antibodies. After washing three times with PBST, the membrane was blocked with 1% BSA/PBST at 25 °C for 1 h and immunostained as described previously (9.Sato C. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2575-2582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To confirm that the bands detected on the PVDF membrane were specifically recognized by the different anti-di-, oligo-, and poly-Sia antibodies, the following control treatments of the membrane were carried out: (i) Endo-N treatment (20 milliunits/2 ml) in 1% BSA/PBST at 37 °C for 20 h after blocking; (ii) treatment with A. ureafacienssialidase (250 milliunits) and C. perfringens sialidase (400 milliunits) in 2.0 ml of 1% BSA/PBST at 37 °C for 20 h after blocking. To determine that the immunoreactive bands were expressed on glycoproteins and not glycolipids, the following experiments were carried out: (i) trypsin was used to treat the blotted m"

Although each of these steps has been intensively explored, little is known of how these processes are linked and what factors are involved. RNA-binding proteins, components of the hnRNP1 particles, may play such a role (1.Ladomery M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The formation of these particles is closely coupled to transcription. There are over 20 proteins that bind to pre-mRNA, which are collectively known as the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. These proteins are thought to promote formation of pre-mRNA secondary structure and can influence splice site selection. Some hnRNP proteins shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and potentially can influence mRNA export and translation. RNA-binding proteins not only associate with nascent pre-mRNA but also have been found to contact the basal transcriptional machinery and can directly bind to DNA regulatory elements within the promoter itself (reviewed in Ref. 2.Wolffe A.P. Meric F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent data suggest that components of hnRNPs may serve as a structural and/or functional link between RNA metabolism and nuclear architecture (3.Gohring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The hnRNP K protein, a component of the hnRNP particle, exhibits many of the functions described above. It has a wide tissue distribution and is detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm (4.Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). K protein contains both a classical bipartite-basic nuclear localization signal and the novel K nuclear shuttling domain that allow it to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm by utilization of one of the two pathways for nuclear entry (5.Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). K protein has a strong affinity for polypyrimidine-rich RNA and for single-stranded DNA. K protein is also known to interact with many proteins involved in several cellular processes. Because hnRNP K interacts with many protein kinases such as Src, protein kinases C, and the proto-oncogene vav (6.Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P.R. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

Van Seuningen I. Suzuki H. Denisenko O. Ostrowski J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). K protein may facilitate the ability of other factors to stimulate or repress transcription by recruiting gene-specific or general components of the transcription machinery to promoters, such as TBP, SP1, and the transcriptional repressor, Zik1 (10.Michelotti E.F.

In addition to its involvement in signal transduction and transcription, K protein may participate in the regulation of other nucleic acid-dependent processes. For example, binding of K protein to Eed (13.Denisenko O.N. Bomsztyk K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a putative silencer of homeotic genes, may reflect participation of hnRNP K in chromatin reorganization. K protein-mediated silencing of the lipoxygenase mRNA through the binding to the CU-rich 3′-untranslated region (14.Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M.B. Thiele J. Mann M. Hentze M.W.

To gain more insight into the mechanisms of K protein action, we performed two-hybrid screens using full-length hnRNP K as a bait. We identified several novel protein partners, including YB-1 transcription factor, splicing factors 9G8 and SRp20, DNA-methyltransferase, hnRNP L, and hnRNP U. In this work we describe the interaction between K protein and YB-1, another multifunctional protein. For two-hybrid analyses, cDNA encoding full-length K protein was inserted into multiple cloning sites of plasmid pGBT9, which expresses the Gal4 DNA binding domain (CLONTECH). In frame fusion was verified by sequencing using the DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems) and by in vitrotranscription/translation analysis. Two cDNA libraries were used in the two-hybrid screen. The mouse cDNA library was generated by random-primed cDNA synthesis from a 9–10-day-old mouse embryo (Dr. S. Hollenberg) and size-selected for inserts in the range of 350–700 nucleotides. This library was inserted into the transcription activation domain vector, pVP16, to generate VP16-cDNA hybrid proteins. The Jurkat cell cDNA library of Gal4AD-cDNA fusion for the two-hybrid screen was obtained fromCLONTECH. Construction of the GST·K mutants was described previously (6.Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J.

For the in vitro experiments the NotI fragment carrying full-length EFIA/YB-1 cDNA was subcloned into the NotI site of pBluescript II SK (Stratagene), and the resulting plasmid was denoted pSK-YB-1. To create the YB-1 C mutant, pSK-YB-1 was digested with SalI and religated. The NotI/SalI fragment was isolated and inserted into the NotI/SalI sites of pET28a. The 0.7-kilobase SalI fragment from pSK-YB-1 containing the N terminus of EFIA/YB-1 was subcloned into theSalI site of the pSK vector. This mutant was named YB-1 NI. The NII, cold shock domain (CSD), NIII, CI, and CII fragments were created by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pET28a vector (Fig. 5).

CT3wt-c-fos and CT3mut-c-fospromoter elements were cut out from pΔ56CT3wt and pΔ56CT3mut, respectively, and subcloned into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). All plasmids were purified using the QIAfilter Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Transformation of yeast cells was carried out by the method of Klebe et al. (16.Klebe R.J. Harris J.V. Sharp Z.D. Douglas M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were selected and cultivated on SD synthetic medium (2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) supplemented with essential amino acids and nucleotides. The yeast strain HF7C (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801, ade2–101, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, gal4–542, gal80–538, LYS2::GAL-HIS3, URA3::(GAL4 17-mers) 3-CYC1-LacZ) was used to perform primary screening. Histidine prototroph clones were assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay. Positive clones were then transformed into the yeast strain SFY526 (MATa, ura3–52, his3–200, ade2–101, lys2–801, trp1–901, leu2–3, 112, can r , gal4–542, gal80–538, URA3::GAL1-LacZ) and tested for β-galactosidase activity. β-galactosidase expression was detected either by qualitative determination using a filter lift assay (17.Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate or quantitatively byo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolysis measured photometrically at 420 nm upon permeabilization of cells (17.Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1987; 48: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity was normalized to cell culture density expressed as arbitrary units. GST·K and GST·TBP constructs were described previously (6.Van Seuningen I. Ostrowski J. Bustelo X.R. Sleath P.R. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol.

In vitro transcription and translation was performed using the TNT T7 Quick coupled transcription/translation system as per the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). 2.5 μl of the35S-labeled products were added to a suspension of 20 μl of glutathione or 10 μl of either poly(A), (C), (G), (U), or (I) beads in 100 μl of binding buffer (12.Denisenko O.N. O'Neil B. Ostrowski J. Van Seuningen I. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27701-27706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After mixing for 60 min (4 °C), the beads were washed three times with 400 μl of binding buffer and then boiled with 30 μl of SDS loading buffer; proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and detected by autoradiography. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 60- or 100-mm dishes and were transfected using SuperFect Transfection Reagent as per the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Either pRLnull plasmid (Promega) encoding Renillaluciferase or pSVgal plasmid (Promega) encoding β-galactosidase was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency. The same protocol was used to transfect NIH3T3 cells. Luciferase activity assay was performed according standard protocols (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using a Galacto-light plus chemiluminescent reporter assay system (Tropix). Cell extracts were prepared by a modified version of the method of Dignam et al. (18.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) as described previously (7.Schullery D.S. Ostrowski J. Denisenko O.N. Stempka L. Shnyreva M. Suzuki H. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15101-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using the DC method (Pierce). Transfected HeLa cells were grown for 48 h, and cell extracts were prepared as described above. Rabbit polyclonal anti-K protein antibody 54 was added to 500 μl of cell extract, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with low speed rotation. 20 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and ELB buffer (19.Sewalt R.G.A.B. van der Vlag J. Gunster M.J. Hamer K.M. den Blaauwen J.L. Satijn D.P.E. Hendrix T. van Driel R. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (250 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA) were added to a total volume of 1 ml. The mixture was rotated for another hour at 4 °C. The protein A/G beads were washed four times with 1 ml of ELB buffer, and the proteins were eluted by boiling in 30 μl 1× loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with monoclonal M2 anti-Flag antibodies (Sigma). The chemiluminescent detection was performed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents according to standard protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Although recent data indicate that hnRNP K protein is involved in many cellular processes, the mechanism of its action is largely unexplored. Thus the identification of new protein partners of K protein provides important information about its cellular function. We performed a two-hybrid screen with full-length K as a bait using two cDNA libraries. The Gal4BD·K fusion protein did not have transactivation activity by itself when expressed inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast strain HF7C expressing Gal4BD·K protein was transformed with 9–10-day-old mouse embryo or Jurkat cell cDNA library; transformants were selected as described under “Materials and Methods.” Putative positive clones were retransformed into SFY526 yeast strain and tested for the expression of β-galactosidase. False positives were excluded by their ability to activate transcription of His and lacZ reporter genes in the absence of the bait. Sequencing of twenty-one true positive clones from the mouse cDNA library identified several new protein partners of hnRNP K (Table I). Screening of the Jurkat cDNA library yielded two true positive clones encoding hnRNP L, a component of hnRNP, and the pre-mRNA splicing factor SRp 20. The interaction with splicing factors and hnRNP L suggests that K protein participates in the processing of pre-mRNA. Interaction with scaffold factors and DNA-methyltransferase may reflect the role of K protein in chromatin organization. Seven clones represented YB-1 cDNA with different lengths of insert and different strength of interaction with the bait (Fig. 1). We were particularly interested in YB-1 protein because it shares many functional similarities with hnRNP K and appears to be involved in many cellular processes.Table IIdentification of hnRNP K binding proteins by two-hybrid screenHnRNP K binding proteincDNA libraryHnRNP LJurkat cells/mouse embryoSRp20 pre-mRNA splicing factorJurkat cellsYB-1 transcription factormouse embryoScaffold attachment factor Bmouse embryoHnRNP U/scaffold attachment factor Amouse embryoDNA-methyltransferasemouse embryoRBM3 (putative RNA binding protein RNP L)mouse embryo9G8 splicing factormouse embryo Open table in a new tab To confirm the two-hybrid screen we examined whether YB-1 could interact with K protein in vitro. In these experiments we used the rat homologue of YB-1, EFIA. In vitro translated35S-labeled YB-1 was incubated with agarose beads bearing GST·K protein, as described previously (7.Schullery D.S. Ostrowski J. Denisenko O.N. Stempka L. Shnyreva M. Suzuki H. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15101-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After incubation, beads were washed three times with an excess of binding buffer and one time with the same buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were boiled in SDS loading buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. In agreement with the two-hybrid screen, a strong interaction between YB-1 and GST·K was observed in vitro (Fig.2 A, lane 2). In contrast to the mammalian K protein, the yeast homolog of hnRNP K, PBP2p (20.Delling U. Raymond M. Schurr E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not interact with YB-1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). Of note, the YB-1 family proteins are not represented in the yeast genome (confirmed by a search of the completed yeast genome sequence). For some RNA-binding proteins it is known that RNA mediates protein-protein interaction. For example, the primary steps of Sam68 dimerization require cellular RNA (21.Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because both K and YB-1 are known to be RNA-binding proteins, we next tested whether the interaction between these proteins can be mediated by RNA. We performed the binding experiments in the presence of RNase and found no change in the strength of binding of YB-1 to GST·K (data not shown). This indicates that YB-1 interacts with hnRNP K directly; however, the possibility that RNA regulates this interaction cannot be excluded. To test this possibility, the binding of 35S-labeled YB-1 to GST·K was performed in the presence of several homopolymeric RNAs, poly(A), (C), (G), (I), and (U) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). These experiments were carried out in two different ways. In one set of experiments, 35S-labeled YB-1 and GST·K beads were incubated in the presence of polynucleotides; in another set, GST·K beads were preincubated with polynucleotides for 30 min before 35S-labeled YB-1 was added to the reaction mixture. Identical results were obtained in both experiments. As shown in Fig.2 B (lane 1), poly(U) decreased the interaction of YB-1 with K protein, whereas the other polynucleotides did not alter this binding. When incubated under the same binding conditions, but without K protein, YB-1 was able to bind poly(U) and poly(G) beads (data not shown). Using a panel of GST·K deletion mutants, we next mapped the interaction region in hnRNP K responsible for binding to YB-1. As shown in Fig. 3, 35S-labeled YB-1 strongly interacted with GST·K13 (lane 6) and GST·K31 (lane 8), but no binding was detected with the other mutants. These data indicate that the interactive region is located between amino acids 240 and 337. This region, denoted KI, was previously found to be responsible for binding of other K protein partners such as protein kinase C δ, Zik1, and Eed (7.Schullery D.S. Ostrowski J. Denisenko O.N.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Levens and co-workers (10.Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) demonstrated the interaction between TBP and K in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to YB-1, we observed strong interaction of 35S-labeled TBP not only with GST·K31 and GST·K13 but also with GST·K7 (Fig.4, lanes 3, 6, and8) and moderate binding to GST·K10 (Fig. 4, lane 4) indicating that the only amino acids overlapping the strongest binding fragments are 318–337, but amino acids external to this region also impact TBP binding. To more precisely map the region of K protein responsible for binding to YB-1, we used GST·K protein mutants with deletions inside the KI region. Deletions of amino acids 322–337 and 288–321 abolished binding to 35S-labeled YB-1 (data not shown). Thus KI (amino acids 240–337) is the minimal region responsible for hnRNP K-YB-1 interaction. To map the interactive region in YB-1 that binds K protein, we created a series of deletion mutants (Fig.5 C). The in vitrobinding experiments were performed as described above. Surprisingly, we observed equally strong binding of both N-terminal and C-terminal parts of YB-1, indicating the presence of multiple interactive regions (Fig.5, A and B). The binding of NII polypeptide (amino acids 58–150), which includes the conservative RNA binding CSD followed by 26 amino acids, was as strong as that of the full-length YB-1 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7). As shown in Fig.5 A, the NIII polypeptide, containing 26 amino acids immediately downstream of the CSD, maintained a strong interaction with GST·K (Fig. 5 A, lane 9). No interaction was found with the “cold shock” domain (Fig. 5 A, lane 8). Fig. 5 B illustrates mapping of the second interactive region localized in the C terminus of YB-1. The CI polypeptide did not interact with GST·K protein (lane 11); however, the binding of the CII polypeptide containing the amino acids 271–320 was strong (lane 12). Thus the second interactive region responsible for binding to GST·K is located in the last 50 amino acids of the C terminus of YB-1 (amino acids 271–320). These results are in agreement with our two-hybrid system data. As shown in Fig. 1, the highest β-galactosidase activity was observed with clones 1 and 2, which contained residues located just downstream of the cold shock domain. Clone 5 had the part of the C-terminal interactive region resulting in an increase of β-galactosidase activity in comparison to clones 3 and 4, which are missing this C-terminal region. The middle part of YB-1 has been shown to be responsible for its multimerization and for binding to other protein partners of YB-1 (22.Tafuri S.R. Wolfe A.P. New Biol. 1991; 4: 349-359Google Scholar, 23.Safak M. Gallia G.L. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of two distinct interactive regions for K protein in YB-1 is a novel observation. Next, we examined whether TATA-binding protein, a known partner of hnRNP K, can interact with YB-1. As in the case of GST·K, the same NIII (amino acids 124–150) (Fig. 5 A, lane 6) and CII (amino acids 271–320) polypeptides (Fig. 5 B, lane 6) were responsible for the binding of YB-1 to TBP. Because the hnRNP K is highly expressed in HeLa cells, we tested whether endogenous K protein can interact with overexpressed Flag-tagged YB-1. HeLa cells were transfected with Flag- YB-1 construct. Cellular extracts were prepared and examined for the presence of K protein·YB-1 complex by co-immunoprecipitation with either pre-immune or anti-K serum followed by Western blotting with anti-Flag antibodies (as described under “Materials and Methods”). In cells transfected with Flag-YB-1 only immune anti-K serum precipitated Flag-YB-1 (Fig. 5, lane 4). Although expression levels of both hnRNP K (4.Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and Flag- YB-1 are high (lanes 7and 8), the magnitude of their detectable interaction appears to be lower than expected. This could be explained by the fact that both K protein and YB-1 have many other molecular partners. One of the functional similarities between hnRNP K and YB-1 is their high affinity binding to single-stranded polypyrimidine-rich sequences. K protein and YB-1 have been shown to interact with a C-rich DNA sequence, termed the CT element upstream of the c-myc gene (24.Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kolluri R. Torrey T.A. Kinniburgh A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpressed hnRNP K and TBP synergistically activated transcription of a CT element-dependent reporter gene in vivo (10.Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that the chicken homolog of YB-1 protein, chk-YB-1b, binds efficiently to the well conserved polypyrimidine tract found in α1(I) collagen gene promoter from rat, mouse, human, and chicken (26.Dhalla A.K. Ririe S.S. Swamynathan S.K. Weber K.T. Guntaka R.V. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus the promoters containing CT-rich elements could be an appropriate system to understand the significance of hnRNP-K-YB-1 interaction (Fig.7). Because hnRNP K and YB-1 exhibit transcriptional activities from the sequence CCCTCCCCA, known as the CT element of the humanc-myc gene (10.Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 24.Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Kolluri R. Torrey T.A. Kinniburgh A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we tested how the coexpression of K and YB-1 proteins affects the activity of a luciferase reporter gene. HeLa cells were transfected with hnRNP K and Flag-tagged YB-1 expression constructs and with a plasmid encoding the luciferase reporter gene driven by a synthetic promoter containing three repeats of the CT element of either wild-type CT3 or a mutated version, CT3mut, upstream of the minimal c-fos promoter described in Ref. 10.Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar. As shown in Fig. 7 A, hnRNP K alone did not have an effect on the luciferase expression level. Flag- YB-1 slightly activated transcription from the CT3 wild type promoter element but did not affect transcription from the promoter-containing mutated CT3 element. When both proteins were coexpressed in HeLa cells, the activation effect of YB-1 from the wild-type CT3 element was reduced. Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 cells (Fig.7 B). YB-1 activated transcription from the wild type promoter but not from the mutant. Interestingly, in this cell line hnRNP K also activated the CT element in a sequence-specific manner. The sequence-specific trans-activation effect of both K protein and YB-1 was reduced when both proteins were coexpressed. These transfection experiments show that hnRNP K and YB-1 are functionally linked. It should be noted, however, that both proteins had only a modest effect on the expression of the reporter gene. As mentioned above, K and YB-1 proteins are abundant, and the high level of the endogenous proteins may have blunted the reporter gene expression. In this paper we describe the interaction between K protein and YB-1. There are many indications that hnRNP K and YB-1 are functionally similar proteins. As described in the Introduction, K protein is involved in many steps of transcriptional regulation, interacting with general and sequence-specific transcription factors, and binding sequence-specific polypyrimidine-rich DNA motifs within promoter regions. It has been proposed that K protein acts as a scaffold or architectural transcription factor that promotes assembly of sequence-specific transcription factors and basal transcription machinery on the promoter elements (10.Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). YB-1 protein possesses similar functional properties. It has been shown to modulate transcription through binding single-stranded polypyrimidine-rich DNA sequences and by interacting with transcription factors (10.Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 11.Du Q. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27701-27706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Like K, protein YB-1, is known to be involved in repressing and activating transcription (11.Du Q. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19877-19883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 27.Swamynathan S.K. Nambiar A. Guntaka R.V. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). YB-1 is thought to activate transcription of human polyomavirus JC by recruiting another trans-activator (p65 or RelA) to the viral promoter (28.Raj G.V. Safak M. MacDonald G.H. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5944-5953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YB-1 can act on a single gene, the matrix metalloproteinase 2 gene, in a positive or negative manner that is dependent upon the cellular context (29.Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The reported transcriptional activity of YB-1 protein is strongly dependent on the intracellular environment. For example, the synergistic activity of YB-1 and Pur α proteins on the JCV enhancer-promoter region has been observed in glial cells but was not detected in other cell lines (23.Safak M. Gallia G.L. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transactivation properties of YB-1 on myosin light chain 2v gene promoter have been shown in cardiac myocytes, where the expression of YB-1 resulted in a 3.4 higher reporter gene activity in comparison to the control, but no activation was detected in COS-1 cells (30.Zou Y. Chien K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A moderate level of transcription activation of matrix metalloproteinase-2 promoter by YB-1 was observed in mesangial cells but not in glomerular epithelial cells (29.Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data and our transfection experiments (Fig. 7) clearly show that transcriptional activity of hnRNP K and YB-1 is cell type-dependent. Both proteins are likely acting as scaffolds or docking platforms for multiprotein complexes that include transcription factors. Acting as docking platforms, they may respond to changes in extracellular environment at sites of nucleic acid-dependent processes (7.Schullery D.S. Ostrowski J. Denisenko O.N. Stempka L. Shnyreva M. Suzuki H. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15101-15109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15.Ostrowski J. Schullery D.S. Denisenko O.N. Higaki Y. Watts J. Aebersold R. Stempka L. Gschwendt M. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3619-3628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both proteins have multiple interactive domains. K protein contains two different types of nucleic acid binding domains, the KH domains and the RGG cluster, and the KI region responsible for protein-protein interaction. The same is true for YB-1. Safak et al. (23.Safak M. Gallia G.L. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that YB-1 protein interacts through the region that includes the entire cold shock RNA binding domain with the transcription factor Pur α. Our data indicate that the N-terminal interactive domain (NIII) in YB-1 responsible for K protein binding overlaps with the Pur α binding region but does not include the cold shock domain. Moreover, the CII peptide, which has a strong affinity for hnRNP K and TBP (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6 and 12), does not bind Pur α (23.Safak M. Gallia G.L. Khalili K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that K and YB-1 proteins may simultaneously interact with more than one of their partners to form multiple protein or protein·nucleic acid complexes. It is further plausible that the interaction of YB-1-hnRNP K with one of their partners (nucleic acid and proteins) may serve to regulate the interaction with another partner. For example, as shown in Fig. 2 B (lane 1) the interaction with poly(U) abolished the binding of K to YB-1. When both YB-1 and hnRNP K proteins are coexpressed their transcriptional activity is reduced. HnRNP K and YB-1 interact in vitro with the general transcription factor TATA-binding protein (Figs. 4 and 5). It has been suggested that TBP-mediated activation of transcription can be regulated by a variety of gene-specific transcription factors (31.Wu S-Y. Kershnar E. Chiang C.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4478-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown previously, cotransfection of K protein and TBP resulted in activation of transcription from the CT-rich promoter element (10.Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Our preliminary findings indicate that coexpression of YB-1 and TBP has the same effect on the CT-rich promoter element. 2M. Shnyreva, D. S. Schullery, H. Suzuki, Y. Higaki, and K. Bomsztyk, unpublished data. In vitro data show that YB-1 binds K protein and TBP through the same domains (Fig. 5), suggesting that the two factors may compete for YB-1. We propose that gene-specific activation of transcription, particularly from the CT element containing promoters, may be activated by increasing concentration of either hnRNP K·TBP or YB-1·TBP complexes explaining the increased reporter gene expression when either K or YB-1 was transfected. Coexpression of K and YB-1 proteins may favor formation of K·YB-1 complexes, which might be transcriptionally inactive, accounting for the decreased reporter gene expression. A similar effect has been shown for Sp1 and C/EBP β transcription factors where the interaction with K protein abolished their trans-activation ability (11.Du Q. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19877-19883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32.Miau L.-H. Chang C.-J. Shen B.-J. Tsai W.-H. Lee S.-C. J. Biol.

Because both proteins are involved in many steps of gene expression such as transcription, translation, and nuclear transport it is plausible that these processes are regulated by the interaction of hnRNP K and YB-1. Future studies will be designed to address this issue."

Bach2 is an Nrf2-related transcription repressor and a tissue-specific partner of the Maf oncoprotein family. We show here how Bach2 is regulated by an oxidative stress-sensitive conditional nuclear export. In cultured cells, Bach2 was localized in cytoplasm through its C-terminal evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic localization signal (CLS). The CLS directed leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export of reporter proteins, suggesting its dependence on the nuclear exporter Crm1/exportin 1. However, the CLS sequence does not bear a resemblance to the leucine-rich class of nuclear export signal, and mutagenesis analysis indicated that a stretch of nonhydrophobic amino acids is essential for its activity. Oxidative stressors aborted the CLS activity and induced nuclear accumulation of Bach2. Whereas oxidative stress is known to activate MARE-dependent transcription, overexpression of Bach2 in cultured cells silenced the inducibility of MARE. The results suggest that Bach2 mediates nucleocytoplasmic communication to couple oxidative stress and transcription repression in mammalian cells.

To understand the mechanism by which cells transmit signals to nuclei in response to oxidative changes, it is important to identify specific regulatory targets of oxidative stress. In yeast, basic region-leucine zipper (bZip)1transcription factors yAP-1 and Pap1, which are related to the vertebrate activating protein-1 (AP-1), play key roles in the oxidative stress response inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, respectively (5.Gounalaki N.

However, the mechanism by which mammalian cells transmit signals to the nuclei in response to oxidative changes is largely unknown, because there are only a few specific regulatory targets of oxidative stress thus far identified. Among them are three well characterized transcription factors: NF-κB, AP-1, and the glucocorticoid receptor, whose activities are regulated by reduction-oxidation (redox) changes (11.Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 12.Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10363-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Another interesting example is the vertebrate bZip transcription factor Nrf2 (14.Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Analyses of Nrf2, yAP-1, and Pap1 have revealed the importance of translocation of the regulators between cytoplasm and the nucleus in response to oxidative stress. Nrf2 is essential for the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE)-mediated induction of phase II detoxifying and oxidative stress enzyme genes in mice (15.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). ARE is also known as an electrophile-responsive element (16.Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89 (372): 668Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The activity of Nrf2 is repressed by binding to the cytoplasmic inhibitory factor, Keap1 (17.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2657) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress liberates Nrf2 from Keap1, allowing Nrf2 to transverse to the nuclei and to activate ARE/MARE-dependent gene expression. Thus, the Keap1-Nrf2 complex is believed to constitute a cytoplasmic sensor system for oxidative stress (17.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2657) Google Scholar). In contrast, both yAP-1 and Pap1 activities are regulated by a conditional nuclear export. In addition to a nuclear localization signal (NLS), they contain a nuclear export signal (NES) at their C termini (18.Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19.Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), which resembles the leucine rich-class of NES (18.Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). yAP-1 and Pap1 interact with the nuclear export factor Crm1/exportin 1 through the NES and are exported from the nuclei under normal growth conditions. Upon oxidative stress, the NES-dependent nuclear export of yAP-1 and Pap1 is specifically inhibited, enabling them to accumulate in the nuclei and to execute an oxidative stress response (9.Toone W.M. Kuge S. Samuels M. Morgan B.A. Toda T. Jones N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18.Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol.

Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The presence of cysteine residues within the NES have been suggested to confer the oxidative stress sensitivity (18.Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20.Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Such a conditional nuclear export regulated by oxidative stress may be widespread in eukaryotes (18.Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, there is no known evidence among higher eukaryotes. The mammalian transcription factors Bach1 and Bach2 (22.Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) belong to the Cap'n'Collar (CNC)-related bZip family that also includes Nrf2 (14.Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc.

They form heterodimers with the Maf-related bZip proteins and thus bind to a Maf recognition element (MARE; Ref. 25.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which resembles the ARE (16.Friling R.S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similar specificity of the CNC-related factors in Maf interaction and DNA binding suggests that, besides Nrf2, some of them may be involved in the oxidative stress response as well. Expression of Bach2 is specific to neural tissues and B lymphoid cells (22.Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 28.Muto A. Hoshino H. Madisen L. Yanai N. Obinata M. Karasuyama H. Hayashi N. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. Groudine M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In these cells, Bach2 generates the major binding activity to MARE by dimerizing with a small Maf protein. To understand biological roles for Bach2, it is essential to place Bach2 within biological processes with known biochemical function. We report here that subcellular localization of Bach2 is regulated by a conditional nuclear export that is sensitive to oxidative stress. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that this regulation is operative through an evolutionarily conserved motif on Bach2. In contrast to Nrf2, Bach2 counteracted oxidative stress inducibility of MARE. The results suggest that Bach2 provides a simple mechanism that couples oxidative stress and transcription repression through MARE in mammalian cells. Bach2 expression plasmid (pCMVBach2F) was described previously (22.Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The Bach2 cDNA sequence lacking coding domain for the C-terminal 97 amino acid residues was isolated as aBamHI/HpaI fragment from Bach2J/F cDNA and was inserted into the SmaI site of pCMV/KM, resulting in pCMVBach2ΔC1. A stop codon was inserted into the Bach2J/F cDNA so that the most C-terminal 21 amino acid residues were deleted using PCR. The mutagenic PCR primer was 5′-ctacaccgtcacagactggctcct-3′ (the stop codon is underlined). The resulting PCR product was inserted into pGEM-T (Promega) and sequenced to confirm the mutation. The resulting mutated cDNA was isolated byXbaI/EcoRV digestion and inserted into theSmaI site of pCMV/KM. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion plasmids were constructed as follows. EcoRI 3.1-kilobase pair DNA was isolated from pBSBach2J/F and was inserted into theEcoRI site of pEGFPC1 (CLONTECH), resulting in pEGFPBach2 that encoded a fusion protein of EGFP and Bach2 (from amino acid residue 148 to 839). A 2.6-kilobase pairEcoRI DNA from the pCMVBach2ΔC2 was also inserted into theEcoRI site of pEGFPC2, resulting in pEGFPBach2ΔC2 that encoded a fusion protein of EGFP and a portion of Bach2 (residues 148–818). Fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) and GFP were constructed as follows. First, a 0.8-kilobase pair HpaI DNA fragment was isolated from pBSJ/F and inserted in the BamHI site of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) after blunting the DNA ends, resulting in a fusion of GAL4 DBD and the C-terminal 97 amino acid residues of Bach2 (pGBTB2C). Similarly, a 0.7-kilobase pairHpaI–EcoRI DNA fragment was isolated from pCMVBach2ΔC2 and inserted in the BamHI site of pGBT9, resulting in a fusion of GAL4 DBD and the C-terminal 76 amino acid residues of Bach2 (pGBTB2CΔC2). The GAL4 DBD and its fusion DNAs were isolated by PCR, digested with KpnI, and inserted into theKpnI site of pEGFPC2. Primers for the PCRs were 5′-ttttggtaccatgaagctactgtcttct-3′ (the initiation methionine for GAL4 is underlined) and 5′-ttttggtacccccggaattagcttggct-3′. The resulting plasmids were pEGFPG4, pEGFPG4B2C, and pEGFPG4B2CΔC2 and encoded EGFP fused to GAL4 DBD, GAL4 DBD/Bach2 (residues 743–839), and GAL4 DBD/Bach2ΔC2 (residues 743–818), respectively. To construct a fusion of GFP and Bach2 cytoplasmic localizaton signal (CLS), the C-terminal coding domain (amino acids 769–839) was amplified by PCR. The 5′ primer was 5′-ttatttctgcagagccaggggcggc-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-ttatttggatccctaggcataatct-3′. The PCR product was digested with PstI and BamHI and ligated withPstI/BamHI-digested pEGFPC1, resulting in pEGFP-CLS. Single amino acid substitution mutations were generated on pBSBach2J/F by a site-directed mutagenesis system (CLONTECH) using mutagenic oligonucleotide primers. The primers were as follows: D818A, 5′-cagtctgtgacggtggccttctgccaggaaatg-3′; F819A, 5′-tctgtgacggtggacgcctgccaggaaatgact-3′; C820A, 5′-gtgacggtggacttcgcccaggaaatggctgag-3′; M823A, 5′-gacttctgccaggaagcgactgagaagtgtaca-3′; K826A, 5′-caggaaatgactgaggcgtgtacaacggacgaa-3′; C827A, 5′-gactgagaaggccacaacggacga-3′; T828A, 5′-atgactgagaagtgtgcaacggacgaacagccc-3′; D830A, 5′-gagaagtgtacaacggccgaacagcccaggaaa-3′; E831A, 5′-aagtgtacaacggacgcacagcccaggaaagat-3′ (mutations are underlined). The resulting mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. EcoRI DNA fragments encoding amino acids 148–839 with the mutations were inserted into the EcoRI site of pEGFPC1, resulting in GFP fusion expression plasmids. pXHC1 for cytomegalovirus promoter-directed expression of wild-type human CRM1 was constructed in pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) by replacing the GFP open reading frame with the CRM1 open reading frame. pXHCK1 for LMB-resistant human CRM1 containing an amino acid replacement at Cys-528 with Ser, the human equivalent of the LMB-resistant fission yeast Crm1-K1 (29.Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), was constructed based on pXHC1 using PCR-mediated mutagenesis with primers 5′-gatctattaggattatctgaacagaaaagaggc-3′ and 5′-gcctcttttctgttcagataatcctaatagatc-3′ (mutations are underlined). QT-6 cells were transfected with the Bach2 expression plasmids and cultured for 24–36 h. The cells were fixed with methanol and blocked in 2% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were reacted for 1 h at room temperature with the anti-Bach2 antiserum (22.Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) and then with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After washing, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO). The cells were then examined by fluorescence microscopy. MNS-8 cells (30.Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 153-168Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were maintained in a medium containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 nutrients supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. MNS-8 cells or QT-6 cells were transfected with the GFP fusion expression plasmids and cultured for 36 h. Subcellular localizaion of GFP fusion proteins was examined using a fluorescence microscopy without fixation or with fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. To examine effects of reagents, transfected cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of leptomycin B or 1–2 mm of diethyl maleate (Sigma) for the indicated periods at the end of incubation. QT-6 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes 24 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with the reporter and effector plasmids by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (23.Itoh K. Igarashi K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4184-4193Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). After incubating cells with the DNA precipitate for 8 h, cells were washed in PBS and fed with fresh medium with or without 166 μm of diethyl maleate (Wako). Preparation of cell lysates were performed with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) following the supplier's protocol. Luciferase activities were measured with a Biolumat Luminometer (Berthold). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency as determined by a control sea pansy luciferase activity (28.Muto A. Hoshino H. Madisen L. Yanai N. Obinata M. Karasuyama H. Hayashi N. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. Groudine M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments, each carried out in duplicate, were performed, and the results were averaged and diagrammed with the S.E. values. During analysis of subcellular localization of Bach2, we noticed that Bach2 localized in the cytoplasmic region and was excluded from the nuclear compartment within transfected cells (see Fig.1 B). The accumulation of Bach2 within cytoplasm suggests that the nuclear localization of this transcription factor might be negatively regulated. To test this hypothesis, we first examined subcellular localization of Bach2 and its derivatives using antibody staining after transfecting expression plasmids into quail fibroblast QT-6 cells. The wild-type Bach2 protein was localized in the cytoplasmic region and often excluded from the nuclei (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, Bach2 appeared to contain a domain that inhibits nuclear accumulation. There are three conserved regions between Bach1 and Bach2, i.e. the BTB domain, the bZip domain, and the most C-terminal region (Fig.1 A). Because no function has been assigned to the C-terminal region, we examined its possible involvement in the cytoplasmic localization of Bach2. Bach2ΔC1 lacked the C-terminal 97 amino acid residues, whereas Bach2ΔC2 lacked the conserved C-terminal 21 amino acid residues (Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, the C-terminal deletions led to accumulation of Bach2 within the nucleus in almost every transfected cell (Fig. 1, C and D). Virtually no signal was detected in the cytoplasmic region of transfected cells. Quantitative analyses of subcellular localization of Bach2 and its derivatives are shown in Fig. 1 E and clearly indicate an important role for the C-terminal region in determining subcellular localization. Bach2 expression is specific to neural tissues and B lymphoid cells (22.Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 28.Muto A. Hoshino H. Madisen L. Yanai N. Obinata M. Karasuyama H. Hayashi N. Nakauchi H. Yamamoto M. Groudine M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To assess the function of the C-terminal region of Bach2 in living neural cells, we fused GFP and a portion of Bach2 with and without the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues (Fig.2 A, GFP-Bach2 and GFP- Bach2ΔC2, respectively). Upon examining their distribution in living MNS8 neural stem cells (30.Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 153-168Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), these GFP fusion proteins showed essentially the similar distribution as described above (Fig.2 B); the GFP-Bach2 fusion protein mainly localized in the cytoplasm and was often excluded from the nuclei, whereas the GFP-Bach2ΔC2 fusion protein localized exclusively in the nuclei. We hypothesized that the nuclear localization of GFP-Bach2 ΔC2 was directed by the basic region of Bach2, because basic regions of various bZip factors are known to function as an NLS as well. Indeed, the basic region of Bach2 functioned as an NLS when fused to GFP (data not shown). The C-terminal region of Bach2 may inhibit nuclear localization of Bach2 by masking its NLS. In this case, the C-terminal region would function only in a specific protein context (i.e. on Bach2). To examine whether the C-terminal region is functional in a different protein context, we utilized a fusion protein of GFP and the DNA binding domain of yeast GAL4 (GG4) and its derivatives (Fig.2 A). When expressed in QT-6 cells, GG4 accumulated within nuclei, indicating that the GAL4 nuclear localization signal is functional in QT-6 cells (Fig. 2, C and D). This nuclear accumulation was inhibited significantly by further fusing the C-terminal 97 amino acid residues of Bach2 that were missing in Bach2ΔC1 (GG4B2C; Fig. 2, C and D, and see Fig.1 A). A deletion of the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues (similar to that in Bach2ΔC2) eliminated the nuclear exclusion of the fusion reporter protein (GG4B2CΔC2; Fig. 2, C andD). Thus, the C-terminal region can impart cytoplasmic localization to a heterologous nuclear protein. Based on these observations, we conclude that the subcellular localization of Bach2 is regulated by two components; one is the NLS within the basic region, and the other is the C-terminal region that autonomously directs the cytoplasmic localization of Bach2. We refer to the C-terminal region as CLS. A homology search of data bases with the CLS sequence revealed no other protein with this motif except Bach1 and Bach2. The steady state nuclear accumulation of Bach2 could be regulated by either a conditional nuclear import or export. To distinguish these two possibilities, we examined the effect of leptomycin B (LMB). LMB binds to the nuclear export carrier protein Crm1/exportin 1 and inhibits NES-dependent protein export (29.Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M.

QT-6 cells were transfected with the GFP-Bach2 fusion protein expression plasmid and then treated with LMB. As shown in Fig.3, LMB induced rapid and efficient accumulation of GFP-Bach2 fusion protein within the nuclei. Similar results were obtained when the nonfusion, wild-type Bach2 was expressed and detected with an antibody (data not shown). The results indicate that Bach2 is normally exported from the nuclei through a LMB-sensitive export pathway. Since CLS of Bach2 was essential to impart cytoplasmic localization onto the heterologous reporter protein (Fig. 2), we conclude that CLS is responsible for the nuclear export of Bach2 (see below). Because Bach2 functions as a transcription regulator (22.Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), the nuclear exclusion of Bach2 appeared conditional. Considering the fact that Nrf2 and MARE are involved in oxidative stress response (15.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar,17.Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2657) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of oxidative stressor diethylmaleate (DEM) on subcellular localization of the GFP-Bach2 reporter protein. As shown in Fig. 3 C, DEM induced efficient nuclear accumulation of GFP-Bach2 in QT-6 cells. This nuclear accumulation was very rapid and was evident within 30 min after treatment with DEM. Within 1 h, almost every transfected cell accumulated GFP-Bach2 fusion protein within the nucleus and gave virtually no signal in the cytoplasmic region. Other reagents like dibutyryl cAMP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and ionomycin did not show any effect on the cytoplasmic localization of GFP-Bach2 (data not shown). The results indicate that nuclear accumulation of Bach2 is induced by oxidative stress. DEM may abolish cytoplasmic localization of Bach2 by either stimulating the nuclear import or inhibiting the nuclear export. To address this issue, we developed an assay system to monitor nuclear export activity of CLS independent of NLS activity. In this system, we used GFP as a reporter protein that localizes in both cytoplasm and nuclei due to a passive diffusion through nuclear pores. GFP was fused with the C-terminal 70-amino acid residue of Bach2, including CLS (GFP-CLS, Fig.4 A). Nonfusion GFP was distributed in both nuclei as well as cytoplasm (data not shown), whereas the GFP-CLS reporter protein showed efficient nuclear exclusion (Fig. 4, B–D, time points 0). Time-lapse observation of transfected cells revealed that GFP-CLS redistributed in nuclei upon treatment with LMB (Fig. 4 B). Nuclear accumulation was evident by 10 min after LMB treatment and completed by 20 min. These observations verified that the GFP-CLS fusion protein allows monitoring of nuclear export activity of CLS in living cells. Using this system, we examined the effect of DEM on the nuclear export activity of CLS. Time-lapse observations of the living transfected cells indicated that DEM induced rapid nuclear accumulation of GFP-CLS (Fig. 4 C). Treatment of transfected cells with hydrogen peroxide also induced rapid nuclear accumulation of GFP-CLS (Fig.4 D). GFP-CLS did not show nuclear accumulation upon mock treatment (Fig. 4 E). Thus, we conclude that the nuclear export mediated by Bach2 CLS is inhibited under oxidative stress conditions. Because a typical leucine-rich class of NES is not sensitive to oxidative stress in mammalian cells (18.Kudo N. Taoka H. Toda T. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15151-15158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the results suggest that Bach2 CLS directs mechanistically distinct nuclear exports. One of the hallmarks of oxidative stress-sensitive NES of yAP-1 and Pap1 is that, in addition to the clusters of essential hydrophobic amino acids that are reminiscent of the typical NES, they contain juxtaposing essential Cys residues (18.Kudo N.

It is initiated by activation and translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, which catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid (AA)1 from membrane phospholipids. The free AA enters the substrate channel of prostaglandin H synthase-1 (PGHS-1, also known as cyclooxygenase-1) or PGHS-2, where it is converted to prostaglandin G2 by the cyclooxygenase activity, and PGG2 is further converted to PGH2 by the peroxidase activity of PGHS enzymes (1.Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. DeWitt D.L. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). PGH2 is the common precursor for prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin (PGI2). PGI2 is synthesized from PGH2 by a specific enzyme, PGI2 synthase (PGIS) (2.Moncada S. Vane J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1979; 30: 293-331Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of PGI2and other prostanoids is regulated at each enzymatic step by multiple mechanisms including enzyme autoinactivation, induction of enzyme transcription, and post-translational modification. Recent studies suggest that their synthesis could be further influenced by subcellular localization of these synthetic enzymes. The subcellular locations of a few of these enzymes have been determined. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 has been reported to localize to the perinuclear region and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (3.Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 have been reported also to be localized to perinuclear area and ER, suggesting a possible colocalization of cytosolic phospholipase A2 with PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 (4.Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). PGIS was previously reported to be localized to plasma and nuclear membranes (5.Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Allen M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5922-5926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that PGI synthase, like its related cytochrome P450 proteins, is localized to ER (6.Lin Y-Z. Wu K.K. Ruan K-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether it is colocalized with PGHS-1 and/or PGHS-2. Since PGI2 is a key molecule in vasoprotection and vascular tone control and PGIS occupies a pivotal position in its synthesis, it is crucial to know its subcellular localization and important to determine whether it is colocalized with its upstream enzymes. To this end, we have determined colocalization of PGIS with PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and a human endothelial cell line, ECV304, by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. The influence of colocalization or lack of it on prostacyclin synthesis has also been evaluated by HPLC. The results indicate that colocalization of PGIS with PGHS-1 or PGHS-2 to ER is crucial for prostacyclin synthesis. Lack of colocalization leads to failed prostacyclin production.DISCUSSIONProstacyclin synthase, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells (10.Hara S.

Cell Res. 1995; 219: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PGIS anchors to the ER membrane by a single transmembrane domain located at its N-terminal region, with the enzyme mass located at the cytosolic side of the membrane (6.Lin Y-Z. Wu K.K. Ruan K-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide new information by confocal analysis that PGIS is localized not only on the ER but also at the perinuclear region including NE. Given the recent observation that cytochrome P450 is mobile in ER (13.Szczesna-Skopura E. Chen C-D. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the NE location of PGIS may be an extension of that from ER. It is expected that the membrane anchoring topology of PGIS in NE will be similar to that in ER. The present study has also shown colocalization of PGIS with PGHS-1. Since PGHS-1 is located within the ER and probably also within the lumen of NE through hydrophobic interaction (14.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), colocalization of these two enzymes implies a close physical relationship on the membrane of ER and NE. This would facilitate the transfer of PGH2 generated by PGHS-1 associated with the inner membrane of the lumen to enter PGIS facing the opposite side of the membrane.We previously reported that retrovirus-mediated and adenovirus-mediated transfer of PGHS-1 cDNA into human endothelial cells increased PGHS-1 levels to be in large excess of PGIS (8.Zoldhelyi P.

This resulted in augmentation of not only prostacyclin but also PGE2 and other prostanoid synthesis (8.Zoldhelyi P. McNatt J. Xu X-M. Loose-Mitchell D. Meidell R.S. Clubb F.J. Buja L.M.

We have recently evaluated the influence of the ratio of PGHS-1 to PGIS overexpression as conferred by co-transfer of different m.o.i. values of Ad-PGHS-1 and Ad-PGIS on the PGI2 synthesis. The results show that when the m.o.i. ratio of co-transfected Ad-PGHS-1 to Ad-PGIS is approximately 1–2:1, the 6-keto-PGF1α level was singularly augmented while the level of other prostanoids became undetectable.2 These metabolic data together with our confocal results further support coupling of PGHS-1 with PGIS.Our report of PGIS and PGHS-1 colocalization to NE and ER and the previous separate reports of similar subcellular locations of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (3.Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and PGHS-1 (4.Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) lead to a plausible conclusion that all three PGI2 synthetic enzymes are colocalized to NE and ER. It is generally believed that PGI2 and other prostanoids produced in ER are secreted into the extracellular milieu to act as an autacoid. The fate and the role of PGI2 and other prostaglandins generated in NE are less clear. There is an emerging theory that the nuclear membrane may transmit distinct signals to nucleus (16.Malviya A.N. Rogue P.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17.Baldassare J.J. Jarpe M.B. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PGI2 and prostanoids produced in NE may thus serve as signaling molecules for nuclear function. This notion is supported by the demonstration of functional PGE2 receptors on nuclear membrane (18.Bhattacharya M. Peri K.G. Almazan G. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Shichi H. Durocher Y. Abramovitz M. Hou X. Varma D.R. Chemtob S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15792-15797Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19.Bhattacharya M. Peri K. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Almazan G. Shichi H. Hou X. Varma D.R. Chemtob S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15719-15724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is important to investigate whether the PGI2 receptor is expressed on nuclear membrane and whether it transmits signals to nucleus for distinct functions.Our findings of ER and nuclear locations of PGHS-2 in serum-treated BAEC are in agreement with a previous report (4.Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Our results further reveal colocalization of PGHS-2 with PGIS in BAEC cultured in the presence of 10% FBS. Thus, under this culture condition, PGHS-2 has a similar relationship with PGIS as PGHS-1. This relationship is retained when PGHS-2 is overexpressed by transgenes but is drastically altered when cells are stimulated by PMA. PMA causes transport of PGHS-2 out of ER into vesicle-like structures (20.Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The nature of these vesicles remains to be determined. Recent studies suggest that caveolins are key proteins in cytosolic vesicle formation (21.Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 22.Li S. Sorg K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether PMA-induced dot-like structures contain caveolins and whether PGHS-2 interacts directly with caveolins in the vesicles. Work is now in progress in our laboratory to address these important questions. Work is also in progress to determine whether interleukin-1 stimulation also induces PGHS-2 localization in cytosolic vesicles in endothelial cells. Given the recent discovery of diverse pathophysiological roles of PGHS-2, it is conceivable that PGHS-2 compartmentalization may contribute significantly to its diverse activities. Characterization of its subcellular localization and its interacting enzymes under various pathophysiological stimuli will shed further light on the mechanisms by which it triggers these pathophysiological processes.The unusual location of PGHS-2 and a lack of colocalization with PGIS in PMA-treated cells versus the “native” colocalization of PGHS-2 and PGIS in serum-treated or Ad-cyclooxygenase-2-infected cells significantly influence prostacyclin synthesis. The high passage BAECs used in our experiments express PGHS-2 and produce a considerable amount of prostacyclin when cultured in the presence of 10% FBS. Prostacyclin synthesis was not augmented by PMA. By contrast, overexpressed PGHS-2 by transgenes augments PGI2 synthesis. These results further support the importance of colocalization and coupling of prostanoid synthetic enzymes. HPLC analysis failed to detect appreciable amounts of other eicosanoids in PMA-treated cells. It is possible that PGHS-2 is catalytically inactive when localized to the vesicles. An alternative explanation is that uncoupling of PGHS-2 from other synthetic enzymes disrupts the transfer of substrates for PGI2 synthesis. To our knowledge, localization of PGHS-2 to cytosolic vesicles has not been previously reported. It should be interesting to determine the catalytic activity of these enzymes and their pathophysiological implications.ECV304 cells used in our experiments retained a key feature of endothelial cells, i.e. expression of von Willebrand factor. However, they did not express detectable PGHS-1 or PGIS proteins nor did they synthesize PGI2. This is attributable to abnormal subcellular locations of PGHS-1 and PGIS. Both enzymes are colocalized to a filamentous structure not containing actin or vimentin and are tightly associated with the filaments rendering them not solubilized by lysis buffer for protein blotting. It is possible that both proteins undergo erroneous post-translational modifications which lead to their transport to an aberrant destination in the cell. This assumption is probably unlikely since overexpressed PGHS-1 and PGIS by adenovirus-mediated transfer have normal subcellular locations as well as normal functional capacity. If abnormal post-translational modification were to be the culprit, overexpressed proteins would be expected to have a similar fate. The abnormal locations of these two enzymes in native cells could be due to a common genetic defect which causes an abnormal trafficking of these proteins. The transgenes, on the other hand, would not have such defect and, therefore the encoded proteins would have normal subcellular locations. ECV304 cells will be valuable for unraveling the intracellular trafficking of these two enzymes.In conclusion, constitutively expressed and transgenically overexpressed PGIS is colocalized with PGHS-1 at nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum of cultured endothelial cells and this innate colocalization property is critical for synthesis of physiologically important prostacyclin and other prostanoids. PGIS is also colocalized with PGHS-2 in serum-treated and transgenic overexpressed PGIS. By contrast, PGIS is not colocalized with PGHS-2 induced by PMA, resulting in an altered prostanoid synthetic profile, which may contribute to the diverse pathophysiological roles of PGHS-2. These findings underscore the importance of appropriate colocalization and possible coupling of synthetic enzymes in regulating prostanoid biosynthesis. Prostaglandin biosynthesis is catalyzed by a series of enzymes. It is initiated by activation and translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, which catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid (AA)1 from membrane phospholipids.

The results show that when the m.o.i. ratio of co-transfected Ad-PGHS-1 to Ad-PGIS is approximately 1–2:1, the 6-keto-PGF1α level was singularly augmented while the level of other prostanoids became undetectable.2 These metabolic data together with our confocal results further support coupling of PGHS-1 with PGIS.Our report of PGIS and PGHS-1 colocalization to NE and ER and the previous separate reports of similar subcellular locations of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (3.Schievella A.R. Regier M.K. Smith W.L. Lin L-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30749-30754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and PGHS-1 (4.Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) lead to a plausible conclusion that all three PGI2 synthetic enzymes are colocalized to NE and ER. It is generally believed that PGI2 and other prostanoids produced in ER are secreted into the extracellular milieu to act as an autacoid. The fate and the role of PGI2 and other prostaglandins generated in NE are less clear. There is an emerging theory that the nuclear membrane may transmit distinct signals to nucleus (16.Malviya A.N. Rogue P.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 17.Baldassare J.J. Jarpe M.B. Alferes L. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4911-4914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). PGI2 and prostanoids produced in NE may thus serve as signaling molecules for nuclear function. This notion is supported by the demonstration of functional PGE2 receptors on nuclear membrane (18.Bhattacharya M. Peri K.G. Almazan G. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Shichi H. Durocher Y. Abramovitz M. Hou X.

Varma D.R. Chemtob S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15719-15724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is important to investigate whether the PGI2 receptor is expressed on nuclear membrane and whether it transmits signals to nucleus for distinct functions.Our findings of ER and nuclear locations of PGHS-2 in serum-treated BAEC are in agreement with a previous report (4.Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Our results further reveal colocalization of PGHS-2 with PGIS in BAEC cultured in the presence of 10% FBS. Thus, under this culture condition, PGHS-2 has a similar relationship with PGIS as PGHS-1. This relationship is retained when PGHS-2 is overexpressed by transgenes but is drastically altered when cells are stimulated by PMA. PMA causes transport of PGHS-2 out of ER into vesicle-like structures (20.Luetterforst R. Stang E. Zorzi N. Carozzi A. Way M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1443-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The nature of these vesicles remains to be determined. Recent studies suggest that caveolins are key proteins in cytosolic vesicle formation (21.Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 22.Li S. Sorg K.S. Koh S.S. Kikuchi A. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28647-28654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether PMA-induced dot-like structures contain caveolins and whether PGHS-2 interacts directly with caveolins in the vesicles. Work is now in progress in our laboratory to address these important questions. Work is also in progress to determine whether interleukin-1 stimulation also induces PGHS-2 localization in cytosolic vesicles in endothelial cells. Given the recent discovery of diverse pathophysiological roles of PGHS-2, it is conceivable that PGHS-2 compartmentalization may contribute significantly to its diverse activities. Characterization of its subcellular localization and its interacting enzymes under various pathophysiological stimuli will shed further light on the mechanisms by which it triggers these pathophysiological processes.The unusual location of PGHS-2 and a lack of colocalization with PGIS in PMA-treated cells versus the “native” colocalization of PGHS-2 and PGIS in serum-treated or Ad-cyclooxygenase-2-infected cells significantly influence prostacyclin synthesis. The high passage BAECs used in our experiments express PGHS-2 and produce a considerable amount of prostacyclin when cultured in the presence of 10% FBS. Prostacyclin synthesis was not augmented by PMA. By contrast, overexpressed PGHS-2 by transgenes augments PGI2 synthesis. These results further support the importance of colocalization and coupling of prostanoid synthetic enzymes. HPLC analysis failed to detect appreciable amounts of other eicosanoids in PMA-treated cells. It is possible that PGHS-2 is catalytically inactive when localized to the vesicles. An alternative explanation is that uncoupling of PGHS-2 from other synthetic enzymes disrupts the transfer of substrates for PGI2 synthesis. To our knowledge, localization of PGHS-2 to cytosolic vesicles has not been previously reported. It should be interesting to determine the catalytic activity of these enzymes and their pathophysiological implications.ECV304 cells used in our experiments retained a key feature of endothelial cells, i.e. expression of von Willebrand factor. However, they did not express detectable PGHS-1 or PGIS proteins nor did they synthesize PGI2. This is attributable to abnormal subcellular locations of PGHS-1 and PGIS. Both enzymes are colocalized to a filamentous structure not containing actin or vimentin and are tightly associated with the filaments rendering them not solubilized by lysis buffer for protein blotting. It is possible that both proteins undergo erroneous post-translational modifications which lead to their transport to an aberrant destination in the cell. This assumption is probably unlikely since overexpressed PGHS-1 and PGIS by adenovirus-mediated transfer have normal subcellular locations as well as normal functional capacity. If abnormal post-translational modification were to be the culprit, overexpressed proteins would be expected to have a similar fate. The abnormal locations of these two enzymes in native cells could be due to a common genetic defect which causes an abnormal trafficking of these proteins. The transgenes, on the other hand, would not have such defect and, therefore the encoded proteins would have normal subcellular locations. ECV304 cells will be valuable for unraveling the intracellular trafficking of these two enzymes.In conclusion, constitutively expressed and transgenically overexpressed PGIS is colocalized with PGHS-1 at nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum of cultured endothelial cells and this innate colocalization property is critical for synthesis of physiologically important prostacyclin and other prostanoids. PGIS is also colocalized with PGHS-2 in serum-treated and transgenic overexpressed PGIS. By contrast, PGIS is not colocalized with PGHS-2 induced by PMA, resulting in an altered prostanoid synthetic profile, which may contribute to the diverse pathophysiological roles of PGHS-2. These findings underscore the importance of appropriate colocalization and possible coupling of synthetic enzymes in regulating prostanoid biosynthesis. Prostacyclin synthase, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is constitutively expressed in endothelial cells (10.Hara S. Miyata A. Yokoyama C. Inoue H. Brugger R. Lottspeich F. Ullrich V.

Cell Res. 1995; 219: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PGIS anchors to the ER membrane by a single transmembrane domain located at its N-terminal region, with the enzyme mass located at the cytosolic side of the membrane (6.Lin Y-Z. Wu K.K. Ruan K-H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 352: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide new information by confocal analysis that PGIS is localized not only on the ER but also at the perinuclear region including NE. Given the recent observation that cytochrome P450 is mobile in ER (13.Szczesna-Skopura E. Chen C-D. Rogers S. Kemper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14793-14798Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the NE location of PGIS may be an extension of that from ER. It is expected that the membrane anchoring topology of PGIS in NE will be similar to that in ER. The present study has also shown colocalization of PGIS with PGHS-1. Since PGHS-1 is located within the ER and probably also within the lumen of NE through hydrophobic interaction (14.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), colocalization of these two enzymes implies a close physical relationship on the membrane of ER and NE. This would facilitate the transfer of PGH2 generated by PGHS-1 associated with the inner membrane of the lumen to enter PGIS facing the opposite side of the membrane. We previously reported that retrovirus-mediated and adenovirus-mediated transfer of PGHS-1 cDNA into human endothelial cells increased PGHS-1 levels to be in large excess of PGIS (8.Zoldhelyi P.

In addition, an extracellular (periplasmic) substrate-binding protein (MalE) is required for activity. Ligand translocation and ATP hydrolysis are dependent on a signaling mechanism originating from the binding protein and traveling through MalF/MalG. Thus, subunit-subunit interactions in the complex are crucial to the transport process but the chemical nature of residues involved is poorly understood. We have investigated the proximity of residues in a conserved sequence (“EAA” loop) of MalF and MalG to residues in a helical segment of the MalK subunits by means of site-directed chemical cross-linking. To this end, single cysteine residues were introduced into each subunit at several positions and the respectivemalF and malG alleles were individually co-expressed with each of the malK alleles. Membrane vesicles were prepared from those double mutants that contained a functional transporter in vivo and treated with Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4 or bifunctional cross-linkers. The results suggest that residues Ala-85, Lys-106, Val-114, and Val-117 in the helical segment of MalK, to different extents, participate in constitution of asymmetric interaction sites with the EAA loops of MalF and MalG. Furthermore, both MalK monomers in the complex are in close contact to each other through Ala-85 and Lys-106. These interactions are strongly modulated by MgATP, indicating a structural rearrangement of the subunits during the transport cycle.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Prominent members of the family include the P-glycoprotein involved in multidrug resistance of certain cancer cells; the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein, which is mutated in patients affected by cystic fibrosis; the TAP1-TAP2 peptide transporter, associated with antigen presentation (1.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar); a transporter that, when mutated, causes adrenoleukodystrophy, an error in peroxisomal β-oxidation of long fatty acids (2.Mosser J.

Nature. 1993; 361: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar); a protein involved in recessive Stargardt's macula dystrophy (3.Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B. Baird L. Stauffer D. Peiffer A. Rattner A. Smallwood P. Li Y. Anderson K.L. Lewis R.A. Nathans J. Leppert M. Dean M. Lupski J.R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar); and the subclass of binding protein-dependent ABC transport systems that mediate the uptake of a large variety of nutrients in prokaryotes (4.Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low Jr., K.B. Magasanik B. Rezinkoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). A prototype ABC transporter is composed of four entities: two membrane-integral domains, which presumably constitute a translocation pore; and two domains carrying the highly conserved nucleotide binding motifs (“Walker” sites A and B) (also referred to as ABC subunits/domains), which are thought to provide the energy for the transport process (1.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The ABC domains are further characterized by a unique “signature sequence” (LSGGQ motif) of yet unknown function located at the C-terminal end of a large helical peptide segment that connects the Walker A and B sites (5.Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In export systems, these modules are mostly fused to yield a single polypeptide chain, while prokaryotic ABC transporters mediating the uptake of solutes are built up from individual subunits (1.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The latter also require an additional extracellular (periplasmic) substrate-binding protein for activity (4.Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low Jr., K.B. Magasanik B. Rezinkoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). The binding protein-dependent maltose transporter of enterobacteria, such as Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium, is a well characterized model system for studying the mechanism of action of the ABC transport family. It is composed of a soluble periplasmic receptor, the maltose-binding protein, MalE, and of a membrane-bound complex (MalFGK2), consisting of one copy each of the hydrophobic subunits MalF and MalG and of two copies of the nucleotide-binding subunit MalK (6.Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified MalK displays a spontaneous ATPase activity (7.Morbach S. Tebbe S. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18617-18621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while, in the MalFGK2 complex, ATP hydrolysis and ligand translocation are strictly coupled and dependent on the binding protein (8.Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of substrate in the medium is thought to be signaled by liganded MalE via interaction with externally exposed peptide loops of MalF and MalG (9.Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As a consequence, conformational changes of the latter are transmitted to the MalK subunits, which, in turn, become activated. Hydrolysis of ATP would then trigger subsequent conformational changes that eventually lead to the translocation of the substrate molecule. Obviously, specific interactions between the individual subunits of the transport complex are crucial to this model. The chemical nature of residues involved in such an interplay between the hydrophobic components and the ATPase subunits is largely unknown. However, recent genetic and biochemical studies provided first, albeit indirect, evidence in favor of amino acids located in a mostly helical segment of MalK (approximately encompassing residues 83–149) (see Fig.1 A) as putative candidates for contacting MalF and/or MalG. By using a close homologue, the LacK protein of Agrobacterium radiobacter, as a tool, Wilken et al. (10.Wilken S. Schmees G. Schneider E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 555-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutations affecting Val-114 (→ Met) and Leu-123 (→ Phe) optimize the capability of LacK to substitute for MalK in maltose transport. Furthermore, reconstitution experiments revealed that Lys-106 of MalK, which is susceptible to trypsin in the purified protein (11.Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is protected against proteolytic attack in the assembled complex (12.Mourez M. Jéhano M. Schneider E. Dassa E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, and most importantly, Mourez et al. (13.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) identified substitutions of methionine for Ala-85, Val-117, or Val-149 of MalK, as suppressors of mutations affecting a conserved sequence motif in the membrane-integral components MalF and MalG. This motif (consensus: EAA … G. . . . . . . . . . .I-LP, thus often referred to as “EAA loop”) (see Fig. 1 B) is located in a cytoplasmic loop at a distance of ∼100 residues from the C terminus (14.Dassa E. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2287-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It is shared by the hydrophobic subunits of prokaryotic binding protein-dependent ABC transporters (4.Boos W.

In this paper, we provide the first direct evidence for interaction of the helical domain of an ABC subunit and the EAA loops of the membrane-integral components that is modulated by ATP. The neighboring residues are revealed by the introduction of single cysteines into each subunit and disulfide bridge formation or chemical cross-linking between MalK monomers, MalK and MalF, and MalK and MalG, respectively.

Schneider E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The plasmid carrying the resultingmalK798 allele is a derivative of pSE380 (Apr, ptrc) and was designated pSH30 (16.Hunke S. Schneider E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For complementation analysis, the malK798 allele was cloned as aPvuII fragment encompassing the ptrc promoter into the SmaI site of pSU19 (Cmr, P15A replicon) (17.Martinez E. Bartolomé B. de la Cruz F. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 68: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pSH46. Naturally occurring cysteine residues in the MalF (Cys-85, Cys-304, Cys-388) and MalG (Cys-106) proteins fromE. coli were substituted for by serines by subjecting themalF and malG wild type alleles on plasmid pTAZFGQ (pMB1 replicon) (13.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) to site-directed mutagenesis as above. The resulting plasmid was named pTAZFGQ*. Mono-Cys variants of MalK were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using themalK798 allele (Cys-less MalK) (pSH30) as template. Base changes were introduced in codons 85 (Ala → Cys), 106 (Lys → Cys), 114 (Val → Cys), or 117 (Val → Cys), yielding plasmids pSH36 (malK815), pSH38 (malK817), pSH34 (malK813), and pSH37 (malK816), respectively. For complementation studies, the malK alleles were subcloned in pSU19 as above, yielding plasmids pSH49 (malK815), pSH51 (malK817), pSH47 (malK813), and pSH50 (malK816), respectively. Mono-Cys variants of MalF or MalG were constructed by the same protocol, usingmalF(Cys −)/malG(Cys −) (pTAZFGQ*) as template. Base changes in malF were introduced in codons 401 (Glu → Cys) and 403 (Ser → Cys), resulting in plasmids pTAZFGQ(E1C/−) and pTAZFGQ(S3C/−), respectively. Base changes in malG were introduced in codons 190 (Glu → Cys), 192 (Ala → Cys), or 196 (Glu → Cys), resulting in plasmids pTAZFGQ(−/E1C), pTAZFGQ(−/A3C), and pTAZFGQ(−/G7C), respectively. The presence of the mutations was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. Strain ED169 (ΔmalB107) was transformed with any combination of plasmids encoding Cys-less and mono-Cys variants of MalK (derivatives of pSU19), Cys-less and mono-Cys variants of MalF or MalG (derivatives of pTZFGQ), and plasmid pTLCME (Knr, pSC101 replicon), encoding E. coli maltose-binding protein (MalE) (13.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Transformants were analyzed for utilization of maltose on MacConkey medium containing 2% maltose and supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). Microtiter plates were incubated at 30 °C and scored for growth after 24–48 h. Cells of strain ED169 harboring the described plasmids were grown in LB medium (18.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin at 30 °C to an OD650 = 0.3. Plasmid-encoded mal gene expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 or 1 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, and growth was continued for 2 h. Cells were harvested, washed twice in M63 salt medium (18.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), and adjusted to to an optical density at 650 nm of 1.2. Transport assays were essentially performed as described previously (19.Schneider E. Walter C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), with the following modifications; 20 μl of [14C]maltose (44 kBq) was added to 980 μl of cells to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and 0.3-ml samples were filtered after 1, 5, and 10 min. The high cell density and a high concentration of [14C]maltose were necessary due to the lack of thelamB gene, encoding maltoporin, in strain ED169. Maltoporin is required for the specific diffusion of maltose and maltodextrins through the outer membrane, especially at low substrate concentrations (6.Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells of strain ED169 cotransformed with plasmids encoding mono-Cys variants of MalK (derivatives of pSU19) and mono-Cys variants of MalF and MalG, respectively (derivatives of pTZ18R), were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) at 30 °C to an OD650 = 0.3. Then, 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactoside was added and growth was continued for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer 1 (0.1 m KPi, 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.6) (8 ml/500 ml of culture), containing 0.05 mg/ml DNase I and disrupted by one passage through a French press at 27 megapascals at 4 °C. Membrane vesicles were collected by ultracentrifugation (200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C), resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer 2 (0.1 m Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.0), shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. If not stated otherwise, membrane vesicles at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2 (assay buffer) were routinely treated with CuPhe (3 mm CuSO4/9 mm1,10-phenanthroline) for 30 min on ice. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5× SDS sample buffer, containing 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. For studying the effect of ATP on the cross-linking reaction, membrane vesicles were first incubated in buffer 2, containing 10 mm EDTA for 30 min on ice, collected by ultracentrifugation, washed once in assay buffer containing 5 mm DTT, and finally resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Cross-linking reactions were then performed as above but in the presence of 5 mm ATP. Reactions were performed under the same conditions as above but in the presence of 0.25 mm BMH, o-PDM, or p-PDM (10 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide). After incubation for 30 min on ice, the reactions were terminated by adding 5× SDS sample buffer containing 0.5 mDTT. Standard DNA techniques were performed as in (20.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Stratagene's QuikChange mutagenesis kit. The Pierce BCA microassay was used for assaying protein concentrations. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described in Ref. 19.Schneider E. Walter C. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. Immunoblots were developed using the Western Blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus system (NEN Life Science Products). Antiserum against MalF was kindly provided by B. Traxler. 1,6-Bismaleimidohexane was bought from Pierce.N,N′-o-Phenylenedimaleimide andN,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide were purchased from Sigma. As a prerequisite for the intended cross-linking experiments, we first constructed a maltose transporter devoid of the naturally occurring cysteine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. It had already been demonstrated that a Cys-less variant of MalK of S. typhimurium fully retained its function in maltose transport (16.Hunke S. Schneider E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). By using the same protocol, serine residues substituting for cysteines were introduced at positions 85, 304 and 388 in MalF, and at position 106 in MalG of E. coli, respectively. Subsequently, E. coli strain ED169, carrying a deletion of the malBregion that encodes the transport proteins, was cotransformed with plasmids pSH46 (malK798; encoding Cys-less MalK of S. typhimurium), pTAZFGQ* (encoding Cys-less MalF and Cys-less MalG of E. coli), and pTLCME (malE +; encoding wild type maltose-binding protein of E. coli). The resulting triple transformants are capable of utilizing maltose as sole source of carbon and energy, as indicated by their dark red appearance on McConkey/maltose agar (Fig. 2), thus clearly suggesting that none of the native cysteine residues of the MalFGK2 complex is essential for function. This conclusion was confirmed by transport assays, which demonstrated that the cells displayed [14C]maltose uptake at a rate corresponding to 61% of that measured with cells harboring the plasmid-borne wild type alleles (Table II).Table IIMaltose transport activities of Cys-substituted mutantsMalF/MalG variantsMalK variantsWild typeCys-lessA85CK106CV114CV117CWild type100NDNDNDNDNDCys-lessND6119555852S3C/−NDND52489361−/A3CNDND521385265−/G7CNDND71903281Cells of strain ED169 (ΔmalB107) transformed with combinations of plasmids that carry the described alleles ofmalF, malG, and malK each together with the wild type allele of malE were grown and assayed for [14C]maltose uptake as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transport rates represent the average of at least two experiments and are given in percentage relative to that measured with control cells harboring the respective plasmid-borne wild type alleles.

ND, not determined. The data also demonstrate that a functional transport complex can be assembled from mutant subunits of different organisms. This is consistent with the observation that wild type MalK of S. typhimurium can fully substitute for E. coli MalK in maltose transport (10.Wilken S. Schmees G. Schneider E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 555-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21.Dahl M.K. Francoz E. Saurin W. Boos W. Manson M.D. Hofnung M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the hybrid transport complex represents a well suited model system for the intended study. Starting from the Cys-less variants, we next constructed mono-Cys derivatives of each subunit by site-directed mutagenesis, using plasmids pSH30 and pTAZFGQ* as templates. In MalK, cysteines were introduced in place of Ala-85, Lys-106, Val-114, and Val-117, respectively, which by genetic and biochemical approaches had been identified as putative candidates for interaction with MalF and/or MalG (10.Wilken S. Schmees G. Schneider E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 555-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 12.Mourez M. Jéhano M. Schneider E. Dassa E. Mol.

In MalF and MalG, we introduced cysteine residues in the respective EAA loops at those positions that, when mutated, gave rise to the described suppressor mutations in malK (13.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Glu-401 (E1) in MalF, and Glu-190 (E1), Ala-192 (A3), and Gly-196 (G7) in MalG, respectively, were individually substituted for by cysteines. In addition, Ser-403 (S3) in MalF, which was shown previously to be less sensitive to replacements (13.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was also modified. From here on, the mono-Cys variants are denoted by a set of two symbols separated by a slash (13.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The first symbol describes cysteine replacements in MalF and the second those in MalG. A non-mutated (Cys-less) variant is represented by a dash. Numbers between letters point to the relative position of the residue in the consensus sequence (see Fig.1 B). Plasmids carrying Cys substitutions in MalK (all derivatives of pSU19, see Table I) and plasmids carrying Cys substitutions in either MalF or MalG, were cotransformed together with pTLCME (malE +) into strain ED169. Additionally, combinations of plasmids carrying Cys substitutions of MalK and Cys-less MalF/MalG or vice versa were also introduced into ED169. Growth of the transformants were again tested on McConkey/maltose agar. As shown in Fig.2, all mono-Cys variants of MalK when combined with MalF(−)/MalG(−), MalF(S3C)/MalG(−) or MalF(−)/MalG(G7C) supported growth on maltose comparable to the Cys-less complex. Some reduction in growth, as indicated by a less intense red color of the wells, was observed in combination with MalF(−)/MalG(A3C). These data were largely confirmed by measuring initial rates of [14C]maltose uptake. As summarized in Table II, the majority of Cys-substituted mutant strains exhibited transport rates of at least 48% of those measured with wild type cells. Only two combinations (MalKA85C with MalF(−)/MalG(−) and MalKV114C with MalF(−)/MalG(G7C)) gave lower values. Transformants carrying MalF(E1C)/MalG(−) and MalF(−)/MalG(E1C) behaved differently. As indicated by the almost colorless wells in Fig.2, substitution of cysteine for glutamate at position 1 in MalF strongly affected growth in a complex with Cys-less MalK or any of the mono-Cys MalK variants. However, in some experiments, newly transformed cells also appeared as red colonies on MacConkey/maltose plates. The reasons for these inconsistent results are not known. In contrast, cysteine replacing glutamate at position 1 in MalG consistently allowed growth when combined with either Cys-less MalK or MalKV114C, while other complexes failed to support growth on maltose. For cells containing the MalKV117C variant, this result was confirmed by the absence of any measurable maltose transport activity (data not shown). Thus, in order to exclude potential artifacts created by nonfunctional transport complexes, combinations with Cys substitutions at position 1 in both MalF and MalG were eliminated from subsequent cross-linking experiments. The initial screening experiments for MalK-MalF and MalK-MalG cross-link formation were performed with inside-out membrane vesicles containing combinations of MalKA85C with MalF(S3C)/MalG(−) and MalF(−)/MalG(A3C), respectively. Strong cross-links were observed in both cases on immunoblots probed with antiserum to MalK after CuPhe treatment for 30 min on ice (Fig. 3,A and B, lanes 2). In contrast, when CuPhe-treated control samples were electrophoresed in the presence of DTT, no cross-links were detected (data not shown). The identity of the putative FK and GK products was verified by re-probing the blots with antisera raised against MalF and MalG, respectively. As demonstrated in Fig. 3 (panels A andB, lanes 4), cross-links with molecular masses similar to those detected with anti-MalK antiserum were observed in the presence of CuPhe only. Since both antisera cross-reacted with other proteins, in subsequent experiments, immunoblots were probed with the anti-MalK antiserum only. An additional, slower migrating band (∼97 kDa) was picked up by the MalK antiserum in the combination with MalF(−)/MalG(A3C) (Fig.3 B, lane 2). A weak reaction at about the same position was also observed with the anti-MalG antiserum (Fig.3 B, lanes 3 and 4); however, independent of the presence of CuPhe, which is in contrast to the result obtained with the antiserum to MalK. Thus, it is concluded that the bands seen in Fig. 3 B (lanes 3 and 4) are due to an unspecific cross-reaction and that the cross-link detected with anti-MalK antiserum"

In this study we hypothesized that newly synthesized polymeric immunoglobulin receptors are targeted from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes prior to their appearance on the basolateral cell surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. To examine this hypothesis, we have used an assay designed to measure the meeting of newly synthesized receptors with a selective population of apical or basolateral endosomes loaded with horseradish peroxidase. We found that in the course of basolateral exocytosis, the wild-type polymeric immunoglobulin receptor is targeted from the trans-Golgi network to apical and basolateral endosomes. Phosphorylation of a Ser residue in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor is implicated in this process. The biosynthetic pathway of apically sorted polymeric immunoglobulin receptor mutants similarly traversed apical endosomes, raising the possibility that apical receptors are segregated from basolateral receptors in apical endosomes. The post-endocytic pathway of transcytosing and recycling receptors also passed through apical endosomes. Together, these observations are consistent with the possibility that the biosynthetic and endocytic routes merge into endosomes and justify a model suggesting that endosomal recycling processes govern polarized trafficking of proteins traveling in both pathways.

The plasma membrane of epithelial cells can generally be divided into two domains, an apical surface that faces the external environment and a basolateral surface contacting adjacent cells and underlying tissues. The two surface domains display a completely different protein and lipid composition. The precise intracellular compartment(s) in which proteins destined for the apical and basolateral cell surface are sorted is not certain. It is commonly believed that the combined ability of endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN)1 to target a membrane protein to a particular surface domain plays a role in determining its polarized steady-state distribution on the plasma membrane (1.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 1999; 99: 121-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The TGN is thought to serve as a major sorting site for plasma membrane proteins traveling in the biosynthetic pathway (1.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 4381-4443Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This notion is based primarily on observations of a common intracellular localization of apical and basolateral proteins throughout the Golgi stacks (6.Rindler M.J. Ivanov I.E. Plesken H. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1304-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the TGN (7.Fuller S.D. Bravo R. Simons K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, these data do not rule out the possibility that sorting of newly synthesized proteins can take place at later compartments, for instance, in endosomes (1.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Aroeti B. Okhrimenko H. Reich V. Orzech E. Biochim. Biophys.

In this case, membrane proteins would be delivered directly from the TGN to endosomes prior to their appearance on the cell surface. Results from recent studies in nonpolarized cells are consistent with this notion (9.Leitinger B. Hille-Rehfeld A. Spiess M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 10109-10113Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10.Futter C.E. Connolly C.N. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10999-11003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) showed that the transferrin receptor (TfnR) is targeted first from the TGN to endosomes and is subsequently delivered to the plasma membrane. More recently, Brachetet al. (11.Brachet V. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Desaymard C. Raposo G. Amigorena S. Mol. Biol.

In contrast, the biosynthetic pathway of other membrane proteins, such as glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-linked proteins, seem to bypass endosomes (10.Futter C.E. Connolly C.N. Cutler D.F. Hopkins C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10999-11003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Hence, diverse pathways (mechanisms) can direct membrane proteins from the TGN to the plasma membrane in nonpolarized cells. Whether similar direct and indirect pathways exist in polarized cells is currently unknown. Here we analyzed the polarized exocytic transport of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) exogenously expressed in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (12.Mostov K.E. Altschuler Y. Chapin S.J. Enrich C.C. Low S.-H. Luton F. Richman-Eisenstat J. Singer K.L. Tang K. Weimbs T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; LX: 775-781Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that the pIgR is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, from where it is targeted to the Golgi complex. From the TGN the pIgR is directed to the basolateral surface, where it can bind polymeric immunoglobulins, such as dimeric IgA (dIgA) or IgM, and internalize via clathrin-mediated endocytosis into endosomes. The pIgR bound to its ligand then transcytoses from the basolateral to the apical pole of the cell. The process of pIgR transcytosis utilizes several endosomal compartments, each of which is presumed to play a role in its trafficking to the apical plasma membrane. Initialy, upon internalization from the basolateral plasma membrane, dIgA-pIgR complexes reach basolateral early (sorting) endosomes (BEE). BEE serve as the first station for many other endocytic ligands internalized from the basolateral surface (e.g. Tfn, low density lipoprotein, and epidermal growth factor bound to their receptors (13.Gibson A. Futter C.E. Maxwell S. Allchin E.H. Shipman M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Domingo D. Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). These ligands exist at high concentrations in BEE (see Ref. 14.Brown P.S. Wang E. Aroeti B. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Dunn K.W. Traffic. 2000; 1: 124-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Next, pIgR-dIgA complexes are transported to a compartment that consists of long, 60-nm diameter tubules lying parallel to microtubules and oriented toward the apical cytoplasm (15.Futter C.E. Gibson A. Allchin E.H. Maxwell S. Ruddock L.J. Odorizzi G. Domingo D. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The “tubular compartment” contains both IgA and transferrin at the same relative concentrations as the BEE but is substantially depleted of low density lipoprotein and epidermal growth factor receptor, which are destined for the degradative pathway (13.Gibson A. Futter C.E. Maxwell S. Allchin E.H. Shipman M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Domingo D. Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 124-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This compartment, which resides in the medial and apical cytoplasm of polarized MDCK and Caco-2 cells, has been designated the “interconnected compartment” or the “common endosomal compartment” (CE) (14.Brown P.S. Wang E. Aroeti B. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Dunn K.W. Traffic. 2000; 1: 124-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15.Futter C.E. Gibson A. Allchin E.H. Maxwell S. Ruddock L.J. Odorizzi G.

The final compartment in the transcytotic pathway is comprised of 100–150-nm cup-shaped vesicles distributed underneath the apical plasma membrane (13.Gibson A. Futter C.E. Maxwell S. Allchin E.H. Shipman M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Domingo D. Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This compartment is likely the equivalent of the pericentriolar apical recycling endosomal compartment (ARE), whose structure depends upon microtubules (19.Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 20.Barroso M. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic and quantitative immunofluorescence localization data suggest that ARE are enriched in the transcytotic marker, the pIgR, but are relatively depleted in the recycling marker, the human TfnR (hTfnR) (13.Gibson A. Futter C.E. Maxwell S. Allchin E.H. Shipman M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Domingo D. Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 124-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The endosomal rabs, rab11a, rab17, and rab25 are associated with this compartment (21.van Ijzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 144-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22.Casanova J.E. Wang X. Kumar R. Bhartur S.G. Navarre J. Woodrum J.E. Altschuler Y. Ray G.S. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Fluid phase ligands internalized from the apical plasma membrane reach apical early endosomes (AEE) but not ARE or the CE (19.Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). ARE and CE, however, can be reached by membrane-bound endocytic ligands such as dIgA, Tfn, or the general endocytic tracer ricin (13.Gibson A. Futter C.E. Maxwell S. Allchin E.H. Shipman M. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Domingo D. Odorizzi G. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20.Barroso M. Sztul E.S. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23712-23719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CE, ARE, and AEE are distinct compartments. Apical endosomes have become the focus of intense interest, because they appear to serve as a major intersection site for various post-endocytic (transcytotic and recycling) receptors in epithelia. On the basis of these and other observations it has been postulated that in epithelial cells, apical and basolateral sorting as well as recycling of endocytic receptors is mediated by CE and/or in ARE (21.van Ijzendoorn S.C. Hoekstra D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 144-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24.Mostov K.E. Cardone M.H. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A significant level of pIgR transcytosis can also occur when the pIgR is not bound to its ligand. This process has been referred to as constitutive transcytosis (25.Song W. Bomsel M. Casanova J. Vaerman J.-P. Mostov K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whose presumptive trigger is phosphorylation of a cytoplasmic Ser, Ser664 (26.Hirt R.P. Hughes G.J. Frutiger S. Michetti P. Perregaux C. Poulain-Godefroy O. Jeanguenat N. Neutra M.R. Kraehenbuhl J.-P. Cell. 1993; 74: 245-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27.Casanova J.E. Breitfeld P.P. Ross S.A. Mostov K.E. Science. 1990; 248: 742-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Like ligand-bound pIgR, the unoccupied pIgR also reaches ARE en route to the apical cell surface (19.Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, both dIgA-mediated and constitutive transcytosis of the pIgR are potentially regulated by multiple endosomal compartments. The 17-residue cytoplasmic segment positioned immediately after the transmembrane domain of the pIgR has been characterized as an autonomous and dominant basolateral sorting signal (28.Casanova J.E. Apodaca G. Mostov K.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 65-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). An in-frame deletion of fourteen amino acids in this segment results in sorting of the pIgR from the TGN to the apical plasma membrane. Individual residues (His656, Arg657, and Val660) within the 17-residue peptide have been shown to be important for mediating basolateral transport of the receptor (29.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30.Reich V. Mostov K. Aroeti B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2133-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a fraction of the pIgR mutants impaired in basolateral sorting can reach the basolateral surface, internalize into basolateral endosomes, and transcytose to the apical surface. Intriguingly, the mutant receptors displayed enhanced transcytotic activity (8.Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hence, mutations that inhibited basolateral targeting and increased apical targeting from the TGN similarly decreased basolateral recycling from endosomes and increased basolateral-to-apical transcytosis. Mutations in the basolateral targeting signal of the low density lipoprotein receptor that affect the polarity of biosynthetic sorting show similar enhancement of its apical sorting after endocytosis (31.Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these observations is that the targeting signal acts in two different locations: in the TGN during exocytosis and in endosomes after endocytosis. This suggests that a similar type of sorting machinery operates in both the TGN and endosomes. An alternative model argues that the constitutive exocytic and post-endocytic pathways of the pIgR converge into a common sorting compartment. This compartment is unlikely to be the TGN (8.Aroeti B. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2297-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31.Matter K. Whitney J.A. Yamamoto E.M. Mellman I. Cell. 1993; 74: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) but may be endosomes. The latter model would predict the direct targeting of newly synthesized pIgR from the TGN to endosomes. A casein kinase II (CKII) phosphorylation motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) is thought to mediate MPR interaction with the Golgi-associated clathrin AP-1 adaptor (32.Mauxion F. Le Borgne R. Munier-Lehmann H. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2171-2178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33.Honing S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A number of observations argue that AP-1 binding may be coupled to the subsequent process of MPR budding into clathrin-coated vesicles and transport from the TGN to endosomes (34.Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35.Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 36.Hunziker W. Geuze H. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We have recently suggested that phosphorylated Ser726 residing in a putative CKII/protein kinase A phosphorylation site in the cytoplasmic tail of pIgR mediates the association of AP-1 adaptor with the pIgR (37.Orzech E. Schlessinger K. Weiss A. Okamoto C.T. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2201-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These observations further suggested to us that similar to MPR, AP-1 association with phosphorylated Ser in the cytoplasmic tail of pIgR elicits the sequestration of pIgR into clathrin-AP-1-coated domains in the TGN, from where it could be transported to endosomes, prior to its appearance on the basolateral cell surface. In the present study we took morphological and biochemical approaches to assess this hypothesis and found that the polarized exocytic pathway taken by the pIgR may involve various endosomal compartments. Lectin-triticum vulgaris (wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)) coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and free HRP Type II were from Sigma. Human apo-transferrin (hTfn; Biological Industries Co, Beit hemeek, Israel) was loaded with iron as described (38.Podbilewicz B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum directed against a peptide in the cytoplasmic domain of the rat TGN resident protein, TGN-38 (39.Wilde A. Reaves B. Banting G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. G. Banting (University of Bristol, Bristol, UK) and was used at 1:500 and 1:100 dilution for Western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Fab fragments derived from affinity purified guinea pig anti-rabbit SC polyclonal antibodies were a kind gift from Prof. K. Mostov (University of California, San Francisco) and were prepared as described previously (40.Breitfeld P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Radioiodination of Fabs was performed according to the iodine monochloride protocol (40.Breitfeld P. Casanova J.E. Harris J.M. Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). MDCK cell lines that exogenously co-express the wild-type pIgR and hTfnR was established as described (14.Brown P.S. Wang E. Aroeti B. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Dunn K.W. Traffic. 2000; 1: 124-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We have used MDCK cells expressing various pIgR constructs. Some of their basic characteristics are summarized in Fig. 1. To obtain cells with higher expression levels, the pIgR-ΔR655-Y668 mutant was re-expressed in MDCK cells using the pCB6 vector (41.Brewer C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), as described (29.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The pIgR mutant, pIgR-S726-t, whose 30 C-terminal amino acids have been deleted was described and characterized in an earlier work (designated 725t in Ref. 42.Breitfeld P.P. Casanova J.E. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13750-13757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1). This pIgR mutant also exhibited low expression levels and was therefore re-expressed in MDCK cells. In both cases, cell lines exhibiting pIgR expression levels comparable with those of other pIgR-WT expressing cell lines were isolated. Exocytic and endocytic trafficking characteristics of the re-expressed mutant receptors were identical to those described for the original expressors. All MDCK cells were routinely cultured on 10-cm dishes, in minimal essential medium (MEM; Sigma) containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (Biological industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). Cells were maintained in culture up to 10 passages. To induce polarity, cells were cultured on 12-mm Transwell filters (Costar) for at least 4 days prior to each experiment. Cell polarity was estimated by measuring gp80 secretion as described (29.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This assay is designed to measure the meeting of newly synthesized receptors in the exocytic pathway or receptors traveling in the post-endocytic pathway with a selective population of apical or basolateral endosomes loaded with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). A modified version of the original DAB density shift assay (43.Courtoy P.J. Quintart J. Baudhuin P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) used by Apodaca et al. (19.Apodaca G. Katz L.A. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 67-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) has been applied here to assay the targeting of newly synthesized pIgR to apical or basolateral endosomes. The various steps of the assay are schematically depicted in Fig. 3 A. MDCK cells grown on 12-mm Transwell filters were pulse-labeled for 10 min at 37 °C with [35S]Cys,Met (0.07 mCi of Promix; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and subsequently chased for 15 min at 37 °C in minimal essential medium containing bovine serum albumin (MEM-BSA) (MEM containing Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma), 20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, and 0.6% BSA) lacking radioactive amino acids. To label apical endosomes, WGA-HRP (12 μg/ml) or free HRP (10 mg/ml) was introduced into the medium bathing the apical surface during the chase at 37 °C. To label basolateral early endosomes, free HRP (10 mg/ml) was added to the medium in the basolateral chamber during the 15-min chase. In all cases, the medium in contact with the basolateral surface was supplemented with V8 proteinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) throughout the entire chase period. The proteinase does not digest HRP, but it immediately digests the lumenal domain (i.e. the SC) of radiolabeled pIgR molecules that appear on the basolateral plasma membrane. V8-digested pIgR is no longer recognized by anti-SC antibodies and cannot be immunoprecipitated from the cell (our proteinase-based delivery assay is based upon this principle (29.Aroeti B. Kosen P.A. Kuntz I.D. Cohen F.E. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar)). The application of V8 proteinase was important for preventing the internalization of intact molecules into the cell, thereby eliminating the ability of exocytic receptors to reach endosomes via the indirect post-endocytic route. In cases where a fraction of metabolically labeled pIgR reaches the apical surface, apical endocytosis of surface arriving receptor molecules is largely diminished because of efficient cleavage of pIgR to SC by the endogenous protease. Cells were then washed three times quickly and once for 5 min with ice-cold MEM-BSA containing 20% calf serum to quench the V8 proteolytic activity. Noninternalized HRP was stripped from the cell surface as follows: WGA-HRP was removed by incubating the cells with 100 mm N-acetyl-d-glucosoamine in ice-cold MEM-BSA for three times for 10 min each time. HRP was removed by washing the cells twice quickly and once for 60 min with ice-cold glycine buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glycine, pH 9.0) as described (44.Geuze H.J. Stoorvogel W. Strous G.J. Slot J.W. Bleekemolen J.E. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold MEM-BSA, medium was aspirated, and DAB reaction buffer (0.5 ml) was added to both the apical and basolateral compartments of the Transwell. The DAB reaction buffer was prepared by adding 1.65 ml of 3 mg/ml DAB to 10 ml HBSS+ (1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 25 mm Hepes titered to pH 7.4 with NaOH). The pH of the solution was then carefully adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH, filtered through a 0.45-μm pore filter unit, and 12 μl of fresh 30% H2O2 was added to the DAB reaction buffer. In control experiments, H2O2 was omitted from the DAB reaction buffer. Upon incubation with monomeric DAB and peroxide, DAB is selectively polymerized by the peroxide. Consequently, peroxide-containing organelles become detergent-insoluble. Following 45 min of incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS+, buffer was aspirated, and filters were excised from their holders, boiled for exactly 90 s in 0.5 ml of SDS-lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmtriethanolamine chloride, pH 8.6, 5 mm EDTA. 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Filters in lysis buffer were then vortexed for 15 min at 22 °C, and SDS-insoluble DAB polymers were pelleted by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 25 min, TL-100 Beckman ultracentrifuge). Supernatants were added to 0.5 ml of 2.5% Triton dilution buffer (TDB) (100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 100 mm triethanolamine chloride, pH 8.6, 2.5% Triton X-100, 0.02% sodium azide), and the pIgR was immunoprecipitated with sheep anti-rabbit SC polyclonal antibodies covalently coupled to protein A-Sepharose (50 μl of 15% slurry) as described (37.Orzech E. Schlessinger K. Weiss A. Okamoto C.T. Aroeti B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2201-2215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The pIgR was immunoprecipitated, and the degree of pIgR meeting with endosomes is calculated from the relative loss in radiolabeled receptor signal (see Fig. 3 A). Internalization of large HRP concentrations may result in nonspecific precipitation of metabolically labeled pIgR. We hence carefully calibrated the concentration of HRP ligands applied to the cells in each experiments, and the concentration chosen (mentioned above) resulted in the consistent internalization of HRP activity that did not cause the pelleting of pulse-labeled receptors (namely, receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum). Cell-associated HRP activity in each experiment was determined using the following protocol. HRP-coupled ligands or free HRP was internalized from the apical surface of MDCK cells, and surface-bound ligand was removed. Cells were washed twice quickly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the filter was excised from its holder, and cells were scraped into 0.1 ml of ice-cold TDB containing 2.5% Triton X-100 lacking sodium azide. Cell lysates were vortexed at 4 °C for 20 min, and 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.75 mg/mlo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.023% H2O2 was added to the lysate. The mixture was incubated further for 20 min on ice, and the reaction was stopped with 0.3 ml of 1 n HCl. Absorbance was determined at 492 nm, and the amount of cell-assoc"

L., Rappuoli, R., and Montecucco, C. (1998) FEBS Lett. 436, 218–222). We examined the mechanism by which HL-60 cells acquire sensitivity to VacA, in particular, looking for expression of RPTPβ, a VacA-binding protein postulated to be the VacA receptor (Yahiro, K., Niidome, T., Kimura, M., Hatakeyama, T., Aoyagi, H., Kurazono, H., Imagawa, K., Wada, A., Moss, J., and Hirayama, T. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36693–36699). PMA induced expression of RPTPβ mRNA and protein as determined by RNase protection assay and indirect immunofluorescence studies, respectively. Vitamin D3 and interferon-γ, which stimulate differentiation of HL-60 cells into monocyte-like cells, also induced VacA sensitivity and expression of RPTPβ mRNA, whereas 1.2% Me2SO and retinoic acid, which stimulated the maturation of HL-60 into granulocyte-like cells, did not. RPTPβ antisense oligonucleotide inhibited induction of VacA sensitivity and expression of RPTPβ. Double immunostaining studies also indicated that newly expressed RPTPβ colocalized with VacA in PMA-treated HL-60 cells. In agreement with these data, BHK-21 cells, which are insensitive to VacA, when transfected with the RPTPβ cDNA, acquired VacA sensitivity. All data are consistent with the conclusion that acquisition of VacA sensitivity by PMA-treated HL-60 cells results from induction of RPTPβ, a protein that functions as the VacA receptor.

All data are consistent with the conclusion that acquisition of VacA sensitivity by PMA-treated HL-60 cells results from induction of RPTPβ, a protein that functions as the VacA receptor. bovine serum albumin Eagle's minimum essential medium fetal calf serum phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate interferon phosphate-buffered saline base pair(s) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase polymerase chain reaction vitamin D3 Helicobacter pylori is believed to be a major cause of gastritis, gastric ulcer, and gastric cancer (1.Blaser M.J.

The m2 genotype can be distinguished from the m1 VacA genotype by the presence of a unique middle region locus.

VacA of the m1 genotype is an oligomeric toxin, composed of 5 or 6 subunits. The 87–95-kDa mature toxin is generated by proteolytic cleavage of a 140-kDa precursor at the bacterial outer membrane (6.Cover T.L.

We recently reported that VacA is able to interact with target cells by binding to a 250-kDa receptor protein, tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) β. 1Yahiro, K., Niidome, T., Kimura, M., Hatakeyama, T., Aoyagi, H., Kurazono, H., Imagawa, K., Wada, A., Moss, J., and Hirayama, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274,36693–36699. To define further whether RPTPβ serves as the VacA receptor, we investigated the relationship between induction of VacA sensitivity and RPTPβ expression in HL-60 cells treated with differentiation-promoting reagents. Agents that promote differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage- and monocyte-like cells, but not granulocyte-like cells, enhanced VacA sensitivity by increasing expression of cell surface RPTPβ. Suppression of RPTPβ synthesis with antisense oligonucleotides inhibited receptor expression. Transfection of RPTPβ gene into BHK-21 cells resulted in an induction of VacA sensitivity in these cells. These data support the hypothesis that RPTPβ is the VacA cytotoxin receptor. VacA was purified from the toxin-producing H. pylori strain ATCC49503, according to our published procedure (5.Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Padilla P.I. Wada A. Hirayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, after growth of H. pyloriin Brucella broth containing 0.1% β-cyclodextran at 37 °C for 3–4 days with vigorous shaking in a controlled micro-aerophilic atmosphere of 10% O2 and 10% CO2, VacA was precipitated from culture supernatant using 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and purified by column chromatography on hydroxyapatite, Superose 6HR 10/30, and Resource Q. Purified VacA (200 μg/ml) was stored in TBS buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 m NaCl). VacA concentration was determined by Beads enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (21.Nagata H. Wada A. Kurazono H. Yahiro K. Shirasaka D. Ikemura T. Aoyama N. Ping W.A. Makiyama K. Kohno S. Hirayama T. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 26: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein content was measured by the Bradford method using BSA2 as a standard (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). AZ-521 cells (human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line) and BHK-21 (hamster kidney cell line) cells seeded in 96-well culture plates (2 × 104 cells/well, 80 μl) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and EMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% FCS and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were grown as monolayers for 24 h in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. HL-60 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (2 × 104 cells/well, 100 μl) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). The cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of PMA or Me2SO for 0, 12, 24, or 48 h. Because PMA was dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO, this solution served as a control for PMA.

To quantify vacuolation, neutral red uptake into vacuoles was determined as described by Cover et al. (28.Cover T Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with 50 μl of freshly prepared 0.05% neutral red in PBS containing 0.3% BSA and then washed three times with 0.1 ml of PBS containing 0.3% BSA. After addition of 0.1 ml of 70% ethanol in water containing 0.4% HCl, absorbance at 540 nm (A 540) was measured. Neutral red uptake was determined by subtracting the A 540 of cells incubated without VacA from that of VacA-treated cells. DNA fragments (6021–6250) from RPTPβ cDNA were generated by PCR amplification and subcloned into pBluescript/KS vector. The identity of the fragments was confirmed by sequencing following established protocols. The plasmid was then linearized by using the XhoI restriction site. Antisense riboprobes were synthesized using the MAXIScript SP6/T7 transcription kit from Ambion. These probes also contained, at their 5′ end, base pairs of pBluescript corresponding to DNA sequences between the T3 promoter and the restriction sites where the DNA fragments were inserted and had a total size of 314 bp. The control probe for GAPDH was synthesized using human GAPDH control template DNA from CLONTECH Laboratories. An amplified GAPDH fragment was generated by PCR using a 3′ primer and transcribed using the T7 promoter sequence. An antisense 184-nucleotide RNA probe was generated using the MAXIScript by Ambion. RNase protection assays were performed according to the protocol contained in the Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit (RPA III; Ambion). Briefly, 20 μg of total RNA from AZ-521 cells and HL-60 cells stimulated by different reagents were used for the RNase A protection assay. Total RNA was hybridized overnight with the RPTPβ and GAPDH probes using hybridization buffer at 42 °C. Afterward, the reaction was treated with RNase, which was then inactivated, and the fragments were precipitated. Protected fragments were detected using 5% sequencing gels followed by Fuji film autoradiography. Sizes of 230 nucleotides for RPTPβ and 184 nucleotides for GAPDH were predicted. HL-60 cells were incubated without or with 20 nm PMA for 48 h, harvested, washed twice with PBS, and divided in samples of 2 × 105 cells/sample. The cells were then fixed (15 min at room temperature), washed three times with PBS, and then permeabilized (15 min at room temperature), using the Fixing and Permeabilization Kit (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). During permeabilization, the cells were incubated with anti-human RPTPβ mouse monoclonal antibody (1:10) (Transduction Laboratories) or irrelevant mouse IgG antibodies (control) in PBS containing 2% BSA and 1 mm NaN3. Cells were then washed three times with the same buffer, followed by incubation with second antibody (1:400) (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min in the dark. After three more washings, the samples were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System, La Jolla, CA) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 529 nm. Phosphorothioate-capped oligonucleotides were synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The phosphorothioate-capped antisense oligonucleotide sequence was (positions 139–159) 5′-TsAsGsGsAsTsTsCsGsCsAsTsTsTsCsCsAsGsAsCsGs-3′; the corresponding sense oligonucleotide was 5′-CsGsTsCsTsGsGsAsAsAsTsGsCsGsAsAsTsCsCsTsAs-3′ (29.Krueger N.X. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7417-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were treated with the oligonucleotides (5, 10, or 15 μm) in 50 μl of RPMI medium supplemented with kanamycin, 50 μg/ml, in a 96-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well) and 6-cm Petri dishes for 3 h, followed by incubation with 20 nm PMA for 24 h (30.Eck S.L. Perkins N.D. Carr D.P. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6530-6536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells used to assess vacuolating activity were then incubated with VacA for 8 h, and vacuolation was quantified in the neutral red assay. The cells used to assess RPTPβ expression were harvested and subjected to cell sorter analysis. For immunofluorescent staining, HL-60 cells were grown on 6-cm Petri dishes and stimulated with 20 nm PMA for 48 h. After incubation with 120 nm VacA for 1 h, the cells were washed twice with culture medium and centrifuged at 200 ×g for 5 min. The cells were smeared on glass slides and fixed in absolute methanol. After fixation, the cells were hydrated, incubated with a mixture of 10% normal goat serum/10% normal horse serum for 20 min at room temperature, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mixture of rabbit polyclonal antibody against VacA (1:500) and mouse monoclonal antibody against human RPTPβ (1:10). Slides were then incubated with the mixture of the two secondary antibodies (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG, diluted 1:100; Vector Laboratories and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1:100; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were examined with a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC-600) equipped with argon and argon-krypton lasers for blue (488 nm) and green (544 nm) excitation. Negative control immunohistochemical procedures included: 1) omission of the primary antibody from the staining protocol, 2) omission of PMA stimulation of HL-60 cells, and 3) omission of VacA from the incubation with HL-60 cells. We used two PTPζ cDNA clones (pHPTPζ.fl.preUC and pSP65.HPTPζ256T) (29.Krueger N.X. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7417-7421Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A 1-μl sample of the 100× diluted cDNA pSP65.HPTPζ256T solution was used as template. Primers used for RPTPβ were: 5′-GGGCTAGCATGCGAATCCTAAAGCGTTTC-3′ (sense; positions 147–167) (GGGCTAGC was added to the primer to create a site for NheI) and 5′-ATATGGTCGGAAGAACAATGT-3′ (antisense; positions 1118–1138). AnXbaI site was located internally within the PCR products. PCR was performed in PCR Buffer II containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase (Takara) in a final volume of 50 μl. Primers were added at a final concentration of 1 μm. Reactions were carried out in a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer Cetus) for 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products of 994 bp were analyzed on ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gels. The PCR products were first subcloned into the pBluescript vector. The construct was then digested with NheI and XbaI to yield a 884-bp fragment. This subcloned fragment (884 bp) was then inserted into another vector, the pBK-CMV vector. Because the target sequence in the clones was too large, the pHPTPζ.fl.preUC clone was digested twice, first with XbaI and ClaI to yield a 4380-bp fragment and second with ClaI and SmaI to yield a 1988-bp fragment. The 4380-bp fragment was inserted first into the pBK-CMV vector with the 884-bp fragment followed by the last fragment (1988 bp) from pHPTPζ.fl.preUC for a total length of 7252 bp. BHK-21 cells in EMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) were cultured as monolayers for 24 h in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were harvested with 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 buffer, washed twice with serum-free EMEM, and suspended in EMEM; then 0.5 ml of this cell suspension was mixed with 30 μg of the RPTPβ-pBK-CMV plasmid. The cells and the plasmid were incubated for 10 min at room temperature before electroporation at 950 microfarad, 250 mV. The cuvettes were then placed in an ice bath for 10 min. The cells were then transferred to 10 ml of EMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and 24 h later, cells were trypsinized and replated at a 1:10 dilution. After another 24 h, Geneticin (G418 sulfate; Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 800 μg/ml was added to the medium. After 5 days, transfected BHK-21 cell colonies were harvested for vacuolation assay and FACScan. After HL-60 cells were incubated with 5, 10, and 20 nm PMA for 24 h, their sensitivity to VacA was evaluated (Fig. 1). Addition of 120 nm VacA resulted in a remarkable vacuolation of HL-60 cells treated with 10 and 20 nm PMA, starting at 4 h post-exposure to toxin. No significant vacuolation was observed in cells treated with 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO or 5 nmPMA. HL-60 cells were exposed to 20 nm PMA for the indicated time before addition of 120 nm VacA, and vacuolation was assessed 8 h later. The longer the exposure of HL-60 cells to 20 nm PMA, the greater the vacuolation induced by VacA at 12 h than at 6 h (Fig. 2). More cells were adherent to the surface at 6 h. Cells treated with 0.1% (v/v) Me2SO exhibited negligible vacuolation in response to 120 nmVacA. Because RPTPβ was identified as a VacA receptor in AZ-521 cells,1 we investigated RPTPβ mRNA levels in HL-60 cells incubated without and with PMA by RNase Protection Assay (Fig.3). Treatment of HL-60 cells with 10 or 20 nm PMA for 24 and 48 h significantly increased RPTPβ mRNA. Measurable radioactivity was 49 and 67% for HL-60 cells treated with 10 and 20 nm PMA for 48 h, respectively, with AZ-521 cells as control (100%). In untreated and 0.1% Me2SO-treated HL-60 cells, RPTPβ mRNA was not detected, whereas AZ-521 cells expressed RPTPβ mRNA constitutively. These findings suggest that the exposure of HL-60 cells to 10 or 20 nm PMA for 24 and 48 h induced VacA sensitivity through enhancement of RPTPβ synthesis. To confirm the presence of RPTPβ protein, we performed a FACScan analysis using monoclonal anti-RPTPβ antibody (Fig.4). As shown in Fig. 4 B, PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells had greater (dotted lines) fluorescence than the control cells (solid line), indicating that the amount of RPTPβ was increased in cells treated with PMA. The positions of peak fluorescence in untreated HL-60 cells in assays using control and anti-RPTPβ antibodies were unchanged (Fig.4 A). To define more clearly the relationship between VacA sensitivity and expression of RPTPβ in PMA-treated HL-60 cells, RPTPβ sense or antisense oligonucleotides were added to the cells before exposure to PMA. As shown in Fig.5, there was a concentration-dependent inhibition of vacuolation in HL-60 cells treated for 3 h with the RPTPβ antisense oligonucleotide but not the sense oligonucleotide. The sense oligonucleotide-treated cells had the same degree of vacuolation as the controls (0.1% (v/v) Me2SO-treated cells without oligonucleotide). This result suggests that RPTPβ specifically functions as the primary functional receptor for VacA in HL-60 cells treated with PMA. To characterize further RPTPβ expression in HL-60 cells incubated with RPTPβ antisense oligonucleotides, cell sorter analysis was performed to show the dose-dependent inhibition of expression of RPTPβ. In Fig.6 A, when PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells were treated with RPTPβ sense oligonucleotides, no visible shift in the amount of fluorescence was seen, whereas cells that were treated with antisense oligonucleotide exhibited decreased fluorescence inversely proportional to the concentration of RPTPβ antisense oligonucleotide. To demonstrate the colocalization of VacA and RPTPβ on the surface of HL-60 cells treated with PMA, we carried out double-immunostaining by confocal microscopy using anti-VacA and anti-RPTPβ antibodies (Fig.7). In HL-60 cells treated with 20 nm PMA for 48 h followed by incubation with 120 nm VacA for 1 h, RPTPβ and VacA were extensively colocalized at the cytoplasmic membrane. In many cells, the red fluorescence of VacA rimmed the yellow, which resulted from superimposition of green indicating RPTPβ (Fig. 7 A). RPTPβ was found in the cytoplasm in addition to its primary location at the plasma membrane (Fig. 7 B). The VacA was similarly located in the cytoplasm as well as in the plasma membrane (Fig.7 C). In untreated HL-60 cells (i.e. without exposure to PMA or VacA), no fluorescence indicative of RPTPβ or VacA was observed (Fig. 7 D). HL-60 cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 20 nm PMA to induce differentiation to macrophage-like cells, with 1.2% (v/v) Me2SO or 100 nm retinoic acid to induce granulocyte-like differentiation, or with 10 nmVitD3 or IFN-γ (100 units/ml) to induce monocyte-like cells. The cells were then incubated with 120 nm VacA for an additional 8 h at 37 °C (Fig.8). VacA-induced vacuolation similar to that seen after PMA was clearly observed in HL-60 cells treated with VitD3 or IFN-γ. No significant vacuolation was detected in HL-60 cells treated with 1.2% (v/v) Me2SO or retinoic acid. Limited but significant expression of RPTPβ mRNA was observed in HL-60 cells treated with VitD3 (28%), IFN-γ (48%), and PMA (61%) with RNase Protection Assay (Fig.9) as compared with AZ-521 cells. Me2SO and retinoic acid, however, which stimulate the maturation of HL-60 into granulocyte-like cells, did not induce VacA sensitivity or increase expression of RPTPβ mRNA.Figure 9Effect of differentiating agents on RPTPβ mRNA expression in HL-60 cells.mRNA was harvested after cells were incubated with the indicated agents for 24 h.

Confirmation of the newly expressed RPTPβ itself in the cell membrane was seen upon cell sorting analysis. There was a significant shift in the fluorescence of the cells (clone 26) transfected with RPTPβ as compared with the control (untransfected cells) and cells transfected with the vector only (Fig. 10 B). VacA has been implicated as one of the major pathogenic factors inH. pylori-induced disease. VacA has been found mainly in the gastric mucosa, and its ability to cause vacuolation has been widely documented in many cell types, with the notable exception of HL-60 (6.Cover T.L. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 127-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). de Bernard et al. (19.de Bernard M. Moschioni M. Papini E. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) recently reported that PMA induced VacA susceptibility in HL-60 cells and increased the sensitivity of HeLa cells to VacA. The increased sensitivity of HeLa cells to VacA required protein kinase C activation for 10–15 h, suggesting that it resulted from new protein synthesis. Because we purified a putative receptor for VacA from AZ-521 cells and identified it as RPTPβ,1 we investigated the association between differentiation of HL-60 cells induced with several agents and RPTPβ expression or VacA sensitivity to determine whether RPTPβ indeed serves as the primary functional receptor for VacA. We also attempted to express RPTPβ in BHK-21 cells, another cell line that is resistant to VacA. We now report that VacA sensitivity clearly parallels induction of RPTPβ mRNA expression by PMA (Fig. 3). In HL-60 cells both induction of VacA sensitivity and expression of RPTPβ mRNA were directly dependent on the concentration and time of exposure of cells to PMA. In addition to enhanced RPTPβ mRNA expression in HL-60 cells treated with PMA, an increased amount of RPTPβ protein was demonstrated using indirect immunofluorescence. The mean fluorescence per cell of RPTPβ was clearly greater after PMA treatment, which did not alter the fluorescence of cells reacted with nonspecific antibodies, indicating the presence of newly expressed surface RPTPβ (Fig. 4). Thus, PMA substantially increased both RPTPβ mRNA and protein in HL-60 cells, strongly suggesting that the acquisition of VacA sensitivity of HL-60 cells induced by PMA resulted from newly expressed RPTPβ. This hypothesis was further examined by assessing the effects of RPTPβ antisense oligonucleotide on the induction of the VacA sensitivity by PMA and on the expression of RPTPβ protein (Figs. 5and 6) as well as by colocalization of VacA and RPTPβ in PMA-treated HL-60 cells (Fig. 7). Treatment of HL-60 cells with RPTPβ antisense oligonucleotide before incubation with PMA led to the dose-dependent decrease in VacA sensitivity, whereas RPTPβ sense oligonucleotide was without effect (Fig. 5). Antisense oligonucleotide also decreased RPTPβ expression (by FACScan) in a dose-dependent manner, whereas sense oligonucleotide had no effect (Fig. 6). Confocal microscopy revealed that RPTPβ was mainly located near the plasma membrane with some in the cytoplasm. Both RPTPβ and VacA colocalized to a significant extent in the two regions. VacA was also found outside of the region of colocalization with RPTPβ, possibly on the exterior of the cell. The latter may represent toxin bound but not yet internalized. The site of localization of VacA with RPTPβ in the cytoplasm is unclear; it may represent an endosomal structure involved in toxin processing. Numerous agents have been used to induce differentiation of HL-60 cells (18.Collins S. Blood. 1987; 70: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMA inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell adhesion, spreading, and phagocytic activity, all characteristic of macrophage-like cells (14.Huberman E. Callaham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 15.Rovera G. Santoli D. Damsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In this study, consistent with published findings (14.Huberman E. Callaham M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), almost 80% of cultured HL-60 cells became adherent to the surface after 24 h of incubation with 10 nm PMA. Retinoic acid and Me2SO at a concentration that causes development into granulocytic cells failed to induce RPTPβ expression (Fig. 9) or VacA sensitivity (Fig. 8). Because PMA is usually grouped with VitD3 and IFN-γ among reagents that stimulate differentiation of HL-60 cells into monocytic/macrophage-like cells, the latter were tested for their ability to induce VacA sensitivity. Like PMA, both agents induced VacA sensitivity and increased expression of RPTPβ mRNA and protein in HL-60 cells. RPTPβ cDNA was also stably expressed in BHK-21 cells. Cells expressing RPTPβ (clone 26) showed greater sensitivity to VacA on the neutral red uptake assay than did control cells or those transfected with vector only (Fig. 10 A). Presence of the newly expressed RPTPβ was confirmed on FACScan analysis by the shifting of the curve to the right for BHK-21 clone 26 (Fig. 10 B). Thus, we have proven that expression of RPTPβ cDNA confers VacA sensitivity on both HL-60 cells during PMA-induced differentiation to macrophage/monocytic-like cells and BHK-21 cells transfected with the RPTPβ cDNA. This further supports our hypothesis that RPTPβ acts as the receptor for VacA. RPTPβ is most abundant in cells of nervous system where it regulates the maturation, development, and differentiation of neuronal and glial cells (31.Holland S. Peles E. Pawson T. Schelssinger J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It is postulated that phosphorylation (32.Meighan-Mantha R.L. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. Exp.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1C, has been reported to play an important role in suppressing the proliferation of hematopoietic cells and inducing cellular maturation (36.Walton K. Dixon J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The high expression of PTP1C in HL-60 cells appears to be involved in the enhancement of susceptibility to macrophage-like differentiation by PMA (37.Kasugai I Morimoto K. Hayakawa T. Cancer Lett. 1997; 120: 223-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in the early stages of the differentiation of HL-60 cells by PMA, the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region of cytosolic, but not that of transmembrane RPTPε, was dramatically elevated, and cytosolic RPTPε mRNA was highly expressed, suggesting its involvement in the events leading to differentiation of HL-60 cells (20.Tanuma N. Nakamura K. Kikuchi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38.Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad., Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12235-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RPTPβ may also promote maturation of HL-60 cells into a monocytic/macrophage phenotype. The exact mechanism by which vacuolization is related to signaling from RPTPβ remains to be determined. Interaction of VacA with RPTPβ may serve to bind the toxin to the cell surface and promote internalization. Alternatively, VacA may affect the activity of RPTPβ and then facilitate its entrance leading to vacuolation of the cells. We thank I. Kato (Medical School of Chiba University), M.

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been implicated in many cellular processes including replication, transcription, and the maintenance of genomic stability. However, studies with mice and cells lacking PARP-1 reveal a critical role for the enzyme in the maintenance of genomic integrity only. Recently, a significant level of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity has been detected in fibroblasts derived from mice lacking PARP-1 following treatment with genotoxic agents (Shieh, W. M., Amé, J-C., Wilson, M. V., Wang, Z-Q., Koh, D. W., Jacobson, M. K., and Jacobson, E. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 30069–30072). We have isolated a cDNA that originates from PARP-1 (−/−) fibroblasts and encodes a polypeptide of 493 amino acid residues bearing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. This protein, that we named sPARP-1 for shortpoly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1, has a calculated mass of 55.3 kDa and is identical in deduced amino acid sequence to the catalytic domain of PARP-1. Radiation hybrid analysis assigned the sPARP-1 gene to the chromosome 1H5-H6 in an immediate proximity to the known location of PARP-1 gene, indicating that sPARP-1 and PARP-1 are most probably products of the same gene. Active sPARP-1 is present in both PARP-1 (+/+) and PARP-1 (−/−) cells as demonstrated by activity-Western blotting and immunostaining using a specific antibody developed against sPARP-1. Like PARP-1, sPARP-1 is localized in the cell nucleus, uses NAD+ as a substrate and is inhibited by nicotinamide analogues. sPARP-1 produces pADPr of similar length and structure to that of PARP-1. However, contrary to PARP-1, sPARP-1 does not require DNA strand breaks for its activation, although it is stimulated following genotoxic treatments.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-11; EC 2.4.2.30), the only well characterized enzyme in animal cells that catalyzes pADPr synthesis, comprises three functional domains: a DNA-binding domain, an automodification domain, and a catalytic domain (15.Kameshita I. Matsuda Z. Taniguchi T. Shizuta Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4770-4776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal DNA-binding domain (apparent molecular mass 46 kDa) contains two zinc fingers, responsible for the recognition and binding to both single and double DNA strand breaks, as well as a bipartite nuclear localization signal (16.Schreiber V. Molinete M. Boeuf H. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The 55-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain that bears the NAD+-binding site and the catalytic activity represents the most highly conserved part of the enzyme (3.de Murcia G. Menissier de Murcia J.

The enzymatic activity of the COOH-terminal domain is greatly enhanced upon the binding of PARP-1 to DNA strand breaks (15.Kameshita I. Matsuda Z. Taniguchi T. Shizuta Y. J. Biol.

The central 16-kDa automodification domain is rich in glutamic acid residues, which are sites for covalent binding of pADPr (22.Desmarais Y. Menard L. Lagueux J. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This domain contains a BRCT domain, a putative site of interactions with other proteins (23.Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P.

To better define the biological functions of PARP-1 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, PARP-1 (−/−) mice have been independently generated by three groups (25.Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H.

The primary phenotype in these animals is genomic instability following DNA damage (26.Ménissier-de Murcia J. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Javier Olivier F. Masson M.

Jantsch M. Los M. Schulze-Osthoff K. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2347-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although a slightly reduced proliferation rate is observed in derived PARP-1 (−/−) cells, no effect on cell cycle profile or on cell differentiation has been reported. Moreover, the homozygous mutant mice develop normally and are fertile (29.Le Rhun Y. Kirkland J.B. Shah G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These observations are hard to reconcile with previous studies showing that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is involved in many important processes related to DNA metabolism. However, recent studies have shown that PARP-1 (−/−) cells retain the ability to synthesize pADPr following treatment with genotoxic agents, suggesting the presence of an as yet unidentified enzyme with this activity (30.Shieh W.M.

This idea is supported by the discovery of two structurally different and functionally active PARP proteins in plants (31.Lepiniec L. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Van Montagu M. Inze D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32.Babiychuk E. Cottrill P.B. Strorozhenko S. Fuangthong M. Chen Y. O'Farrell M.K. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Kushnir S.

Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Three recent papers describe the cloning of new PARP family members cDNAs from mouse and human cells (PARP-2 and PARP-3) (34.Berghammer H. Ebner M. Marksteiner R. Auer B.

In this paper, we show that a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity is present in immortalized PARP-1 (−/−) embryonic mouse fibroblasts (25.Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and report the cloning of a cDNA that encodes a protein responsible for pADPr synthesis. The enzyme, designated sPARP-1 (forshort poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1), is identical to the catalytic domain of PARP-1 and shares most of the well documented features of the carboxyl-terminal part of PARP-1. The determination of the chromosomal localization of sPARP-1 gene leads us to conclude that both sPARP-1 and PARP-1 are products of the PARP-1 gene. sPARP-1 is present in wild type and PARP-1 (−/−) cells and is localized in the nucleus. Although the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity of sPARP-1 is DNA strand break-independent, it is strongly stimulated by genotoxic treatments such as alkylation and UV irradiation, suggesting the involvement of PARP-1 and sPARP-1 in different types of DNA damage-inducible response pathways. The enzymes poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase were purified as described previously (37.Zahradka P. Ebisuzaki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 38.Thomassin H. Jacobson M.K. Guay J. Verreault A. Aboul-ela N. Ménard L. Poirier G.G.

The PARP-1 inhibitors 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), 1,5-dihydroxyquinolinediol, and 3-methoxybenzamide were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Canada (Oakville, Ontario), as well as the alkylating agent,N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), and DNase I-activated DNA. All reagents were of analytical grade. The mouse fibroblast L (PARP-1 (+/+)), the PARP-1 (−/−) mouse embryo fibroblast A1, and the A1 mother cell line F20 (PARP-1 (+/+)) (25.Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) was modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bicarbonate for L cells, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium low glucose supplemented with 1%l-glutamine and 0.2% bicarbonate for A1 and F20 cells. Penicillin (100 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum were added to both media. A1 cells were always maintained in presence of 600 μg/ml neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) as a selection agent (25.Wang Z.Q. Auer B. Stingl L. Berghammer H. Haidacher D. Schweiger M. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Cells grown to 80% confluence were treated at 37 °C for various times with either 100 μmMNNG in serum-free medium or with a germicidal lamp (G. W. Gates & Co. Inc., New York) at a dose of 30 J/m2 as verified with an ultraviolet meter (Ultra-Violet Products Inc., Upland, CA). To study the inhibition of pADPr synthesis, cells were preincubated with 2 mm 1,5-dihydroxyquinolinediol for 5 min at 37 °C. PADPr and NAD+ were affinity purified on a dihydroxyboronyl-Bio-Rex 70 matrix as described earlier (39.Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J-C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) except that the elutions were performed with water at 37 °C. The amount of synthesized pADPr was estimated by immunodot blot (40.Affar E.B. Duriez P.J. Shah R.G. Sallmann F.R. Bourassa S. Kupper J.H. Burkle A. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 280-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), while the analysis and measurements of NAD+ were performed using an enzyme cycling assay (39.Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G. Desnoyers S. Lagueux J. Verreault A. Hoflack J-C. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from PARP-1 (−/−) cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (41.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Three μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed at 42 °C using oligo(dT)16 primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For PCR amplification, primers were chosen based on the cDNA sequences present in the catalytic domain of PARP-1 that were most conserved among species (5′-primer: 5′-CTTCTGGAGGACGACAAGGA-3′; 3′-primer: 5′-CCACAGGGATGTCTTAAAAT-3′). Restriction sites EcoRI and HindIII were added to the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. Five μl of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was directly added to 95 μl of PCR reaction mixture containing thermopol buffer, 200 μm of each dNTP, 100 mm MgSO4, 15 pmol of each 3′- and 5′-primer, and 0.8 units of Vent DNA polymerase for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min. and 72 °C for 2 min. We obtained thus a partial cDNA of sPARP-1, referred to as sPARPcat, which was cloned into EcoRI-HindIII restriction sites of pBlueScript SK− (Stratagene). The 5′ end of the sPARP-1 cDNA was amplified using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit from CLONTECH. First-strand cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA extracted from A1 cells catalyzed by 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and using oligo(dT)16 primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final reaction volume of 15 μl. To synthesize the second-strand, 10 μl of the reverse transcription reaction mixture was incubated with 40 units of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, 1.5 units of RNase H, and 15 units of E. coli DNA ligase in a final volume of 80 μl according to the CLONTECH protocol. After 1.5 h of incubation at 16 °C, 10 units of T4 DNA polymerase were added to the reaction mixture and further incubated at 16 °C for 45 min to create blunt ends on the double-stranded cDNA. The Marathon cDNA adaptor was ligated to the 5′ and 3′ extremities of the phenol-purified double-stranded cDNA, using 1 unit of T4 DNA ligase to catalyze this reaction at 16 °C overnight. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed with an adaptor primer supplied with the kit (AP2; CLONTECH) and the 3′ gene-specific primer described above (30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 3 min). The correct PCR product was identified by hybridization using 32P-labeled sPARPcat as a probe, purified from agarose gel (GenecleanTMSpin, Bio-101) and reamplified using AP2 and a 3′ nested gene-specific primer containing SacI restriction site (5′-CATCCCCACCAGCTCCTGCACTG-3′) (5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 3 min, 5 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 3 min; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 68 °C for 3 min). The PCR product (5′-sPARP) was then introduced in XbaI andSacI restriction sites of pBluescript SK−. The total cDNA for sPARP-1 was sequenced according to the Sanger method (42.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The 5′-untranslated region of the sPARP-1 gene was PCR amplified using the following pair of primers: 5′-GGTGAAGATGAGTAAGAAGATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGCTGTCAAGGAAGGAG-3′ (reverse). These primers yield a 235-bp product from mouse genomic DNA but no amplification from hamster genomic DNA. The PCR screening of the mouse T31 panel, which contained DNA from 100 radiation hybrid clones plus two control DNAs (donor 129aa and recipient A23), was accomplished at Research Genetics, Inc., Huntsville, AL. To map thesPARP-1 gene, the data vector, obtained by scoring the radiation hybrid clones for a presence or absence of the 235-bp product specific for the sPARP-1 gene, was submitted to the web server of MIT Whitehead Institute. Mouse genomic DNA was isolated from fibroblast cells and subjected to Southern blotting according to the standard procedure (43.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Coloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of the genomic DNA was digested with each of EcoRI, HindIII,BamHI, or PstI restriction endonucleases, fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel and alkaline-transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled 235-bp PCR product, generated by the primers used for radiation hybrid mapping. Sample preparation was carried out essentially as described earlier (44.Desnoyers S. Shah G.M. Brochu G. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) except that protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete, Mini; Roche Molecular Bichemicals, Ontario, Canada) were used as antiproteases. The poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity was visualized as described previously (45.Shah G.M. Kaufmann S.H. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the gel was then soaked at 37 °C in Tris glycine running buffer containing 0.7 m2-mercaptoethanol and the proteins were transferred onto a Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After refolding of proteins in renaturation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Tween), the enzymatic reaction was started by incubating the membrane in the same buffer supplemented with 2 μg/ml DNase I-activated DNA, 2 mm Mg2+, 20 μm Zn2+, and 100 μm NAD+. Noncovalently bound pADPr was removed by four washes with SDS wash buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2% SDS). Finally, covalently automodified proteins were detected by using a 1:500 diluted monoclonal antibody 10H, directed against the pADPr (46.Kawamitsu H. Hoshino H. Okada H. Miwa M. Momoi H. Sugimura T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3771-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and visualized with 1:5000 diluted secondary peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoReasearch) and enhanced chemiluminiscence reagent (Renaissance ECL-Plus, DuPont). The chemical and enzymatic stripping of the activity-Western blots were performed as described earlier (44.Desnoyers S. Shah G.M. Brochu G. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A peptide (MPSKEDAVEHFMKLY) chosen from the predicted amino acid sequence of sPARP-1 was synthesized on a four-branch Multiple Antigenic Peptide resin (47.Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar, 48.Briand J.P. Barin C. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Muller S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 156: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) using a 433A Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer with Fast-MOC chemistry and injected into a rabbit to raise the polyclonal antipeptide antibody (LR98–196) directed against sPARP-1. The antiserum was affinity purified on Affi-Gel 10 resin (Bio-Rad) coupled with the same peptide. For Western blot analysis of sPARP-1, nuclear proteins from PARP-1 (+/+) and PARP-1 (−/−) cells were resolved on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skimmed milk and 0.1% Tween. Blots were incubated overnight with affinity purified LR98–196 diluted 1:100 followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoReasearch) diluted 1:2500 in blocking solution. Immunocomplexes were detected by ECL (Renaissance ECL-Plus, DuPont). Cells grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm dishes were incubated for 7 min with 500 μl of buffer A (300 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, CompleteTM Mini antiprotease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) supplemented with 0.03% Nonidet P-40. After homogenization with a glass-Teflon homogenizer (20 strokes), the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g. The cytoplasmic supernatant was removed and the pelleted nuclei were washed three times in 500 μl of buffer A. The nuclear proteins were solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reducing loading buffer (49.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1 st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), sonicated, and kept at −80 °C for further analyses. All the steps were performed at 4 °C. PARP-1 (−/−) cells were grown in basal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and supplemented with 400 μCi of [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol; NENTM Life Science Products, Inc.). The nuclear fraction prepared as described above was resuspended in column loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1M NaCl, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, one CompleteTM Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml of buffer) and sonicated on ice. The protein lysate was loaded on an Econo-Column containing 400 μl of equilibrated 3-AB-Affi-Gel matrix prepared as described elsewhere (50.D'Amours D. Duriez P.J. Orth K. Shah R.G. Dixit V.M. Earnshaw W.C. Alnemri E.S. Poirier G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer followed by elution with a 10 mmsolution of 3-methoxybenzamide. Fractions of 200 μl were recovered and 30 μl of each fraction was analyzed by autoradiography after a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PADPr was analyzed by electrophoresis at 400 V on a 20% polyacrylamide gel essentially as described elsewhere (51.Alvarez-Gonzales R. Jacobson M.K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3218-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). PADPr was transferred onto a Hybond N+membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and immunodetected as described previously (52.Affar E.B. Duriez P.I. Shah R.G. Winstall E. Germain M. Boucher C. Bourassa S. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PARP-1 (−/−) cells, grown to confluence on coverslips, were treated with 200 μmMNNG for 20 min, briefly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in acetone/methanol (0.3/0.7, v/v) at −20 °C for 10 min. After saturation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% non-fat milk and 0.1% Tween, cells were incubated in the same buffer with the polyclonal antibody LP96–10 diluted 1:250 (52.Affar E.B. Duriez P.I. Shah R.G. Winstall E. Germain M. Boucher C. Bourassa S. Kirkland J.B. Poirier G.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and subsequently with a 1:50 diluted secondary Texas Red-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Slides were analyzed by indirect fluorescence microscopy. For the immunoanalysis using the polyclonal anti-peptide antibody LR98-196, the procedure was essentially the same, except that PARP-1 (−/−) cells were not treated with alkylating agent and the secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. PARP-1 (−/−) cells grown to 80% confluence in 6-well plates, were treated for different time intervals with 100 μm MNNG as described above. The genomic DNA was extracted and prepared as described previously (53.Legault J. Tremblay A. Ramotar D. Mirault M-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5437-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 3′ end of DNA breaks was radiolabeled by a nucleotide exchange reaction catalyzed by the T4 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the presence of [32P]dCTP (NENTM Life Science Products, Inc.) and quantified according to the method of Legault et al.(53.Legault J. Tremblay A. Ramotar D. Mirault M-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5437-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with alkylating agents such as MNNG usually leads to pADPr synthesis. In contrast, other genotoxic agents, like UVC for instance, do not significantly induce the synthesis of pADPr. PARP-1 is the only well characterized enzyme responsible for the synthesis of pADPr following DNA damage. To determine whether PARP-1 is solely responsible for pADPr synthesis, we have studied this activity in PARP-1 (−/−) cells. Wild type and mutant cells were treated with 100 μm MNNG or UVC irradiated with a dose of 30 J/m2 for different periods of time up to 60 min. After purification by affinity chromatography, the amount of pADPr at each time point was measured by an immunodot blot assay as described earlier (39.Shah G.M. Poirier D. Duchaine C. Brochu G.

Table I shows the peak levels of pADPr found in PARP-1 (−/−) and PARP-1 (+/+; F20) cells. Treatment of cells for 20 min with 100 μm MNNG results in a synthesis of 5.85 pmol of pADPr per mg of DNA for PARP-1 (−/−) cells, whereas 60 pmol of pADPr per mg of DNA are synthesized by PARP-"

A revised model for the mechanism of the allosteric activation of antithrombin is proposed. polyethylene glycol root mean square Antithrombin is unique as a proteinase inhibitor because it requires allosteric activation. Its cofactor, heparin, binds antithrombin via a specific pentasaccharide domain that accounts for its anticoagulant activity. Antithrombin plays a critical role in the prevention of thrombosis by inhibiting the final two proteinases in the blood coagulation cascade, factor Xa and thrombin. The tight regulation of antithrombin involves the following: 1) maintenance of an inactive, native pool in plasma at 2.3 μm; 2) localization to the vascular endothelium through binding to glycosaminoglycans; 3) conformational activation; 4) ability to undergo a massive conformational rearrangement upon reaction with proteinase; and 5) release from glycosaminoglycan upon formation of complex with proteinase. The complexity of the role of antithrombin in hemostasis is illustrated by the wide range of antithrombin mutations that lead to thromboembolic disorders (2.Lane D.A. Bayston T. Olds R.J. Fitches A.C. Cooper D.N. Millar D.S. Jochmans K. Perry D.J. Okajima K. Thein S.L. Emmerich J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Antithrombin is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors and maintains the overall serpin fold (3.Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 4.Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J. Grootenhuis P.D. Hol W.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It is thus capable of undergoing a dramatic conformational rearrangement upon attack by a cognate proteinase at position P1–P1′ (nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (1.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4759) Google Scholar)) where the surface-exposed reactive center loop is incorporated as strand four in the central β-sheet A (5.Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The loop-inserted form is significantly more stable than the native form of serpins (6.Hood D.B. Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5455-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it is believed that the energy required to stabilize the inhibitory complex with a proteinase is supplied from loop insertion (8.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins. 1995; 22: 210-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All of the known structures of native serpins maintain a flexible, exposed reactive center loop containing a proteinase-accessible P1 side chain, with the exception of antithrombin (3.Carrell R.W.

The reactive center loop of native antithrombin is constrained by the insertion of hinge region residues P15 and P14 as s4A, resulting in interactions between the P1 Arg side chain and the body of the serpin (Fig. 1). The conformation of the reactive center loop of native antithrombin is the structural basis of its marginal rate of factor Xa inhibition. The structure of pentasaccharide-bound antithrombin has recently been solved by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 1) and reveals expulsion of the hinge region and secondary structural changes in the heparin binding region consisting of helix A and D elongation and helix P formation (15.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have indicated that activation is ultimately the result of the reorientation of the cognate P1 Arg from interacting with the main body of the protein to pointing out toward a potential attacking proteinase (16.Pike R.N. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H.L. McGraw W.T. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reorientation of the P1 side chain is not seen in the pentasaccharide-bound structure, presumably due to contacts between the reactive center loop of the active monomer and its latent counterpart. Activation can also be effected by the forced expulsion of the hinge region through substitution of the P14 Ser with bulky or charged residues. This has been shown using a P14 Ser → Trp, which gave a 3-fold increase in rate of reaction with factor Xa (17.Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and for a P14 Ser → Cys variant derivatized with fluorescein that was fully activated toward factor Xa (460-fold over P14-Cys control) (18.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such variants achieve activation through a destabilization of the native state resulting in a shifting of the equilibrium position between the native and activated states (Fig. 1). In contrast, the pentasaccharide alters the equilibrium position by stabilizing the activated state. This is borne out by thermal denaturation studies that show a 10 °C increase in stability for antithrombin bound to the physiological pentasaccharide, a 20 °C increase in stability for antithrombin bound to a synthetic pentasaccharide with a 100-fold higher affinity for antithrombin (19.Beauchamp N.J. Pike R.N. Daly M. Butler L. Makris M. Dafforn T.R. Zhou A. Fitton H.L. Preston F.E. Peake I.R. Carrell R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 2696-2706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and an 8 °C decrease in stability for the native fluorescein-labeled variant when compared with the control, P14-Cys, which itself was more than 2 °C more stable than the recombinant background (18.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In all studies, the level of activation against factor Xa is dependent on the energy difference between the native and activated states. The structures of native and pentasaccharide-bound antithrombins, as well as the biochemical studies on P14 variants, provide convincing evidence that activation requires the expulsion of the hinge region. A major question remains concerning the mechanism of allosteric activation of antithrombin. How do the local structural changes caused by pentasaccharide binding result in the expulsion of the hinge region from β-sheet A? It was hypothesized by van Boeckel and colleagues (20.van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), based on the structure of native antithrombin and computer simulations, that binding of the pentasaccharide occurred at the C terminus of helix D and that expulsion of the reactive center loop resulted from a mechanical force effected on strand 2A by the C-terminal elongation of helix D. The structure of pentasaccharide-bound antithrombin revealed both helix D elongation and loop expulsion but not, as proposed, through direct interaction between the elongated portion of helix D and the pentasaccharide. This leaves the question of how pentasaccharide binding causes expulsion of the hinge region from β-sheet A. We hypothesize that the D-helix elongation is a consequence of the electrostatic effect of pentasaccharide binding and that expulsion is not effected by a mechanical force but rather a perturbation of surface electrostatics that help determine the equilibrium position between the native and activated forms. This hypothesis is tested here by determining the structure of an antithrombin variant, N135Q, S380C, that is fully activated in solution in the absence of pentasaccharide due to the presence of a bulky fluorescein moiety bound at the P14 position (18.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We specifically address the questions of how the solution equilibrium between the native and activated states is maintained and how remote binding of the pentasaccharide confers its effect on the conformation of the reactive center loop. The S380C variant of antithrombin was produced on the recombinant β-glycoform antithrombin template of N135Q, as described previously (17.Huntington J.A. Olson S.T. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), in order to reduce heparin binding heterogeneity. The variant was then reacted with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein, obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, on a 1-ml heparin-Sepharose column with a continuous loop run overnight at room temperature. After washing with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris, 10 mm sodium citrate, 5 mmEDTA, pH 7.4), the derivatized variant was eluted with a NaCl gradient as a single peak at about 1.7 m NaCl. The pooled fractions were 76% labeled, based on differential absorbance at 280 and 494 nm, and buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Crystallization was achieved as described previously (15.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, equimolar amounts of the derivatized or underivatized variant and previously prepared plasma latent antithrombins were mixed with a concentrated solution of the precipitant in a 10-well glass plate. Final concentrations were 5 mg/ml protein, 10.5% PEG1 4000, 65 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Crystals grew within 2 weeks of mixing and were yellow/green for the fluorescein-labeled variant. Diffraction data were collected at the SRS Daresbury, UK, on beamline 7.2 for P14-fluorescein and 9.6 for the P14-Cys control using a single frozen crystal of each. Cryoprotection for the P14-fluorescein variant crystal was effected by quickly dipping the crystal into a solution of 10% methylpentanediol, 15% glycerol, 10.5% PEG 4000, 100 mm cacodylate, pH 6.5, and quick freezing in the cryostream at 100 K. The control crystal, P14-Cys, was dehydrated in 20% PEG 4000 and the cryoprotected with 20% glycerol. Useful data were obtained to a resolution limit of 2.85 and 2.8 Å for P14-fluorescein and P14-Cys, respectively, and processed using the programs of the CCP4 suite (22.Leslie A.W.G.

Open table in a new tab All comparisons were between the structure of the α-glycoform of plasma antithrombin (31.Skinner R. Abrahams J.P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol.

Jin, and R. Carrell, manuscript in preparation. This structure was chosen over the P14-Cys for comparison with the P14-fluorescein structure due to its higher resolution and better electron density in the regions of interest. 4We refer to the α-glycoform of plasma antithrombin that contains all four N-linked carbohydrate chains as plasma antithrombin. Recombinant antithrombin variants S380C and S380C-fluorescein are made on the recombinant β-glycoform template of N135Q to eliminate glycosylation heterogeneity and increase affinity for heparin-Sepharose. Variants are designated P14-Cys and P14-fluorescein after the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (1.Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4759) Google Scholar) where P1–P1′ is the scissile bond, and the P and P′ numbering increases towards the N and C termini, respectively. Crystallization of the P14-fluorescein variant was facilitated by the addition of equimolar amounts of the latent conformer of plasma antithrombin (15.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M.

Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus the asymmetric unit consists of an active/latent dimer, as in all other crystal structures of antithrombin (3.Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 15.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), in which the reactive center loop of the active monomer replaces s1C of its latent partner. The Cα trace of the dimer of P14-fluorescein and latent plasma antithrombins is given in Fig.2 a. Although the biochemical activity of the variant indicated that the fluorescein at position P14 induced a full conversion to the activated conformation, the structure was found to be in the partially inserted form as in native antithrombin. This is most likely due to the difference in environment between solution and crystal and the constraints imposed by the formation of the dimer. The long and flexible linker allowed for the accommodation of the bulky fluorophore on the surface of β-sheet A with minimal perturbation of the backbone conformation for residues 378, 379, and 380 (P16 to P14). Fig. 2 b is an electron density map of the region surrounding the fluorescein moiety and clearly demonstrates its position. The overall Cα r.m.s. deviation for the residues from 40 to 431 between the P14-fluorescein and plasma antithrombins was 0.936 Å, with the core of the molecule essentially unchanged. Comparison with the structure of native plasma antithrombin reveal two regions that have been significantly perturbed by the fluorescein as follows: the hinge region, of which the fluorescein labeled cysteine is a part, and the heparin binding region. Fig.2 c is a ribbon diagram of P14-fluorescein illustrating the secondary structural changes in the heparin binding region, and Fig.2 d is a space filling representation of the fluorescein-labeled antithrombin variant colored according to amino acid r.m.s. deviation from plasma antithrombin. Residues with atoms deviating by more than 2 Å are colored magenta with the fluorescein in green and the reactive center Arg inred. Most of the atoms that deviated significantly were from side chains except for the N terminus of helix A and the C terminus of helix D which deviated significantly in main chain atoms. Central to the question of what confers the special properties of antithrombin is the issue of why, in contrast to other serpins, the native conformation has its hinge region inserted in β-sheet A. The fully activated properties of P14-fluorescein antithrombin indicate that it exists predominantly in the loop-expelled conformation in solution. From this it is concluded that the fluorescein adduct is responsible for the change in position of the solution equilibrium. We therefore focused on the hinge region interactions that are perturbed by the fluorescein, and we identified a network of interactions in native antithrombin centered about Glu381 (P13), which forms a bridge between the hinge region, the helix F loop, and strands three and five of β-sheet A, which are altered in the P14-fluorescein structure. Fig.3 is a close-up of the hinge regions of native (a), P14-fluorescein (b), and pentasaccharide bound (c) antithrombins. The native interactions include hinge region residue Glu381 (P13), helix F loop residues Glu195 and Arg197, s3A residues Tyr220 and Lys222, and s5A Phe372 and Glu374. These interactions are perturbed by the presence of the fluorescein moiety in the P14-fluorescein variant that replaces the side chain position of the P13 Glu in the native structure and forces its reorientation toward the position occupied in the pentasaccharide-activated conformation. Disruption of these interactions could account for the loss of stability of the native P14-fluorescein variant (18.Huntington J.A. Gettins P.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3272-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and, consequently, its fully activated solution properties. Comparison to the pentasaccharide-bound form also reveals the role of P13 Glu in stabilizing the activated, five-stranded form by shifting toward the heparin binding region and interacting with Lys139 and Lys222 of s2A and s3A, respectively. P13 Glu in the fluorescein variant shifts similarly due to the presence of the fluorescein group at P14 into close proximity to Lys139 but without making a hydrogen bond. The effect of the reorganization of the charged residues constituting the network surrounding P13 Glu is an alteration of the surface electrostatic potential of antithrombin (Fig.4).Figure 4Surface potential maps of native plasma (a) and the fluorescein variant (b) antithrombins demonstrate an electrostatic link between the hinge and heparin binding regions. The orientation of the maps is similar to that of Fig. 2 d.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As Fig. 2 cdemonstrates, there is a change in secondary structure in the heparin binding region similar to that found in the pentasaccharide-bound antithrombin. The P14-fluorescein variant was made on the recombinant β template N135Q which prevents glycosylation at this position. We observed the presence of a hydrogen bond between Gln135 and a main chain N on s2A. To ensure that the altered helix D conformation for the P14-fluorescein variant was not due to the N135Q background, we also crystallized and solved the structure of the S380C,N135Q variant in the absence of fluorescein. As Fig. 5demonstrates, the conformation of the recombinant control more closely resembles that of glycosylated plasma antithrombin with a surface-exposed side chain at position 135. This confirms that the structural changes in helix D of P14-fluorescein are the result of the presence of the fluorescein adduct in the hinge region. Recent attention has been drawn to the potential role of helix A elongation in the mechanism of activation of antithrombin. Clearly, residues Arg46 and Arg47 are involved in the binding of heparin but are not critical (34.Arocas V. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our control structure of P14-Cys showed the same helix A elongation as the fluorescein-derivatized variant, extending to Asn45 as in the pentasaccharide-bound antithrombin. In addition, the structure of latent antithrombin in complex with the pentasaccharide shows both helix A elongation and helix P formation identical to the pentasaccharide-bound active monomer, but no elongation of helix D is observed (15.Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that helix A elongation and helix P formation facilitate tight interaction with the pentasaccharide but are not involved in the transmission of conformational change to the hinge region. Fig. 2 d demonstrates that, in addition to secondary structural changes in the heparin binding region, the presence of the fluorescein perturbs the conformation of the side chains on the surface of the variant. Interestingly, these limited changes form a link between the fluorescein moiety in the hinge region and the heparin binding region. The surface electrostatic potentials of the plasma and P14-fluorescein antithrombins oriented as in Fig. 2 d are given in Fig. 4. Here too, the conformational link between the two regions is evident. More importantly, this comparison demonstrates that the effect of the perturbation of the interactions in the hinge region results in long range surface potential changes in the heparin binding region. Regulation of antithrombin activity through binding to heparin-like oligosaccharides depends on a native fold which is kinetically inactive toward its target proteases. Therefore, how the native conformation is maintained and how heparin binding results in activation are central to understanding the special role antithrombin plays in the coagulation pathway. The structure of the P14-fluorescein variant of antithrombin described here directly addresses these issues. Interpretation of the structure in terms of the mechanism of activation requires a two-state model where the degree of activation depends on the position of the equilibrium between the two states, native and activated. The native state has a six-stranded β-sheet A due to the incorporation of the hinge region residues P15 and P14 as s4A, and the activated state has a five-stranded β-sheet A and resembles all of the other known structures of native serpins. Activation is normally achieved by the binding of a specific pentasaccharide sequence that stabilizes the five-stranded form resulting in its dominating the solution equilibrium. Due to the large structural changes accompanying pentasaccharide binding, the structures of the native and pentasaccharide-bound states are not alone sufficient for identification of the interactions that stabilize the native state in the absence of oligosaccharide. We crystallized the P14-fluorescein variant in a state that represents the left-hand side of the solution equilibrium illustrated in Fig. 1. This allows for the identification of the hinge region interactions involved in stabilizing the native conformation, since they would necessarily be altered by the presence of the fluorescein adduct. We identified a network of electrostatic interactions centered on the P13 Glu which acts as a bridge between the overlying helix F loop, the hinge region, and flanking strands 3 and 5 of β-sheet A. These interactions are undone by the presence of the fluorescein in the structure of the variant. From the biochemical characterization of the variant, it is possible to conclude that disruption of this network alone is sufficient for the shift in equilibrium to favor the five-stranded activated state. The major conformational change caused by the presence of the fluorescein moiety was the shifting of the P13 Glu toward the heparin binding region. It is important to note that the P13 side chain could have moved elsewhere but was found oriented toward the heparin binding region in a position similar to that found in the pentasaccharide-bound structure. We believe that the observed change in side chain orientation of the P13 Glu represents a critical step in the activation mechanism first by no longer participating in the network of interactions responsible for stabilizing the native state, and second by shifting toward the heparin binding region. We also observed changes in the conformation of the heparin binding region in the P14-fluorescein variant. These changes resemble those observed in the presence of the pentasaccharide but are not identical. This finding is of interest since it links changes in the hinge region with the heparin binding region. The space filling model given as Fig.2 d demonstrates that the conformational changes induced by the fluorescein in the hinge region are propagated to the heparin binding region, and the surface potential maps in Fig. 4 demonstrate how the two regions are linked through electrostatics. We do not see evidence of a discrete network of hydrogen bonding interactions linking the two regions in the structure of P14-fluorescein, rather, we observe a more subtle effect of charged surface side chains affecting the orientation of others nearby which hinges on the orientation of the P13 Glu side chain. This is in contrast to the mechanistic model for the transmission of conformational change proposed by van Boeckel and colleagues (20.van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These results, taken together with recent investigations into the binding of truncated pentasaccharides (32.Desai U.R. Petitou M. Bjork I. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7478-7487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 33.Petitou M. Barzu T. Herault J.P. Herbert J.M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), allow for the proposal of a more detailed model of glycosaminoglycan activation of antithrombin as follows. 1) Antithrombin exists in an equilibrium between the kinetically inactive, six-stranded, and the activated, five-stranded, conformations defined byk 2/k −2 (Fig. 1). The extent of activation upon gylcosaminoglycan binding, at saturation, is related to the strength of binding defined byk 2/k −2. 2) Glycosaminoglycan binding changes the surface electrostatic network that links the heparin-binding site and the reactive center loop so as to alter the interactions of P13 Glu that stabilize the loop-inserted conformation in the native state. 3) The pentasaccharide-induced change in surface electrostatics has two components. One is that pentasaccharide residues D, E, and F bind to helix D and increasek 2 through charge neutralization and helix D elongation. The second is that the bound state is stabilized, decreasing k −2, through interactions between pentasaccharide residues G and H and Arg46 and Arg47 on the N terminus of helix A. Efforts to create activated antithrombin variants for replacement therapy can now be focused on the interactions made by the P13 Glu residue. Destabilization of these interactions or stabilization of the activated conformer should result in a constitutively activated antithrombin."

Incubation of membranes with a photoactivable 125I-labeled PSK-α analog, [N ε-(4-azidosalicyl)Lys5]PSK-α (AS-PSK-α), followed by UV irradiation resulted in specific labeling of 120- and 160-kDa bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Planta. 1999; 207: 559-565Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, dispersed cells cannot proliferate under low cell density conditions in which secreted PSK-α is diluted below the critical concentration with excess culture medium. This autocrine type peptide growth factor has been found in conditioned medium derived from both monocot and dicot cell cultures (3.Matsubayashi Y. Takagi L. Omura N. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4.Hanai H. Matsuno T. Yamamoto M. Matsubayashi Y. Kobayashi T. Kamada H. Sakagami Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), implying that PSK-α is the general factor involved in plant cell growth. PSK-α also stimulates tracheary element differentiation of Zinniamesophyll cells (3.Matsubayashi Y. Takagi L. Omura N. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and somatic embryogenesis in carrots under defined conditions (5.Kobayashi T. Eun C.H. Hanai H. Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Kamada H. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1123-1128Google Scholar).A cDNA encoding a PSK-α precursor has been isolated from cDNA library constructed using poly(A)+ mRNA purified from rice cells cultured for 10 days (6.Yang H. Matsubayashi Y. Nakamura K. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cDNA is 725 base pairs in length, and the 89-amino acid product, preprophytosulfokine, has a 22-amino acid hydrophobic region that resembles a cleavable leader peptide at its NH2 terminus. The PSK-α sequence occurs only once within the precursor, close to the COOH terminus. The critical importance of preprophytosulfokine in cell growth was shown by transforming rice cells with sense and antisense rice PSKgene that is regulated by the constitutive rice actin promoter. The sense transgenic cells divided about two times faster than the controls, whereas the antisense transgenic cells had decreased mitogenic activity.Evidence for the existence of high affinity binding sites for PSK-α in rice plasma membrane was provided initially by us using [35S]PSK-α (7.Matsubayashi Y. Takagi L. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13357-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and later using [3H]PSK-α (8.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The observed binding was saturable, reversible, and localized on the outer surface of the plasma membrane of rice cells. Because the specific binding was significantly altered by the external pH and ionic strength, the ligand-receptor binding may be mainly controlled by ionic interactions. Ligand saturation analysis using [3H]PSK-α revealed the existence of both high and low affinity binding sites with K d values of 1.4 and 27 nm, respectively. Specific binding activities for [3H]PSK-α have been detected in plasma membrane fractions derived from cell lines of many plant species containing carrot, maize, asparagus, and tomato, indicating the widespread occurrence of [3H]PSK-α-binding sites (8.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At present, however, the molecular structures of PSK-α-binding sites remain rather unclear. To understand the molecular mechanism of how plant cells perceive and transduce the PSK-α signal, it is critically important to identify and characterize the receptor molecules that initially perceive the PSK-α signal.Derivatization of small peptide hormones with photoactivable groups has been utilized for characterization and purification of hormone receptors (9.Hazum E. Endocr. Rev. 1983; 4: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In these cases, a key factor in the application of such functional groups may be how to modify peptides without loss of binding activity and biological activity. Structure-activity studies for PSK-α have shown that the active core of PSK-α is an NH2-terminal tripeptide containing two sulfated groups (10.Matsubayashi Y. Hanai H. Hara O. Sakagami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on the COOH-terminal region of PSK-α for the functional derivatization of PSK-α.In this study, we prepared an 125I-labeled photoactivable PSK-α analog containing 4-azidosalicylic acid, [N ε-(4-azidosalicyl)Lys5]PSK-α, which possesses comparable binding activity with that of PSK-α in order to specifically label membrane proteins. After photoaffinity cross-linking, proteins of 120 and 160 kDa in rice plasma membranes were labeled with this ligand. These proteins fulfill the criteria expected for the high affinity PSK-α receptor(s) in terms of their affinity and specificity.DISCUSSIONAs part of a research program to characterize the PSK receptor protein, we prepared a fully active photoactivable probe that could be used in receptor visualization experiments through UV irradiation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. In designing this analog, the ε amino group of [Lys5]PSK-α appeared particularly appropriate as the site of modification for the following reasons. First, structure-activity studies demonstrated that the COOH-terminal dipeptide of PSK-α does not play a critical role in the expression of its biological activity. Second, the allylazido moiety would not be expected to interfere with receptor binding due to its remote location relative to the message portion of PSK-α.The present study demonstrated cross-linking of125I-AS-PSK-α to rice plasma membrane proteins of 120 and 160 kDa. These proteins have all the properties expected of components of the PSK-α receptor that mediates proliferation and differentiation of plant cells. (a) The photoaffinity labeling of these two species occurs at biologically relevant concentrations of the ligand, in the range 0.1–10 nm; (b) the labeling of 120- and 160-kDa proteins is inhibited by native PSK-α in a dose-dependent manner; (c) the cross-linking is not affected by PSK-α analogs that have no biological activities; (d) the binding constants of 120- and 160-kDa proteins for125I-AS-PSK-α are at the nanomolar level, in agreement with the binding constant of [3H]PSK-α for the high affinity site in the rice plasma membrane fraction (1.4 nm) and also the ED50 of PSK-α (3.8 nm) determined by bioassay using asparagus mesophyll cells (1.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar).Although we detected both high and low affinity binding sites in the rice plasma membrane fraction by the ligand binding assay using [3H]PSK-α (8.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the photoaffinity labeling described here only revealed the presence of two binding proteins with high affinity binding constants. The absence of a low affinity protein detected by photoaffinity labeling might be explained by the following. Low affinity binding site could be produced by ligand-induced changes in receptor affinities and, therefore, not present at low ligand concentrations. A negatively cooperative model for hormone-receptor interaction has been reported for several mammal growth factor receptors (16.De Meyts P. Roth J. Neville Jr., D.M. Gavin III, J.R. Lesniak M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 17.Sutter A. Riopelle R.J. Harris-Warrick R.M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol.

We therefore tried to determine the binding constants of 125I-AS-PSK-α for the two proteins at high ligand concentrations, but unfortunately the high background precluded meaningful results. Alternatively, these may be two distinct PSK-α-binding sites that have different binding affinities in the rice plasma membrane fraction, but the low affinity site could not be labeled due to its conformational characteristics.The 160-kDa protein is not a multicomponent complex resulting from covalent cross-linking of the 120-kDa protein with other membrane proteins, since 125I-AS-PSK-α possesses only one photoactivable site which usually reacts with only one target molecule. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the relative amount of labeling of the 120- and 160-kDa proteins did not change over a wide range of 125I-AS-PSK-α concentrations. The finding of two different PSK-α-binding proteins with different molecular weights can be interpreted in several ways. (a) Only the 160-kDa protein is the biologically relevant receptor, whereas the lower molecular mass 120-kDa protein is a proteolytic breakdown product. (b) The 120-kDa protein is a translation product of a truncated form of the mRNA encoding the 160-kDa protein. (c) The high affinity PSK-α receptor is associated with both of these two proteins without covalent links such as disulfide bonds. (d) Iodine radicals generated by UV irradiation may react at a site somewhat distant from the site of nitrene insertion (18.Van der Walt B. Cahnmann H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(e) The two high affinity binding sites are structurally unrelated and are involved in different biological functions of PSK-α.In the case of mammal growth factor receptor, limited and specific proteolytic processes are known to transform the native insulin receptor (19.Massague J. Pilch P.F. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3182-3190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the epidermal growth factor (20.Cassel D. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9845-9848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to lower molecular weight forms. Moreover, it has been reported that in addition to the mature 175-kDa epidermal growth factor receptor, A431 cells also possess a 95-kDa form originating from such a truncated mRNA (21.Mayes E.L.V. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this context, interpretation a or b shown above may be a better explanation for the presence of two different PSK-α-binding proteins with different molecular weights.Several well characterized mammal growth factor receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (22.Soderquist A.M. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12586-12594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (23.Daniel T.O. Milfay D.F. Escobedo J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9778-9784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and insulin receptor (24.Reed B.C. Ronnett G.V. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2908-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), contain N-linked carbohydrate side chains. It has been demonstrated that core oligosaccharide addition is essential for the acquisition of epidermal growth factor binding activity (25.Slieker L.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the oligosaccharide moieties of the insulin receptor precursor are crucial for proper processing, intracellular translocation, and formation of functionally competent insulin receptors (26.Ronnett G.V. Knutson V.P. Kohanski R.A. Simpson T.L. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4566-4575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the function of the carbohydrate moiety in PSK-α receptors is still unclear, the presence of glycosylated side chain allows us to predict that immobilized lectins will be a useful tool in the purification of the PSK-α receptors.Occurrence of specifically 125I-AS-PSK-α cross-linked proteins with similar size across distantly related plant species, rice, carrot, and tobacco, is in good agreement with the widespread occurrence of PSK-α. Although the presence of a number of receptor-like membrane proteins involved in plant growth and development has been predicted based on sequence similarities (27.Clark S.E. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 28.Hervé C. Dabos P. Galaud J.P. Rougé P. Lescure B. J. Mol.

Bleecker A.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), little is known about the receptor ligand(s) that ultimately activates the receptor function through the receptor-ligand interaction. Recent evidence implies that plants, like animals, may actually make wide use of peptide signaling (1.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 32.Marx J. Science. 1996; 273: 1338-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33.Scheer J.M. Ryan C.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), so that plant cell-to-cell communication is mediated by peptide-receptor interactions. Although further analysis of the PSK-α-binding proteins is needed to determine whether a relationship exists between the two proteins detected here, our work provides a basis for the purification and sequence analysis of PSK-α receptor(s) that perceive the extracellular peptide signal and transduce the intracellular secondary messengers activating sets of genes involved in plant cell proliferation and differentiation. Plant cells in culture secrete a sulfated pentapeptide named phytosulfokine-α (PSK-α1; Tyr(SO3H)-Ile-Tyr(SO3H)-Thr-Gln) in response to externally added auxin and cytokinin, and PSK-α triggers cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations in collaboration with plant hormones (1.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 2.Matsubayashi Y. Morita A. Matsunaga E. Furuya A. Hanai N. Sakagami Y. Planta. 1999; 207: 559-565Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, dispersed cells cannot proliferate under low cell density conditions in which secreted PSK-α is diluted below the critical concentration with excess culture medium. This autocrine type peptide growth factor has been found in conditioned medium derived from both monocot and dicot cell cultures (3.Matsubayashi Y. Takagi L. Omura N. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4.Hanai H. Matsuno T. Yamamoto M. Matsubayashi Y. Kobayashi T. Kamada H. Sakagami Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), implying that PSK-α is the general factor involved in plant cell growth. PSK-α also stimulates tracheary element differentiation of Zinniamesophyll cells (3.Matsubayashi Y. Takagi L. Omura N. Morita A. Sakagami Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and somatic embryogenesis in carrots under defined conditions (5.Kobayashi T. Eun C.H. Hanai H. Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Kamada H. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1123-1128Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a PSK-α precursor has been isolated from cDNA library constructed using poly(A)+ mRNA purified from rice cells cultured for 10 days (6.Yang H. Matsubayashi Y. Nakamura K. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cDNA is 725 base pairs in length, and the 89-amino acid product, preprophytosulfokine, has a 22-amino acid hydrophobic region that resembles a cleavable leader peptide at its NH2 terminus. The PSK-α sequence occurs only once within the precursor, close to the COOH terminus. The critical importance of preprophytosulfokine in cell growth was shown by transforming rice cells with sense and antisense rice PSKgene that is regulated by the constitutive rice actin promoter. The sense transgenic cells divided about two times faster than the controls, whereas the antisense transgenic cells had decreased mitogenic activity. Evidence for the existence of high affinity binding sites for PSK-α in rice plasma membrane was provided initially by us using [35S]PSK-α (7.Matsubayashi Y. Takagi L. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13357-13362Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and later using [3H]PSK-α (8.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The observed binding was saturable, reversible, and localized on the outer surface of the plasma membrane of rice cells. Because the specific binding was significantly altered by the external pH and ionic strength, the ligand-receptor binding may be mainly controlled by ionic interactions. Ligand saturation analysis using [3H]PSK-α revealed the existence of both high and low affinity binding sites with K d values of 1.4 and 27 nm, respectively. Specific binding activities for [3H]PSK-α have been detected in plasma membrane fractions derived from cell lines of many plant species containing carrot, maize, asparagus, and tomato, indicating the widespread occurrence of [3H]PSK-α-binding sites (8.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). At present, however, the molecular structures of PSK-α-binding sites remain rather unclear. To understand the molecular mechanism of how plant cells perceive and transduce the PSK-α signal, it is critically important to identify and characterize the receptor molecules that initially perceive the PSK-α signal. Derivatization of small peptide hormones with photoactivable groups has been utilized for characterization and purification of hormone receptors (9.Hazum E. Endocr. Rev. 1983; 4: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In these cases, a key factor in the application of such functional groups may be how to modify peptides without loss of binding activity and biological activity. Structure-activity studies for PSK-α have shown that the active core of PSK-α is an NH2-terminal tripeptide containing two sulfated groups (10.Matsubayashi Y. Hanai H. Hara O. Sakagami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, we focused on the COOH-terminal region of PSK-α for the functional derivatization of PSK-α. In this study, we prepared an 125I-labeled photoactivable PSK-α analog containing 4-azidosalicylic acid, [N ε-(4-azidosalicyl)Lys5]PSK-α, which possesses comparable binding activity with that of PSK-α in order to specifically label membrane proteins. After photoaffinity cross-linking, proteins of 120 and 160 kDa in rice plasma membranes were labeled with this ligand. These proteins fulfill the criteria expected for the high affinity PSK-α receptor(s) in terms of their affinity and specificity. DISCUSSIONAs part of a research program to characterize the PSK receptor protein, we prepared a fully active photoactivable probe that could be used in receptor visualization experiments through UV irradiation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. In designing this analog, the ε amino group of [Lys5]PSK-α appeared particularly appropriate as the site of modification for the following reasons. First, structure-activity studies demonstrated that the COOH-terminal dipeptide of PSK-α does not play a critical role in the expression of its biological activity. Second, the allylazido moiety would not be expected to interfere with receptor binding due to its remote location relative to the message portion of PSK-α.The present study demonstrated cross-linking of125I-AS-PSK-α to rice plasma membrane proteins of 120 and 160 kDa. These proteins have all the properties expected of components of the PSK-α receptor that mediates proliferation and differentiation of plant cells.

It has been demonstrated that core oligosaccharide addition is essential for the acquisition of epidermal growth factor binding activity (25.Slieker L.J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the oligosaccharide moieties of the insulin receptor precursor are crucial for proper processing, intracellular translocation, and formation of functionally competent insulin receptors (26.Ronnett G.V.

Although the function of the carbohydrate moiety in PSK-α receptors is still unclear, the presence of glycosylated side chain allows us to predict that immobilized lectins will be a useful tool in the purification of the PSK-α receptors. Occurrence of specifically 125I-AS-PSK-α cross-linked proteins with similar size across distantly related plant species, rice, carrot, and tobacco, is in good agreement with the widespread occurrence of PSK-α. Although the presence of a number of receptor-like membrane proteins involved in plant growth and development has been predicted based on sequence similarities (27.Clark S.E. Williams R.W.

Recent evidence implies that plants, like animals, may actually make wide use of peptide signaling (1.Matsubayashi Y. Sakagami Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although further analysis of the PSK-α-binding proteins is needed to determine whether a relationship exists between the two proteins detected here, our work provides a basis for the purification and sequence analysis of PSK-α receptor(s) that perceive the extracellular peptide signal and transduce the intracellular secondary messengers activating sets of genes involved in plant cell proliferation and differentiation.

We now show that Hrs-2 physically interacts with Eps15, a protein required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. The Hrs-2/Eps15 interaction is calcium dependent, inhibited by SNAP-25 and α-adaptin, and results in the inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Immunoelectron microscopy reveals Hrs-2 localization on the limiting membrane of multivesicular bodies, organelles in the endosomal pathway. These data show that Hrs-2 regulates endocytosis, delineate a biochemical pathway (Hrs-2-Eps15-AP2) in which Hrs-2 functions, and suggest that Hrs-2 acts to provide communication between endo- and exocytic processes.

Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Hrs-2 binds to SNAP-25 through its second coiled-coil domain and does not directly interact with either syntaxin or VAMP (11.Tsujimoto S. Bean A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2938-2942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When Hrs-2 is bound to the complex of SNAP-25 and syntaxin, VAMP binding to SNAP-25 is inhibited, reducing the amount of 7 S complex formed (11.Tsujimoto S. Bean A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2938-2942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, Hrs-2, via interaction with SNAP-25, may play a negative regulatory role on the exocytic machinery that is alleviated when calcium concentrations are elevated, dissociating Hrs-2 from the Hrs-2·SNAP-25·syntaxin complex and allowing VAMP to bind to SNAP-25/syntaxin. Ultrastructural and physiological experiments have identified at least two endocytic pathways: a rapid clathrin-independent pathway, and a slower clathrin-dependent pathway (12.Artalejo C.R.

Other proteins necessary for endocytosis have been found in genetic screens as well as by using biochemical methods. Eps15 is the prototypical member of a family of proteins containing EH motifs that bind to NPF domains in target proteins (30.Wong W.T. Schumacher C. Salcini A.E. Romano A. Castagnino P. Pelicci P.G.

Eps15 contains three amino-terminal EH domains, a central coiled-coil region, and 15 COOH-terminal DPF repeats (32.Paoluzi S. Castagnoli L. Lauro I. Salcini A.E. Coda L. Fre S. Confalonieri S.

Confalonieri S. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 417-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be essential for receptor-mediated endocytosis through interactions with α-adaptin (35.Carbone R. Fre S.

Cerf-Bensussan N. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The yeast homolog of Eps15, Pan1p, is an EH domain-containing protein found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is required for endocytosis (31.Tang H.Y. Munn A. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40.Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Additionally, Pan1p binds to another EH-containing protein, END3p, as well as the yeast homolog of AP180, and has genetic interactions with synaptojanin and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (31.Tang H.Y. Munn A. Cai M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4294-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 40.Wendland B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Exocytosis and endocytosis are closely linked and temporally coordinated during the vesicle cycle. These two distinct events must be regulated precisely such that they occur sequentially in order to maintain the fidelity of vesicle-mediated secretion and cellular architecture. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate these events remain elusive. The protein machinery involved in endocytosis and exocytosis is a likely substrate for their interaction. We have found that Hrs-2, a protein implicated in regulation of the formation of the SNAP-25·syntaxin·VAMP complex, interacts with Eps15, a protein necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The interaction of Hrs-2 with Eps15 is calcium dependent, is inhibited by SNAP-25 and α-adaptin, and results in the inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the inhibition of endocytosis produced by expression of Hrs-2 is rescued by coexpression of α-adaptin. These data show that Hrs-2 has a regulatory role in endocytosis, delineate a biochemical pathway (Hrs-2-Eps15-AP2) in which Hrs-2 functions, and suggest a mechanism by which exocytosis and endocytosis are linked. Full-length rat Hrs-2 was subcloned into the pGBT vector and used to screen a human brain cDNA library inserted downstream of the GAL4 activation domain in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH). Yeast strains (SFY526, HF7c) used herein have been previously characterized (S. Fields,CLONTECH). All constructions were verified by sequencing (Sequenase). 3.06 × 106 independent clones were screened by sequential transformation with pGBT/Hrs-2 and pGAD/library followed by plating on agar containing yeast nitrogen base (6.7 g/liter, Difco), dextrose (2%), and an amino acid mixture lacking histidine, leucine, tryptophan, and uracil and stored at 30 °C in the dark. Five-12 days after plating, large colonies (>3 mm diameter,n = 190) were replica plated onto new plates and β-galactosidase activity was assessed on filter lifts. Single colonies from clones that turned blue within 1 h (n = 40) were grown overnight in SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and DNA was extracted. DNA was electroporated into HB101 Escherichia coli cells, and DNA was isolated from single colonies. After restriction digests confirmed the presence of the activation domain plasmid, multiple co-transformations were performed with the candidate DNA and the pGBT9/Hrs-2, as well as pGBT9/p53. Clones that reacted positively for β-galactosidase activity with the pGBT9/Hrs-2 but not either by themselves or with the control plasmids containing the binding domain alone or the binding domain fused to the tumor supressor gene p53, were considered for further study (n = 36). Sequencing revealed a single clone whose sequence was identical to SNAP-25b and a single clone identical to human Eps15 (amino acids 416–858). Other clones remain to be analyzed. Hrs-2 monoclonal antibody or purified mouse IgG was cross-linked to Protein A-agarose using dimethylpimelimidate. Rat brain postnuclear supernatant was precleared with protein A-agarose and incubated with either anti-Hrs-2 or mouse IgG overnight at 4 °C. Following four washes with PBS-T, samples were boiled in sample buffer and separated using SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to membranes that were probed with Eps15 (Santa Cruz Biotech) or Hrs-2 (41.Tsujimoto S. Pelto-Huikko M. Aitola M. Meister B. Vik-Mo E.O. Davanger S. Scheller R.H. Bean A.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 3047-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) antibodies. Full-length Hrs-2 was subcloned into Hta baculovirus vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), and Hrs-2 virus was produced according to the manufacturer's protocol. Hrs-2 protein was produced by infecting a 500-ml culture of Sf21 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Post-infection (72–96 h), cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were frozen. Proteins were extracted by incubation (60 min at 4 °C) with 5% betaine in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors including aprotinin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, affinity isolated using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), and eluted from the resin when necessary, using 250 mm imidazole. Hrs-2 truncations were produced as described (11.Tsujimoto S. Bean A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2938-2942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GFP fusion proteins were produced in pEGFP (CLONTECH) by direct transfer from the GST vector. Hrs-2Δeps was produced by partial digestion of pEGFP-Hrs-2 withPstI removing amino acids 258–484. Using the two-hybrid technique we have observed that the Hrs-2Δeps protein does not bind to Eps15 although it does bind to SNAP-25 and full-length Hrs-2 (data not shown). SNAP-25 was subcloned into pGEX-KG and grown at 37 °C in the AB1899 strain of E. coli. Full-length GST-Eps15 was a kind gift of A. E. Salcini and P. DiFiore, while deletion constructs of Eps15 were a kind gift of A. Benmerah and N. Cerf-Bensussan. All constructs were grown in BL21 cells at 37 °C. After reaching mid-log phase, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactosidase (300 μm) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed in a French Press, and protein was affinity isolated using glutathione-agarose. Eps15/GST (0.3 μm) bound to glutathione beads was incubated with the indicated amount of recombinant Hrs-2 protein for 60 min at 4 °C in either: 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm KoAc, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20 or the same buffer containing either 2 mm EGTA and various concentrations of Ca2+, Ba2+, or Sr2+. Beads were washed 3 times with PBS-T, and the proteins remaining on the beads were solubilized in 15 μl of sample buffer. Samples were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed using anti-Hrs-2 antibodies followed by 125I-labeled secondary antibody and quantitated by phosphorimaging. The EC50 is defined as half-maximal binding of each soluble protein based on optical density obtained by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics model 300A). For saturation binding, various concentrations of Hrs-2 were incubated (4 °C for 60 min) with glutathione-agarose beads containing either glutathione S-transferase or Eps15. To determine interacting domains, various Hrs-2 or Eps15 fragments were purified and incubated (4 °C for 60 min) with either Eps15 or Hrs-2, respectively. For complex formation studies Hrs-2 bound to Ni-agarose was incubated with Eps15 alone or Eps15 and various concentrations of SNAP-25 at 4 °C for 60 min. To determine whether Ca2+ had an effect on Hrs-2/Eps15 interactions, single concentrations of Hrs-2 were incubated with Eps15 bound to glutathione-agarose (4 °C for 60 min) in the presence of various concentrations of free Ca2+ (buffered with 2 mm EGTA and calculated using WebMaxCalc version 1.1). Free Ba2+ or Sr2+ (0.5 mm) were used to examine selectivity. To examine the effect of α-adaptin on Hrs-2/Eps15 binding, Eps15 was immobilized on glutathione-agarose and then incubated with α-adaptin bacterial lysate. The Eps15-agarose, with or without with α-adaptin, was then incubated with increasing concentrations of Hrs-2. Following binding incubations, reactions were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and SDS sample buffer was added to the beads. Proteins bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-Hrs-2 antibodies and either horseradish peroxidase- or125I-labeled secondary antisera. For electron microscopic immunohistochemical localization, rats were perfused with 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, 0.2% picric acid in 0.1m phosphate buffer. Brains were post-fixed in situ and sectioned on a vibratome. Tissues were embedded in Lowecryl and thin sectioned. Embedded tissues were incubated with Hrs-2 antibody (10.Bean A.J. Seifert R. Chen Y.A. Sacks R. Scheller R.H. Nature. 1997; 385: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (1:200), anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to 1.4 nm gold particles (nanogold 2004, Nanoprobes, Stony Brook, NY), and silver intensified (Nanoprobes). Cells were examined on an electron microscope (Jeol) and photographed. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated onto coverslips and transiently transfected (Qiagen, effectene transfection reagent) with pEGFP, pEGFP-Hrs-2, pEGFP-Hrs-2ΔEps15, pEGFP-Hrs-2 fragments, pCDNA3-α-adaptin or pEGFP-Hrs-2+pCDNA3-α-adaptin 24 h prior to endocytosis experiments. To examine receptor-mediated endocytosis, transfected HeLa cells were serum starved for 1 h prior to incubation (10 min at 4 °C followed by 3 washes with media) with Alexa 594-conjugated transferrin. After the chamber temperature was heated back to 37 °C, images were acquired on a Zeiss Aviovert microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA CCD camera between 5 and 20 min post-warming. Experiments using pCDNA3-α-adaptin were performed identically except that after the unbound transferrin was washed, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then washed three times in PBS. The α-adaptin was visualized using a monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and cy-5 secondary antibody on a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope. Image analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program (version 1.62) and consisted of outlining cells and computing the area and mean gray value of the region of interest. This computation was performed after the threshold was set automatically based on an analysis of the histogram of the region of interest. Data are presented in units of integrated density (area of the cells × mean pixel volume) and are normalized to untransfected cells for graphical representation. The number of cells analyzed from each group is listed in the figure legend. Differences between groups were analyzed using ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnetts test. Using full-length Hrs-2 as bait in a two-hybrid screen, we recovered a cDNA clone identical to amino acids 416–858 of human Eps15. The interaction appeared specific as it was not observed using either p53 or GAL4 as bait (data not shown). To confirm the two-hybrid result we obtained the rat Eps15 clone, produced the recombinant protein, and performed binding assays using purified Hrs-2 and Eps15 (Fig. 1 A). Hrs-2 binding to immobilized Eps15 approached saturation with an apparent EC50 for binding of ∼1.8 μm. These data suggest that Hrs-2 interacts with Eps15 directly in the absence of other protein components. Eps15 from brain postnuclear supernatant was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Hrs-2 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, while Eps15 was bound to protein A-Sepharose to which Hrs-2 antibody had been cross-linked (lane 2), Eps15 was not detected on protein A-Sepharose containing a control antibody, mouse IgG (lane 3). These data support the two-hybrid data and confirm that Hrs-2 can interact with Eps15 from brain. We used truncated forms of the recombinant proteins to determine the domains of Hrs-2 and Eps15 that mediate the interaction between these molecules. To determine the domain of Hrs-2 that binds to Eps15, we constructed a set of GST fusion proteins containing regions of Hrs-2 predicted to form structural motifs (Fig. 1 C, top). These truncation mutants were expressed, bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and then examined for interaction with full-length soluble Eps15 during an in vitro binding assay. As shown in Fig. 1 C(bottom), Eps15 bound to Hrs-2 truncations that contained the region between the FYVE zinc finger region and the first coiled-coil domain, and not to GST beads alone or to either of the coiled-coil regions. Since Eps15 was able to bind to the Hrs-2 truncation containing amino acids 216–449, we conclude that this region of Hrs-2 is both necessary and sufficient for the binding of Eps15. In a similar manner, we determined the domain of Eps15 that binds to Hrs-2 (Fig. 1 D). GST fusion proteins containing regions of Eps15 were expressed, immobilized on glutathione-agarose, and then assayed for interaction with full-length Hrs-2. Hrs-2 bound to both the coiled-coil domain and the carboxyl-terminal domain of Eps15 that contains NPF repeats (Fig. 1 D). Moreover, the region in the carboxyl-terminal domain necessary for Hrs-2 binding was delineated using additional deletion constructs of that region and found to correspond to the region required for α-adaptin binding to Eps15 (Fig. 1 D). The amino-terminal EH domain construct was unable to interact with Hrs-2. Thus, we conclude that Eps15 contains two domains capable of interaction with Hrs-2, the coiled-coil motif, as well as the α-adaptin binding region in the COOH-terminal domain. Since Hrs-2 is known to have calcium-sensitive interactions with SNAP-25, we examined whether the interaction with Eps15 is altered by calcium. Recombinant Eps15 was immobilized, and a single concentration of Hrs-2 was added in the presence of increasing free Ca2+. As the concentration of Ca2+ was increased, less Hrs-2 bound to Eps15 (Fig.2). The half-maximal inhibition of Hrs-2 binding produced by Ca2+ was ∼100 nm. Ba2+ and Sr2+ (0.5 mmconcentrations) did not effect the binding of Hrs-2 to Eps15 (data not shown). These data suggest that Ca2+ regulates the ability of Hrs-2 and Eps15 to interact. The calcium concentration necessary for half-maximal inhibition of Hrs-2/Eps15 binding is ∼1000 × lower than that needed to inhibit Hrs-2/SNAP-25 binding, suggesting that Eps15 and SNAP-25 do not interact with Hrs-2 simultaneously. Additionally, since SNAP-25 is involved in regulation of the exocytic machinery and Eps15 in the endocytic machinery, it seems unlikely that they would bind to Hrs-2 simultaneously. To examine whether SNAP-25 and Eps15 interact with Hrs-2 simultaneously, we incubated immobilized Hrs-2 with Eps15 and increasing concentrations of SNAP-25 (Fig.3). As the concentration of SNAP-25 increased, less Eps15 bound to Hrs-2. At 3 μm SNAP-25, Eps15 binding was reduced by 90% indicating that while SNAP-25 and Eps15 can both bind to Hrs-2, SNAP-25, and Eps15 do not bind to Hrs-2 simultaneously. The demonstration of a direct interaction between Hrs-2 and Eps15 suggests that Hrs-2 may play a role in the endocytic machinery. Eps15 is localized to components of the endocytic pathway (38.Torrisi M.R. Lotti L.V. Belleudi F. Gradini R. Salcini A.E. Confalonieri S. Pelicci P.G. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Biol.

To understand where in the endocytic pathway Hrs-2 and Eps15 may interact, we examined the ultrastructural localization of Hrs-2 in neurons. As shown in Fig.4, gold particles were localized on the limiting membrane of MVBs (Fig. 4, A-C). Additional Hrs-2 immunoreactivity was found intracellularly although it did not appear to be associated with any organelle or membrane and is therefore assumed to be cytosolic. Differential centrifugation reveals that approximately 75% of Hrs-2 is cytosolic, 2A. J. Bean, unpublished observations. and we observed the majority of labeling on MVBs, suggesting that we cannot detect all of the intracellular Hrs-2 with our technique. The presence of Hrs-2 on limiting membranes of MVBs suggests an anatomical substrate for the interaction of Hrs-2 with Eps15 on this organelle. To examine whether Hrs-2 and Eps15 are coupled functionally in the endocytic pathway we studied the effect of Hrs-2 on the uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin in HeLa cells (Fig.5). The uptake of transferrin is dependent on Eps15 (35.Carbone R. Fre S. Iannolo G. Belleudi F. Mancini P. Pelicci P.G. Torrisi M.R. Di Fiore P.P.

HeLa cells overexpressing GFP-tagged Hrs-2 displayed markedly reduced transferrin uptake compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 5, A versus B). Quantification of these data revealed a significant inhibition of transferrin uptake in cells overexpressing Hrs-2 (Fig. 5,bar graph). We expressed a GFP-Hrs-2 construct lacking the Eps15-binding domain (GFP-Hrs-2Δeps) in HeLa cells. In contrast to the wild type Hrs-2 construct, the GFP-Hrs-2Δeps construct was cytosolic in localization, suggesting the need for the Eps15 binding region of Hrs-2 for punctate localization (Fig. 5 C), and transferrin uptake in cells expressing GFP-Hrs-2Δeps was not significantly different from untransfected cells (Fig. 5 D). We next overexpressed a portion of Hrs-2 containing only the Eps15-binding region, Hrs-2(216–449). Hrs-2(216–449) was punctate in localization and significantly i"

We have previously shown that it potently inhibits OCM-1 melanoma cell proliferation by inducing a G2 cell cycle arrest. Here we show that genistein exerts this effect by impairing the Cdc25C-dependent Tyr-15 dephosphorylation of Cdk1, as the overexpression of this phosphatase allows the cells to escape G2 arrest and enter an abnormal chromatin condensation stage. Caffeine totally overrides the genistein-induced G2 arrest, whereas the block caused by etoposide is not bypassed and that caused by adriamycin is only partially abolished. We also report that genistein activates the checkpoint kinase Chk2 as efficiently as the two genotoxic agents and that caffeine may counteract the activation of Chk2 by genistein but not by etoposide. In contrast, caffeine abolishes the accumulation of p53 caused by all the compounds. Wortmannin does not suppress the Chk2 activation in any situation, suggesting that the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase is not involved in this regulation. Finally, unlike etoposide and adriamycin, genistein induces only a weak response in terms of DNA damage in OCM-1 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the G2 checkpoints activated by genistein and the two genotoxic agents involve different pathways.

However, it remains unknown whether the anti-proliferative effect of genistein is dependent on these inhibitions. Genistein has also been reported to be a non-intercalative inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, an enzyme that interacts with DNA and catalyzes the concerted breaking and rejoining of the two DNA strands. Indeed, genistein has been shown to inhibit the relaxation activity of topoisomerase II in vitro and to stabilize topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes in vitro as well as in cellulo (8.Okura A.

Topoisomerase II has been reported to be the primary cellular target for a series of clinically important antitumor agents, including intercalating (i.e. the anthracycline antibiotic, adriamycin, also termed doxorubicin) and non-intercalating (i.e. the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide) compounds. Inhibition of the strand passing activity of topoisomerase II by these compounds is accompanied by stabilization of the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complexes, which prevents the rejoining of the two DNA strands (12.Chen G.L.

Inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II have been shown to arrest mammalian cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (15.Lock R.B. Ross W.E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3761-3766PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Ling Y.-H. El-Naggar A.K. Priebe W. Perez-Soler R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 832-841PubMed Google Scholar), even when they do not cause direct DNA damage (17.Downes C.S. Clarke D.J. Mullinger A.M. Gimenez-Ablan J.F. Creighton A.M. Johnson R.T. Nature. 1994; 372: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Cell cycle checkpoints are biochemical pathways that ensure the orderly and timely progression and completion of critical events such as DNA replication and chromosome segregation. Activation of checkpoints in G1 and G2 in response to DNA damage, in S phase upon inhibition of DNA replication, or in mitosis after disruption of the spindle leads to cell cycle arrest. Such delays provide time for repair processes or, in case of severe damage, for the activation of programmed cell death. Defects in the checkpoint regulatory network result in increased sensitivity to damaging agents and to the genomic instability that is often observed in cancer. Paradoxically, checkpoint-evading agents, such as the methylxanthine caffeine, are used in cancer therapy to sensitize cells to killing by genotoxic agents as they override the drug-induced G2 checkpoint (18.Russell K.J. Wiens L.W. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. Plon S.E. Groudine M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1639-1642PubMed Google Scholar,19.Powell S.N. DeFrank J.S. Connell P. Eogan M. Preffer F. Dombkowski D. Tang W. Friend S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1643-1648PubMed Google Scholar). The ultimate target of the G2 checkpoint signaling pathway is the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)1 complex Cdk1-cyclin B1 (Cdc2 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe), whose activation depends on the dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and Tyr-15 residues by the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25C (20.Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 21.Poon R.Y.C. Chau M.S. Yamashita K. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar). This dephosphorylation/activation has been demonstrated to be an absolute requirement for the onset of mitosis. Recently, it has been shown that Cdc25C can be negatively regulated by phosphorylation on its Ser-216 residue, during interphase or in response to DNA damage or incomplete DNA replication (22.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this residue creates a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins that is believed to be responsible for the nuclear export of Cdc25C and the subsequent impairment of nuclear Cdk1 dephosphorylation. Consistent with this model, expression of a Cdc25C mutant in which Ala was substituted for Ser-216 abrogated the interaction between Cdc25C and 14-3-3 proteins and induced premature entry in mitosis by overriding both replication and DNA damage checkpoints (22.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Two checkpoint kinases have been recently identified in humans; these phosphorylate Cdc25C on Ser-216. Chk1 has been proposed to be activated in γ-irradiated HeLa cells (23.Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu R.Q. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar), whereas Chk2 (Cds1 in S. pombe) has been reported to be involved both in the replication and DNA damage checkpoints (24.Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). The response to DNA damage occurred in an ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent manner (24.Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

Furthermore, we have demonstrated that genistein impairs the Tyr-15 dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and that Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes from genistein-arrested cells can be reactivated in vitro by Cdc25 phosphatase. In this paper, we address the question of whether genistein exerts these effects by activating the signaling cascade involving the kinases Chk1 or Chk2. Human choroidal melanoma cells (spindle-shaped OCM-1) were kindly provided by Dr. Maria A. Saornil, Valadolid Institute, Spain, and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, pH 7.3, supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 5% fetal calf serum. All culture reagents and media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Culture media were changed every 2–3 days. When they reached confluence, cells were dissociated by 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA and replated at 1:30 dilution. Cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells per 100-mm Petri dish. After 24 h, 60 μm genistein, 0.32 μmadriamycin, 30 μm etoposide, or 1 mmhydroxyurea were added in the absence or presence of 2 mmcaffeine for a further 24 h (except for etoposide, which was removed after 1 h). Genistein and etoposide were dissolved in Me2SO (final concentration 0.1%). After 24 h, approximately 106 cells were harvested by brief trypsinization and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was washed in PBS and fixed by the gradual addition of ice-cold 70% ethanol. Cells were then labeled with propidium iodide, and the cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry analysis using a Coulter Elite. Whole cell lysates were prepared by directly lysing cells in sample buffer. Proteins (approximately 100 μg) were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue to control for balanced loading or electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes (BA85 from Schleicher and Schuell) for 1 h at 20 V using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. Immunoblots were developed by using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse monoclonal anti-Cdk1 (SC54) and anti-p53 (clone DO1) antibodies were obtained respectively from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and PharMingen. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Cdk1 (Tyr-15) and anti-phospho-p53 (Ser-15) antibodies were from Biolabs. The anti-hemagglutinin (HA11) antibody was purchased from Babco. HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal calf serum. After treatment with 60 μm genistein for 24 h, the cells were transfected with the HA-tagged Cdc25C pcDNA using linear ethyleneimine polymers (Exgen 500, Euromedex), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The transfection efficiency was usually around 10%. Twenty four hours later, the cells were recovered, washed once with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min, and then washed 3 times with PBS. They were then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and with 100% cold methanol for 10 min at −20 °C. The cells were then washed 3 times in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Euromedex) for 15 min at room temperature, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with polyclonal anti-HA antibody (1:400 dilution in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin). After 3 washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa 594, 1:400 dilution in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 45 min at room temperature and then in PBS/Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. After 3 washes with PBS and a 4th wash with water, coverslips were mounted for microscopic observation. Comet assays were performed according to Singh et al. (31.Singh N.P. Mc Coy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9053) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After treatment with the different compounds for 1–4 or 24 h, OCM-1 cells were trypsinized. Immediately, 3.5 × 104cells were embedded in 0.35 ml of low melting agarose (1% in distilled water) that was layered onto microscope slides. After solidification of agarose, the slides were immersed in cold lysing buffer (1% sodium sarcosinate, 2.5 m NaCl, 100 mmNa2EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 10, and 1% Triton X-100 added fresh) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The slides were then removed from the lysing solution, gently rinsed with distilled water, and placed on a horizontal gel electrophoresis unit, which was filled with freshly made alkaline buffer (1 mm Na2EDTA, 300 mm NaOH, pH >12.5). After immersion of the slides for 20 min, electrophoresis was performed in the same buffer for the next 20 min at 2 V/cm. The slides were then gently washed with 0.4m Tris, pH 7.4, and DNA was stained by immersion in 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. After 4 gentle rinses in distilled water, the slides were mounted for observation with an epifluorescence microscope (LSM 410 invert laser scan microscope, Zeiss). The DNA damage in each cell was quantified using an image analysis system (Komet 4.0, Optilas system). Twenty five to 76 comets were analyzed for each sample. The “tail moment” accounted for DNA damage and was defined as the product of the percentage of DNA in the comet tail and of the distance between the means of the head and tail DNA distributions (32.Olive P.L. Banath J.P. Durand R.E. Radiat. Res. 1990; 122: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). We first compared the effects of genistein and the DNA-damaging agents adriamycin and etoposide on cell cycle distribution in human melanoma cells. As shown in Fig.1, treatment with genistein, adriamycin, and etoposide led to a clear-cut G2 cell cycle arrest in OCM-1 cells. Interestingly, the G2 block induced by genistein was bypassed by a concomitant treatment of the cells with 2 mm caffeine, whereas the arrest caused by etoposide was not. An intermediate sensitivity to caffeine was observed with adriamycin. These cell cycle events mirrored fairly well the effects of the drugs on cell proliferation (data not shown). As the status of Cdk1 phosphorylation on Tyr-15 has been shown to be a key event in the control of the G2/M transition (the kinase remaining inactive until it is dephosphorylated), we investigated the effects of the different compounds on the phosphorylation of this residue. As shown in Fig. 2, all three agents resulted in an increase in the amount of the slower electrophoretic mobility form of Cdk1 (upper panel). That this band corresponded to the Tyr-15-phosphorylated form was confirmed by using a specific anti-phospho-Cdk1(Tyr-15) antibody (lower panel). Remarkably, the phosphorylation of Cdk1 induced by genistein and DNA-damaging agents was abolished by caffeine (Fig.2). We have previously shown that Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes from genistein-treated OCM-1 cells can be reactivatedin vitro by recombinant Cdc25 phosphatase.2 We also reported (33.Cans C. Sert V. De Rycke J. Baldin V. Ducommun B. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 1241-1244PubMed Google Scholar) similar results with Cdk1-cyclin B1 complexes isolated from HeLa cells exposed to etoposide. To confirm that the inhibition of Cdk1 was due to the inactivation of the phosphatase in treated cells, we performed transient overexpression of Cdc25C in genistein-arrested HeLa cells. As shown in Fig.3, when these cells were forced to overexpress Cdc25C, most of them (56%) left the G2 block and entered an abnormal chromatin condensation stage. In contrast, under our experimental conditions, cells that were not exposed to genistein but that were transfected with Cdc25C did not display any significant sign of chromatin condensation (not shown). These in vivo results strongly suggest that the genistein-induced G2 block was due to an impairment of Cdc25C activity in genistein-treated cells. Activation of the Chk1 and/or Chk2 kinases has been proposed to be a key event in the DNA damage G2 checkpoint pathway. Phosphorylation/activation of these kinases can be revealed by the appearance of a slower electrophoretic mobility form (23.Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu R.Q. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar, 24.Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 a, none of the drugs tested induced any modification of Chk1 electrophoretic mobility. In contrast, genistein activated the checkpoint kinase Chk2, as did etoposide and adriamycin. Indeed, all these agents caused a discrete but significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Chk2. Caffeine abolished the genistein-induced and, to some extent, the adriamycin-induced Chk2 activation, but it was unable to counteract the etoposide effect. Whereas caffeine was able to suppress the activation of Chk2 resulting from short term adriamycin treatment (2–4 h, Fig.4 b), it was less efficient in long term treatment (24 h, Fig. 4 a). Genistein and DNA-damaging agents induced p53 accumulation in a somewhat different manner, with adriamycin having a much greater effect, followed by etoposide; genistein treatment led to only a slightly increased level of p53 (Fig. 4 a). Similar results were obtained with respect to p21 induction, except that the differences were attenuated (not shown). Caffeine counteracted the accumulation of both p53 (Fig. 4) and p21 (not shown) induced by all the drugs tested. As shown in Fig. 5 a, the effect of genistein on Chk2 activation was rather rapid, as a 1–2-h cell stimulation led to a significant shift of the protein. The maximal response was reached at 4 h and was maintained at least until 24 h. A dose-response study indicated that Chk2 activation could already be observed with 15–30 μm genistein and that the maximal effect was obtained with concentrations of 45–60 μm (Fig. 5, b and c). As expected, p53 accumulation occurred during the long term exposure and, interestingly, increased significantly for slightly higher genistein doses than those required to activate Chk2 (60 μm instead of 30 μm, Fig. 5 c). A similar observation was made when the effect of increasing concentrations of adriamycin on Chk2 and p53 was investigated. Indeed, Chk2 was already maximally activated by 0.017 μm adriamycin, whereas p53 progressively accumulated when adriamycin concentration increased from 0.043 to 0.34 μm (not shown). Because genistein resulted in events similar to those caused by DNA-damaging agents in human melanoma cells (i.e.Chk2 activation, Cdk1 inhibition, and G2 block) and because genistein has been shown to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II and to stabilize the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complexes in other cell types, we wondered whether it could induce DNA damage in OCM-1 cells. Using the so-called “Comet” assay, we compared the ability of genistein, adriamycin, and etoposide to damage DNA in melanoma cells. As illustrated in Fig. 6, genistein was only weakly effective in causing DNA damage compared with the two other drugs. Nevertheless, as shown in Table I, 60 μm genistein significantly increased the tail moment parameter after both short term (1–4 h) and long term (24 h) exposure. Higher concentrations (180 μm) of genistein did not lead to a major increase (not shown).Table IQuantification of DNA damage caused by genistein, adriamycin, and etoposide in OCM-1 cellsShort term (1–4 h)Long term (24 h)Exp. 1Exp 2Exp 3Exp 4Mean ± S.D.Cont3.63 ± 3.443.13 ± 2.153.50 ± 1.833.12 ± 2.293.34 ± 0.25(n = 46)(n = 66)(n = 25)(n = 63)(n = 4)Gen4.61 ± 3.384.17 ± 2.804.81 ± 1.645.50 ± 3.764.77 ± 0.55(n = 53)(n = 60)(n = 25)(n = 76)(n = 4)Adr26.64 ± 9.58(n = 25)Eto18.78 ± 7.70(n = 74)OCM-1 were either untreated (Cont) or treated with 60 μmgenistein (Gen), 0.34 μm adriamycin (Adr), or 30 μm etoposide (Eto) for short term (1–4 h) or long term (24 h) periods. Twenty-five to 76 comets were analyzed for each sample. The tail moment accounted for DNA damage and was defined as the product of the percentage of DNA in the comet tail and of the distance between the means of the head and tail DNA distributions.

Open table in a new tab OCM-1 were either untreated (Cont) or treated with 60 μmgenistein (Gen), 0.34 μm adriamycin (Adr), or 30 μm etoposide (Eto) for short term (1–4 h) or long term (24 h) periods.

To compare further the increase in the tail moment caused by genistein, means ± S.D. of the four experiments are also indicated (right column). Genistein caused only slight DNA damage in OCM-1 cells. Because we have shown that it induced transient accumulation of cells in S-phase,2 we wondered whether the Chk2 activation might also be triggered by a replication block. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of hydroxyurea (HU) on melanoma cells to compare its effect with that exerted by genistein. Fig.7 shows that HU activated Chk2 after both short term and long term stimulation. Interestingly, caffeine did not counteract Chk2 activation (Fig. 7 b) nor did it disrupt the replication block (not shown) caused by HU. ATM, a member of the PI 3-kinase superfamily, is believed to be the upstream kinase responsible for Chk1/2 activation. High concentrations of wortmannin (the well known PI 3-kinase inhibitor) have been shown to impair the activation of ATM by γ-irradiation (34.Blasina A. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Luyten W.H.M.L. Parker A.E. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 9: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.8, in the presence of wortmannin, Chk2 activation was still detected; in contrast, phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 was almost abolished. Thus, despite the fact that phosphorylation of a physiological substrate of ATM was inhibited by wortmannin, the stimulatory effect of all the tested compounds on Chk2 remained unchanged, suggesting that ATM was not involved in that process. We demonstrate here that genistein exerts its effects on cell cycle somewhat differently from those of the DNA-damaging agents adriamycin and etoposide. (i) Although genistein induced only a weak response in terms of DNA damage in OCM-1 melanoma cells, it caused a complete G2 cell cycle arrest and was as efficient as the two DNA-damaging agents in activating Chk2. (ii) Caffeine completely overrode the genistein-induced G2 cell cycle arrest. In contrast, the blocks caused by etoposide and adriamycin were either not bypassed (etoposide) or only partially abolished (adriamycin) in the presence of caffeine. These results suggest that the G2 checkpoints activated by genistein and the two DNA-damaging agents are likely to be different in nature. They are compatible with the existence of two different G2 checkpoint pathways in mammals, as proposed by Downeset al. (17.Downes C.S. Clarke D.J. Mullinger A.M. Gimenez-Ablan J.F. Creighton A.M. Johnson R.T. Nature. 1994; 372: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) as follows: one sensitive to DNA damage and the other to a decatenation state of DNA. Indeed, these authors reported that the bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-193, a potent topoisomerase II inhibitor, induced a G2 cell cycle block without inducing DNA damage. Unlike other inhibitors, which arrest the enzyme at its transition state after DNA-strand breakage, bisdioxopiperazines trap DNA topoisomerase II as a closed protein clamp, with no associated DNA break. Accordingly, although genistein has been demonstrated to be a non-intercalative topoisomerase II inhibitor in several cell types (8.Okura A. Arakawa H. Oka H. Yoshinari T. Monden Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 9.Markovits J. Linassier C. Fossé P. Couprie J. Pierre J. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.M. Le Pecq J.B. Larsen A.K.

Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we show here that genistein is a very weak inducer of DNA damage in OCM-1 cells. However, treatment of other cell types with genistein has been shown to result in the occurrence of protein-linked DNA strand breaks (9.Markovits J. Linassier C. Fossé P. Couprie J. Pierre J. Jacquemin-Sablon A. Saucier J.M. Le Pecq J.B. Larsen A.K. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5111-5117PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Constantinou A. Kiguchi K. Huberman E. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2618-2624PubMed Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate a close correlation between the activation of Chk2 by genistein or DNA-damaging agents and the induced cell cycle arrest in G2. When caffeine was able to override completely the G2 checkpoint (in genistein-treated cells), it was also found to abolish Chk2 activation. In contrast, in etoposide-treated cells, caffeine was inefficient both in counteracting Chk2 activation and in bypassing G2 arrest. This close correlation between the two events is further emphasized by the fact that caffeine had an intermediate effect both on Chk2 and G2 block in adriamycin-treated cells. Moreover, when DNA replication was inhibited by hydroxyurea treatment, caffeine was shown to be unable to counteract either the Chk2 activation or the replication block. At first glance, this is surprising, because caffeine has been shown to cause premature mitosis in hamster fibroblasts arrested in early S phase (35.Schlegel R. Pardee A.B. Science. 1986; 232: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to hamster cells, it has been shown that the S phase block induced by hydroxyurea in murine and human cells is not released by"

ANG II is the final effector of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and a central regulator of blood pressure, salt, and water homeostasis, as well as cardiac and vascular growth. Because conversion of AOGEN to ANG I by renin is the rate-limiting step in initiating the endocrine cascade of RAS, much attention has focused on elucidating the mechanisms that may control renin expression and secretion (1.Reudelhuber T.L. Mercure C. Ramla D. Methot D. Postnov A.Y. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension. Raven Press, New York1995: 1621-1636Google Scholar, 2.Gomez R.A. Gloor J.M. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension. Raven Press, New York1995: 1637-1652Google Scholar). Although renin is expressed in a variety of tissues, the kidney is the sole source of circulating active renin and thus plays a crucial role in short term regulation of RAS activity. Within the kidney, specialized myoepithelial cells in the afferent arteriole of the juxtaglomerular apparatus express and secrete active renin in response to various stimuli, including a decrease in blood pressure or in ANG II concentration (1.Reudelhuber T.L. Mercure C. Ramla D. Methot D. Postnov A.Y. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension. Raven Press, New York1995: 1621-1636Google Scholar). Previously, a 46-kDa protein was identified in the kidney that was proposed to play a role in the regulation of renin activity in this tissue. This protein was called the renin-binding protein (RnBP). RnBP was identified initially because in renal homogenates it forms a tight 1:1 complex with renin, designated “high molecular mass renin” (3.Takahashi S. Ohsawa T. Miura R. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that RnBP specifically binds renin (K d 0.2 nm) but not other aspartyl proteases such as cathepsin D or pepsin. Binding requires a leucine zipper motif present in RnBP (4.Inoue H. Takahashi S. Fukui K. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11896-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because RnBP binding to renin strongly inhibits cleavage of AOGEN to ANG I, RnBP was suggested to act as renin inhibitor in vivo. Experimental evidence to support this hypothesis came from studies in mouse pituitary AtT-20 cells, where expression of RnBP inhibits the secretion of active renin in a dose-dependent manner (5.Inoue H. Takahashi S. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, a polymorphism in intron 6 of the RnBP gene (T61C) was shown to be associated with a 40% increase in the renin/prorenin ratio in Caucasian men (6.Knoll A. Schunkert H. Reichwald K. Danser A.H. Bauer D. Platzer M. Stein G. Rosenthal A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although several hypotheses about a function of RnBP in renin regulation have been advanced, some experimental evidence argued against such a role. Although infusion of recombinant RnBP into rats leads to a long lasting decrease in plasma renin activity, neither RnBP nor high molecular mass renin are normally found in plasma (7.Tada M. Takahashi S. Miyano M. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, within cells renin is localized in the intracellular secretory pathway, whereas RnBP lacks a signal peptide and apparently resides in the cytoplasm. Finally, RnBP was shown to act as anN-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase, interconverting GlcNAc and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), a precursor in N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) biosynthesis, suggesting a function in carbohydrate metabolism rather than in the RAS (8.Maru I. Ohta Y. Murata K. Tsukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16294-16299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To clarify this controversy, we have investigated a potential role of RnBP in RAS in detail. In particular, we have used gene targeting to generate mice lacking RnBP and to test the consequences of RnBP deficiency for renin activity in vivo. The gene targeting approach has been used previously to gain important insights into the RAS in mice (9.Smithies O. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that RnBP-deficient mice are healthy and normotensive and that lack of RnBP does not affect expression or activity of renin under normal physiological conditions. Rabbit anti-mouse submaxillary renin antibody reacting with mouse renin-1 and renin-2 was kindly provided by Joel Menard (INSERM U367, Paris, France). Experiments involving recombinant DNA technologies were performed according to standard protocols. Characterization of tissues by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or immunoelectron microscopy have been described (10.Görg A. Weiss W. Celis J.E. A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1998: 386-397Google Scholar, 11.Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc.

Cryosections (10 μm) from mouse and rat kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) for 10 min, deproteinated in 0.2 m HCl for 15 min, and acetylated in 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0/0.25% acetic anhydride. To generate RNA probes, a 0.2-kbSacI-AccI fragment of the mouse renin-2 cDNA and a 1.3-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment of the rat RnBP cDNA were transcribed in vitro using digoxigenin-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization to kidney sections was carried out for 16 h at 55–65 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1× Denhardt's solution, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 1 mg/ml poly(A)+ RNA, 333 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10% dextran sulfate, and 50% formamide. Bound probes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin IgG and nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sections were counterstained with 1% neutral red. A 1-kbXhoI-NcoI and a 7-kb NcoI-HindIII fragment of the murine RnBP gene were used as short and long homology regions of the targeting construct and fused to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the pol2neobpA expression cassette (neo), respectively. This results in replacement of approximately 1-kb of genomic sequences including parts of exons 5 and 6 by neo. Electroporation of the linearized replacement vector into the embryonic stem cell line ICp4 (kindly provided by C. Graves, UT Southwestern Medical Center) and derivation of germ line chimeras by blastocyst injections were performed according to standard procedures. Mice genetically deficient for RnBP and wild type controls were kept on a mixed genetic background of C57Bl/6J X 129SvJ. Experimental procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines. Mouse kidneys were homogenized in 9 volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mmdiisopropylphosphofluoridate, and 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 20 μl of supernatant were incubated for 20 h at 37 °C with 80 μl of epimerase assay buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mg/ml N-acetylmannosamine, pH 7.5). Then the samples were heat-inactivated and cleared at 10,000 × g for 5 min. 100 μl of a 1:500 dilution of the supernatant were loaded on a Carbopac PA-1 column (Dionex) and subjected to high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a sodium hydroxide/sodium acetate gradient at a flow rate of 1.25 ml/min, with subsequent pulsed amperometric detection. Blood samples (100 μl) were collected from the retroorbital plexus of unanesthetized mice into prechilled tubes containing 10 μl of 100 mmEDTA, pH 7.4. To minimize stress-induced renin secretion, the blood sampling was completed within 20 s. The plasma was separated by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Total renin and active renin concentrations were measured by enzyme kinetic assay (with or without prior trypsinization) and by detection of ANG I conversion by radioimmunoassay. For total renin activity, 10 μl of plasma were activated for 15 min on ice with 10 μl of tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl keton-treated trypsin (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of 20 μl of (20 mg/ml) soy bean trypsin inhibitor (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). ANG I was generated by incubation of 10 μl of plasma (or trypsinate) for 1 h at 37 °C with 25 μl of renin-free rat plasma and 25 μl of incubation buffer (200 mm Tris, 50 mm EDTA, 5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.5). The samples were diluted 1:100, and ANG I concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay as published (12.Bohlender J. Menard J. Edling O. Ganten D. Luft F.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1450-H1456PubMed Google Scholar). All assays were carried out in triplicate. The concentration of prorenin was calculated by subtracting the active from the total renin concentration. For determination of kidney renin concentrations, kidney homogenates were prepared as described for the epimerase assay, and 10 μl of a 1:5000 dilution were assayed. To stimulate renin secretion in mice, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril was administered in drinking water at 50 mg/liter for 5 days, corresponding to an estimated dose of 10 mg/kg body weight/day. Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine. A polyurethane catheter (1.2 French) was placed into the right femoral artery and advanced into the abdominal aorta below the branching of the renal vessels. The catheter was then tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the back of the neck. On the next day, blood pressure was measured in conscious, unrestrained animals as published (13.Gross V. Schneider W. Schunck W.H. Mervaala E. Luft F.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 10: 1430-1439Crossref Google Scholar). Mean arterial pressure values were calculated for each animal by averaging all values recorded during a 5–10-min time period. Urine samples were heat-inactivated for 3 min and precleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. 100 μl of 1:100 dilution of the samples were loaded onto a Dionex Carbopac PA-1 column and subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a sodium hydroxide/sodium acetate gradient essentially as described for the epimerase assay. Using RNase protection assay, RnBP has previously been shown to be co-expressed with renin in rat kidney (7.Tada M. Takahashi S. Miyano M. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 112: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, data about the expression pattern in the mouse or about the exact renal cell type synthesizing RnBP were lacking. To define the expression pattern of the murine protein, we initially applied Northern blot analysis to screen mouse tissues for the presence of RnBP mRNA (Fig.1). In the mouse, RnBP is almost exclusively expressed in the kidney with low expression in liver and lung. Abundant expression in the kidney was also observed for renin (Fig. 1). Next, we tested whether the same renal cell types express RnBP and renin using in situ hybridization. As expected, renin expression was observed in juxtaglomerular cells (Fig.2 A). Surprisingly, RnBP mRNA was detected exclusively in glomerular cells, most likely mesangial cells (Fig. 2, B and C), with no apparent co-expression of both proteins in any renal cell type. This finding argued against a direct role of RnBP in regulation of renin expression in juxtaglomerular cells.Figure 2Localization of renin and RnBP expression in the kidney. Cryosections from mouse (A) or rat kidneys (B and C) were analyzed by in situhybridization with antisense probes directed against mouse renin-2 (A) or rat RnBP mRNAs (B and C). Expression of renin is detectable in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (arrow; A), whereas RnBP is confined to mesangial cells in the glomeruli (arrow; B andC). No signal is seen with a sense probe for RnBP (D) or renin mRNA (not shown). Magnification was ×400 for A, B, and D and ×1000 forC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To exclude a more indirect effect of RnBP on renin metabolism, we used homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells to introduce a targeting construct into the murine RnBP gene (Fig.3). The neo selection cassette replaced exons 5 and 6 of the RnBP gene, which encode a leucine zipper motif required for interaction with renin (14.Takahashi S. Inoue H. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13007-13013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Inoue H. Fukui K. Takahashi S. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6556-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for the disrupted RnBP allele were obtained by injection of embryonic stem cells into blastocysts and by breeding of mice carrying the gene disruption in their germ line (Fig.4 A). In mice homozygous for the disrupted allele (−/−), no RnBP mRNA was detectable in the kidney, demonstrating successful inactivation of the RnBP gene locus (Fig. 4 B). RnBP−/− mice were viable and fertile.Figure 4Southern and Northern blot analysis of mice. A, 20 μg of genomic DNA of mice of the indicated genotypes were digested with NcoI and subjected to Southern blot analysis. Wild type (WT) and disrupted RnBP alleles (KO) are indicated. B, 20 μg of total RNA from wild type (lanes 3 and 4) or RnBP−/− kidneys (lanes 1 and 2) were analyzed by Northern blot analysis using a mouse RnBP cDNA fragment. A signal corresponding to the RnBP mRNA was detected in wild type but not in knockout tissues. As a control, parallel RNA samples were probed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (GAPDH).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we investigated whether inactivation of the RnBP gene resulted in complete absence of RnBP activity in the kidney. In hog kidney extracts, RnBP activity can be assayed by means of its inhibitory effect on renin activity in vitro (16.Ikemoto F. Takaori K. Iwao H. Yamamoto K. Clin. Sci. 1982; 62: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast, the comparatively low amount of RnBP in mouse kidney extracts precludes reliable detection of such protein activity (not shown). Therefore, we assayed mouse renal extracts forN-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase activity, the second known biochemical function of RnBP. Conversion of the substrate ManNAc to GlcNAc was readily observed when the substrate was incubated with wild type kidney extracts. In contrast, no conversion was seen when knockout kidney samples were used demonstrating lack of RnBP activity (Fig. 5). In plasma, renin is present in several glycoforms that result from a complex pathway of renin synthesis, maturation, and secretion in juxtaglomerular cells. This variability in glycosylation pattern has important physiological consequences because it affects secretion and plasma half-life of the protein. Thus, renin containing complex oligosaccharides is constitutively secreted by juxtaglomerular cells. This protein exhibits slow hepatic clearance providing a basal source of long-lived renin activity. On the other hand, renin molecules with high mannose oligosaccharides are synthesized and stored within secretory granules and released upon cellular stimulation. These renin isoforms have a short plasma half-life and constitute the regulated source of renin to the circulating RAS (17.Katz S.A. Opsahl J.A. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension. Raven Press, New York1995: 1489-1502Google Scholar). Given the importance of the renin biosynthetic pathways for the RAS, we tested whether RnBP deficiency may affect glycosylation, intracellular localization, or secretion of renin in the kidney. Plasma proteins from both wild type and RnBP knockout mice were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and probed with an anti-mouse renin antibody. As seen in Fig.6, renin was present in several glycovariants in mouse plasma. The pI for the mouse protein in this assay was between 6 and 7, which is slightly more basic than renin from other species (e.g. pI 4.8–5.7 in humans). No difference in the renin protein pattern was observed when comparing wild type with RnBP−/− samples (Fig. 6). In addition, we analyzed the subcellular localization of renin in myoepithelial cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus using immunoelectron microscopy. Intracellular staining for renin localized to secretory granules in both wild type and knockout tissue sections without discernible difference between both genotypes (Fig. 7).Figure 7Analysis of the subcellular localization of renin in juxtaglomerular cells. Ultrathin kidney sections (70–90 nm) from wild type (A) or RnBP-deficient mouse kidneys (B) were processed for immunoelectron microscopy as described (11.Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H.

Renin was detected by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse renin antiserum followed by 10-nm goat anti-rabbit gold particles. Thearrows highlight renin localized in secretory granules of juxtaglomerular cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we compared the circulating RAS in wild type and RnBP-deficient animals to detect possible consequences of RnBP deficiency. No differences were observed when determining the concentrations of active renin, prorenin, and AOGEN in plasma or active renin in kidney (Table I). The mean arterial blood pressure tended to be slightly lower in knockout mice, but this trend was statistically not significant (Table I). Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme activity is known to stimulate renin secretion in vivo. Therefore, we administered the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril to mice for 5 days and measured the concentrations of prorenin and active renin thereafter. Although the levels of prorenin and active renin in plasma increased 2- and 30-fold, respectively, no obvious differences were observed when comparing wild type with RnBP knockout animals. The data presented in Table I were obtained in strains of mice on a mixed genetic background of C57Bl/6J and 129SvJ. It is well established that C57Bl/6J mice carry one renin gene (ren-1), whereas 129SvJ mice have two (ren-1 and ren-2) (18.Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension. 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To ascertain that variability in the renin genotypes did not influence the results obtained, we genotyped wild type and RnBP−/− mice in these studies for ren-1 and ren-2 genes using polymerase chain reaction. Both groups of mice included similar numbers of animals carrying one or two renin genes (not shown). Furthermore, we also performed RAS analysis comparing only wild type and knockout mice with one or both renin genes. No statistically significant differences between the genotypes were observed in any of these experiments (not shown).Table IAnalysis of RAS and blood pressure in wild type (+/+) and RnBP-deficient mice (−/−)Parameter+/+n−/−nPlasma Renin (ng ANG I/ml/h)555 ± 29138665 ± 52639 Prorenin (ng ANG I/ml/h)2286 ± 1972381955 ± 155339 AOGEN (ng ANG I/ml)70 ± 142767 ± 1144Kidney Renin (ng ANG I/mg/h)87707 ± 31096976170 ± 4020412MAP (mm Hg)104.8 ± 7.0898.3 ± 4.99Cilazapril Renin (ng ANG I/ml/h)17312 ± 9354718191 ± 72527 Prorenin (ng ANG I/ml/h)5471 ± 374865652 ± 48165Data are presented as the means ± standard deviation.

MAP, mean arterial blood pressure; n, number of animals. So far, our studies have focused on the role of RnBP in the regulation of renin. However, another biochemical activity of the protein has been uncovered recently (8.Maru I. Ohta Y. Murata K. Tsukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16294-16299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). RnBP acts as aN-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase and generates ManNAc, a precursor in the biosynthesis of NANA. The well characterized enzyme acting in this enzymatic pathway is the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, which catalyzes the formation of ManNAc from UDP-GlcNAc. The importance of this enzyme in the regulation of NANA metabolism is underscored in patients that express a constitutively active enzyme. As a consequence of the defective regulation of the sialic acid metabolism, individuals exhibit developmental delay, coarse facies, and massive urinary excretion of NANA (sialuria) (21.Weiss P. Tietze F. Gahl W.A. Seppala R. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17635-17636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, the RnBP/N-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase is able to interconvert GlcNAc and ManNAc in an ATP-dependent fashion. The significance of this reaction in sialic acid metabolism is presently unknown. Using RnBP−/− mice, we now can address this question in vivo. In initial experiments, we have analyzed the profile of metabolites excreted in the urine of RnBP knockout mice and have identified distinct differences as compared with wild type animals. Although the amount of NANA is not changed significantly, knockout urine samples exhibit a distinct peak that is absent in control samples (Fig.8, peak X). The elution profile and additional studies (not shown) suggest that this peak may represent an uncharged oligosaccharide. The exact nature of this metabolite and its relationship to RnBP/GlcNAc 2-epimerase remains to be shown. In the present study, we have carried out an extensive analysis of the RAS in mice lacking RnBP, a proposed cellular renin inhibitor. Despite previous experimental evidence implicating RnBP in the regulation of renin activity, we failed to identify any major effects of RnBP deficiency on the circulating RAS. The kidney is the prime tissue to provide renin to the circulating RAS. Expression and secretion of renin in the kidney is tightly regulated and essential to control blood pressure and fluid homeostasis (1.Reudelhuber T.L. Mercure C. Ramla D. Methot D. Postnov A.Y. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension. Raven Press, New York1995: 1621-1636Google Scholar, 2.Gomez R.A. Gloor J.M. Laragh J.H. Brenner B.M. Hypertension. Raven Press, New York1995: 1637-1652Google Scholar). Thus, disturbances in renin activity may contribute to the development of hypertension. Given the central role of renin in the (patho-)physiology of RAS, much attention has been focused on identifying factors that may control renin expression and activity in the kidney. One such candidate was the RnBP. Experimental data to support this hypothesis were its co-expression with renin in tissues and established cell lines and its ability to specifically bind and inhibit renin (3.Takahashi S. Ohsawa T. Miura R. Miyake Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 4.Inoue H. Takahashi S. Fukui K. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11896-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We now have re-evaluated some of these earlier observations. Although both RnBP and renin are highly expressed in the mouse kidneys as shown by Northern blotting (Fig. 1), they are not produced in the same renal cell type. Whereas renin is found in juxtaglomerular cells, RnBP is synthesized most likely in mesangial cells of the glomerulus (Fig. 2). Because RnBP is not a secreted protein, it is therefore unlikely to encounter renin in renal tissues or in plasma. Thus, the observation of renin-RnBP complexes (high molecular mass renin) in kidney extracts may be an experimental artifact of homogenization of the tissue. In vitro, RnBP specifically interacts with renin through a leucine zipper, a peptide motif involved in protein-protein interaction (4.Inoue H. Takahashi S. Fukui K. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11896-11900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar cluster of hydrophobic amino acids is found in renin (residues 232–253 of the human protein) and may constitute the RnBP-binding site. This tight and specific interaction between RnBP and renin is remarkable and suggests that it is more than coincidental. Although our data seem to exclude a specific interaction of RnBP and renin in the kidney or in the circulating RAS of the mouse, they do not rule out an interaction of both proteins in other systems. In particular, some studies have localized renin molecules in cellular compartments other than the secretory pathway, indicating an intracellular function for the protease. For example, an alternative renin mRNA giving rise to a cytosolic protein lacking the signal peptide has been detected in the adrenal and in the brain (19.Clausmeyer S. Sturzebecher R. Peters J. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20.Lee-Kirsch M.A. Gaudet F. Cardoso M.C. Lindpaintner K. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Potentially, RnBP may be expressed in low amounts in these tissues and involved in the regulation of intracellular renin activity. In conclusion, we have tested a functional contribution of RnBP to the RAS in vivo. Such a role for RnBP has previously been postulated based on a number of in vitro and cell culture studies. We conclude that RnBP deficiency does not affect renal or plasma renin activity in the mouse under normal physiological conditions, excluding a role for this protein in regulation of the circulating RAS. As such, our studies have resolved a long standing debate on a potential mechanisms of renin regulation by RnBP. In the future, the RnBP-deficient mouse model will be important to uncover the role played by RnBP in sialic acid metabolism. We are indebted to C. Räder, H. Schulz, D. Bischof, and S. Grüger for expert technical assistance and D. Ganten and M. Bader for critical reading of the manuscript."

Using a cAMP-dependent cell system, FRTL-5 thyroid cells, we have previously demonstrated the existence of a precise autocrine loop in the control of cell proliferation that involves the positive effector thyrotropin (TSH) and the general inhibitor somatostatin. In search of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the TSH and somatostatin control of cell proliferation, we analyzed the cell cycle regulatory proteins and the cellular pathways involved in the action of both signals. The results show that specific inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase blocks independently TSH-induced FRTL-5 cell proliferation and that somatostatin interferes with both signals. Each pathway activates different proteins required for G1/S progression. Thus, PKA is responsible for the TSH-induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase mRNA levels, RhoA activation, and down-regulation of p27 kip1. These correlated events are necessary for FRTL-5 cell proliferation after TSH stimulation. Moreover, TSH through PKA pathway increases cyclin-dependent kinase 2 levels, whereas PI 3-kinase signaling increases cyclin E levels. Together, both pathways finally converge, increasing the formation and activation of cyclin E·cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complexes and the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, two important steps in the transition from G1 to S phase in growth-stimulated cells. Somatostatin exerts its antiproliferative effect inhibiting more upstream the TSH stimulation of PKA and PI 3-kinase, interfering with the TSH-mediated increases of intracellular cAMP levels by inactivation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Together, these results suggest the existence of a PKA-dependent pathway and a new PKA-independent PI 3-kinase pathway in the TSH/cAMP-mediated proliferation of FRTL-5 thyroid cells. cAMP-mediated cell proliferation is a complex process that involves multiple pathways.

One of the critical targets of cyclin·Cdk complexes is the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product, which acts as a transcriptional repressor. During G1 phase, Rb is hypophosphorylated and binds to E2F, a family of cell cycle transcription factors, inhibiting its activity. Rb is inactivated by a coordinated, sequential phosphorylation by cyclin D·Cdk4, cyclin D·Cdk6 in mid-G1 phase, and cyclin E·Cdk2 in the G1/S boundary (which completes the phosphorylation of Rb in additional sites) (for review see Refs. 1.Weinberg R.A.

Sci. 1997; 22: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This process leads to Rb dissociation from E2F, with the corresponding activation of genes containing E2F-binding sites in their promoters and implicated in G1/S transition (for review see Refs. 5.Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar and 6.Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Another level of Cdk activity regulation results from the action of Cdk inhibitors that bind to cyclin·Cdk complexes and either inhibit their kinase activities or prevent their activation by Cdk-activating kinases (for review see Refs. 5.Sherr C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar and 6.Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). The Cdk inhibitors comprise two classes of proteins. The first includes the Ink4 family, so named for their ability to inhibit specifically the catalytic subunit of Cdk4 and Cdk6. The second class includes the Cip/Kip family, which can interact with many different cyclin·Cdk complexes. This family was initially described to interfere with the activity of cyclin D-, E-, and A-dependent kinases. More recent work revealed that although the Cip/Kip proteins are potent inhibitors of cyclin E- and A-dependent Cdk2, they can act as positive regulators of cyclin D·Cdk4 and Cdk6 complex formation (4.Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5143) Google Scholar, 7.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M.F. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). In this last Cdk inhibitor family, p27 kip1 is a widely distributed Cdk inhibitor that has an important role in regulating entry into and exit from the cell cycle. We have recently demonstrated that p27 kip1 expression is down-regulated by thyrotropin (TSH) in FRTL-5 thyroid cells and that somatostatin prevents this TSH-induced down-regulation (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). FRTL-5 cells provide an excellent system to study the mechanisms that govern progression from G1 to S phase, because in this cell type the transition from quiescent to proliferative cells requires the action of hormones and growth factors such as TSH, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor-I (9.Santisteban P.

Studies in FRTL-5 thyroid cells, although performed in different hormonal backgrounds, show that TSH increases the expression of G1 cyclins such as cyclin D1, D3, and E (13.Carneiro C. Alvarez C.V.

Oncogen. 1998; 16: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), leading to the activation of cyclin·Cdk complexes and the progression of the cells through the cell cycle. TSH cell cycle induction is counteracted by cytostatic signals such as TGF-β1 (13.Carneiro C. Alvarez C.V. Zalvide J. Vidal A. Dominguez F. Oncogen. 1998; 16: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and somatostatin (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P.

Oncogen. 1998; 16: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of interference between somatostatin and TSH is unknown. It has recently been demonstrated, in another system, that somatostatin interferes with the insulin-mediated induction of cell cycle proteins by activating p27 kip1 (18.Pagès P. Benali N. Saint-Laurent N. Estève J-P. Schally A.V. Tkaczuk J. Vaysse N. Susini C. Buscail L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15186-15193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This action takes place through the specific somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) expressed in many cell types, including FRTL-5 cells (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The critical role of p27 kip1 in the cytostatic effects elicited by somatostatin (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P.

Among other functions, p27 kip1 has been implicated in G1 arrest induced by inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (19.Hengst L. Dulic V. Slingerland J.M. Lees E.

Science. 1996; 271: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). These inhibitors interfere with cell cycle progression by suppressing the isoprenylation of proteins (21.Chakrabarti R.

A class of isoprenylated small GTP-binding proteins, termed Rho small GTPases, is proposed to be involved in G1/S transition in mouse fibroblasts (24.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) and also in FRTL-5 thyroid cells (15.Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K.

RhoA, a member of a subgroup of the Ras superfamily, regulates a wide spectrum of cell functions such as cell growth, membrane trafficking, and transcription (for review see Ref. 25.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). RhoA expression promotes p27 kip1 degradation in FRTL-5 cells, leading to progress from G1 to S phases (15.Hirai A. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Tatsuno I. Oeda T. Tahara K. Terano T. Narumiya S. Kohn L.D. Saito Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition, p27 kip1 is involved in G1 arrest by cAMP, in cells in which this second messenger is an inhibitor of cell proliferation (26.Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar, 27.Kato J.Y. Matsuoka M. Polyak K. Massague J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar); conversely, cAMP signaling in FRTL-5 cells is the main mediator of thyroid cell proliferation in response to TSH (28.Dumont J.E. Lamy F. Roger P. Maenhaut C. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 667-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). We have studied how this hormone regulates two important mediators of the G1-S transition (Cdk2 and cyclin E associated with p27 kip1), as well as the role played by somatostatin in each control point of the TSH effect. Our work focused on the effect of TSH alone. The results obtained are due to TSH and not to the combined action of TSH with other hormones and growth factors, such as insulin or serum. The main signal pathways involved in TSH and somatostatin control of cell growth have been also studied. The results show that TSH regulates cell cycle proteins through at least two independent pathways that involve PKA and PI 3-kinase. These pathways induce different sets of cell cycle proteins that finally converge in Rb phosphorylation. Somatostatin prevents TSH modulation of p27 kip1·Cdk2 association, cyclin E·Cdk2 kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of Rb. Moreover, somatostatin also blocks the TSH-mediated induction of HMG-CoA-reductase mRNA levels as well as RhoA activation, two of the decisive events in FRTL-5 cells growth, which we show are mediated by PKA but not by PI 3-kinase. Finally, the mechanism by which somatostatin interferes with TSH effects involves inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase activity and the consecutive decrease in TSH-induced intracellular cAMP levels.

The Biotrak cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (dual range) prestained protein marker, [α-32P]ATP, [γ-32P]ATP, and [α-32P]dCTP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The IMMUNOcatcher kit was from CytoSignal Research Products. FRTL-5 thyroid cells (29.Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% donor calf serum and a hormone mixture (6H medium) including glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine acetate (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (10 nm), transferrin (5 μg/ml), somatostatin (10 ng/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), and TSH (1 nm). Fresh medium was added every 2 or 3 days, and cultures were divided every 7 days. Before treatment, cell cultures were maintained for 3 days (otherwise indicated) in medium depleted of TSH, insulin, somatostatin, and 0.2% serum (3H medium) and were then maintained with each treatment at the concentration and for the time indicated below. Cells maintained in 3H medium (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are completely viable. 2D. L. Medina and P. Santisteban, unpublished observation. To perform growth curve profiles FRTL-5 cells (4 × 104) were maintained in basal medium (3H) for 3 days and then treated with TSH (1 nm), somatostatin (1 μm), octeotride (100 ng/ml), H89 (10 μm), PD98059 (50 μm), wortmannin (25 nm), or pravastatin (100 μg/ml) in the combinations indicated for each experiment. To avoid wortmannin degradation, this inhibitor was added every 6 h to cell culture medium. The number of viable cells was determined by cell counting at 36 h (otherwise indicated), and the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments are represented. Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium-isothiocyanate-phenol procedure (30.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63183) Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde. RNA was transferred to Nytran membranes, and RNA integrity was revealed by methylene blue staining of the blots. Hybridization and washing were performed with a probe specific for HMG-CoA reductase (31.Grieco D. Beg Z.H. Romano A. Bifulco M. Aloj S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19343-19350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. FRTL-5 cells grown to 80% confluence in 6H medium were transiently transfected (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of different expression vectors. The involvement of PI 3-kinase pathway was studied with the constitutively activated catalytic subunit (p110CAAX) or the dominant negative (pαΔ85iSH2-N) that contains a deletion of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (32.Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The role of RhoA was analyzed with a dominant positive RhoA QL (33.Teramoto H. Crespo P. Coso O.A. Igishi T. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25731-2573430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), dominant negative RhoA N19 (34.Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A. Lopez-Barahona M. Barbacid M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar), or the botulinum C3 exoenzyme, TC3 (35.Dong J-M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In all cases cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of expression vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (36.Watanabe S.Y. Albsoul-Younes A.M. Kawano T. Itoh H. Kaziro Y. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 33: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A group of cells was transfected with the corresponding empty vector as control. After transfection different hormonal treatments were used, as detailed in results. Then cells were harvested and the cell cycle distribution of propidium iodine-stained samples was performed as described previously (37.Vindelov L.L. Christensen Y.J. Nissen N.Y. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar), using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Co.). At least 10,000 events were collected and analyzed. Data were integrated and plotted with the CellQuest software. GFP expression was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Total protein extracts (50 or 90 μg for Rb detection) were subjected to 7.5, 10, and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, for Rb, cyclin E and Cdk2, and p27 kip1 and RhoA respectively, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1–2 h at room temperature in TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5) containing 5% non-fat milk. After incubation with the corresponding antibodies (1 μg/ml, 1 h, room temperature) in TBS-T containing 5% non-fat milk, membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and then incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, followed by three washes of 5 min/each with TBS-T buffer. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the Luminol kit as described by the manufacturer. RhoA levels were quantitated after densitometric scanning of the blots using the MacBas software. For immunoprecipitation assays we used the IMMUNOcatcher kit. Briefly, cells were lysed as recommended by the manufacturer, and 500 μg of total protein extracts were incubated with the primary antibody (1 h, room temperature). The samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. After centrifugation, the pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer, resuspended in 40 μl of protein sample buffer, separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation were performed as described above. After washing in lysis buffer, pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 μm ATP) containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 1 μg of histone H1. Samples were incubated (37 °C, 30 min) and boiled in protein sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and visualized by autoradiography. The Biotrak cAMP competitive enzyme immunoassay system was used, following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, FRTL-5 cells were grown in 96-well microtiter plates (104–106 cells/ml), maintained in 3H medium for 3 days, and then treated with 1 nm TSH, 1 μm somatostatin, 100 ng/ml octeotride, or the appropriate combination for 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 4 h. Cells were then lysed, moved to a donkey anti-rabbit Ig precoated microtiter plate, and incubated with anti-cAMP antiserum for 2 h at 4 °C, after which samples were incubated with a cAMP-peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1 h, 4 °C) and washed four times with washing buffer. The enzyme substrate was added immediately afterward to all wells and incubated (1 h, room temperature). Prior to optical density determination a plate reader at 450 nm, the reaction was terminated by adding 1 msulfuric acid to each well. In parallel, we prepared a standard curve with concentrations cAMP from 12.5–3200 fmol/well. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of three different experiments. Cells in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm EDTA were homogenized at 0–4 °C by nitrogen cavitation using a 75 ml of Parr bomb; cells were equilibrated for 15 min at 750 p.s.i. N2, followed by slow release into a glass test tube. The homogenates were centrifuged (500 × g, 10 min) to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Membranes were collected by centrifugation of the supernatant fluid (18,000 × g, 10 min), washed in 10 volumes of the same buffer, recentrifuged, resuspended in the same buffer (1–2 mg of protein/ml), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. As described previously (38.Toro M.J. Birnbaumer L. Redon M.C. Montoya E. Horm. Res. 1988; 29: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), membrane extracts were incubated at 32 °C for 10 min in a 50-μl final volume containing 0.1 mm [α32P]ATP (approximately 5 × 106 cpm/assay), 2.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm [3H]cAMP (approximately 15,000 cpm/assay), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, a nucleoside triphosphate regenerating system composed of 20 mm creatine phosphate, 26 units/ml creatine kinase, 25 units/ml myokinase, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 μl of membrane extracts, and, when present, 20 μm GTP, 10 μm TSH, 10 μm somatostatin, 10 μm forskolin plus 0.5% ethanol. The reactions were terminated, and the [32P] cAMP formed was assayed by the method of Salomon et al.(39.Salomon Y. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 35-55PubMed Google Scholar). The data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. We previously described the existence of an autocrine loop in the control of FRTL-5 thyroid cell proliferation that involves TSH, the main regulator of thyroid cell proliferation, and somatostatin, a cytostatic agent (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To elucidate the signal transduction pathways mediating TSH proliferation and the level at which somatostatin elicited its negative control, FRTL-5 cells were maintained for 3 days in a medium containing 0.2% serum and depleted of TSH, insulin, and somatostatin (3H medium). The cells were then treated for 36 h with TSH alone or combined with specific inhibitors of the most common transduction signal pathways or with somatostatin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Growth curve profiles (Fig. 1 A) and cell cycle distribution after flow cytometric analysis (Fig.1 B) were determined. TSH increased cell number about 1.7-fold, and when added together with somatostatin, a detectable inhibition of cell number was observed. The most drastic inhibition of TSH induction of cell growth was obtained with the PKA inhibitor H89. A PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, also inhibited TSH cell growth induction, although to a lesser extent than H89. The inhibitor of MEK (the upstream regulator of mitogen-activated protein kinase) PD98059 had no effect on TSH induction of cell growth in 3H cells. The results of G1/S ratio analysis are summarized in Fig.1 B. Cells maintained in 3H medium have an increase in G1 over the S phase that indicates cell quiescence, with a virtual absence of DNA synthesis. TSH treatment of quiescent 3H cells clearly promotes G1 transition to S phase, and the G1/S ratio decreases 75%. When the cells were treated with TSH plus somatostatin, H89, or wortmannin, however, accumulation was detected in G1 phase, with a G1/S ratio similar to that observed in quiescent 3H cells. Again, PD98059 treatment had no effect on cell cycle distribution. The involvement of PI 3-kinase in the TSH induction of FRTL-5 cells growth is very interesting and has not been previously reported in this cell line. Because of the relevance of these data, we confirm our observation using another experimental approach. FRTL-5 cells maintained in 6H medium were transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding a dominant negative of PI 3-kinase (32.Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with the empty vector. After transfection, cells were maintained for 36 h in 3H medium and then treated with TSH for other 36 h. In all transfection experiments, a plasmid containing GFP was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency, and then cytometric analysis was performed. The results show that control cells respond to TSH and have a cell cycle profile indicative of cells progressing through the G1/S phase (G1/S: 7.1), whereas cells expressing the dominant negative of PI 3-kinase do not respond to TSH and have a dramatic decrease in the S phase (G1/S: 12.9) (Fig. 1 C). When an expression vector of the constitutively activated catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (32.Wennstrom S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) was transfected in the same conditions as above, the cells respond to TSH and have a curve profile similar to control cells (data not shown). Together all these data confirm two previous observations demonstrating that (i) TSH alone, in the absence of growth factors (0.2% serum) and insulin (3H medium), can induce thyroid cell growth (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 40.Rossi D.L. Acebrón A. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23139-23142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and (ii) somatostatin elicits a cytostatic effect (8.Medina D.L. Velasco J.A. Santisteban P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These data also demonstrate that TSH regulation of cell growth involves at least two cascades, one via PKA and another via PI 3-kinase. Once two of the main signal transduction pathways mediating TSH induction of FRTL-5 cell growth had been determined, we analyzed the cell cycle proteins involved in this response and, more precisely, those at the G1-S boundary. Cells maintained for 3 days in 3H medium (0 h) were treated with TSH for 12, 24, and 36 h, and Western blots for Cdk2, cyclin E, and p27 kip1 proteins were performed. Cdk2 and cyclin E levels increased with TSH in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2 A), whereas the levels of the Cdk-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1 decreased in parallel. Following the same experimental approach, TSH was added for 36 h to quiescent 3H cells, alone or together wi"

(1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 8384–8389). In cell culture, it promotes cell adhesion and morphological changes to form cord-like structures of the human bladder carcinoma cell line ECV-304. The cord formation is prevented by heparin, which inhibits the binding of AGM to ECV-304 cells. This observation suggests that AGM interacts with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. In this study, HS glycosaminoglycans and core proteins of integral transmembrane proteoglycans, syndecan-1 and -4, were identified by immunocytochemistry on ECV-304 cells, and the structural requirements for the interaction of HS with AGM were characterized. Inhibition experiments with sulfated polysaccharides and chemically modified heparin derivatives indicated that sulfate groups were essential for both AGM-HS binding and cord-like structure formation and that the rank order of the different sulfate groups in terms of their contribution was N-sulfate > 6-O-sulfate > 2-O-sulfate. The minimum size of heparin, a chemical analog of HS, required for the binding to AGM was a dodecasaccharide as determined by competition experiments using size-defined heparin oligosaccharides. Thus, a specific sulfation pattern in the HS of cell surface syndecans of ECV-304 cells is required for AGM binding and the morphological changes. Tumor-derived adhesion factor/angiomodulin (AGM) is accumulated in tumor blood vessels and on the endothelial cell surface (Akaogi, K., Okabe, Y., Sato, J., Nagashima, Y., Yasumitsu, H., Sugahara, K., and Miyazaki, K.

Commun. 1994; 198: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have purified a cell adhesion glycoprotein of 30 kDa, tentatively designated as tumor-derived adhesion factor (TAF),1 from conditioned medium of the human bladder carcinoma cell line EJ-1. This protein stimulates adhesion and spreading of vascular endothelial cells and other types of cells to plastic substrates without interacting with integrins. The cDNA of TAF has been cloned as mac25 from human brain leptomeningeal cells (2.Murphy M. Pykett M.J. Harnish P. Zang K.D. George D.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 715-722PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially the same cDNA as mac25 has been cloned from human fibroblasts as prostacyclin-stimulating factor, which stimulates prostacyclin production in vascular endothelial cells (3.Yamauchi T. Umeda F. Masakado M. Isaji M. Mizushima S. Nawata H. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet adhesion and aggregation, thus it contributes to the maintenance of vascular homeostasis. TAF is accumulated in tumor, but not in normal, blood vessels, which often have a tortuous architecture, and has been implicated in the high permeability of the tumor blood vessels and in the aberrant cell adhesion of tumor cells (1.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Funahashi K. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). TAF preferentially binds to type IV collagen among various extracellular components, and promotes adhesion of the human tumor cell line ECV-304 to type IV collagen substrate and their morphological change (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The ECV-304 cells, which were reported to be of a spontaneously transformed human vascular endothelial cell line (5.Takahashi K. Sawasaki Y. Hata J. Mukai K. Goto T. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1990; 25: 265-274Crossref Scopus (418) Google Scholar), secrete a large amount of TAF and form a cord-like structure when their confluent culture is stimulated by type I collagen (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which is reminiscent of capillary formation. In view of its vascular modulating function, TAF has been renamed angiomodulin (AGM) (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, however, the German Culture Collection, the American Type Culture Collection, and the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan) have announced that the ECV-304 cell line is a variant of the human bladder carcinoma line T-24 based on the short tandem repeat microsatellite fingerprint and marker chromosomes. Hence, we used here the ECV-304 cell line for studying AGM-inducible morphological changes to tumor cells. In fact, AGM has been demonstrated to be accumulated in various types of carcinoma cells (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and to be located in the invasive front of tumor nests possibly because of much production and/or binding of this protein. 2Y. Adachi, F. Ito, H. Yamamoto, K. Miyazaki, and K. Imai, unpublished results. In cell culture, AGM promotes the adhesion of cancer cells to various extracellular matrix components such as type IV collagen, laminin, vitronectin, etc. (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that AGM may have some effects on cell adhesion and morphology especially during tumor development. It should be noted, however, that ECV-304 cells show a complex genotype combining markers not only of the human bladder carcinoma line T-24 but also human endothelial cells. The endothelial markers include in particular vascular endothelial growth factor receptor Flt-1 and the von Willebrand factor (6.Volk R. Schwartz J.J. Li J. Rosenberg R.D. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24417-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these cells respond to endostatin with dose-dependent inhibition of migration (7.Dhanabal M. Ramchandran R. Volk R. Stillman I.E. Lombardo M. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Simons M. Sukhatme V.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the morphological changes to ECV-304 cells may also represent some aspects of angiogenesis, and this cell line has been widely used for studying angiogenesis. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the binding of AGM to the ECV-304 cell surface and the cord-like structure formation of these cells were completely inhibited by exogenously added heparin (Hep), a chemical analog of HS (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). AGM interacts with the cell surface heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS-GAG) of ECV-304 cells, as demonstrated by inhibition studies using Hep, HS, and an anti-AGM antibody or by HS lyase digestion experiments (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8.Sato J. Hasegawa S. Akaogi K. Yasumitsu H. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cell binding site in AGM that interacts with HS has been identified as the peptide sequence Lys89-Ser90-Arg91-Lys92-Arg93-Arg94-Lys95-Gly96-Lys97. This is involved in the cell adhesion and the cord-like structure formation of ECV-304 cells (8.Sato J. Hasegawa S. Akaogi K. Yasumitsu H. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, HS proteoglycans (HS-PGs) were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry to be present on the surface of ECV-304 cells. HS-GAG was isolated from the cultured cells, structurally characterized, and compared before and after the morphological changes. Furthermore, the structural requirements within the HS chains for the specific binding to AGM were defined.

[3H]Acetic anhydride (500 mCi/mmol) andd-[6-3H]GlcN (10 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St Louis, MO), respectively. Sephadex resins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Actinase E was from Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Type I collagen was purchased from Koken Co. (Tokyo, Japan). AGM was purified to homogeneity from the serum-free conditioned medium of human bladder carcinoma cell line EJ-1 (1.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Funahashi K. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M.

The synthetic peptide, designated as AGM-peptide, which represents the HS binding site of AGM (8.Sato J. Hasegawa S. Akaogi K. Yasumitsu H. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was custom-synthesized by Biologica (Aichi, Japan). ECV-304 cells were obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). These cells were grown in plastic dishes using medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and kanamycin sulfate (60 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were fixed with 95% methanol at −20 °C for 15 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After being blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with HepSS-1 (diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature for 2 h, washed with 0.01% Tween/phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgM antibody (Seikagaku Corp.) at room temperature for 2 h. Fluorescent images were obtained using a laser-scanning confocal microscope FLUOVIEW (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C digestion was performed according to the method of Lowet al. (16.Low M.G. Stiernberg J. Wanek G.L. Flavell R.A. Kincade P.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 113: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 0.1 IU of phospholipase C in supplemented medium 199 at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h. Cells were then thoroughly washed prior to immunofluorescence staining. To determine their composition, the ECV-304 cell GAGs were metabolically labeled with [3H]GlcN. After the cells had been grown to confluence, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 135 nm [3H]GlcN (50 kBq/ml) with or without 50 μg/ml type I collagen, and incubation continued for 24 h. The cells cultured in the presence of type I collagen formed a network of cord-like structures (17.Jackson C.J. Jenkins K.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18.Hughes S.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was removed from each cell culture, and the cells were digested with trypsin for 30 min. Following incubation, the digest was centrifuged, and the supernatant fluid was recovered as a trypsinate fraction. The radioactivity of each fraction was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. ECV-304 cell [3H]GAGs were isolated from each trypsinate fraction by actinase E digestion and subsequent trichloroacetic acid treatment as described previously (19.Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and purified by chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column through stepwise elution with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0m LiCl. Because 2.0 m LiCl-eluted fractions contained little radioactivity, 0.5 and 1.0 m LiCl-eluted fractions were used for the composition analysis of GAGs. These fractions were desalted using a Sephadex G-50 column, and the GAGs were identified by enzymatic digestion using Streptomyceshyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, or a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II. Streptomyces hyaluronidase digestion was performed using 10 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 50 μl of 20 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 60 °C for 30 min. The enzyme digests were fractionated on a Sephadex G-50 column, and the radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The disaccharide composition of CS and HS of the 1.0 mLiCl-eluted fractions was determined as follows. The samples were digested with chondroitinase ABC or the mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II. The resultant disaccharides were separated from the resistant materials by gel filtration and subjected to disaccharide composition analysis by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA-03 column (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) (19.Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20.Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were co-chromatographed with standard unsaturated disaccharides on HPLC, and eluates were collected at 0.5-min intervals for radioactivity measurement in an Aloka LSC-700 liquid scintillation counter. Individual radioactive peaks were identified by comparison with standard disaccharide peaks detected by absorbance at 232 nm. Various amounts of AGM or AGM-peptide were incubated with [3H]HS from ECV-304 cells (50,000 dpm) or bovine liver [3H]HS (26,000 dpm), and AGM with any associated GAG was collected on nitrocellulose filters (15.Yamane Y.

Filters were monitored by liquid scintillation counting. ECV-304 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes containing 500 μl of medium 199, 10% fetal calf serum. The culture medium was replaced with 500 μl of the fresh medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml type I collagen, and the cells were incubated further. On the following day, the formation of the network of cord-like structures was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy. To examine the effects of various GAGs on the formation of cord-like structures, various amounts of GAGs, in addition to type I collagen, were added to the culture of ECV-304. On the following day, the cell morphology was examined under a phase-contrast microscope. ECV-304 cells produce AGM, which promotes the adhesion of these cells to type IV collagen and morphological changes to form cord-like structures when they are stimulated using exogenous type I collagen (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The cord formation is prevented by Hep, which inhibits the binding of AGM to the tumor cells, suggesting that AGM interacts with cell surface HS-PGs and that such interactions are indispensable to the morphological changes in ECV-304 cells. In this study, HS-GAG was isolated from ECV-304 cells and characterized for its structure as well as for the ability to interact with AGM and to regulate the cord-like structure formation. By indirect immunofluorescent staining using the HepSS-1 antibody and subsequent confocal microscopic examinations, a dense staining for HS-GAG was observed on the surface of the ECV-304 cells at three different culture stages. In the logarithmic growing phase, the cell surface staining was evident as shown in Fig.1 A. Although the cells shown in Fig. 1 A were permeabilized with methanol prior to staining, a similar cell surface staining pattern was observed using unpermeabilized cells (data not shown). A dense staining of the basal surface, with dark nuclei, was seen in cells undergoing contact inhibition (Fig. 1 C) and in cells forming the cord-like structures (Fig. 1 E). The staining might be attributable to shed HS (21.Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and intracellular HS, because the cells were fixed with methanol. The uniform staining of the latter cell culture was in sharp contrast to the intense accumulation of AGM in the cord-like structure (4.Akaogi K. Okabe Y. Sato J. Nagashima Y. Yasumitsu H. Sugahara K. Miyazaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8384-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Apparently, the undersulfation (see below) of the HS observed concomitantly with the cord formation did not alter the HepSS-1 epitope. Treatment of the cells with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II, which eliminate the epitope for HepSS-1, completely abolished the immunoreactivity, confirming the specific binding of HepSS-1 to cell surface HS-GAG (data not shown). The core proteins of the HS-PGs were also examined by immunocytochemical analysis. The binding of the anticore protein antibodies toward a basement membrane PG, perlecan, as well as integral transmembrane PGs, syndecan-1, -2, -3, and -4, to the ECV-304 cells was tested. Anti-syndecan-1 and -4 antibodies bound to the cells, whereas the others did not (Fig. 2). The failure to detect perlecan is surprising inasmuch as it is widely distributed in human tissues and is present not only in the basement membrane zone of virtually all vascularized tissues but also in the tumor stroma of several human cancers (22.Iozzo R.V. Cohen I., R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The present results may indicate that perlecan is not expressed in ECV-304 cells as in the case of hepatocytes and keratinocytes (22.Iozzo R.V. Cohen I., R. Grässel S. Murdoch A.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may be released into the medium without being retained in the matrix of the cultured ECV-304 cells. The immunostaining of HepSS-1 antibody was not diminished by the treatment with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C, which releases glypicans from cell surface, suggesting that glypican family members are not appreciably expressed by ECV-304 cells, being consistent with a previous report (6.Volk R. Schwartz J.J. Li J. Rosenberg R.D. Simons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24417-24424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the major cell surface HS-PGs of ECV-304 cells are syndecan-1 and -4. To demonstrate directly the HS-GAG production by ECV-304 cells, we labeled cells using [3H]GlcN and analyzed the sulfated GAGs extracted from the cell culture by means of specific GAG lyases. ECV-304 cells form the cord-like structure network when the confluent monolayer is incubated for 24 h in medium containing type I collagen (17.Jackson C.J. Jenkins K.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To investigate if the sulfation pattern of the ECV-304 cell surface HS changes upon induction of the cord formation, PGs were labeled with [3H]GlcN for 24 h in the presence and absence of type I collagen, and polyanionic materials were isolated by ion-exchange chromatography. Addition of the type I collagen did not markedly affect the number of ECV-304 cells after 24 h: type I collagen-treated and -untreated control cultures contained 1.4 × 103 and 1.7 × 103 cells/mm2, respectively, whereas the total radiolabel incorporation into the GAG fraction was increased ∼1.5-fold by induction of the cord formation (Fig. 3). The isolated polyanionic materials were examined for their susceptibility toStreptomyces hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, or a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II. Each digest was subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (results not shown), and the amounts of hyaluronic acid, CS, and HS were determined by digestion products from each enzyme treatment. The 0.5 m LiCl-eluted fractions obtained from both cultures contained predominantly hyaluronic acid and a small proportion of CS but no HS (Fig. 3). The mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II fragmented ∼52 and 37% of the [3H]GlcN-labeled GAGs in the 1.0 mLiCl-eluted fraction obtained from cultures in the presence and absence of type I collagen, respectively (Fig. 3). These results indicated that ECV-304 cells synthesized an appreciable amount of HS. CS represented 40 and 32% of the 1.0 m LiCl-eluted fractions isolated from the control and the cord-forming ECV-304 cells, respectively (Fig.3). The unidentified materials may include keratan sulfate and/or sialylated or sulfated O-linked oligosaccharides derived from glycoproteins. The HS preparations derived from the ECV-304 cell culture, which had been labeled with [3H]GlcN in the presence or absence of type I collagen, were subjected to a disaccharide composition analysis after digestion with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II. The resulting disaccharides were analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC. Overall, the disaccharide compositions of both HS samples were similar, and the major disaccharide in both HS fractions was nonsulfated disaccharide ΔHexA-GlcNAc (Table I). However, there was an increase in the proportion of the nonsulfated disaccharide and decreases in the sulfated disaccharides in the type I collagen-treated HS preparation. Based on the disaccharide composition data, sulfation degrees at specific positions of the individual saccharide units were calculated (Table II). The data showed that the average number of sulfate groups/100 disaccharides in the HS preparations from the type I collagen-treated and untreated cell cultures was 93 and 113, respectively. The lower sulfation (82.1%) in the HS preparation from the collagen-treated cultures as compared with that from the untreated cultures was attributable to the 16% reduction in N-sulfation, 19% reduction in 6-O-sulfation, and 21% reduction in 2-O-sulfation.Table IDisaccharide composition analysis of the HS preparations from ECV-304 cellsDisaccharidesProportion+ Collagen− Collagen%ΔHexAα1–4GlcNAc45.136.1ΔHexAα1–4GlcNAc(6S)5.75.3ΔHexAα1–4GlcN(NS)20.721.6ΔHexAα1–4GlcN(NS,6S)5.27.5ΔHexA(2S)α1–4GlcN(NS)13.817.2ΔHexA(2S)α1–4GlcN(NS,6S)9.512.3GAG preparations, which had been labeled with [3H]GlcN in the presence or absence of type I collagen, were isolated from the confluent ECV-304 cells and purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography.

The data indicate the different levels of sulfation in these two HS samples. The [3H]GlcN-labeled GAG preparations isolated from the confluent ECV-304 cell culture were incubated with AGM, and their binding ability was evaluated using the nitrocellulose filter binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig.4, GAG fractions eluted with 1.0m LiCl on DEAE-cellulose chromatography bound to AGM. The retained counts on the nitrocellulose filters were comparable between the 1.0 m LiCl-eluted fractions prepared from type I collagen-treated and untreated cultures. The binding of the 1.0m LiCl-eluted fractions to AGM was abolished by treatment with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinases I and II (Fig. 4). A chondroitinase ABC treatment did not affect the bound radioactivity (data not shown). These results indicated that AGM bound to HS rather than CS. In contrast, very little binding to AGM was observed for the GAG fractions eluted with 0.5 m LiCl on DEAE-cellulose chromatography (Fig. 4), being consistent with the observation that the 0.5 m LiCl-eluted fractions contained no HS (Fig. 3). Because the availability of the 3H-labeled ECV-304 cell HS was limited, bovine liver HS (15.Yamane Y. Toh"

Recent reports of enzyme structure highlight the importance of conserved amino acids N-terminal to the active site tyrosine and the involvement of Asn-726 in mediating Top1p sensitivity to camptothecin. To investigate the contribution of this residue to enzyme catalysis, we evaluated the effect of substituting His, Asp, or Ser for Asn-726 on yeast Top1p. Top1N726S and Top1N726D mutant proteins were resistant to camptothecin, although the Ser mutant was distinguished by a lack of detectable changes in activity. Thus, a basic residue immediately N-terminal to the active site tyrosine is required for camptothecin cytotoxicity. However, replacing Asn-726 with Asp or His interfered with distinct aspects of the catalytic cycle, resulting in cell lethality. In contrast to camptothecin, which inhibits enzyme-catalyzed religation of DNA, the His substituent enhanced the rate of DNA scission, whereas the Asp mutation diminished the enzyme binding of DNA. Yet, these effects on enzyme catalysis were not mutually exclusive as the His mutant was hypersensitive to camptothecin. These results suggest distinct mechanisms of poisoning DNA topoisomerase I may be explored in the development of antitumor agents capable of targeting different aspects of the Top1p catalytic cycle.

DNA topoisomerase I binds double-stranded DNA and transiently cleaves one strand of the duplex via the nucleophilic attack of the active site tyrosine on the phosphodiester backbone bond of the DNA. A phosphotyrosyl linkage in the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate tethers the enzyme to the 3′-phosphate end of the cleaved DNA strand. Biochemical and crystallographic data suggest that the free DNA end rotates around the intact complementary strand, affecting alterations in the linkage of the two DNA strands (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A conservation of function is also supported by several studies involving specific amino acid substitutions. For example, mutation of these residues in either yeast or human Top1 to match the Ser-Lys-Arg-Ala-Tyr sequence found at the corresponding position in the camptothecin-resistant vaccinia virus enzyme rendered the mutant Top1vac enzymes resistant to the drug (26.Knab A.M.

Conversely, substitution of Ala for Thr-722 enhanced the stability of the covalent enzyme-DNA complex in the absence of camptothecin, which proved lethal when top1T722A was expressed in yeast or mammalian cells (28.Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

Similar effects on human Top1p function have recently been reported for the analogous replacement of Thr-718 with Ala (31.Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The characterization of second site mutations in yeasttop1T722A or human top1T718A, which suppress the lethal phenotype, provides evidence of functionally conserved domainal interactions (29.Hann C.L. Carlberg A.L. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31519-31527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31.Fiorani P. Amatruda J.F. Silvestri A. Butler R.H. Bjornsti M.-A. Benedetti P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The structures of human Top1p in covalent and noncovalent complexes with DNA demonstrate remarkably few contacts between the DNA substrate and the C-terminal domain (6.Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 23.Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Among residues near the active site tyrosine, only those immediately N-terminal to Tyr (Thr, Lys, and Asn in Fig. 1) interact with phosphate groups near the site of DNA scission. Mutation of this Asn to Leu in yeast Top1N726Lp diminished the catalytic activity and camptothecin sensitivity of the enzyme (26.Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of Ser for the same Asn residue in human DNA topoisomerase I also conferred camptothecin resistance, without a concomitant decrease in activity (32.Fujimori A. Harker W.G. Kohlhagen G. Hoki Y. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1339-1346PubMed Google Scholar). To directly address the contribution of this residue to DNA topoisomerase I catalysis, we investigated the consequences of substituting His, Ser, and Asp for Asn-726 in yeast Top1p. Here we report that these mutations had dramatically different effects on enzyme binding to DNA, cleavage of DNA, and camptothecin sensitivity. Our studies indicate a basic residue immediately N-terminal to the active site tyrosine is essential for the camptothecin sensitivity of the enzyme. Further, the presence of histidine enhanced cleavage of the DNA substrate. In contrast, replacement of Asn with an acidic residue diminished the ability of the enzyme to bind DNA. As a consequence, noncovalent binding of DNA 3′ to the cleavage site was selectively destabilized in the covalent complex. These data suggest novel mechanisms of stabilizing the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate, which may be exploited in the development of new antitumor drugs that target DNA topoisomerase I. Camptothecin was obtained from Sigma and dissolved at 4 mg/ml in Me2SO. Aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Yeast strains EKY3 (MATα, ura3–52,his3Δ200, leu2Δ1,trp1Δ63,top1Δ::TRP1) and MBY3 (MATα, ura3–52,his3Δ200, leu2Δ1,trp1Δ63,top1Δ::TRP1,rad52Δ::LEU2) were previously described (29.Hann C.L.

In top1N726L, amino acid residue Asn-726 (adjacent to active site tyrosine 727) was mutated to Leu (25.Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22322-22330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Substitution of Ser for Asn-726 (top1N726S) was achieved by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A 445-base pairSalI-PstI DNA fragment encoding the active tyrosine region of yeast TOP1 was cloned into M13mp19 RF DNA. The single-stranded phage DNA was mutagenized with the oligonucleotide 5′-GCACTTCCAAAATCAGTTATATAGACCCTAG-3′. The mutated sequences were excised with SalI/PstI and used to replace the wild-type sequences in YCpGAL1-TOP1-L to yield plasmid YCpGAL1-top1N726S-L. L designates the selectable markerLEU2. Other ARS/CEN vectors used in this study contain the URA3 marker. Plasmid YCpGAL1-top1N726S was constructed by replacing theBsu36I-XbaI DNA fragment of YCpGAL1-TOP1 with the corresponding sequences from YCpGAL1-top1N726S-L. Mutation of Asn-726 to Asp and His, in mutants top1N726D andtop1N726H, respectively, was accomplished by degenerate oligonucleotide mutagenesis of TOP1 sequences spanning the active site tyrosine (described in Ref. 28.Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

Briefly, the mutated sequences in the replicative form of M13mp18 were restricted withSpeI and PstI and successively cloned into the expression vectors ptacTOP1 (35.Bjornsti M.-A. Wang J.C. Proc.

Yeast strains were transformed by treatment with lithium acetate (36.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 133-134Google Scholar). Plasmids were maintained by growing cells in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil (S.C.1 -ura) or leucine (S.C.-leu) and supplemented with 2% dextrose or galactose, as indicated. The camptothecin sensitivity of yeast cells transformed with various TOP1constructs was determined as described (2.Reid R.J.D. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M.-A. Biochim. Biophys.

Individual transformants were grown in selective medium plus dextrose and serially 10-fold diluted, and 5-μl volumes were spotted onto selective plates supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2% dextrose or galactose, and 10 μg/ml camptothecin in a final 0.25% Me2SO. No drug control plates contained 0.25% Me2SO. Cell viability was scored following incubation at 30 °C. DNA topoisomerase I was purified from EKY3 cells transformed with various pGAL1-TOP1 constructs as described (26.Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

Briefly, extracts from 1.5 liters of galactose-induced cultures were fractionated by successive 30 and 75% saturation ammonium sulfate precipitations and phosphocellulose chromatography. Proteins bound to the phosphocellulose column were eluted with successive 2-column volumes of TEEG buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) containing 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 m KCl. Top1 proteins, in the 0.6 m KCl fractions, were adjusted to a final 50% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Top1 protein integrity was assessed in immunoblots probed with rabbit antibodies specific for yeast DNA topoisomerase I and stained with alkaline-phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies (26.Knab A.M.

Briefly, serial 10-fold dilution of proteins corrected for concentration were incubated in 20-μl reaction volumes with 0.3 μg of negatively supercoiled pHC624 DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and 150 mm KCl. Where indicated, the final KCl concentration was adjusted from 50 to 200 mm, in 25 mmincrements. Following incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS, and the extent of plasmid DNA relaxation was assessed following electrophoresis in agarose gels. Topoisomer bands were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. Enzyme sensitivity to camptothecin was assayed in DNA cleavage reactions (26.Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

A single 3′-end-labeled DNA substrate was prepared by cleaving plasmid pHCAK3–1 with BglII, repairing the ends with [32P]dATP, dNTPs, and Sequenase, and restricting with BamHI. Following purification in a 5% polyacrylamide gel, ∼7.5 ng (8000 cpm) of the 480-base pair DNA fragment was incubated with equal concentrations of Top1p in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml gelatin, and a final 50 μmcamptothecin. After 30 min at 30 °C, the covalent complexes were trapped with 1% SDS at 75 °C for 10 min. The samples were digested with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K, ethanol precipitated, and electrophoresed in an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel in 0.1 mTris-Borate buffer at 20 V/cm. The cleavage products were visualized by autoradiography. Single-stranded oligonucleotides containing a modified high affinityTetrahymena rDNA cleavage site sequence (5′-GG↓AT-3′ replaced by 5′-GG↓TT-3′) were 3′-end labeled with [32P]cordycepin using terminal deoxnucleotidyltransferase (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (37.Pourquier P.

Excess unincorporated nucleotide was removed by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-25 spin column. The labeled oligonucleotide, corresponding to the scissile DNA strand, was then annealed to equimolar amounts of unlabeled complementary DNA(s) in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) by heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by slow cooling over 3 h. Suicide DNA substrates were similarly prepared by annealing a 3′-end-labeled scissile strand oligonucleotide (5′-GATCTAAAAGACTT↓GGAAA*A-3′) to an unlabeled complementary nonscissile strand oligonucleotide (5′-GATCTTTTTTAAAAATTTTTCCAAGTCTTTTAGATC-3′). Cleavage reactions were performed at room temperature by incubating equal concentrations of enzyme with 20 fmol of DNA in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, and 50 μg/ml gelatin. Reactions were terminated with SDS (0.5% final) followed by the addition of 3.3 volumes of loading buffer (1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol in either 95% formamide or 80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH). Samples were loaded on 16% polyacrylamide, 7m urea gels and electrophoresed at 40 V/cm at 50 °C. JCW28 cells were co-transformed with plasmid YEptopA-PGPD, which constitutively expresses bacterial DNA topoisomerase I (28.Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.-A. J. Biol.

Cells were grown at the permissive temperature (25 °C) in S.C.-tryptophan, -leucine dextrose medium, diluted into selective medium containing raffinose, and induced with 2% galactose at A 595 = 1.3–1.4. After 5 h, half of each culture was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (35 °C) for an additional 3 h. To prevent changes in plasmid DNA topology during cell lysis, the cultures were mixed with an equal volume of buffered ethanol/toluene (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 95% ethanol, 3% toluene, and 10 mm EDTA) prechilled to −20 °C (28.Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

Following cell lysis, plasmid topoisomers were resolved by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, where the 0.6 μg/ml chloroquine of the first dimension was increased to 3 μg/ml in the second dimension (26.Knab A.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transcription factors belonging to the AP11 family are key factor in this control. Interactions of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers with an element located 77 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site of the profilaggrin gene are indispensable for maintaining high levels of promoter activity, whereas DNA binding-independent interactions of JunB serve to repress the promoter. Despite the essential role of AP1, it is unlikely that these factors are solely responsible for optimal levels of profilaggrin transcription. In fact, we have previously reported that the effect of c-Jun is modulated in cooperation with Ets transcription factors, including the dual Ets/HMG protein Jen (5.Andreoli J.M. Jang S.-I. Chung E. Coticchia C.M. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4287-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By using transgenic mice, we have also shown that the homeodomain containing protein Dlx3, which recognizes AT-rich motifs in the vicinity of the initiation site, has the potential to profoundly influence profilaggrin expression (6.Morasso M.E. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and the well documented ability of POU domain proteins to interact with AP1 to both activate and repress target genes (8.Kim M.K.

POU domain proteins form a subfamily of the homeodomain proteins with a divergent POU-type homeodomain (POUHD). Amino-terminal to POUHD there is a second conserved domain, the POU-specific (POUS) domain. Whereas the POUHD domain is related to the classic homeodomain encoded by the homeobox, the POUS domain is unique to the POU protein family. Outside of the POU domain, there are no structural characteristics common to all POU domain gene family members. The entire POU domain is required for DNA binding (reviewed in Refs. 11.Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 12.Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin.

The most frequent targets of the POU domain proteins are the “octamer” motifs (ATGCAAAT), which have been shown to be involved in both ubiquitous and cell type-specific regulation of various genes (11.Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 13.Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these proteins have the flexibility to bind heterogeneous sequences, such as the so-called TAATGARAT motif. The more degenerated the core sequence is, the more important the flanking bases for the affinity and the specificity of the binding (11.Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). POU domain proteins have been implicated in development; control of replication, growth, and cell cycle arrest; and differentiation (Refs. 7.Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar and 11.Verrijzer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim Biophys.

They have been shown to exert both activation and repression. The complexity of POU domain protein functions is further increased by the diversity of their interactions with other transcription factors and cell type-specific co-regulators (8.Kim M.K.

The POU domain proteins reported to date in epidermis are Oct1, Skn1a/i (Epoc Oct11), and Oct6 (24.Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V.,II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G.

Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15905-15913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ubiquitous Oct1 is expressed in both mitotic and postmitotic keratinocytes (26.Andersen B. Hariri A. Pittelkow M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15905-15913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The expression of both Skn1a/i and Oct6 is restricted to cells of ectodermal origin, and especially for Skn1a/i, it appears to be limited almost exclusively to interfollicular epidermis and cortical cells of the hair. Both proteins have been found predominantly in the differentiating epidermal layers (24.Andersen B. Schonemann M.D. Flynn S.E. Pearse R.V.,II Singh H. Rosenfeld M.G.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the three major epidermal POU domain proteins, Oct1, Skn1a/i, and Oct6, regulate the transcription of the epidermal late differentiation marker profilaggrin in a distinct manner. Their effect on the endogenous gene activity is faithfully reproduced over the profilaggrin promoter in transiently transfected keratinocyte cultures. Two closely located octamer-like binding sites mediate the POU domain protein function. We provide evidence that all three proteins function in conjunction with c-Jun containing AP1 complexes. Our data demonstrate the complexity of the profilaggrin promoter activity and suggest that its ultimate regulation may require a fine balance between the activities of these epidermally expressed POU domain proteins. All recombinant DNA work was done by standard procedures (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The wild type and AP1-mutant profilaggrin constructs were described previously (4.Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The Oct mutants were generated with a polymerase chain reaction-based commercial site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), as suggested by the manufacturer. The wild type motif OctA (CATTATCTCAG) was mutated into CACTCACAGAG; OctB (TGGAGAAATAGAG) was mutated into TGGAGAACAAGAG. Total RNA was isolated from monolayers of submerged NHEKs by using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNase protection experiments were done with total cell lysates from about 105 cells and the commercially available Direct Protect lysate RNase protection assay kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Profilaggrin, Oct1, Skn1a, and Oct6 templates were created by subcloning polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments of the corresponding cDNAs in the original TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The template for 28 S RNA was purchased from Ambion. Antisense riboprobes were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase to an average specific activity of 1–5 × 108 dpm/μg. The protection assays for profilaggrin, 28 S RNA, and each of the transcription factors were carried out in a single tube. The protected fragments were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and detected by radiography after exposure at −70 °C for 2 days for profilaggrin, overnight for 28 S RNA and 5 days for the POU domain proteins. The profilaggrin/CAT templates were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction with profilaggrin and CAT-specific primers. A T7 promoter sequence was included at the 5′-end of the CAT primer to allow for in vitro transcription of the polymerase chain reaction fragments with a MAXIscript kit (Ambion). Similarly, the β-galactosidase templates were synthesized using thymidine kinase and β-galactosidase-specific primers. Neonatal foreskin NHEKs were grown in serum-free keratinocyte medium, transfected with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and assayed for CAT activity as described previously (4.Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30.Jurukovski V. Markova N.G. Karaman-Jurukovska N. Randolph R.K. Su J. Napoli J.L. Simon M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 67: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), grown, and transfected as described previously (4.Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For each set, at least five independent experiments were carried out. The transcription factor expression vectors were generous gifts from the following sources: Oct1, W. Herr (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory); Skn1a and Skn1i, B. Andersen (San Diego, CA); Oct6, E. Fuchs (Chicago, IL); c-Jun, M. Karin (La Jolla, CA); JunD, L. Lau (Chicago, IL). To enrich for cells transfected with each of the POU domain proteins, the Capture-Tec system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used. NHEKs were co-transfected with the corresponding expression vectors and the pHook-1 plasmid and selected on magnetic beads as instructed by the manufacturer. In a typical experiment, the selected cells made up about 15–20% of the total cell population. The mobility shift experiments were done with about 10 μg of NHEK nuclear extracts and 5 × 104 cpm of end-labeled, gel-purified, double-stranded oligonucleotides as already published (4.Jang S.-I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the binding reactions were preincubated with 2 μg of the designated antibodies. With the exception of the antibody against Oct6 (a gift from G. Lemke), all antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The sequences of the double stranded oligonucleotides were as follows: OctA, 5′-GGGGAAGCTTGCCATTATCTCAGCATGCATGT; OctB, 5′-GGGGAAGCTTGCATGTGGAGAAATAGAGTGCATGCTAG-3′; Ets/HMG/AP1, 5′-TGGTTAGGAATGAATCAGACCATCCCACAG-3′. The proximal promoter region of human profilaggrin gene (Fig. 1 a) encompasses two AT-rich motifs that are homologous to the consensus recognition sequence TAATGARAT of the POU domain transcription factors (10.Delhase M. Castrillo J.-L. de la Hoya M. Rajas F. Hooghe-Peters E., L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32349-32358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The first one, CA*TTATCTCAG (designated OctA), is located between positions –16 and –6. Recently we demonstrated that this motif binds the recombinant homeodomain protein Dlx3 (5.Andreoli J.M. Jang S.-I. Chung E. Coticchia C.M. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4287-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The second, TGGAGA*AATAGAG, was identified between positions –124 and –112 and was designated OctB. The two Oct sequences share nine complementary nucleotides (shown in boldface) with just one mismatch (marked with asterisks). To explore the role of the Oct motifs for the activity of the profilaggrin promoter, we transfected into NHEKs reporter constructs in which the expression of a CAT gene is under the control of either wild type, OctA, or OctB mutant promoter sequences. Invariably, mutation of the AT-rich core of OctA reduced the activity of CAT about 3-fold (Fig.1 b, black bars). Significantly, construct –41/+9, which encompasses only the OctA motif and the TATA box of the profilaggrin gene, did not show any marked CAT activity, suggesting that the OctA site was necessary but not sufficient to maintain the expression. Apparently, the positive interactions at the OctA site were not specific for epidermal keratinocytes, because the OctA mutant constructs showed similar behavior in HeLa cells (Fig. 1 b, open bars). In NHEKs, mutation of OctB within construct –354/+9 caused a 50% increase in activity, compared with the wild type. Gradual deletions of the sequences between –354 and –125 resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the levels of CAT. A further deletion to –116, which destroyed the OctB motif, abolished its inhibitory effect and resulted in activity that was similar to that of construct –354/+9. Mutations in the AT-rich core of OctB within construct –125/+9 restored the activity to the level of construct –116/+9. Together these results indicated that interactions at OctB have a silencing effect on the profilaggrin promoter activity and that elements residing between –125 and –354 may serve to overcome this effect. In contrast to OctA-, the OctB-mediated repression was observed only in NHEKs. In HeLa cells (Fig. 1 b, open bars) and in several other cell lines tested (e.g. dermal fibroblasts, neuroblastoma, HepG2, and embryonic carcinoma F9 cells; data not shown), the levels of expression of the wild type and OctB mutant constructs were comparable. The interactions between Oct sites and keratinocyte nuclear proteins were explored in mobility shift assays. Two strong, slowly migrating and several fast migrating complexes were formed between OctA and NHEK nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 a, lane 2). Their specificity was ascertained in competition experiments with an excess of unlabeled OctA and other oligomers. Invariably, excess of OctA prevented the detection of the slowly migrating complexes A1 and A2 and of the faster complex A3 (Fig. 2 a, lane 3). In contrast, incubation with a number of irrelevant oligonucleotides (such as AP1, AP2, and EF2) or with dI/dC did not interfere with the formation of complexes A1–A3 (data not shown). We concluded that complexes A1, A2 and A3 represented specific interactions between oligonucleotide OctA and nuclear proteins. The nature of the other complexes could not be unambiguously determined, and therefore, they were not further investigated. To elucidate the protein content of complexes A1, A2, and A3, the bandshift reactions were carried out in the presence of antibodies against the epidermal POU domain proteins. Preincubation with the antibody against Oct1 prevented the formation of complex A1 (Fig. 2 a, lane 4). The formation of complexes A2 and A3 was perturbed in the presence of the antibody against Skn1a/i (Fig. 2 a, lane 5) and to a lesser extent by the antibody against Oct6 (Fig. 2 a, lane 7). Similar co-migration of Skn1a/i and Oct6 complexes formed in epidermal nuclear extracts has been reported previously by Andersen et al. (26.Andersen B. Hariri A. Pittelkow M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15905-15913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). None of the complexes was affected by antibodies against Oct2 (Fig. 2 a, lane 6) or by an antibody against the transcription factor NF1, which also recognizes AT-rich DNA elements (Fig. 2 a, lane 8). Because of the ability of recombinant Dlx3 to bind the OctA motif (6.Morasso M.E. Markova N.G. Sargent T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1879-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we were surprised to observe that none of the OctA complexes was sensitive to an antibody against Dlx3 (data not shown). In bandshift experiments, OctB formed Oct1-sensitive (B1 and B2), Skn1a/i-sensitive (B3), and Oct6-sensitive (B3) complexes (Fig.2 b, lanes 2, 4, and 5, respectively). Similar to OctA, the OctB complexes did not include Oct2 (Fig. 2 b, lane 3) and were not sensitive to antibodies against non-POU domain proteins, such as Dlx3 (data not shown) and NF1 (Fig. 2 b, lane 6).Figure 5Effect of POU domain protein interactions on the AP1-dependent activity of the profilaggrin promoter. a, effect of Oct mutations on c-Jun and JunD activation. The designated wild type and mutant profilaggrin constructs were transfected into NHEKs (black bars) or HeLa cells (open bars) together with empty expression vectors for c-Jun or JunD. The dark striped bars show the activity after co-transfection with c-Jun, and the widely striped bars show the activity after co-transfection with JunD. The CAT values are presented relative to the levels obtained with construct –354/+9 co-transfected with the corresponding empty vectors. b, NHEK cultures were co-transfected with profilaggrin reporter constructs and expression vectors for either c-Jun (dark striped bars), the indicated POU domain protein (light striped bars), or c-Jun and the POU domain protein (shaded bars) or with the respective empty expression vectors (black bars). The CAT values are related to the activity of construct –354/+9 in the presence of the empty expression vectors: panel A,co-transfections with c-Jun and Oct1; panel B,co-transfections with c-Jun and Skn1a; panel D,co-transfection with c-Jun and Oct6. To avoid repetition, the results with the constructs co-transfected with c-Jun alone are shown only inpanel A. Panel C illustrates the usage of the cryptic transcription initiation site in response to forced expression of Skn1a. Wild type and OctA mutant constructs –354/+9 were co-transfected into NHEKs with loaded and unloaded Skn1a expression vectors, and the amount and the length of the profilaggrin/CAT transcripts were assayed by RNase protection. Lane 1represents the mobility of labeled 1-kb DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.); lanes 2 and 3 show the protected profilaggrin/CAT sequences in the absence and in the presence, respectively, of excess Skn1a; lane 4 shows the effect of the OctA mutation, which prevented the usage of the cryptic site even in the presence of Skn1a. In each case, a thymidine kinase/β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid was included in the transfection mixtures to monitor the efficiency of the transfection and the amount of the input RNA. Note that a 5-fold greater amount of cell lysate was analyzed in lane 4. Panel E shows the binding profile of the Ets/HMG/AP1 oligonucleotide with vector-programmed (lane 1) and Oct6-programmed (lanes 2–4) nuclear extracts; in the presence of antibodies against Oct6 (lane 3) and c-Jun (lane 4).

The ubiquitously expressed Oct1 transactivated profilaggrin construct –354/+9 at least 2-fold. This effect was exerted mainly through the OctA site, because mutation of the OctB site did not alter the degree of transactivation (Fig.3 a). We were not able to detect differentiation or cell type specificity in the effect of Oct1 (data not shown). Co-transfection of construct –354/+9 with Skn1a expression vector down-regulated the activity of the reporter (Fig.3 b). The effect was observed both in HeLa cells (Fig.3 b, open bar) and in NHEKs, in which it was most pronounced (5-fold) at elevated calcium concentrations (compare darkand light striped bars). Under these conditions, the “inhibitory” splice variant Skn1i (23.Kuhlbrodt K. Herbath B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) was one-half as efficient but still repressed the activity by more than 2-fold (compare thelight striped and shaded bars). To a large extent, the effect of Skn1a/i was mediated through the OctA motif, because its mutation reduced the repression to only 40%, whereas mutation of OctB still resulted in a 5-fold inhibition. However, mutation in the OctA motif was not able to completely prevent the repression. A similar effect of Skn1a was recorded, with constructs extending as little as 116 base pairs upstream of the transcription initiation site (e.g. –116/+9) and which did not encompass other octamer-like sequences. Notably, Skn1i, which binds DNA very poorly (25.Yukawa K. Yasui T. Yamamoto A. Shiku H. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Gene. 1993; 133: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was still able to repress transcription, to a level comparable to that obtained with Skn1a when binding to OctA was perturbed. These results suggested that the repression was exerted both through interactions of Skn1a with DNA over the OctA motif and with other transcriptional regulators. The latter did not require direct binding of Skn1a/i to DNA and were probably mediated through interfaces common for both splice variants. The more pronounced effect at higher calcium concentrations was also an indication that the Skn1a/i interactions were modulated by the differentiation state of the keratinocytes. In NHEKs, forced expression of Oct6 down-regulated the activity of profilaggrin construct –354/+9 by 30–50%, the effect being more pronounced in cultures induced to differentiate by calcium (Fig. 3 c, compare dark and light striped bars). The repression was specific for epidermal keratinocytes, because when co-transfected in HeLa cells, Oct6 increased the activity by more than 60%. These effects likely required interactions of the transcription factor with both DNA and other proteins, because a mutant variant of Oct6 with a truncated POU domain (ΔC, Ref. 26.Andersen B. Hariri A. Pittelkow M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15905-15913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was not able to transactivate in HeLa, but in NHEKs acted as a dominant negative mutant, reducing the activity below the level elicited by the empty vector (Fig. 3 c, shaded bars). The mutation of the OctA site in the frame of construct –354/+9 reduced Oct6-mediated activation in HeLa cells but could not interfere with Oct6 repression in NHEKs. In contrast, mutations in the OctB motif did not perturb transactivation in HeLa cells and in NHEKs caused activation by more than 50%. The profiles with the OctB mutants were very similar to the profile of construct –116/+9, which did not encompass the OctB motif. In this case Oct6 activated profilaggrin promoter in NHEKs through binding at the OctA motif, in a way similar to that in HeLa cells. Together, these data indicated that Oct6 could act, via site OctA, as a general positive regulator of the profilaggrin promoter. However, in the keratinocytes"

Mutation of non-cystine knot disulfide bond 7–31, bond 59–87, or both (leaving only the cystine knot) resulted in an efficiently secreted folding form that was indistinguishable from wild type. Conversely, the cystine knot mutants were inefficiently secreted (<25%). Furthermore, mutation of the cystine knot disulfide bonds resulted in multiple folding intermediates containing 1, 2, or 4 disulfide bonds. High performance liquid chromatographic separation of intracellular and secreted forms of the folding intermediates demonstrated that the most folded forms were preferentially secreted and combined with hCG-β. From these studies we conclude that: (i) the cystine knot of GPH-α is necessary and sufficient for folding and (ii) there is a direct correlation between the extent of GPH-α folding, its ability to be secreted, and its ability to heterodimerize with hCG-β.

GPH-α is a 92-amino acid subunit that contains five disulfide bonds in its native conformation (Fig. 1). According to the crystal structure (1.Lapthorn A.J. Harris D.C. Littlejohn A. Lustbader J.W.

Disulfide bonds 28–82 and 32–84 create an 8-amino acid ring structure by bridging adjacent polypeptide segments (residues 28–32 and 82–84) through which disulfide bond 10–60 penetrates.

Furthermore, approximately 30 other proteins are predicted to contain a cystine knot (4.Isaacs N.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, this conserved cystine knot motif is likely to be essential for the biological activity of numerous proteins. We have been interested in studying the structural features involved in the folding and assembly of GPH-α with various glycoprotein hormone β-subunits. Previous studies in our laboratory have defined the folding pathway of hCG-β by monitoring the sequential formation of its six intramolecular disulfide bonds (6.Beebe J.S. Mountjoy K. Krzesicki R.F.

The role of individual disulfide bonds in hCG-β secretion (11.Bedows E. Norton S.E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol.

Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of hCG-β has shown that the removal of disulfide bonds involved in discrete steps of the hCG-β folding pathway either disrupts the folding and assembly of hCG-β or slows progression to subsequent folding intermediates (10.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the three cystine knot disulfide bonds of GPH-α are necessary for efficient secretion and heterodimerization with hCG-β (13.Furuhashi M. Ando H. Bielinska M.

However, little is known about the role of individual disulfide bonds as GPH-α folds to its native conformation and how this folding process relates to GPH-α secretion and heterodimer formation. In this study, we have determined the role of disulfide bond formation in the intracellular folding of GPH-α and have determined the relationship between the extent of folding, the ability to be secreted, and the ability to form a dimer with hCG-β. Previous attempts to study the intracellular folding of GPH-α have been unsuccessful because GPH-α folds relatively fast (t 12 = ∼90 s), making the isolation of folding intermediates difficult. 2R. J. Darling, R. W. Ruddon, and E. Bedows, unpublished observation.2R. J. Darling, R. W. Ruddon, and E. Bedows, unpublished observation. Therefore, to characterize the role of each disulfide bond, we have converted each pair of cysteine residues involved in a disulfide bond to alanine. From these experiments, we have determined that removal of any of the three cystine knot disulfide bonds (10–60, 28–82, or 32–84) significantly disrupted folding and resulted in multiple folding intermediates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the most highly folded intermediates of the cystine knot mutants are preferentially secreted and combine with hCG-β, whereas the less folded forms are more highly degraded. Removal of each non-cystine knot disulfide bond individually or in combination, however, did not affect folding or secretion. To our knowledge, the results reported here are the first to describe the construction and folding of a cystine knot-containing protein from which all other disulfide bonds have been removed, except those involved in the knot. This has enabled us to specifically study the role of the cystine knot in GPH-α secretion and heterodimerization with hCG-β and should serve as a simplified model protein for future studies involving the cystine knot motif. 293T cells (15.Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown in Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (10.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine to alanine mutations were made using “megaprimer” polymerase chain reaction (16.Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) with Pfupolymerase (Stratagene). The 410-base pair fragment was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using HindIII and ApaI restriction sites. Clones containing an insert were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation(s). Plasmid preparation was performed using the Maxi Plasmid Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Stable Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were made by calcium phosphate precipitation of plasmid DNA followed by selection in Ham's F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing G418. Plasmid DNA was also used for transient transfection into 293T cells as described below. The abbreviations used to describe the disulfide bond mutations in which both cysteine residues of a given disulfide bond were converted to alanine are: C7–31A, C10–60A, C28–82A, C32–84A, and C59–87A. The mutant missing both disulfide bonds 7–31 and 59–87 is designated as C7–31A/C59–87A. 293T cells were plated into 60-mm plastic dishes and grown to 70–80% confluency. 5.0 ml of fresh medium was added to each dish 1 h before transfection. To precipitate the plasmid DNA, 15–20 μg of pcDNA3-α (wild type (WT) or mutant constructs) was diluted to 225 μl with sterile water and 25 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 was added. For co-expression of hCG-β with GPH-α, pcDNA3-hCGβ was included in the DNA/CaCl2 solution. The DNA/CaCl2solution was added dropwise to 250 μl of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (0.28 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 0.78 mmphosphate) pH 7.1 while vortexing. The resulting precipitate solution was placed on ice for 10 min and then added dropwise to a 60-mm dish of 293T cells and agitated gently to mix the precipitate and medium. To ensure a uniform precipitate exposure for all dishes, one large scale precipitation was used and distributed equally among all dishes. The transiently transfected 293T cells were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C and then used for metabolic labeling. Transiently transfected 293T or Chinese hamster ovary cells were pulse-labeled for the times indicated in the text with l-[35S]cysteine (∼1100 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), at a concentration of 100–150 μCi/ml, in serum-free medium lacking cysteine (10.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments using dithiothreitol (DTT) during the pulse, DTT was added with the [35S]cysteine at a final concentration of 2.0 mm. Pulse incubations were carried out as described previously (9.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were incubated for the chase times indicated. For secretion studies, the chase medium was saved. Cells were harvested by rinsing with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immediately lysed in 2.5 ml of PBS containing detergents (1.0% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS); protease inhibitors (20 mm EDTA and 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride); and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), pH 7.0, to trap free thiol groups of the GPH-α folding intermediates that contained unformed disulfide bonds. Cell lysates were incubated 10–20 min at room temperature in the dark, followed by disruption through a 22-gauge needle (five times) and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. For secretion studies, the chase medium was also clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was transferred to a 15-ml conical tube for immunoprecipitation. For secretion studies, PBS containing detergents, protease inhibitors (as described above), and NEM were added to the collected medium before immunoprecipitation. Studies performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and 293T cells gave similar results. The experiments described in this manuscript used 293T cells because higher GPH-α expression levels were attained. Immunoreactive forms of GPH-α were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes all known forms of GPH-α. Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C for 16–20 h with rotation in the dark. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or reversed-phase HPLC as described below. Radiolabeled GPH-α forms that adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads were prepared as described previously (9.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, protein A-Sepharose beads/antibody-antigen immunocomplexes were washed three times with PBS containing detergents (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) followed by three times with PBS lacking detergents. Immunocomplexes were pelleted between washes by centrifugation for 1 min at 2000 ×g. To dissociate precipitated immunocomplexes, pellets were treated with 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 3.0 (sequenal grade; Pierce) for 16–20 h while rotating at 20 °C. 100 μg of myoglobin was added as a carrier. The guanidine eluates were injected onto a Vydac 300-Å C4 reversed-phase column equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted using an acetonitrile gradient as described previously (8.Huth J.R. Mountjoy K. Perini F. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8870-8879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were collected in 1-min intervals, and 1–5% of each fraction was quantitated by scintillation counting. Samples were stored at −20 °C until further characterization. Data presented in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 have been normalized and plotted as a percentage of cpm because the data for some chase times were obtained in different experiments where the level of [35S]cysteine incorporation differed. The percentage of cpm is defined as the percentage of the total [35S]Cys-labeled protein that eluted in each fraction.Figure 2The effect of DTT on GPH-α folding. 293T cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3-α (WT) were radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine for 10 min in the presence of 2 mm DTT followed by the chase conditions indicated.

Recovery of >98% of 35S as cystine for αN confirmed that all five disulfide bonds were formed. The S-S content shown in each bar graph is the average of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Radiolabeled GPH-α forms that adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads were prepared as described previously (9.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8880-8886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, GPH-α was eluted with twice concentrated SDS gel sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 40 μg/ml bromphenol blue). The samples, including the protein A-Sepharose beads, were boiled for 5 min, loaded on polyacrylamide gradient slab gels (5–20%), and run by the method of Laemmli (17.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gels were dried in vacuo on filter paper and exposed to a phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics). The exposed phosphor screen was scanned on the Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 using Molecular Dynamics Scanner Control (version 4.1) software. Bands were quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics ImageQuaNT (version 4.2a) volume report. A modified protocol, similar to the one used in determining the disulfide folding pathways for potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor and human epidermal growth factor (18.Chang J.Y. Canals F. Schindler P. Querol E. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Chang J.Y. Schindler P. Ramseier U. Lai P.H. J. Biol.

[35S]Cysteine containing folding forms of GPH-α isolated from reversed-phase HPLC were dried in vacuo and hydrolyzed by vapor phase HCl under vacuum for 75 min at 150 °C in a Waters Pico-Tag work station. Quantitation of [35S]cystine and succinyl-[35S]cysteine (hydrolysis product of NEM-Cys) was performed using a modification of the method described by Cohen and Michaud (20.Cohen S.A. Michaud D.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Hydrolysates were resuspended in 10 μl of 10 mm HCl. To this, 70 μl of 0.2 n borate buffer, pH 8.8, was added. Derivatization of amino acids was performed by adding 30 μl of 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (8 mg/ml in anhydrous acetonitrile). Samples were dried in vacuo. Before injection, samples were resuspended in 110 μl of buffer A (140 mm sodium acetate, 17 mm triethylamine, pH 4.9). Separation of derivatized amino acids was performed using a Waters Nova-Pak 4 μm C18 column using buffer A and buffer B (60% acetonitrile in water). The column was eluted using the following gradient: (i) 3% B to 11% B from 0–20 min, (ii) 11% B to 37% B from 20–45 min, (iii) 37% B to 100% B from 45–48 min, and (iv) reequilibration at 0% B for 15 min. The column was eluted at 1.0 ml/min at 30 °C, and 1-ml fractions were collected and quantitated by scintillation counting. The peak containing [35S]cystine represented cysteine residues involved in a disulfide bond, whereas succinyl-[35S]cysteine represented unformed disulfide bonds. The percentage of [35S]cystine and succinyl-[35S]cysteine was calculated by dividing the cpm recovered for each species by the total cpm recovered. Fully folded [35S]cysteine-labeled hCG-β was used as a positive control for [35S]cystine content. Folding forms of GPH-α mutants that combined with hCG-β were co-immunoprecipitated with hCG-β using a polyclonal hCG-β antibody followed by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose beads as described previously (10.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunocomplex-containing beads were prepared for reversed-phase HPLC as described above. Guanidine elution of the subunits from the Sepharose beads prior to HPLC dissociates the α/β heterodimer (10.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the dimer was dissociated, the GPH-α and hCG-β subunits co-eluted and therefore were not resolved by reversed-phase HPLC. Fractions containing [35S]cysteine-labeled GPH-α and hCG-β were combined and concentrated in vacuo, and the volume and pH was adjusted using PBS containing detergents. To separate the dissociated subunits, GPH-α was immunoprecipitated with GPH-α polyclonal antiserum. This step isolated the forms of GPH-α that co-precipitated with hCG-β and, thus, represents assembly-competent GPH-α folding forms. Following GPH-α immunoprecipitation, a second immunoprecipitation was performed with hCG-β polyclonal antiserum. The immunoprecipated GPH-α and hCG-β were each analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC as described above. The intracellular kinetics of GPH-α folding is relatively fast (t12 = ∼90 s), making the analysis of short time points (0–5 min) in pulse-chase experiments difficult. This is because most of the35S-labeled GPH-α has achieved a fully folded conformation during a 3–5-min pulse. To more effectively study GPH-α folding, we needed a strategy to better control the kinetics of GPH-α folding. Treatment of cells with DTT reversibly retains proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum that require disulfide bond formation for folding, while having no detectable effect on secretory proteins that do not contain disulfide bonds (21.Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if DTT treatment reversibly blocked the folding of GPH-α, we could use DTT during the pulse phase to allow [35S]cysteine labeling while maintaining GPH-α in its unfolded conformation. Subsequent folding steps could then be defined after removal of DTT. To examine this, 293T cells transiently expressing GPH-α were radiolabeled with [35S]cysteine for 10 min in the presence of 2 mm DTT and chased in medium with or without 2 mm DTT for 5 min. GPH-α folding intermediates were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using a polyclonal α-antibody and separated by reversed-phase HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2 A (0 min chase), 2 mm DTT blocked the folding of GPH-α as indicated by the late eluting peak (αu). The αu peak represents the accumulation of completely reduced, unfolded GPH-α as indicated by >95% of the [35S]cysteine being recovered as NEM-alkylated cysteine residues (Fig. 2 A, right panel). When 2 mm DTT was maintained throughout the 5-min chase, GPH-α remained unfolded (Fig. 2 B). However, removal of DTT during the 5-min chase resulted in rapid GPH-α folding to the native conformation (αN) containing five disulfide bonds (Fig.2 C). In this context, we use the term “native conformation” to define a form of GPH-α that contained five disulfide bonds, that was efficiently secreted (see under “The Effect of Disulfide Bond Mutations on GPH-α Secretion”), that combined with hCG-β (10.Bedows E. Huth J.R. Suganuma N. Bartels C.F. Boime I. Ruddon R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11655-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that eluted at 28 min on reversed-phase HPLC. The folding from the unfolded species (αu) (Fig. 2,A and B) to the less hydrophobic, native conformation (αN) (Fig. 2 C) resulted in a shift to an earlier elution time (28 min). Thus, treatment of 293T cells with 2 mm DTT inhibited the folding of GPH-α, and this inhibition was reversible when DTT was removed. Previous studies have shown that mutation of the cystine knot disulfide bonds (10–60, 28–82, and 32–84) results in an unstable molecule that is highly degraded and combines inefficiently with hCG-β (13.Furuhashi M. Ando H. Bielinska M. Pixley M.R. Shikone T. Hsueh A.J. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25543-25548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Sato A. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Kudo M. Pixley M.R. Furuhashi M. Hsueh A.J. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18098-18103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that formation of the cystine knot plays an important structural role in the ability of GPH-α to fold into its native conformation. To test this hypothesis, five mutants were created by converting each pair of cysteine residues to alanine such that each mutant lacked the ability to form one of the five disulfide bonds. The mutants created were C7–31A, C59–87A, C10–60A, C28–82A, and C32–84A (see Fig. 1 for disulfide bond locations). Disulfide bonds 7–31 and 59–87 of GPH-α are located in loops 1 and 3, respectively, and are not involved in the cystine knot motif. Pulse-chase studies were performed to determine the ability of the two non-cystine knot mutants, C7–31A and C59–87A, to fold. 293T cells transiently expressing C7–31A or C59–87A were labeled with [35S]cysteine for 10 min in the presence of 2 mm DTT to block folding and then chased for 0 or 5 min in the absence of DTT to allow folding to proceed. As shown in Fig.3, disruption of disulfide bond 7–31 or disulfide bond 59–87 did not affect the ability of GPH-α to convert to a folded form (αf) that eluted at the same position as WT. The folded forms of these mutants were not designated αN (native) because HPLC elution times may not necessarily separate all native and native-like species. Based on these results, we next wanted to determine whether the three cystine knot disulfide bonds were sufficient for folding. To address this issue, a mutant lacking both disulfide bonds 7–31 and 59–87 (C7–31A/C59–87A) was constructed and analyzed as described above. The simultaneous mutation of disulfide bonds 7–31 and 59–87 resulted in a protein that contained only the three cystine knot disulfide bonds. As shown in Fig.3, the C7–31A/C59–87A mutant folded within 5 min to a form indistinguishable from that of the C7–31A and C59–87A single disulfide mutants and that of native WT-α. These data demonstrate that the non-cystine knot disulfide bonds 7–31 and 59–87 are not required for folding to a form that is indistinguishable from WT GPH-α. Thus, the three cystine knot disulfide bonds appear to be sufficient for folding and may function as the major structural framework for GPH-α. In contrast to the C7–31A and C59–87A mutants, disruption of any of the cystine knot disulfide bonds (10–60, 28–82, or 32–84) resulted in multiple folding forms (Fig. 4). Using HPLC elution times as an indicator of relative hydrophobicity, the degree of folding of the various intermediates for each mutant was assessed. Thus, within each series of intermediates, α1was the least folded, and α3 or α4 was the most folded. Based on this analysis, none of these intermediates were as folded as native WT-α. As shown in Fig. 4, the multiple folding intermediates were present at 2 min and remained for up to 10 min of chase. Chase times of greater than 10 min did not result in further progression of the less folded forms to the most folded form (data not shown), suggesting that a portion of the less folded forms became trapped. Studies on the in vitro folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor have established precedence for kinetically trapped, dead-end intermediates (22.Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9900-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 23.Zapun A. Creighton T.E. Rowling P.J. Freedman R.B. Proteins. 1992; 14: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To ensure that the isolation of multiple folding forms was not due to labeling in the presence of 2 mm DTT, experiments were performed without DTT, and the same profile of intermediates was obtained (data not shown). Furthermore, Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing each of these mutants gave similar results, suggesting that the folding observed was not cell type-specific (data not shown). Taken together, the analysis of folding intermediates for each disulfide bond mutant supports our hypothesis that the cystine knot disulfide bonds play a more important role in attaining a native conformation than the two non-cystine knot disulfide bonds. The data presented in the previous section demonstrated the importance of the three cystine knot disulfide bonds. Their disruption by mutagenesis resulted in multiple intermediates representing non-native conformations. To further investigate the nature of the folding forms isolated for the disulfide bond mutants, we determined the number of disulfide bonds formed for each of the isolated species. Fractions representing the folding forms observed in Figs. 3 and 4 were isolated by reversed-phase HPLC and further analyzed by amino acid analysis. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” acid hydrolysis of the isolated folding forms resulted in the production of [35S]succinyl-cystine (i.e. hydrol"
https://openalex.org/W2056550604,"RPTPμ is a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) whose ectodomain mediates homotypic cell-cell interactions. The intracellular part of RPTPμ contains a relatively long juxtamembrane domain (158 amino acids; aa) and two conserved phosphatase domains (C1 and C2). The membrane-proximal C1 domain is responsible for the catalytic activity of RPTPμ, whereas the membrane-distal C2 domain serves an unknown function. The regulation of RPTP activity remains poorly understood, although dimerization has been proposed as a general mechanism of inactivation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we find that the C1 domain binds to an N-terminal noncatalytic region in RPTPμ, termed JM (aa 803–955), consisting of a large part of the juxtamembrane domain (120 aa) and a small part of the C1 domain (33 aa). When co-expressed in COS cells, the JM polypeptide binds to both the C1 and the C2 domain. Strikingly, the isolated JM polypeptide fails to interact with either full-length RPTPμ or with truncated versions of RPTPμ that contain the JM region, consistent with the JM-C1 and JM-C2 interactions being intramolecular rather than intermolecular. Furthermore, we find that large part of the juxtamembrane domain (aa 814–922) is essential for C1 to be catalytically active. Our findings suggest a model in which RPTPμ activity is regulated by the juxtamembrane domain undergoing intramolecular interactions with both the C1 and C2 domain.

Members of the superfamily of PTPs use the same catalytic mechanism and are broadly classified into transmembrane or receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) and intracellular, nonreceptor PTPs (reviewed in Refs. 1.Fauman E.B.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Members of the RPTP subfamily are type I membrane proteins consisting of a variable ectodomain, a single membrane-spanning region, and in most cases, two conserved intracellular phosphatase domains. The RPTPs are further classified according to the structure of their ectodomains (reviewed in Refs. 3.Fischer E.H. Charbonneau H. Tonks N.K.

The large variety in ectodomain structure suggests the existence of an equal number of putative ligands, yet in most cases the corresponding ligands have not been identified. RPTPμ is the prototype member of a subfamily of RPTPs that mediate homophilic cell-cell interactions via their ectodomains and, hence, are thought to play a role in cell adhesion-mediated processes (5.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Brady-Kalnay S.M. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K.

The ectodomain of RPTPμ shows similarities with that of cell-cell adhesion molecules and consists of an N-terminal “MAM” domain, which is critical for mediating cell-cell adhesion (9.Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Jiang Y.-P. Sap J. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14247-14250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), followed by an Ig-like domain and four fibronectin type III repeats (10.Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I.

Its intracellular part consists of a juxtamembrane domain of 158 amino acids (aa), which is relatively long compared with that in other RPTPs, and two tandem phosphatase domains referred to as C1 and C2. As in most other RPTPs, the membrane-proximal C1 domain of RPTPμ is catalytically active, whereas the membrane-distal C2 domain shows no activity, at least in vitro (11.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Verheijen M.H.G. Zondag G.C.M. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The C2 domains of most RPTPs have been proposed to play a regulatory role (12.Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), but how it might contribute to RPTP activity is not known. One major unresolved question is how ligand binding may influence the catalytic activity of RPTPs to affect signal transduction events. A recently proposed model involves dimerization, as inferred from the crystal structure of RPTPα (13.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This model suggests that ligand binding induces the formation of a symmetrical dimer in which the catalytic site of one molecule is blocked by specific interactions with a helix-turn-helix segment (termed the “wedge”) in the juxtamembrane domain of the other (13.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). There is no wedge-like region present directly upstream of the C2 domain, suggesting a fundamental difference between the C1 and C2 domains. Based on these structural studies, dimerization has been proposed to be a universal mechanism of inactivation of RPTPs (reviewed in Ref. 14.Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, earlier studies had already indicated that the leukocyte-specific RPTP CD45 can form homodimers (15.Takeda A. Wu J.J. Maizel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16651-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that artificial induction of CD45 dimerization may lead to loss of function (16.Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Using a epidermal growth factor receptor-CD45 chimera, a part of CD45 homologous to the inhibitory helix-turn-helix wedge in RPTPα was recently shown to inhibit CD45 function after ligation by epidermal growth factor (17.Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), in support of the dimerization model. On the other hand, however, the crystal structure of RPTPμ does not reveal such intermolecular interactions between a wedge region and the C1 domain (18.Hoffmann K.M.V. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27505-27508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It seems that the catalytic site of RPTPμC1 is unhindered and adopts an open conformation similar to what is observed in the cytosolic PTP, PTP1B (19.Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the RPTPμ dimer may be the consequence of crystallization, because dimers were not found in solution. Furthermore, some residues important for the proposed dimerization mechanism are less conserved in RPTPμ (18.Hoffmann K.M.V. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27505-27508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20.Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.-P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), suggesting that RPTPμ may not be regulated by dimerization (reviewed in Refs. 14.Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and20.Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.-P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence for a new type of interdomain interaction involved in the regulation of RPTPμ activity. In a search for potential binding partners of the C1 domain using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding part of RPTPμ itself, consisting of a large part of the juxtamembrane domain and a small part of the C1 domain. We show that this “JM” segment can interact with both the C1 and C2 domain and present evidence suggesting that this interaction is intramolecular rather than intermolecular. We further show that the juxtamembrane domain is essential for catalytic activity of the C1 domain. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which the juxtamembrane domain may contribute to the regulation of RPTPμ activity. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with antibiotics and 8% fetal calf serum. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells were performed by the DEAE-dextran method as described in Ref. 21.Zondag G.C.M. Moolenaar W.H. Gebbink M.F.B.G. J.

Biotinylated anti-HA antibody and anti-FLAG tag monoclonal antibody M2 were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Eastman Kodak Co., respectively. Monoclonal antibody 3D7 directed against the extracellular domain of RPTPμ has been described previously (22.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Koningstein G.M. Feiken E. Wubbolts R.W. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For use as a bait in the two-hybrid screen, the first catalytic domain of RPTPμ (RPTPμC1) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using primers 5′-TATGTCGACAACAGAATGAAGAACAGATACG and 5′-CCGGAATTCCTCTTTAATCTG. RPTPμC1 was fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain bySalI-EcoRI subcloning into pMD4 (23.Smit L. van der Horst G. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8564-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) containing atrp1 marker for selection. pMD4-RPTPμC1 was co-transfected into the lacZ and his3 containing yeast strain Y190, together with a pVP16-based (24.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) human testis cDNA library (kindly provided by R. Bernards) that carries the leu2marker. Yeast transformants expressing the reporter genes were selected on medium lacking histidine and supplemented with 25 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Positive colonies were identified by β-galactosidase filter assays. Plasmid pMT2-HA-cl.2 was constructed by subcloning the insert from pVP16-clone 2 into a modified pMT2 vector containing an HA tag. pMT2-FLAG-RPTPμC1, C1M, and C2 plasmids were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and standard cloning procedures. The wild type and mutant first PTP domain were amplified by sense (5′-TATGTCGACAACAGAATGAAGAACAGATACG) and antisense (5′-GCGTCTAGAATTCCTCTTTAATCTG) primers using hFL and hFLm constructs as template (5.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Zondag G.C.M. Wubbolts R.W. Beijersbergen R.L. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16101-16104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. The second PTP domain was amplified using sense (5′-ATTACTCGAGCGGACGCTAAACATGGTGAC) and antisense (5′-TCATTCTAGAACACCATCAGCCAGAATTCA) primers and hFL as template. All polymerase chain reaction products were verified by sequencing. pMT2-FLAG-RPTPμC1C2 was constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment containing the second PTP domain into plasmid pMT2-FLAG-RPTPμC1. HA- and Myc-tagged constructs encoding the juxtamembrane region and first catalytic domain (RPTPμJC1) were generated using primers 5′-TATGTCGACCTGAATGGGAGATCTGTGTC and 5′-TATGAATTCCTCATCTTTCTTAGCCGAGT. Amplified product was subcloned into pMT2-SM-HA and pMT2-SM-Myc and verified by sequencing. pMT2-hFL containing full-length RPTPμ cDNA has previously been described (11.Gebbink M.F.B.G.

The pMT2-HA-cl.2/E896R and pMT2-HA-RPTPμJC1/E896R plasmids (mutated glutamate 896 to arginine) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Promega) using primers 5′-GATGAAGTGTGCGCGGGGCTACGGCTTC) and 5′-GAAGCCGTAGCCCCGCGCACACTTCATC. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice in 1 ml (per 10 cm plate) of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and PefablocSC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After centrifugation, 200 μl of supernatant (for immunoblot analysis) or 1 ml of supernatant (for phosphatase assays) was incubated for 2 h with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) precoupled to specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting or assayed for phosphatase activity. For expression controls, 10 μl of total lysate was analyzed by Western blotting. Tyrosine phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitates was measured using a nonradioactive protein-tyrosine phosphatase assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Signals on Western blots were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In an attempt to identify proteins that interact with the C1 domain of RPTPμ, we used this domain as bait (RPTPμC1, aa 923–1190) in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human testis cDNA library. Two positive colonies were identified that contained identical testis-derived cDNA clones, termed clone 1 and clone 2. Strikingly, both clones encode a membrane-proximal region of RPTPμ (aa 803–955) consisting of a large part of the juxtamembrane domain (120 aa) and a small part of the C1 domain (33 aa) (Fig.1 A), which we refer to as either cl.2 or the JM region. As shown in Fig. 1 B,co-expression of RPTPμC1 and cl.2/JM in yeast results in the activation of the lacZ reporter gene. These results strongly indicate that the C1 domain undergoes either intermolecular or intramolecular interaction with the JM region. To confirm the observed C1-JM interdomain interaction in mammalian cells, HA-tagged clone 2 (HA-cl.2) encoding the JM polypeptide was transiently expressed together with epitope-tagged C1 (FLAG-RPTPμC1) in COS cells (Fig.2 A). When both proteins were co-expressed, C1 was co-precipitated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody (not shown), whereas HA-cl.2 was co-precipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Thus, the C1-JM interdomain interaction occurs in both yeast and mammalian cells. Given the sequence similarities between the C1 and C2 domains, we tested whether the C2 domain might also interact with JM. As shown in Fig. 2 A, this is indeed the case; when HA-cl.2 was co-expressed with the isolated C2 domain (FLAG-RPTPμC2; aa 1191–1452) or with both C1 and C2 domains in tandem (FLAG-RPTPμC1C2; aa 923–1452), HA-cl.2 was co-precipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. It thus appears that the JM polypeptide does not discriminate between the C1 and C2 domain for binding in COS cells. It is of note that the RPTPμC1C2 construct, containing both phosphatase domains, yields a stronger binding signal than either C1 or C2 (Fig. 2 A, last lane), as one would expect if each catalytic domain binds one HA-cl.2 molecule (JM polypeptide). We next examined whether the nature of the JM-C1 and JM-C2 interactions is intramolecular or intermolecular. To this end, COS cells were transfected with various epitope-tagged RPTPμ constructs and then subjected to immunoprecipitation and blotting assays. Strikingly, whereas HA-cl.2 (JM polypeptide) co-precipitates with the individual phosphatase domains as well as the tandem C1C2 domain (Fig.2 A), HA-cl.2 fails to interact with longer versions of RPTPμ: either a Myc-tagged polypeptide consisting of a large part of the juxtamembrane domain and the C1 domain (JC1, aa 814–1190) (not shown) or full-length RPTPμ (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, we find that HA-tagged JC1 does not co-precipitate with Myc-tagged JC1 (Fig. 2 B) nor with full-length RPTPμ (Fig. 2 C). The results of the co-immunoprecipitation analysis are summarized in Fig. 2 D. From these findings we conclude that the observed JM-C1/C2 interactions do not occur between different RPTPμ molecules. Thus, our results can only be explained by the JM-C1/C2 interactions being intramolecular rather than intermolecular. To determine which residues are involved in the interaction between the JM and C1 domains, we transfected RPTPμ constructs in which the following critical residues were mutated: cysteine 1095 to a serine (C1095S) and glutamate 896 to an arginine (E896R). The conserved cysteine 1095 is essential for catalytic activity of the C1 domain of RPTPμ. Mutation of cysteine 1095 to a serine (C1095S) was shown to completely abolish phosphatase activity (11.Gebbink M.F.B.G. Verheijen M.H.G. Zondag G.C.M. van Etten I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glutamate 896 is analogous to aspartate 228 of RPTPα. In the RPTPα dimer, this residue is located in the N-terminal wedge that inserts into the catalytic pocket of the C1 domain of the juxta-posed RPTPα molecule and thereby may block its activity (13.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Glutamate 896 of RPTPμ is also analogous to glutamate 624 in CD45; mutation of this residue was shown to abolish the inhibitory effect on T-cell receptor signaling caused by CD45 dimerization (17.Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We find, however, that the mutation C1095S in FLAG-RPTPμC1 did not affect association with HA-cl.2 (Fig. 3 A). We also find that the mutation E896R in HA-cl.2 does not affect the association with the C1 domain (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, catalytic activity and glutamate 896 are not essential for the association between the juxtamembrane and the C1 domain of RPTPμ. To examine how the distinct domains of RPTPμ contribute to catalytic activity, we determined tyrosine phosphatase activity in immune complexes using a nonradioactive tyrosine phosphatase assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). We measured the activity of both full-length RPTPμ and different epitope-tagged constructs of RPTPμ (Fig. 4,A and B) expressed in COS cells. We found that the isolated C1 and C2 domains as well as C1C2 are inactive (Fig.4 B). In marked contrast, however, N-terminal extension of the C1 domain leads to phosphatase activity as inferred from the JC1 polypeptide being active in the assay. In other words, the juxtamembrane domain is required for activity of the C1 domain. This is consistent with reports on LAR and RPTPα, which show that the isolated C1 domains require at least part of the juxtamembrane domain for activity in vitro (12.Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25.Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The present data also indicate that the C2 domain is not required for activity of the C1 domain, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the C2 domain may somehow contribute to the activity of C1. Finally, we found that the E896R mutation in the juxtamembrane domain of HA-RPTPμJC1 does not affect phosphatase activity when compared with the wild-type JC1 polypeptide (Fig. 4 B), indicating that glutamate 896 is not essential for activity of the C1 domain. In the present study, we have shown that the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPμ can bind to both the first and the second phosphatase domain (C1 and C2) and that this interaction is likely to be intramolecular rather than intermolecular. Furthermore, we have presented evidence that the juxtamembrane domain is required for the C1 domain to become fully active. Through yeast two-hybrid analysis, we found that the RPTPμC1 domain binds to an RPTPμ segment, termed JM, consisting of a large part of the juxtamembrane domain and a small part of the C1 domain. Our COS cell experiments revealed that the JM segment interacts not only with C1 but also with the C2 domain of RPTPμ. These results would be consistent with RPTPμ forming dimers, in which the JM region of one molecule interacts with the juxtaposed C1 and/or C2 domains in the partner RPTPμ molecule, analogous to what has been proposed for the C1 domain of RPTPα (13.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Inconsistent with a homodimerization model, however, is our finding that the JM segment fails to interact with extended, JM-containing versions of RPTPμC1. JM also fails to interact with full-length RPTPμ. We also did not detect any interdomain interactions between versions of RPTPμ that comprise both JM and C1. These results are most readily explained by a model in which JM-C1/C2 binding represents an intramolecular interaction within one single RPTPμ molecule. Mutational analysis indicates that the interaction is independent of RPTPμ catalytic activity and of glutamate 896 in the helix-turn-helix segment, which is analogous to that in the corresponding motif of CD45, where it has been implicated in dimerization-dependent inhibition of CD45 activity caused by dimerization (17.Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In a recent crystallographic study on the RPTPμC1 domain (residues 874–1168), it was concluded that the protein behaves as a monomer in solution and that C1-C1 dimerization is most likely a consequence of crystallization (18.Hoffmann K.M.V. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27505-27508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The C1 crystal structure revealed that the catalytic site is unhindered and adopts an open conformation. Caution is needed, however, to extrapolate findings obtained with RPTPμC1 to the full-length molecule, particularly because the juxtamembrane domain was excluded from crystallographic analysis and, hence, any JM-C1 interaction would go undetected. The N terminus of the C1 domain used for crystallization starts at the helix-turn-helix segment (at the membrane-distal end) very close to the boundary of the C1 domain. This would imply that a more membrane-proximal part of the juxtamembrane domain (immediately N-terminal to the helix-turn-helix structure) is involved in the observed JM-C1/C2 interaction. Further crystallization studies using N-terminally extended versions of the C1 domain are required to clarify this point. It seems likely that the interdomain interactions found in RPTPμ also occur in other members of the RPTP family. It is of note that the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPμ, in common with the other MAM domain containing RPTPs, is about 70 residues longer than that in all other RPTPs (10.Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. Geurts van Kessel A. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); the significance of this extension remains unknown. It will be interesting to see whether JM-C1/C2 interactions are a specific feature of the MAM domain-containing subfamily of RPTPs. Our results support the view that dimerization is not involved in the regulation of RPTPμ activity, in contrast to what has been proposed for the regulation of RPTPα and CD45 (14.Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 20.Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.-P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In fact, there is no direct evidence that RPTPα dimers are catalytically inactive. Parts of RPTPα, containing the inhibitory wedge and the C1 domain, are catalytically active and probably act as active monomers in solution (25.Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26.Wu L. Buist A. den Hertog J. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6994-7002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The RPTP dimerization concept has become even more complex since the C1 domain of RPTPς was reported to interact with the C2 domain of RPTPδ but not the RPTPςC2 with RPTPδC1 (27.Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent C1-C2 heterodimerization requires the wedge region of RPTPς, which was thought to bind the “pseudo-active” site in the juxtaposed RPTPδC2 domain (27.Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise cellular role of the C2 domain remains unknown, the latter result does suggest that the C2 domain is involved in a variety of protein-protein interactions. Very recently, structural studies on the tandem phosphatase domains of RPTP LAR revealed a monomeric configuration without any indication of dimer formation either in the crystal structure or in solution (28.Nam H.-J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The LAR crystal structure further reveals that the N-terminal helix wedge is not involved in any intermolecular interaction and that the catalytic sites of both C1 and C2 are accessible, a configuration that is in direct contrast to the previous model of dimeric-blocked orientation based on the crystal structure of the RPTPαC1 domain alone (28.Nam H.-J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We also have shown that the juxtamembrane region of RPTPμ is required for the C1 domain to be catalytically active, consistent with an intramolecular JM-C1 interaction regulating catalytic activity. Previous reports have shown that LAR and RPTPα similarly need the juxtamembrane domain for full catalytic activity (12.Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25.Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting a general regulatory mechanism of the juxtamembrane domain among RPTPs. Based on our findings, we propose a model explaining how the observed interdomain interactions may contribute to the regulation of catalytic activity (Fig. 5). In this model, RPTPμ can adopt two different conformations. In one conformation, the juxtamembrane domain interacts with the regulatory, catalytically inactive C2 domain. In this way, the C1 domain lacks interaction with the juxtamembrane domain and thereby remains inactive. When a proper tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate is presented, RPTPμ adopts a new conformation, in which the JM-C2 domain interaction dissociates to promote the formation of a JM-C1 intramolecular complex thereby stimulating catalytic activity and allowing substrate dephosphorylation. The precise function of the juxtamembrane domain remains to be elucidated. It could be important for proper folding of the C1 domain, but it might also be involved in substrate recognition and/or binding. Similarly, the role of the C2 domain remains poorly understood. Interactions between the C2 domain and other signaling molecules might be involved but still remain to be established. Recent mutational analysis has raised the intriguing possibility that C2 might in fact be an active PTPase domain in the correct cellular context (28.Nam H.-J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The role of the juxtamembrane domain and the C2 domain are key issues that need to be addressed for better understanding of the regulation of RPTPμ activity. In conclusion, our findings reveal the occurrence of interdomain interactions in RPTPμ, and given the lack of any indication for intermolecular interactions, they support the view that the dimerization model might not be applicable for the regulation of RPTP activity in general and that of RPTPμ in particular."

The results of this in vitro assay are consistent with the in vivo findings, in that both tRNA annealing and initiation of reverse transcription are sensitive to stable template RNA structure. Reverse transcription initiated by a DNA primer is less hindered by secondary structure in the RNA template than tRNA primed reactions.

Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). This process is mediated by the virion-associated enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT), and the cellular tRNA3Lys molecule is used as a primer by HIV-1 RT (2.Marquet R. Isel C. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The tRNA primer binds with its 3′-terminal 18 nucleotides to a complementary sequence in the viral genome, the primer-binding site (PBS), which is located in the untranslated leader region of the viral genome (Fig. 1 A). The leader region of HIV-1 is highly structured with distinct hairpin motifs (3.Hoglund S. Ohagen A. Goncalves J. Panganiban A.T. Gabuzda D.

Besides secondary structure, the HIV-1 leader RNA was recently demonstrated to adopt a compactly folded higher order structure in vitro (10.Berkhout B. vanWamel J.L.B. RNA. 2000; 6: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The combined results of replication studies with mutant viruses and spontaneous revertants thereof, phylogenetic analyses, RNA structure probing, and computer-assisted RNA folding suggest that part of the PBS is occluded in a hairpin structure (4.Baudin F.

Four nucleotides of the PBS are involved in base pairing to fold a small upstream stem-loop structure, the U5-PBS hairpin (Fig.1 A). RNA structure is not only present in the viral RNA template but also in the tRNA3Lys primer that is known to have a stable tertiary structure. Therefore, partial unfolding of both the tRNA primer and the viral RNA template is necessary for hybridization of these molecules and to initiate reverse transcription. Although the RT enzyme itself may be able to disrupt the secondary structure of the viral RNA and the tRNA primer (14.Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23867-23874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein has been proposed to be specifically involved in this process (reviewed in Ref. 15.Rein A. Henderson L.E. Levin J.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 297-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The NC protein binds preferentially to single-stranded nucleic acids and unwinds tRNAin vitro (16.Karpel R.L. Henderson L.E. Oroszlan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4961-4967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Surovoy A. Dannull J. Moelling K. Jung G. J. Mol.

Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Mugeyre M.T. Grüninger-Leitch F. Barré-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F.J. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3279-3285Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20.Prats A.C. Sarih L. Gabus C. Litvak S. Keith G. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we reported the importance of the U5-PBS hairpin for virus replication and its effect on reverse transcription (11.Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutations that alter the stability of the U5-PBS hairpin inhibit virus replication. In particular, we measured a reverse transcription defect in assays with the virion-extracted RNA-tRNA complexes as template. Stabilization of the hairpin was found to inhibit reverse transcription because of reduced tRNA primer annealing. Destabilization of the hairpin did not affect tRNA binding, and initiation of reverse transcription was in fact slightly activated. However, the interaction between the tRNA primer and this mutant genome appeared less stable than the corresponding wild-type complex, which may explain the replication defect of this mutant virus. Additional base pairing interactions between retroviral RNA sequences in the U5 region and the tRNA molecule have been suggested to stimulate primer annealing onto the PBS (21.Leis J. Aiyar A. Cobrinik D. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY1993Google Scholar, 22.Aiyar A. Cobrinik D. Ge Z. Kung H.J. Leis J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2464-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For HIV-1, a specific interaction has been proposed for the “U-rich” anticodon of tRNA3Lys and the “A-rich” loop of the U5-PBS hairpin (23.Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and this interaction may be affected by mutation of the U5-PBS hairpin. These combined results suggest that the U5-PBS hairpin is involved in both the proper annealing of the tRNA primer onto the viral RNA genome and the initiation of reverse transcription. However, a more detailed analysis is difficult with the virion-derived template-primer material. For instance, this assay system does not allow one to vary the experimental conditions of the tRNA annealing step. We therefore set up reverse transcription assays with in vitro synthesized RNA templates containing the stabilized and destabilized U5-PBS hairpin. Reverse transcription was studied with the natural tRNA3Lys and DNA primers that were annealed at different temperatures and in the presence or absence of NC protein. We demonstrate that both tRNA annealing and initiation of reverse transcription are sensitive to stable RNA structure in the template. However, initiation of reverse transcription was hindered more dramatically by template structure with the in vitro annealed tRNA primer than the in vivo placed tRNA. Apparently, the heat-annealed RNA-tRNA complex differs from the duplex that is formed within virion particles. The U5-PBS hairpin of the construct Blue-5′-LTR (24.Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3830-3840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was mutated by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis with a Muta-Gene phagemid in vitromutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) as described previously (11.Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used are as follows: Ts, 5′-AGACCCTTTTAGTCACTGCTGGAAAATCTCTAGC-3′; Td, 5′-CCTCAGACCCTTTTACAAAGTGTGGAAAATCTC-3′ (mutagenic positions underlined). The construct Blue-5′-LTR contains theXbaI–ClaI fragment of HIV-1, encompassing the 5′-LTR, PBS, and the 5′-end of the gag gene (positions −454 to +376), cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). Nucleotide numbers refer to positions on the wild-type genomic RNA transcript, with +1 being the capped G residue. The mutations introduced were verified by sequence analysis. Sequencing was performed with the primer AD-SD (positions +269 to +290) using the Thermo SequenaseTM dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and an Applied Biosystems 373 DNA sequencer. The control construct PBS− carries an 18-nucleotide deletion over the PBS sequence (25.Das A.T. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3090-3097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant pBlue-5′-LTR plasmids were used as template for PCR amplification and subsequent in vitro transcription. The 5′-LTR region of HIV-1 was PCR-amplified with the sense primer T7–2 (positions +1 to +20) with 5′-flanking T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and the antisense primer AUG (position +348 to +368, with 6 additional nucleotides at its 5′-end). The PCR fragments were phenol-extracted, precipitated, and dissolved in water. The in vitrotranscription reaction was performed in 10 μl of transcription buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol and 12 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5 μg of DNA template; 0.06 μmol of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP; 10 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); and 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Upon DNase treatment and phenol extraction, the unincorporated free nucleotides were removed by passage through a Sephadex G-50 column. Subsequently, the RNA was ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in renaturation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). The RNA was renatured by incubation at 85 °C for 2 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature, and stored at −20 °C. In the DNA- and tRNA-primed reverse transcription assays, 10 ng of in vitrosynthesized RNA template was incubated with 1.5 μg of calf liver tRNA (6 pmol total tRNA, of which approximately 1.2 pmol is tRNALys; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 20 ng of DNA primer in the presence or absence of 80 ng of NC protein in 12 μl of annealing buffer (83 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mm KCl) at 85 or 60 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling to room temperature over a 1-h period or at 37 °C for 30 min. We tested several alternative annealing buffers, buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and buffer K (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and a range of NC concentrations (80, 400, and 2000 ng). The primer was extended by the addition of 6 μl of RT buffer (9 mmMgCl2; 30 mm dithiothreitol; 150 μg/ml actinomycin D; 30 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; and 1.5 μm dCTP), 0.5 μl of [α-32P]dCTP, and 0.5 units of HIV-1 RT (U.S. Biochemical Corp.), and reverse transcription was performed for 30 min at 37 °C. The cDNA product was precipitated in 0.3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and 70% ethanol at −20 °C, dissolved in formamide loading buffer, and analyzed on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel. The antisense primers used were CN1 (positions +123 to +151), Top (positions +165 to +181), and Lys21 (positions +179 to +199), In the PBS occupancy assay, 10 ng of in vitro synthesized RNA template was incubated with 1.5 μg of calf liver tRNA in 12 μl of annealing buffer at 85 °C for 10 min, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature over a 1-h period. Subsequently, 20 ng of the DNA primer AUG (positions +348 to +368, with 6 additional nucleotides at its 5′-end) was added, and the mixture was again incubated for 10 min at 85 °C, followed by cooling to room temperature over a 1-h period. Reverse transcription and analysis of the cDNA products was performed as described above. We reported previously the construction and initial characterization of two HIV-1 mutants, designated Ts and Td, that stabilize and destabilize the U5-PBS hairpin structure, respectively. Mutant Ts is stabilized by two additional C-G base pairs compared with the wild-type hairpin. This was done by substitution of the unpaired G162 by C and by insertion of an additional C at position 165 (Fig.1 B, introduced mutations are marked by a box). This results in an increase in the thermodynamic stability of the hairpin from ΔG = −5.4 kcal/mol for wild-type to ΔG = −18.2 kcal/mol for mutant Ts. Mutant Td contains three nucleotide substitutions at positions 158–160. As a result, base pairing in the lower part of the stem is lost, and a relative short and instable hairpin structure is left (ΔG = −1.6 kcal/mol). RNA structure probing and computer modeling of a larger region of the HIV-1 leader RNA demonstrated that these mutations do not trigger an overall structural rearrangement of the HIV-1 leader (11.Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To study the role of the U5-PBS hairpin in the process of reverse transcription in more detail, we performed in vitro reverse transcription reactions. In these assays, we used in vitrotranscribed RNA templates encompassing the complete untranslated leader region of HIV-1 (positions +1 to +368) and calf liver tRNA as a source of tRNA3Lys primer. The tRNA primer was annealed onto the wild-type and mutant RNA templates at different temperatures with or without NC protein, and reverse transcription was subsequently initiated by the addition of HIV-1 RT enzyme and dNTPs, including [α-32P]dCTP. We will show representative experiments that were used to calculate the reverse transcription efficiency. Similar results were obtained in three to four independent experiments, with less than 10% variation in the relative reverse transcription efficiency calculated for the different templates. Extension of the tRNA primer on the wild-type and mutant templates produced a full-length 257-nt tRNA-cDNA product as well as shorter cDNA products (Fig. 2,lanes 5–28). No cDNA product was synthesized on the PBS-control template that carries an 18-nt deletion over the PBS, demonstrating that all products in this assay represent specific, tRNA3Lys-primed cDNA molecules (26.Oude Essink B.B. Das A.T. Berkhout B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most shorter cDNAs represent RT pauses, due to stable RNA secondary structure in the HIV-1 leader template (27.Klasens B.I.F. Huthoff H.T. Das A.T. Jeeninga R.E. Berkhout B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, one shorter cDNA (marked in Fig. 2) results from the extension of a half-tRNA3Lys molecule present in the calf liver tRNA preparation (results not shown; see also Ref. 28.Oude Essink B.B. Berkhout B. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because the pattern of full-length and shorter cDNA products did not differ for the different RNA templates and annealing conditions, we quantified the full-length tRNA-cDNA products and corrected them for the amount of input viral RNA template as determined by primer extension with the upstream DNA primer CN1. See Fig. 2 for reverse transcription assays and Fig.3 A for a schematic of the different primers positioned on the HIV-1 RNA template. The results of the reverse transcription assay are summarized in TableI.Figure 3Schematic showing different assays and primers used. A, schematic showing the relative positions of the primers used in reverse transcription assays.B, schematic showing the PBS occupancy test and the relative position of the AUG primer used. When the PBS is occupied by a tRNA primer, a 175-nt premature stop product is generated, whereas free RNA templates will produce a 374-nt full-length cDNA product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ItRNA-primed reverse transcription on wild-type and mutant HIV-1 templatesTemplatetRNA 85 °CtRNA 60 °CtRNA 37 °C−NC+NCNC effect−NC+NCNC effect−NC+NCcounts × 10 3counts × 10 3counts × 10 3Wild type560011,6002.1210043002.000Ts1008007.6030000Td830016,1002.0360063001.700PBS−000000 Open table in a new tab In the absence of NC protein (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8,13–16, and 21–24), reverse transcription on the wild-type template is reduced about 2-fold by annealing at 60 °C compared with 85 °C. No full-length tRNA-cDNA product was obtained after annealing of the tRNA primer at 37 °C. However, we did observe the shorter cDNA product that is initiated from the half-tRNA3Lys molecule. This result indicates that the highly structured tRNA molecule cannot bind the PBS at 37 °C, whereas the relatively unstructured 3′-half tRNA molecule can bind. Stabilization of the U5-PBS hairpin in mutant Ts severely reduced reverse transcription at all annealing temperatures (Fig. 2,lanes 6, 14, and 22). At 85 °C, we measured 2% of the reverse transcription efficiency observed on the wild-type template, and no cDNA product was detected after annealing at lower temperatures (Table I). The 3′-half tRNA3Lys molecule was also unable to prime on the Ts template. Destabilization of the U5-PBS hairpin in mutant Td was found to increase reverse transcription approximately 1.5-fold compared with the wild-type level (Fig. 2, lanes 7, 15, and 23, and Table I). Thus, stabilization of the U5-PBS hairpin inhibits tRNA-primed reverse transcription, whereas destabilization of the hairpin has a modest stimulatory effect. We also annealed the tRNA primer onto the wild-type and mutant RNA templates in the presence of NC protein at 85, 60, or 37 °C and performed reverse transcription reactions (Fig. 2, lanes 9–12, 17–20, and 25–28). On the wild-type template, a modest 2-fold stimulatory NC effect was measured in the annealing reactions at 85 and 60 °C. However, we were unable to synthesize full-length tRNA-cDNA products with NC protein at 37 °C. Because NC has been reported to stimulate tRNA annealing at physiological temperature, we repeated this experiment in several buffers and at various NC concentrations ranging from one NC molecule per 2–200 nucleotides, but we failed to measure tRNA-primed reverse transcription (results not shown). We also measured an approximately 2-fold stimulatory effect of NC on reverse transcription on the destabilized Td mutant template at 85 and 60 °C. Interestingly, reverse transcription on the structured Ts template was increased 8-fold by the addition of NC at 85 °C. A significant NC effect was also observed at 60 °C, but the fold induction could not be calculated because no cDNA product was observed in the absence of NC. The NC protein has been suggested to stimulate reverse transcription by unwinding of the structured RNA template and/or the tRNA molecule. The finding that the stabilized Ts template benefits more from the addition of NC is consistent with the idea that this protein unfolds the inhibitory structure in the template. On the other hand, the finding that NC can also stimulate reverse transcription on the destabilized Td template suggests that part of the NC effect is due to melting of the tRNA primer. Under “Discussion,” we will discuss the relative reverse transcription activities of the wild-type and mutant HIV-1 RNA templates in relation to the results that were obtained previously in the in vivo assays with virion-extracted viral RNA-tRNA complexes. The differences in the efficiency of reverse transcription on the mutant and wild-type templates is likely to be the result of differences in the amount of tRNA primer that is annealed onto the PBS. Alternatively, normal levels of tRNA may be bound, but their extension efficiency may differ on the mutant templates. To discriminate between these two possibilities, the tRNA occupancy of the PBS was determined. As shown in the scheme in Fig. 3 B, the tRNA primer was annealed onto the RNA template at 85 °C without NC protein, and this complex was subsequently used for extension of the DNA primer AUG that is positioned downstream of the PBS (Fig. 3 A, position +348 to +368 region, with 6 additional nucleotides at its 5′-end). When the PBS is occupied by the tRNA primer, extension of the AUG primer will stop prematurely to produce a cDNA product of approximately 175 nt, whereas free RNA templates will produce a full-length cDNA product of 374 nt. The PBS occupancy assay with the AUG primer is shown in Fig.4 (lanes 9–12). Control reactions were performed with the CN1 DNA primer and tRNA (Fig.4, lanes 1–4 and 5–8, respectively). The PBS− template was included as an additional control in the PBS occupancy test and yields exclusively the full-length cDNA product that is shorter than 374 nt due to the 18-nt PBS deletion (lane 12). Extension of the downstream AUG primer on the wild-type RNA-tRNA complex produced predominantly the 175-nt stop product (lane 9). Quantitation of the premature stop and the full-length products indicated that approximately 82% of the wild-type templates have an associated tRNA primer, these results are summarized in TableII. For the destabilized Td template, a similar value of 79% was calculated. This result indicates that increased reverse transcription on the Td template is not the result of increased tRNA binding but rather the result of a more efficient extension of the tRNA primer. Extension of the AUG primer on the stabilized Ts template produced primarily the full-length cDNA product, and quantitation indicated that the tRNA occupancy is reduced to 20%. Thus, stabilization of the RNA structure that occludes part of the PBS leads to a tRNA-annealing defect (20%), but a more severe reverse transcription defect was measured (2% activity), indicating that there is also a priming defect on the Ts template.Table IIPBS occupancyOccupancy%Wild type82Ts20Td79PBS−0 Open table in a new tab The results presented above indicate that structure in the template and primer can influence reverse transcription. To distinguish between these two effects we also performed reverse transcription with the DNA primer Lys21, which is complementary to the PBS (Fig. 3 A). This DNA primer has no apparent structure and allows one to focus exclusively on reverse transcription defects imposed by template RNA structure. The 199-nt-long cDNA products (Fig. 5, lanes 10–18) were quantified and corrected for the amount of input viral RNA template as determined by CN1 primer extension (Fig. 5,lanes 1–9). The results are summarized in TableIII. Unlike the results with the tRNA primer, partial annealing of the DNA primer was observed at 37 °C. No difference in DNA-primed reverse transcription was measured for the wild-type and Td template; this result was obtained after annealing at 85 and 37 °C and in the presence of NC. The stabilized Ts template demonstrated only 20% activity after primer annealing at 37 °C, but this defect was largely overcome by the addition of NC or by annealing at 85 °C (Table III). cDNA synthesis was stimulated by NC on all templates; this effect was approximately 1.5-fold for the wild-type and Td template and 3.8-fold for the Ts template. Similar to the results obtained with the tRNA primer, the stabilized Ts template benefits more from the presence of NC than the wild-type and Td templates. These results indicate that DNA-primed reverse transcription is also hindered by secondary structure in the template, although not as severely as reverse transcription primed by a tRNA molecule. For instance, we measured only 2% tRNA priming on the Ts template at 85 °C, compared with 65% DNA priming efficiency.Table IIIDNA-primed reverse transcription on wild-type and HIV-1 mutant templatesLys21Top85 °C37 °C37 °C + NCNC effect85 °C37 °C37 °C + NCNC effectcounts × 10 3counts × 10 3Wild type7700400063001.66400740088001.2Ts500090033003.710000Td7600400059001.5NDaReduced gel loading, due to loss of sample during sample preparation.680079001.2a Reduced gel loading, due to loss of sample during sample preparation. Open table in a new tab To test whether DNA priming can be inhibited more efficiently when the binding site for the primer is occluded completely by a secondary structure, we designed an additional DNA primer, termed Top (Fig.3 A). The Top primer anneals to the upper part of the U5-PBS hairpin and is perfectly complementary to the wild-type and mutant templates because its binding site does not include the nucleotides mutated in Ts or Td. The 181-nt-long cDNA products (Fig. 5,lanes 19–27) were quantified and corrected for the amount of input viral RNA template. The results are summarized in Table III. The Top primer was unable to initiate reverse transcription on the stabilized mutant Ts template, whereas reverse transcription of the wild-type and mutant Td template was initiated with equal efficiency (Fig. 5, lanes 18–27). These results indicate that annealing of a DNA primer can be precluded when the entire binding site is part of a stable RNA structure. The HIV-1 RNA genome encodes a semistable stem-loop structure, the U5-PBS hairpin, which occludes part of the PBS. The importance of the U5-PBS hairpin for virus replication and its effect on reverse transcription was reported previously (11.Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These in vivoresults are summarized in Fig.6 A, with the activity measured for the wild-type template set at 100%. Reverse transcription assays with these virion-extracted RNA-tRNAs complexes demonstrated that reverse transcription of the mutant Ts template was reduced to 27% of the value measured for the wild-type template. For mutant Td, a small increase in reverse transcription was consistently measured (125%). In addition, we determined the in vivo tRNA occupancy of the PBS of the wild-type and mutant genomes. We found that approximately 90% of the wild-type and mutant Td templates are associated with a tRNA primer, whereas the mutant Ts template has a PBS occupancy of only 23%. The somewhat increased reverse transcription efficiency of mutant Td results from increased initiation of reverse transcription. The major reverse transcription defect of mutant Ts is the result of reduced tRNA binding. The analysis of virus revertants demonstrates that replication can be restored by acquisition of additional mutations that reduce the stability of the Ts hairpin from ΔG = −18.2 kcal/mol to a ΔG value between −15.6 and −5.6 kcal/mol for the Ts revertants (11.Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This result suggests that reverse transcription can be initiated in vivo on templates with an intermediate stability. We now extended these studies on the HIV-1 U5-PBS hairpin with in vitro studies on primer annealing and reverse transcription. We analyzed the effect of temperature and NC protein on reverse transcription. These results are summarized in Fig. 6 B, and the activity of the wild-type template was set at 100% for each experimental variation. Stabilization of the U5-PBS hairpin in mutant Ts abolishes tRNA-primed reverse transcription in this in vitro assay. The wild-type U5-PBS hairpin appears also somewhat inhibitory because destabilization of this structure in mutant Td has a positive effect on reverse transcription. These results are consistent with the in vivo findings, but the inhibitory effect of secondary structure on reverse transcription appears more pronouncedin vitro. First, stabilization of the U5-PBS hairpin severely inhibits reverse transcription in vitro (Fig.6 B, 2–8%), even after annealing at high temperature or in the presence of NC protein. With the tRNA-viral RNA complex isolated from virions, a reverse transcription efficiency of 27% was measured (Fig. 6 A). Second, destabilization of the hairpin in mutant Td increases the reverse transcription efficiency to 125% in thein vivo assay (Fig. 6 A), whereas 140–170% efficiency was measured in vitro (Fig. 6 B). We previously suggested that the repressive effect of the U5-PBS hairpin in the wild-type HIV-1 RNA may preclude premature tRNA annealing and reverse transcription in infected cells. This partial suboptimal activity of the wild-type template was partially overcome upon annealing at 85 °C or in the presence of NC, indicating that these factors induce unfolding of the wild-type U5-PBS hairpin. In the virion, the presence of co-factors other than NC may stimulate further unfolding of the hairpin. The NC protein has been reported to stimulate tRNA annealing and the initiation of reverse transcription in vitro, and the annealing of the tRNA primer at physiological temperature in the presence of NC was reported (19.Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Mugeyre M.T. Grüninger-Leitch F. Barré-Sinoussi F. LeGrice S.F.J. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1989; 11: 3279-3285Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20.Prats A.C. Sarih L. Gabus C. Litvak S. Keith G. Darlix J.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We found that the presence of NC had a modest 2-fold stimulatory effect on reverse transcription on the wild-type and destabilized Td templates after annealing at 60 °C or even at 85 °C. This high temperature apparently does not interfere with NC function, suggesting that the NC zinc fingers, which are expected to be denatured at this temperature, are not required for NC-RNA binding. Consistent with this idea, in vitro RNA annealing activity was reported previously for mutant NC proteins lacking the zinc finger domains (29.De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournie-Zaluski M.-C. Roques B. Darlix J.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 30.Lapadat-Tapolsky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31.Prats A.C. Housset V. de Billy G. Cornille F. Prats H. Roques B. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3533-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, NC did not facilitate tRNA annealing at physiological temperature. Another study also reported a very modest effect of NC on in vitro reverse transcription (32.Morris S. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6307-6318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discrepancy with other studies may be caused by differences in RNA template, tRNA primer, or RT enzyme. Up to 8-fold stimulatory NC effect was measured for the stabilized Ts template. This result indicates that the stabilized Ts template benefits more from RNA unfolding by NC than the wild-type and mutant Td template. The finding that NC can activate reverse transcription on the unstructured Td template suggests that part of the NC effect is due to melting of the tRNA primer. To discriminate between the effect of structure in the template and in the primer on reverse transcription, we also performed reverse transcription assays with a DNA primer complementary to the PBS. In contrast to the tRNA primer, this DNA primer has no apparent structure and allows one to study exclusively the effect of template RNA structure. The results are summarized in Fig. 6 C, and the reverse transcription activity of the wild-type template was set at 100%. No difference was found between the wild-type and mutant Td template. This indicates that the secondary structure in the wild-type template is not inhibitory to DNA-primed reverse transcription, whereas it has a modest negative effect on tRNA-primed reverse transcriptionin vivo and in vitro (Fig. 6, A andB). The DNA-primed reverse transcription on the Ts template ranged from 20 to 65% (Fig. 6 C), depending on the annealing temperature and the presence of NC, whereas this template abolished tRNA-primed reverse transcription in vitro (Fig.6 B, 0–8% activity). This result indicates that reverse transcription initiated by a DNA primer is less hindered by the secondary structure in the RNA template than tRNA-primed reactions. Thus, the severe reverse transcription defect of the mutant Ts template with the tRNA primer is the result of inhibitory secondary structure in both the RNA template and tRNA primer. The tRNA occupancy of the PBS was determined for the different templates. We measured a similar PBS occupancy of approximately 80% for both the wild-type and destabilized Td template. These results are consistent with the in vivo experiments that indicated a PBS occupancy of approximately 90% (11.Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that suboptimal reverse transcription on the wild-type template is caused at the level of initiation of reverse transcription. These results indicate that template RNA structure can affect the initial stages of reverse transcription, as has been reported previously (33.Huang Y. Khorchid A. Gabor J. Wang J. Li X. Darlix J.-L. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3907-3915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Miller J.T. Ge Z. Morris S. Das K. Leis J. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In thein vivo experiments, we measured a reduced PBS occupancy (23%) for the stabilized Ts template that correlates with the 27% reverse transcription activity. This indicates that the reverse transcription defect results from reduced tRNA binding onto the PBS. In the in vivo experiments, we also measured reduced PBS occupancy (20%) for the Ts template, but a more severe tRNA priming defect was apparent (2%). Thus, the reverse transcription defect of mutant Ts in the in vitro assay results both from a reduced PBS occupancy and from a less efficient tRNA extension. This indicates that both tRNA annealing and the initiation of reverse transcription are sensitive to stable RNA structure in the template. However, initiation of reverse transcription by an in vitro annealed tRNA is hindered more effectively by the secondary structure than initiation by an in vivo placed tRNA. This suggests that there may be additional features within the virion particle that facilitate efficient reverse transcription. We reported previously efficient reverse transcription for mutant Tdin vivo, although reduced PBS occupancy was measured (11.Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Apparently, the tRNA primer was lost in the PBS occupancy assay during the heat denaturing step to anneal the downstream primer. This result indicates that the interaction between the tRNA primer and the mutant Td genome is less stable than the complex with the wild-type template, although both templates have an identical PBS. Moreover, several additional stop products upstream and downstream of the PBS were observed for the wild-type template during extension of the downstream primer. These stops are due to tRNA annealing, because the signals are not observed with the mutant Ts template. Most importantly, these stops were also not observed for the mutant Td template, indicating that a different conformation of the viral RNA-tRNA complex is reached on the wild-type template compared with mutant Td. This result suggests that the U5-PBS hairpin is directly or indirectly involved in correct tRNA annealing onto the viral RNA genome. Several studies suggest that the A-rich loop of the U5-PBS hairpin interacts directly with the anticodon of tRNA3Lys (23.Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol.

This interaction may be affected by destabilization of the hairpin in mutant Td. We measured no difference in the placement of the tRNA primer onto the wild-type or destabilized Td template, but this could be measured only upon heat annealing. These results suggest that the heat-annealed RNA-tRNA complex differs from the virion-extracted vRNA-tRNA complex, as has been suggested previously (47.Huang Y. Shalom A. Li Z. Wang J. Mak J. Wainberg M.A. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4700-4706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Chan B. Weidemaier K. Yip W.-T. Barbara P.F. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This may explain the more severe inhibitory effect of secondary structure on reverse transcription in vitro and indicates that the complex process of HIV-1 reverse transcription cannot be faithfully studied in simplified in vitro reactions.

https://openalex.org/W2061133731,"Both estrogen receptor (ER) and Pit-1 proteins are essential for the estrogen-activated expression of the rat prolactin gene. Our results show that ER·Pit-1 protein complex formation is reduced by estrogen in GH3 and PR1 rat pituitary tumor cells. In the latter, this decrease was blocked by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. On the other hand, the direct addition of estrogen to PR1 cell lysates had no effect on the formation of ER·Pit-1 complexes. Estrogen-activated prolactin gene expression was also inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting that some form of protein synthesis is involved in ER·Pit-1 complex formation and subsequent prolactin gene activation. In support of this notion, we showed that estrogen-induced regulation of ER·Pit-1 complex formation could be transferred from cell lysates prepared from estrogen-treated PR1 cells to control cell lysates. This is not true for GH3 cells; instead, direct administration of estrogen to GH3 cell lysates readily abolished ER·Pit-1 protein complex formation in a dose-dependent manner, and such estrogen-induced regulation was blocked by the antiestrogen ICI 182,780. These findings thus indicate that 1) interaction between ER and Pit-1 proteins is estrogen-regulated in ways specific to different cell types, and 2) auxiliary protein factor synthesis may be involved in this process."
