https://openalex.org/W87543932,"Streptococcus bovis is an unusual member of the genus Streptococcus because it can synthesize its major cellular nitrogen compounds from ammonium salts (1). Other members of the genus are well known for their requirements for amino acids. Bn enzyme survey was conducted in order to provide information concerning the primary sites of incorporation of NHa into organic nitrogen in Streptococcus bovis. During the course of this survey, it was found that cell extracts were capable of catalyzing the formation of a hydroxamate of aspartic acid in the presence of adenosine triphosphate and Mg++, whereas no similar reaction could be detected with glutamic acid as substrate. These observations suggested the possibility that the extracts contained an asparagine-synthesizing system and were devoid of glutamine synthet.ase. The aspartate-activating system was purified and shown to be an asparagine synthetase which catalyzes the following reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1969237285,"A SMALL rectangular block of the mesoderm immediately subjacent to the superficial venous plexus was excised from the wing bud apex in stages 25–26 of chick embryos and replaced with an isolate of mesoderm from the prospective thigh or proximal foreleg region. The graft extended from the dorsal to the ventral surface of the wing bud apex and did not lie in contact with the apical ridge of the ectoderm; it was separated from the latter structure by the mesoderm intervening between the apical ectoderm and the superficial venous plexus, namely, by about 15–20 layers of mesodermal cells of the wing bud (histological control)."
https://openalex.org/W2081611759,BABOON (Papio anubis) marrows were taken from either the sternum or iliac crest stained with Leishman and Giemsa and examined as thin smears. In the majority of these smears nests of plasma cells as well as early erythro-blasts were seen surrounding a central reticulo-endothelial oell (Fig. 1).
https://openalex.org/W2986508225,"GREGORY1 offers a general account of visual illusions, relating the apparent distortions in them to the perceptual process of size constancy. He observes that Tausch is the only previous writer to have considered constancy in relation to illusions. However, Gibson2 has incorporated illusory perceptions within the context of size constancy, and suggests that perception of size is a by-product of a constant scale, which Gregory calls ‘constancy scaling’, at different distances. Arguing that illusory figures are “flat projections of typical views of objects lying in three-dimensional space”, Gregory notes that “the parts of the figure corresponding to distant objects are expanded and the parts corresponding to nearer objects reduced”. He states the same principle more simply when he writes: “Those parts of the figures which would normally be further away in 3-D space appear too large in the illusion figures”3. These principles are applied to a series of illusions, including those of Müller-Lyer, Ponzo and Hering. Gregory therefore postulates a common process modifying retinal images in constancy scaling and in the perception of illusory figures."
