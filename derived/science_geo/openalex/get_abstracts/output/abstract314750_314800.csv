https://openalex.org/W2043160932,"Exposure to light reduces the ability of the rat pineal gland to synthesize melatonin and decreases the weight of the gland. When the sympathetic nerves to the pineal gland are cut, light no longer has an effect on melatonin synthesis or pineal weight. The response of the gland does not require that the gonads or the pituitary gland be present."
https://openalex.org/W1990187402,A tungsten microelectrode with several small holes burnt in the vinyl insulation enables the action potentials from several adjacent neurons to be observed simultaneously. A digital computer is used to separate the contributions of each neuron by examining and classifying the waveforms of the action potentials. These methods allow studies to be made of interactions between neurons that lie close together.
https://openalex.org/W1997702261,Xenon tetroxide is a yellow solid at low temperature. It has a vapor pressure of about 25 mm-Hg at 0 degrees C. It is unstable at room temperature. The infrared spectrum of the vapor shows it to have tetrahedral symmetry.

https://openalex.org/W2003064711,"Conglutination of antigen-antibody-complement complexes is inhibited by a number of acetamido sugars, the most efficient being N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and closely related compounds. The effects of structural modification on activity of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine are described."

https://openalex.org/W2077745130,"Anangula preserves remains of a lamellar flake industry probably between 8000 and 12,000 years old because of a unique combination of geologic factors. The most important are the relation of land and sea in this region in the past, when the sea level was lower than at present, and the relatively slight erosion by the sea today."
https://openalex.org/W2061872653,The meteoroid experiments by five Lunar Orbiters have provided direct measurements in the near-lunar environment of the rate of penetration of 0.025-millimeter beryllium copper by meteoroids. Each experiment used 20 pressurized-cell detectors having a total effective exposed area of 0.186 square meter. The spacecraft carrying the cells were in both equatorial and polar orbits; altitudes ranged between 30 and 6200 kilometers. Data collected continuously for 17 months indicate that the rate of penetration in the lunar environment is approximately half the rate in the near-Earth environment as measured by detectors of the same type aboard Explorers 16 and 23.

https://openalex.org/W1993185761,"Resistance of implanted sensors fluctuated predictably with uptakes and loss of water by plants, and correlated positively with coincidental measurements of leaf-water potential when transpiration was minimized. Preliminary results indicate that transmission of change in tension may be almost instantaneous, regardless of transpirational flow rates. Rates of relaxation of tension were very rapid after precipitation, but only after water had percolated to root surfaces."

It was possible to devise a quantitative antifibrinolysin test by controlling the various factors influencing the reaction. In man, the antifibrinolysin response was found to vary according to the strain of streptococcus responsible for the infection."

https://openalex.org/W1972422633,"Two well-established observational techniques for determining the age of the galaxy are discussed. The first is the determination of the ages of clusters of stars having a common origin. Special attention is given to the second technique in which use is made of the systematic nuclear properties of radioactive decay and of nucleosynthesis to determine the time of formation of the heavy elements that eventually condensed and formed the solar system and the duration of the process. A recent evaluation of radioactive decays indicates that synthesis of the heavy elements that were to condense into the solar system began about 13 billion years ago. The rate of increase in the concentrations of metals in observed star clusters, on the other hand, indicates that most of the heavy elements began to be synthesized between 20 and 15 billion years ago. It is speculated that extensive star formation began in the galaxy about 15 billion years ago. (P.C.H.)"
https://openalex.org/W2004586141,Xenic acid is reduced at the dropping-mercury electrode in a single step to xenon. The half-wave potential for the reduction of xenic acid changes from approximately -0.10 to -0.360 volt against a saturated Hg(2)SO(4)-Hg reference electrode in the pH range 4.60 to 8.00. The diffusion current varies linearly with concentration of xenic acid.
