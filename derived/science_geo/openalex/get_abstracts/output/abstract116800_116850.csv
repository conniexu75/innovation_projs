https://openalex.org/W1992661805,Zinc ions are key structural components of a large number of proteins. The binding of zinc stabilizes the folded conformations of domains so that they may facilitate interactions between the proteins and other macromolecules such as DNA. The modular nature of some of these zinc-containing proteins has allowed the rational design of site-specific DNA binding proteins. The ability of zinc to be bound specifically within a range of tetrahedral sites appears to be responsible for the evolution of the side range of zinc-stabilized structural domains now known to exist. The lack of redox activity for the zinc ion and its binding and exchange kinetics also may be important in the use of zinc for specific functional roles.

https://openalex.org/W2061445402,"A 200–300 kb region of chromosome 3p14.2, including the fragile site locus FRA3B, is homozygously deleted in multiple tumor-derived cell lines. Exon amplification from cosmids covering this deleted region allowed identification of the human FHIT gene, a member of the histidine triad gene family, which encodes a protein with 69% similarity to an S. pombe enzyme, diadenosine 5′, 5′′′ P1, P4-tetraphosphate asymmetrical hydrolase. The FHIT locus is composed of ten exons distributed over at least 500 kb, with three 5′ untranslated exons centromeric to the renal carcinoma–associated 3p14.2 breakpoint, the remaining exons telomeric to this translocation breakpoint, and exon 5 within the homozygously deleted fragile region. Aberrant transcripts of the FHIT locus were found in ∼50% of esophageal, stomach, and colon carcinomas."

TR− rats are defective in the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), which mediates hepatobiliary excretion of numerous organic anions. The complementary DNA for rat cmoat, a homolog of the human multidrug resistance gene (hMRP1), was isolated and shown to be expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. In the TR− rat, a single-nucleotide deletion in this gene resulted in a reduced messenger RNA level and absence of the protein. It is likely that this mutation accounts for the TR− phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1965144118,"Crystal structures of heparin-derived tetra- and hexasaccharides complexed with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were determined at resolutions of 1.9 and 2.2 angstroms, respectively. The heparin structure may be approximated as a helical polymer with a disaccharide rotation of 174 degrees and a translation of 8.6 angstroms along the helix axis. Both molecules bound similarly to a region of the bFGF surface containing residues asparagine-28, arginine-121, lysine-126, and glutamine-135, the hexasaccharide also interacted with an additional binding site formed by lysine-27, asparagine-102, and lysine-136. No significant conformational change in bFGF occurred upon heparin oligosaccharide binding, which suggests that heparin primarily serves to juxtapose components of the FGF signal transduction pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2009785870,"Using a polymerization inhibition assay, we have purified a small, heat stable protein that physically interacts with tubulin dimers and increases the catastrophe rate of microtubules. Sequence analysis identified this protein as oncoprotein 18 (Op18)/stathmin, a conserved phosphoprotein that is highly expressed in leukemia cells. Immunodepletion experiments in Xenopus egg extracts showed that Op18/stathmin is involved in physiological regulation of mitotic microtubule dynamics. Op18/stathmin is a microtubule regulator that preferentially interacts with unpolymerized subunits. It is a candidate for increasing the microtubule catastrophe rate in mitosis and might also regulate microtubule dynamics in response to external signals."
https://openalex.org/W2052079189,"Hydrogen bond-mediated self-assembly is a powerful strategy for generating large structures from smaller subunits. The synthesis of molecules containing two isophthalic acid units covalently attached to a rigid aromatic spacer is described. By normal pairing of carboxylic acids into hydrogen-bonded dimers, these molecules self-assemble in organic solvents to form either a series of linear aggregates or a cyclic hexamer. These molecules were linked to the core of a family of polyether dendrimers, which caused the hexamer to be formed preferentially. The stability of the hexamer depended on the generation number of the dendrimer. The largest of these hydrogen-bonded macromolecular assemblies is roughly disk-shaped with a 9-nanometer diameter and a 2-nanometer thickness. Its size and molecular mass (34,000 daltons) are comparable to that of small proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2045042588,"HNF1 is a transcriptional activator of many hepatic genes including albumin, alpha1-antitrypsin, and alpha- and beta-fibrinogen. It is related to the homeobox gene family and is predominantly expressed in liver and kidney. Mice lacking HNF1 fail to thrive and die around weaning after a progressive wasting syndrome with a marked liver enlargement. The transcription rate of genes like albumin and alpha1-antitrypsin is reduced, while the gene coding for phenylalanine hydroxylase is totally silent, giving rise to phenylketonuria. Mutant mice also suffer from severe Fanconi syndrome caused by renal proximal tubular dysfunction. The resulting massive urinary glucose loss leads to energy and water wasting. HNF1-deficient mice may provide a model for human renal Fanconi syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2062242135,"We describe the phenotype of mice lacking both endothelial selectins after sequential ablation of the genes encoding P- and E-selectins. In contrast with the rather mild phenotypes observed in mice deficient in a single selectin gene, the doubly deficient mice present extreme leukocytosis, elevated cytokine levels, and alterations in hematopoiesis. Granulocytopoiesis is increased both in bone marrow and spleen, while erythropoiesis is partially translocated to the spleen. Virtual lack of leukocyte rolling and low extravasation at sites of inflammation make these animals susceptible to opportunistic bacterial infections, to which they succumb. Our results show that the absence of endothelial selectins severely affects leukocyte homeostasis and indicate that these two selectins are as important for normal leukocyte function as are the leukocyte beta2 integrins."

https://openalex.org/W2009401513,"Although the thymus produces many immature thymocytes, few of these cells mature. Positive selection has been thought to limit thymocyte development. In thymuses expressing a single MHC/peptide combination, however, surprisingly large numbers of thymocytes are selected to mature. Many of these react with the selecting MHC, bound to other self-peptides. Therefore, the number of thymocytes that mature is limited by the fact that positively selected cells die because they react too well with MHC bound to self-peptides that are not identical to those involved in positive selection. T cells that mature in thymuses expressing a single MHC/peptide ligand react frequently with foreign MHC, suggesting that the repertoire of αβ receptors may be more biased toward reaction with MHC than was previously thought."

https://openalex.org/W2092941260,"Human CD2 locus control region (LCR) sequences are shown here to be essential for establishing an open chromatin configuration. Transgenic mice carrying an hCD2 minigene attached only to the 3′ CD2 transcriptional enhancer exhibited variegated expression when the transgene integrated in the centromere. In contrast, mice carrying a transgene with additional 3′ sequences showed no variegation even when the latter integrated in centromeric positions. This result suggests that LCRs operate by ensuring an open chromatin configuration and that a short region, with no enhancer activity, functions in the establishment, maintenance, or both of an open chromatin domain."
https://openalex.org/W1999925341,"The E. coli replication fork synthesizes DNA at the rate of nearly 1000 nt/s. We show here that an interaction between the τ subunit of the replicative polymerase (the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme) and the replication fork DNA helicase (DnaB) is required to mediate this high rate of replication fork movement. In the absence of this interaction, the polymerase follows behind the helicase at a rate equal to the slow (∼35 nt/s) unwinding rate of the helicase alone, whereas upon establishing a τ–DnaB contact, DnaB becomes a more effective helicase, increasing its translocation rate by more than 10-fold. This finding establishes the existence of both a physical and communications link between the two major replication machines in the replisome: the DNA polymerase and the primosome."
https://openalex.org/W1976703529,"We have generated mice lacking H2-M complexes, critical facilitators of peptide loading onto major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Ab molecules in these mice matured into stable complexes and were efficiently expressed at the cell surface. Most carried a single peptide derived from the class II-associated invariant chain; the diverse array of peptides normally displayed by class II molecules was absent. Cells from mutant mice presented both whole proteins and short peptides very poorly. Surprisingly, positive selection of CD4+ T cells was quite efficient, yielding a large and broad repertoire. Peripheral T cells reacted strongly to splenocytes from syngeneic wild-type mice, no doubt reflecting the unique peptide complement carried by class II molecules in mutant animals."
https://openalex.org/W1998003616,"DLAR is a receptor-like, transmembrane protein-tyrosine phosphatase in Drosophila that is expressed almost exclusively by developing neurons. Analysis of Dlar loss-of-function mutations shows that DLAR plays a key role during motoneuron growth cone guidance. Segmental nerve b (SNb) motor axons normally exit the common motor pathway, enter the ventral target region, and then synapse on specific ventral muscles. In Dlar mutant embryos, SNb axons bypass their normal target region and instead continue to extend along the common pathway. SNd motor axons also make pathfinding errors, while SNa and SNc axons appear normal. Thus, DLAR controls the ability of certain motor axons to navigate specific choice points in the developing Drosophila nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2092847969,"H2-M is a nonconventional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule that has been implicated in the loading of peptides onto conventional class II molecules. We generated mice with a targeted mutation in the H2-Ma gene, which encodes a subunit for H2-M. Although the mutant mice express normal class II cell surface levels, these are structurally distinct from the compact SDS-resistant complexes expressed by wild-type cells and are predominantly bound by class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIPs). Cells from these animals are unable to present intact protein antigens to class II-restricted T cells and show reduced capacity to present exogenous peptides. Numbers of mature CD4+ T lymphocytes in mutant mice are reduced 3- to 4-fold and exhibit altered reactivities. Overall, this phenotype establishes an important role for H2-M in regulating MHC class II function in vivo and supports the notion that self-peptides contribute to the specificity of T cell positive selection."
https://openalex.org/W2167663806,"CD30 is found on Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's disease and on a variety of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells and is up-regulated on cells after Epstein-Barr virus, human T cell leukemia virus, and HIV infections. We report here that the thymus in CD30-deficient mice contains elevated numbers of thymocytes. Activation-induced death of thymocytes after CD3 cross-linking is impaired both in vitro and in vivo. Breeding the CD30 mutation separately into alpha beta TCR-or gamma delta TCR-transgenic mice revealed a gross defect in negative but not positive selection. Thus, like TNF-receptors and Fas/Apo-1, the CD30 receptor is involved in cell death signaling. It is also an important coreceptor that participates in thymic deletion."
https://openalex.org/W2038894713,"Molecular medicine is increasing our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer and is providing new targets for therapeutic intervention. But at present we do not have appropriate ways to deliver these agents to the tumor, and without this ability their potential will not be realized. Jain proposes a three-part strategy for overcoming this obstacle to successful treatment of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2010292457,"We show that sterility is an aging-specific phenotype in S. cerevisiae and, by genetic and physical means, demonstrate that this phenotype results from a loss of silencing in most old cells by the SIR complex at the HM loci. This loss of silencing is specific because transcription of genes, such as ME14 and DCM1, normally induced by sporulation, is not observed, while transcription of HMRa is observed. These findings pinpoint the molecular cause of an aging-specific phenotype in yeast. Further, they provide direct evidence for a breakdown of silencing in old cells, as predicted from earlier findings that SIR4 is a determinant of life span in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W2059944356,"The receptor tyrosine phosphatases DPTP69D and DPTP99A are expressed on motor axons in Drosophila embryos. In mutant embryos lacking DPTP69D protein, motor neuron growth cones stop growing before reaching their muscle targets, or follow incorrect pathways that bypass these muscles. Mutant embryos lacking DPTP99A are indistinguishable from wild type. Motor axon defects in dptp69D dptp99A double mutant embryos, however, are much more severe than in embryos lacking only DPTP69D. Our results demonstrate that DPTP69D and DPTP99A are required for motor axon guidance and that they have partially redundant functions during development of the neuro-muscular system."

https://openalex.org/W1975142943,"The germline genes used by the mouse to generate the esterolytic antibody 48G7 were cloned and expressed in an effort to increase our understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms by which the immune system evolves catalytic function. The nine replacement mutations that were fixed during affinity maturation increased affinity for the transition state analogue by a factor of 10(4), primarily the result of a decrease in the dissociation rate of the hapten-antibody complex. There was a corresponding increase in the rate of reaction of antibody with substrate, k(cat)/k(m), from 1.7 x 10(2)M(-1) min(-1) to 1.4 x 10(4)M(-1) min(-1). The three-dimensional crystal structure of the 48G7-transition state analogue complex at 2.0 angstroms resolution indicates that one of the nine residues in which somatic mutations have been fixed directly contact the hapten. Thus, in the case of 48G7, affinity maturation appears to play a conformational role, either in reorganizing the active site geometry of limiting side-chain and backbone flexibility of the germline antibody. The crystal structure and analysis of somatic and directed active site mutants underscore the role of transition state stabilization in the evolution of this catalytic antibody."

https://openalex.org/W1550778478,"The alpha subunit of p21(RAS) farnesyltransferase (FNTA), which is also shared by geranylgeranyltransferase, was isolated as a specific cytoplasmic interactor of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and activin type I receptors with the use of the yeast two-hybrid system. FNTA interacts specifically with ligand-free TGF-beta type l receptor but is phosphorylated and released upon ligand binding. Furthermore, the release is dependent on the kinase activity of the TGF-beta type II receptor. Thus, the growth inhibitory and differentiative pathways activated by TGF-beta and activin involve novel mechanisms of serine-threonine receptor phosphorylation-dependent release of cytoplasmic interactors and regulation of the activation of small G proteins, such as p21(RAS)."
https://openalex.org/W2028516759,"Transmembrane signaling by bacterial chemotaxis receptors appears to require a conformational change within a receptor dimer. Dimers were engineered of the cytoplasmic domain of the Escherichia coli aspartate receptor that stimulated the kinase CheA in vitro. The folding free energy of the leucine-zipper dimerization domain was harnessed to twist the dimer interface of the receptor, which markedly affected the extent of CheA activation. Response to this twist was attenuated by modification of receptor regulatory sites, in the same manner as adaptation resets sensitivity to ligand in vivo. These results suggest that the normal allosteric activation of the chemotaxis receptor has been mimicked in a system that lacks both ligand-binding and transmembrane domains. The most stimulatory receptor dimer formed a species of tetrameric size."
https://openalex.org/W1988369815,"The recently discovered comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 01) sports a bright dust coma even though it is still far from the sun (presently 6 astronomical units). This feature has attracted considerable interest in the public and scientific arenas. The comet is headed toward perihelion at 0.92 astronomical unit in April 1997 and is widely expected to then become a spectacular naked-eye comet. With millimeter-wave observations, carbon monoxide (CO) has been identified as the driver for the early activity observed in Hale-Bopp."
