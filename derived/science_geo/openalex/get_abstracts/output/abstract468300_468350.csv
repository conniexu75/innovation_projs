https://openalex.org/W2034462612,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has killed ∼50% of individuals known to be infected, making understanding its mechanisms of transmission and pathogenesis and identifying candidate treatments a high priority. Heinz Feldmann, Vincent J. Munster and Michael G. Katze and their colleagues now report that treating MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques with interferon-α2b and ribavirin reduced virus replication and infection severity, suggesting the potential use of this combination for the clinical treatment of infected humans. The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is of global concern: the virus has caused severe respiratory illness, with 111 confirmed cases and 52 deaths1 at the time of this article's publication. Therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated in vivo; thus, patient management relies exclusively on supportive care, which, given the high case-fatality rate, is not highly effective. The rhesus macaque is the only known model organism for MERS-CoV infection, developing an acute localized to widespread pneumonia with transient clinical disease2,3 that recapitulates mild to moderate human MERS-CoV cases4,5. The combination of interferon-α2b and ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro6; therefore, we initiated this treatment 8 h after inoculation of rhesus macaques. In contrast to untreated, infected macaques, treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no or very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Moreover, treated animals showed lower levels of systemic (serum) and local (lung) proinflammatory markers, in addition to fewer viral genome copies, distinct gene expression and less severe histopathological changes in the lungs. Taken together, these data suggest that treatment of MERS-CoV infected rhesus macaques with IFN-α2b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response and improves clinical outcome. As these two drugs are already used in combination in the clinic for other infections, IFN-α2b and ribavirin should be considered for the management of MERS-CoV cases."
https://openalex.org/W1980913229,"Thorek et al. describe an activatable imaging agent based on a radioactive decay signal through the Cerenkov luminescence effect, which is light produced by β-particle–emitting radionuclides, such as clinically available PET tracers. The approach offers a means of simultaneously investigating multiple disease-relevant biological activities in vivo—the radioluminescent readout providing a quantitative measure of enzymatic activation with reduced background. In the era of personalized medicine, there is an urgent need for in vivo techniques able to sensitively detect and quantify molecular activities. Sensitive imaging of gamma rays is widely used; however, radioactive decay is a physical constant, and its signal is independent of biological interactions. Here, we introduce a framework of previously uncharacterized targeted and activatable probes that are excited by a nuclear decay–derived signal to identify and measure molecular signatures of disease. We accomplished this by using Cerenkov luminescence, the light produced by β-particle–emitting radionuclides such as clinical positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. Disease markers were detected using nanoparticles to produce secondary Cerenkov-induced fluorescence. This approach reduces background signal compared to conventional fluorescence imaging. In addition to tumor identification from a conventional PET scan, we demonstrate the medical utility of our approach by quantitatively determining prognostically relevant enzymatic activity. This technique can be applied to monitor other markers and represents a shift toward activatable nuclear medicine agents."
https://openalex.org/W1988019001,"Atmospheric pressure room temperature plasma jets (APRTP-Js) that can emit a mixture of different active species have recently found entry in various medical applications. Apoptosis is a key event in APRTP-Js-induced cellular toxicity, but the exact biological mechanisms underlying remain elusive. Here, we explored the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in APRTP-Js-induced apoptosis using in vitro model of HepG2 cells. We found that APRTP-Js facilitated the accumulation of ROS and RNS in cells, which resulted in the compromised cellular antioxidant defense system, as evidenced by the inactivation of cellular antioxidants including glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. Nitrotyrosine and protein carbonyl content analysis indicated that APRTP-Js treatment caused nitrative and oxidative injury of cells. Meanwhile, intracellular calcium homeostasis was disturbed along with the alteration in the expressions of GRP78, CHOP and pro-caspase12. These effects accumulated and eventually culminated into the cellular dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress)-mediated apoptosis. The apoptosis could be markedly attenuated by N-acetylcysteine (NAC, a free radical scavenger), which confirmed the involvement of oxidative and nitrative stress in the process leading to HepG2 cell apoptosis by APRTP-Js treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2004085006,"Systemic amyloidosis is a fatal disease caused by misfolding of native globular proteins, which then aggregate extracellularly as insoluble fibrils, damaging the structure and function of affected organs. The formation of amyloid fibrils in vivo is poorly understood. We recently identified the first naturally occurring structural variant, D76N, of human β2-microglobulin (β2m), the ubiquitous light chain of class I major histocompatibility antigens, as the amyloid fibril protein in a family with a new phenotype of late onset fatal hereditary systemic amyloidosis. Here we show that, uniquely, D76N β2m readily forms amyloid fibrils in vitro under physiological extracellular conditions. The globular native fold transition to the fibrillar state is primed by exposure to a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface under physiological intensity shear flow. Wild type β2m is recruited by the variant into amyloid fibrils in vitro but is absent from amyloid deposited in vivo. This may be because, as we show here, such recruitment is inhibited by chaperone activity. Our results suggest general mechanistic principles of in vivo amyloid fibrillogenesis by globular proteins, a previously obscure process. Elucidation of this crucial causative event in clinical amyloidosis should also help to explain the hitherto mysterious timing and location of amyloid deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2171389633,"We report on previously unknown early archaeological sites in the Bolivian lowlands, demonstrating for the first time early and middle Holocene human presence in western Amazonia. Multidisciplinary research in forest islands situated in seasonally-inundated savannahs has revealed stratified shell middens produced by human foragers as early as 10,000 years ago, making them the oldest archaeological sites in the region. The absence of stone resources and partial burial by recent alluvial sediments has meant that these kinds of deposits have, until now, remained unidentified. We conducted core sampling, archaeological excavations and an interdisciplinary study of the stratigraphy and recovered materials from three shell midden mounds. Based on multiple lines of evidence, including radiocarbon dating, sedimentary proxies (elements, steroids and black carbon), micromorphology and faunal analysis, we demonstrate the anthropogenic origin and antiquity of these sites. In a tropical and geomorphologically active landscape often considered challenging both for early human occupation and for the preservation of hunter-gatherer sites, the newly discovered shell middens provide evidence for early to middle Holocene occupation and illustrate the potential for identifying and interpreting early open-air archaeological sites in western Amazonia. The existence of early hunter-gatherer sites in the Bolivian lowlands sheds new light on the region’s past and offers a new context within which the late Holocene “Earthmovers” of the Llanos de Moxos could have emerged."
https://openalex.org/W2051510117,"Faster growing and more virulent strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are increasingly displacing highly resistant MRSA. Elevated fitness in these MRSA is often accompanied by decreased and heterogeneous levels of methicillin resistance; however, the mechanisms for this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. Whole genome sequencing was used to investigate the genetic basis of this apparent correlation, in an isogenic MRSA strain pair that differed in methicillin resistance levels and fitness, with respect to growth rate. Sequencing revealed only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the diadenylate cyclase gene dacA in the faster growing but less resistant strain. Diadenylate cyclases were recently discovered to synthesize the new second messenger cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP). Introduction of this mutation into the highly resistant but slower growing strain reduced resistance and increased its growth rate, suggesting a direct connection between the dacA mutation and the phenotypic differences of these strains. Quantification of cellular c-di-AMP revealed that the dacA mutation decreased c-di-AMP levels resulting in reduced autolysis, increased salt tolerance and a reduction in the basal expression of the cell wall stress stimulon. These results indicate that c-di-AMP affects cell envelope-related signalling in S. aureus. The influence of c-di-AMP on growth rate and methicillin resistance in MRSA indicate that altering c-di-AMP levels could be a mechanism by which MRSA strains can increase their fitness levels by reducing their methicillin resistance levels."
https://openalex.org/W2010271652,"LOXL2 is a copper- and lysine tyrosylquinone-dependent amine oxidase that has been proposed to function both extracellularly and intracellularly to activate oncogenic signaling pathways leading to EMT and invasion of breast cancer cells. In this study, we selected MCF-7 cells that stably express forms of recombinant LOXL2 differing in their subcellular localizations and catalytic competencies. This enabled us to dissect the molecular functions of intracellular and extracellular LOXL2s and examine their contributions to breast cancer metastasis/invasion. We discovered that secreted LOXL2 (~100-kDa) is N-glycosylated at Asn-455 and Asn-644, whereas intracellular LOXL2 (~75-kDa) is nonglycosylated and N-terminally processed, and is primarily associated with the nucleus. Both forms of LOXL2 can oxidize lysine in solution. However, we found that expression of intracellular LOXL2 is more strongly associated with EMT and invasiveness than secreted LOXL2 in vitro. The results indicate that nuclear associated LOXL2 contributes to the stabilization of Snail1 transcription factor at the protein level to induce EMT and promote invasion in vitro, through repression of E-cadherin, occludin, and estrogen receptor-α, and up-regulation of vimentin, fibronectin, and MT1-MMP."
https://openalex.org/W2034377002,"Promising advances in cancer therapy stemming from an increasing understanding of the molecular and genetic underpinnings of the tumorigenic process have been fueled by a strong, determined scientific community, influential patient advocacy groups and committed funding bodies. Despite these efforts, the development of effective drugs to prevent systemic dissemination of cancer cells or to eliminate overt metastasis in secondary organs remains a challenge to both researchers and physicians. In an attempt to tackle the most relevant and timely translational issues, a meeting held in 2012 as a result of a successful partnership between the Volkswagen Foundation and Nature Medicine brought together a group of metastasis research experts to identify the most important hurdles and help create a framework for potential clinical and translational strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2092899908,"The spine is routinely subjected to repetitive complex loading consisting of axial compression, torsion, flexion and extension. Mechanical loading is one of the important causes of spinal diseases, including disc herniation and disc degeneration. It is known that static and dynamic compression can lead to progressive disc degeneration, but little is known about the mechanobiology of the disc subjected to combined dynamic compression and torsion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the mechanobiology of the intervertebral disc when subjected to combined dynamic compression and axial torsion or pure dynamic compression or axial torsion using organ culture. We applied four different loading modalities [1. control: no loading (NL), 2. cyclic compression (CC), 3. cyclic torsion (CT), and 4. combined cyclic compression and torsion (CCT)] on bovine caudal disc explants using our custom made dynamic loading bioreactor for disc organ culture. Loads were applied for 8 h/day and continued for 14 days, all at a physiological magnitude and frequency. Our results provided strong evidence that complex loading induced a stronger degree of disc degeneration compared to one degree of freedom loading. In the CCT group, less than 10% nucleus pulposus (NP) cells survived the 14 days of loading, while cell viabilities were maintained above 70% in the NP of all the other three groups and in the annulus fibrosus (AF) of all the groups. Gene expression analysis revealed a strong up-regulation in matrix genes and matrix remodeling genes in the AF of the CCT group. Cell apoptotic activity and glycosaminoglycan content were also quantified but there were no statistically significant differences found. Cell morphology in the NP of the CCT was changed, as shown by histological evaluation. Our results stress the importance of complex loading on the initiation and progression of disc degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2086943351,"In response to nutrient shortage or organelle damage, cells undergo macroautophagy. Starvation of glucose, an essential nutrient, is thought to promote autophagy in mammalian cells. We thus aimed to determine the role of autophagy in cell death induced by glucose deprivation. Glucose withdrawal induces cell death that can occur by apoptosis (in Bax, Bak-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts or HeLa cells) or by necrosis (in Rh4 rhabdomyosarcoma cells). Inhibition of autophagy by chemical or genetic means by using 3-methyladenine, chloroquine, a dominant negative form of ATG4B or silencing Beclin-1, Atg7, or p62 indicated that macroautophagy does not protect cells undergoing necrosis or apoptosis upon glucose deprivation. Moreover, glucose deprivation did not induce autophagic flux in any of the four cell lines analyzed, even though mTOR was inhibited. Indeed, glucose deprivation inhibited basal autophagic flux. In contrast, the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose induced prosurvival autophagy. Further analyses indicated that in the absence of glucose, autophagic flux induced by other stimuli is inhibited. These data suggest that the role of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation should be reconsidered."

https://openalex.org/W2010088940,"Although early detection of breast cancer improved in recent years, prognosis of patients with late stage breast cancer remains poor, mostly due to development of multidrug resistance (MDR) followed by tumor recurrence. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), with higher drug efflux capability and other stem cell-like properties, are concentrated in a side population (SP) of cells, which were proposed to be responsible for MDR and tumor repopulation that cause patients to succumb to breast cancer. Therefore, targeting of CSCs as an adjuvant to chemotherapy should be able to provide a more effective treatment of this disease. Here, we used IMD-0354, an inhibitor of NF-κB, identified for targeting CSCs, in a combination therapy with doxorubicin encapsulated in targeted nanoparticles. IMD-0354 did target CSCs, evidenced by a decrease in the SP, demonstrated by the inhibition of the following: dye/drug efflux, reduction in ABC transporters as well as in colony formation in soft agar and low attachment plates. Decrease of stem-like gene expression of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, and apoptosis resistance related to the Survivin gene also was observed after treatment with this compound. In addition, IMD-0354 targeted non-CSCs as indicated by reducing viability and increasing apoptosis. Targeted drug delivery, achieved with a legumain inhibitor, proved to enhance drug delivery under hypoxia, a hallmark of the tumor microenvironment, but not under normoxia. Together, this allowed a safe, non-toxic delivery of both anticancer agents to the tumor microenvironment of mice bearing syngeneic metastatic breast cancer. Targeting both bulk tumor cells with a chemotherapeutic agent and CSCs with IMD-0354 should be able to reduce MDR. This could eventually result in decreasing tumor recurrences and/or improve the outcome of metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1975447993,"The circadian clock controls cell proliferation in a number of healthy tissues where cell renewal and regeneration are critical for normal physiological function. The intestine is an organ that typically undergoes regular cycles of cell division, differentiation and apoptosis as part of its role in digestion and nutrient absorption. The aim of this study was to explore circadian clock regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle gene expression in the zebrafish intestine. Here we show that the zebrafish gut contains a directly light-entrainable circadian pacemaker, which regulates the daily timing of mitosis. Furthermore, this intestinal clock controls the expression of key cell cycle regulators, such as cdc2, wee1, p21, PCNA and cdk2, but only weakly influences cyclin B1, cyclin B2 and cyclin E1 expression. Interestingly, food deprivation has little impact on circadian clock function in the gut, but dramatically reduces cell proliferation, as well as cell cycle gene expression in this tissue. Timed feeding under constant dark conditions is able to drive rhythmic expression not only of circadian clock genes, but also of several cell cycle genes, suggesting that food can entrain the clock, as well as the cell cycle in the intestine. Rather surprisingly, we found that timed feeding is critical for high amplitude rhythms in cell cycle gene expression, even when zebrafish are maintained on a light-dark cycle. Together these results suggest that the intestinal clock integrates multiple rhythmic cues, including light and food, to function optimally."

Based on initial data, it was proposed that p87 and p101 are functionally similar, acting as Gβγ adapters anchoring PI3Kγ to the plasma membrane (31.Suire S. Coadwell J. Ferguson G.J. Davidson K.

The adapter function of the class IB non-catalytic subunits fairly resembles the recruitment process involved in the activation of class IA PI3K. However, in contrast to the well characterized inhibitory function of class IA p85, the role of p87 and p101 in the modulation of p110γ activity remains obscure. More stringent examinations of PI3Kγ revealed that p87 and p101 do not function equivalently as Gβγ adapters (34.Kurig B. Shymanets A. Bohnacker T. Prajwal Brock C. Ahmadian M.R. Schaefer M. Gohla A.

Differential roles for the p101 and p84 regulatory subunits of PI3Kγ in tumor growth and metastasis.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 2350-2361Google Scholar). These findings in combination with the fact that only a single catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ is known led us to hypothesize additional non-redundant functions of p87 and p101 apart from the Gβγ adapter function that should contribute to the specificity and selectivity of PI3Kγ signaling. Consistent with these assumptions, we have recently demonstrated that p101 but not p87 was able to rescue the stimulatory activity of Gβ1 mutants incapable of activating p110γ (35.Shymanets A. Ahmadian M.R. Kössmeier K.T. Wetzker R. Harteneck C. Nürnberg B. The p101 subunit of PI3Kγ restores activation by Gβ mutants deficient in stimulating p110γ.Biochem. J. 2012; 441: 851-858Google Scholar). In the present study we show that PI3Kγ functions as an obligate heterodimeric enzyme, p87–p110γ or p101–p110γ. Based on the expression pattern in human tissues, every tissue tested expresses both non-catalytic and catalytic subunits of PI3Kγ, where p87 appears to be widely distributed and represents the dominant non-catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ. Hence, p87–110γ may be defined as a constitutively expressed enzyme, whereas p101–p110γ acquires more selective roles in an inducibly expressed manner. We demonstrate that differences in PI3Kγ activities are determined and defined by the non-catalytic subunits, p87 and p101, in vitro and in living cells. In particular, aside from their impact on the differential regulation by Gβγ and Ras, they exhibit distinct regulatory roles even in the absence of upstream stimulators, arguing for specific regulatory roles for the constitutively expressed p87–110γ and the inducibly expressed p101–p110γ. TissueScanTM human major tissue quantitative PCR arrays (OriGene: catalogue number HMRT102) were used as cDNA templates for RNA expression analysis in various normal (non-cancerous) human tissues. Real-time PCR amplifications were performed using RT2 quantitative PCR primer assays (Qiagen: #PPH15199A, #PPH15703A, #PPH02226A, and #PPH00150F for p87, p101, p110γ, and GAPDH, respectively) and RT2 SYBR Green quantitative PCR mastermix (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The real-time PCR cycling was carried out in a LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics), and the data were analyzed using LightCycler 480 (1.5.0) software. The data were normalized by relative quantification of the target gene to a reference gene, GAPDH, based on crossing point (Cp) values. HEK 293 cells (German Resource Centre for Biological Material) were cultured and transfected as described previously (32.Voigt P. Brock C. Nürnberg B. Schaefer M.

A plasmid encoding β-adrenergic receptor kinase-CFP was a generous gift of Michael Schaefer. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coats obtained from the blood donation center of the university hospital of Tübingen using Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation. After lysis of any remaining red blood cells in ACK buffer (0.155 m NH4Cl, 0.01 m KHCO3, 0.1 mm EDTA), the cells were washed in PBS and adjusted to a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml cell culture medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine) with or without 10% FCS (all cell culture products from PAA).

A specific antibody against p101 was a generous gift from Len Stephens. In the current study two preparations of anti-p87 antibodies were used. The antibody against murine p87 was a generous gift from Michael Schaefer. For generation of an antibody against human p87, rabbits were immunized with peptide conjugates corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of p87 (amino acids ESSDVELDLQRSVQAVLREC). In the actual experiment, affinity-purified antibodies were used for visualization of p87. Anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (#29565) and from Sigma (#F3165), respectively. Total protein lysates of human adult tissues, i.e. brain, lung, rectum, thymus, were purchased from BioChain (Newark). Proteins were fractionated by SDS/PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (HybondTM-C Extra, GE Healthcare). Visualization of specific antisera was performed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare) or the SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Chemiluminescence signals were estimated using the VersaDocTM 4000 MP imaging system (Bio-Rad). Sf9 (Fall Armyworm Ovary; Invitrogen) cells were cultured and infected as described previously (35.Shymanets A. Ahmadian M.R. Kössmeier K.T. Wetzker R. Harteneck C. Nürnberg B.

Non-catalytic His6-fused p85α, p87, and p101 subunits of PI3K were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified using the same purification protocol as for heterodimeric PI3Kγ. Purified proteins were quantified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining after SDS/PAGE (10% acrylamide) with BSA as the standard. The proteins were stored at −80 °C. To analyze the exchange of non-catalytic subunits with heterodimeric PI3Kγ variants, Sf9 cells (100 ml) were infected with baculoviruses encoding tag-free p87 or p101. After 48 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 45 mm imidazole, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/50-ml solution, Roche Diagnostics). Cells were lysed by forcing them through a 22-gauge needle 5 times and subsequently through a 26-gauge needle 7 times in 8 ml of lysis buffer. The cytosolic fraction of Sf9 cells (2 ml) was incubated with purified (His)6p110γ, p87-(His)6p110γ, or p101-(His)6p110γ (10 μg of catalytic p110γ subunit in the assay) for 1 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, 50 μl of Ni2+-SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) was added to the mixture and incubated for a further 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive washing with lysis buffer, the proteins were eluted by adding 150 μl of 1× sample buffer according to Laemmli (50.Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Alternatively, after incubation, the mixture was ultrafiltered using Amicon® Ultra-4 MWCO 100-kDa (Millipore) centrifugal filter devices according to manufacturer's specifications. The proteins in the Amicon filtrate were then analyzed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Purified recombinant p87-(His)6p110γ or p101-(His)6p110γ (1 μg of catalytic p110γ subunit in the assay) were mixed with 2.2 μg of anti-p110γ antibody (Cell Signaling #5405) in precipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.033% polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether (C12E10). The assays were conducted in a final volume of 200 μl. After an incubation period of 3 h at 4 °C, 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare) preincubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.7, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% BSA) were added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were isolated using Micro Bio-SpinTM columns (Bio-Rad) and washed using precipitation buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by adding 1× Laemmli sample buffer (50.Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles were prepared as described previously with some modifications (35.Shymanets A. Ahmadian M.R. Kössmeier K.T. Wetzker R. Harteneck C. Nürnberg B. The p101 subunit of PI3Kγ restores activation by Gβ mutants deficient in stimulating p110γ.Biochem. J. 2012; 441: 851-858Google Scholar). A 30-μl phospholipid mixture containing 320 μm phosphatidylethanolamine, 140 μm phosphatidylcholine, 30 μm sphingomyelin, and 40 μm phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate with or without supplementation with different concentrations of phosphatidylserine (see below) was dried using N2 gas and sonicated in buffer containing 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EGTA, 7 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate. To achieve equal association of each PI3Kγ variant with phospholipid vesicles in the absence of Gβ1γ2, the phospholipid vesicles containing 300 μm phosphatidylserine were incubated with 32 nm PI3Kγ variant for 10 min at 4 °C. To achieve equal association of each PI3Kγ variant in the presence of Gβ1γ2, p101–p110γ (32 nm) was incubated with phospholipid vesicles lacking phosphatidylserine, whereas p110γ or p87–p110γ (32 nm concentrations each variant) were incubated with vesicles containing 180 μm phosphatidylserine in the presence of 100 nm Gβ1γ2 in every experimental setup for 10 min at 4 °C. The lipid kinase activity, autophosphorylation of PI3Kγ, and determination of Gβ1γ2 and PI3Kγ association with phospholipid vesicles were performed as described previously (21.Maier U. Babich A.

https://openalex.org/W2074653868,"microRNAs are a large and essential class of gene regulators that play key roles in development, homeostasis, and disease. They are necessary for normal skeletal development, and their expression is altered in arthritis. However, the specific role of individual microRNAs is only beginning to be unraveled. Using microRNA expression profiling in healthy human articular cartilage cells (chondrocytes), we identified miR-1247 expression as highly correlated with that of the differentiated cell phenotype. Transcribed from the DLK1-DIO3 locus, the function of miR-1247 is completely unknown. In mice its expression level was relatively high in cartilage tissue, and correlated with cartilage-associated microRNA miR-675 across a range of 15 different mouse tissues. To further probe miR-1247 function, overexpression and inhibition studies were performed in isolated human chondrocytes. Modulation of miR-1247 was found to exert profound phenotypic effects altering expression levels of cartilage master regulator transcription factor SOX9. SOX9 is essential for cartilage development and subsequent function throughout life, and mutations in this gene result in severe dwarfism. Putative miR-1247 binding sites were further investigated using luciferase reporter assays, which indicated binding of miR-1247 to a highly conserved region in the coding sequence of SOX9 but not in its 3'-UTR. Interestingly, depletion of SOX9 in human chondrocytes resulted in increased levels of the mature, processed microRNA, suggesting a negative feedback loop between miR-1247 and its target SOX9."
https://openalex.org/W1984699081,"Background The reported coverage rates of first and second doses of measles containing vaccine (MCV) are almost 95% in China, while measles cases are constantly being reported. This study evaluated the vaccine coverage, timeliness, and barriers to immunization of MCV1 and MCV2 in children aged from 8–48 months. Methods We assessed 718 children aged 8–48 months, of which 499 children aged 18–48 months in September 2011. Face to face interviews were administered with children’s mothers to estimate MCV1 and MCV2 coverage rate, its timeliness and barriers to vaccine uptake. Results The coverage rates were 76.9% for MCV1 and 44.7% for MCV2 in average. Only 47.5% of surveyed children received the MCV1 timely, which postpone vaccination by up to one month beyond the stipulated age of 8 months. Even if coverage thus improves with time, postponed vaccination adds to the pool of unprotected children in the population. Being unaware of the necessity for vaccination and its schedule, misunderstanding of side-effect of vaccine, and child being sick during the recommended vaccination period were significant preventive factors for both MCV1 and MCV2 vaccination. Having multiple children, mother’s education level, household income and children with working mothers were significantly associated with delayed or missing MCV1 immunization. Conclusions To avoid future outbreaks, it is crucial to attain high coverage levels by timely vaccination, thus, accurate information should be delivered and a systematic approach should be targeted to high-risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2036427629,"ThiC (4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate synthase; EC 4.1.99.17) is a radical S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) enzyme that uses a [4Fe-4S](+) cluster to reductively cleave AdoMet to methionine and a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical that initiates catalysis. In plants and bacteria, ThiC converts the purine intermediate 5-aminoimidazole ribotide to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate, an intermediate of thiamine pyrophosphate (coenzyme B1) biosynthesis. In this study, assay conditions were implemented that consistently generated 5-fold molar excess of HMP, demonstrating that ThiC undergoes multiple turnovers. ThiC activity was improved by in situ removal of product 5'-deoxyadenosine. The activity was inhibited by AdoMet metabolites S-adenosylhomocysteine, adenosine, 5'-deoxyadenosine, S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine, methionine, and homocysteine. Neither adenosine nor S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine had been shown to inhibit radical AdoMet enzymes, suggesting that ThiC is distinct from other family members. The parameters for improved ThiC activity and turnover described here will facilitate kinetic and mechanistic analyses of ThiC."
https://openalex.org/W2126130578,"Neonatal sepsis in the developing world is incompletely characterized. We seek to characterize the microbial spectrum involved in sepsis and determine the role of maternal transmission by comparing organisms that can be cultured from septic newborn infants and their mothers. From 80 consecutive mother-infant pairs meeting clinical criteria for neonatal sepsis, we collected infant blood and spinal fluid, and maternal blood and vaginal specimens. Identifiable bacteria were recovered from the blood in 32.5% of infants, and from 2.5% of cerebrospinal fluid cultures, for a total of 35% recoverable putative causative agents. Bacteria recovered from vaginal specimens were not concordant with those recovered from infants. Similarly there was no concordance of bacteria recovered from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. We conclude that relying on traditional bacterial culture techniques does not adequately delineate the role of maternal versus environmental sources of neonatal sepsis in this setting. More sensitive molecular approaches will be needed to properly characterize the maternal and environmental microbial community involved in neonatal sepsis in such developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2158504054,"WNT signaling plays a key role in the self-renewal of tumor initiation cells (TICs). In this study, we used pyrvinium pamoate (PP), an FDA-approved antihelmintic drug that inhibits WNT signaling, to test whether pharmacologic inhibition of WNT signaling can specifically target TICs of aggressive breast cancer cells. SUM-149, an inflammatory breast cancer cell line, and SUM-159, a metaplastic basal-type breast cancer cell line, were used in these studies. We found that PP inhibited primary and secondary mammosphere formation of cancer cells at nanomolar concentrations, at least 10 times less than the dose needed to have a toxic effect on cancer cells. A comparable mammosphere formation IC50 dose to that observed in cancer cell lines was obtained using malignant pleural effusion samples from patients with IBC. A decrease in activity of the TIC surrogate aldehyde dehydrogenase was observed in PP-treated cells, and inhibition of WNT signaling by PP was associated with down-regulation of a panel of markers associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In vivo, intratumoral injection was associated with tumor necrosis, and intraperitoneal injection into mice with tumor xenografts caused significant tumor growth delay and a trend toward decreased lung metastasis. In in vitro mammosphere-based and monolayer-based clonogenic assays, we found that PP radiosensitized cells in monolayer culture but not mammosphere culture. These findings suggest WNT signaling inhibition may be a feasible strategy for targeting aggressive breast cancer. Investigation and modification of the bioavailability and toxicity profile of systemic PP are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1980809434,"Oxylipins are low-molecular weight secondary metabolites derived from the incorporation of oxygen into the carbon chains of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Oxylipins are produced in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages where they are involved in a broad spectrum of actions spanning from stress and defense responses, regulation of growth and development, signaling, and innate immunity. We explored the diversity in oxylipin patterns in the marine planktonic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia. This genus includes several species only distinguishable with the aid of molecular markers. Oxylipin profiles of cultured strains were obtained by reverse phase column on a liquid chromatograph equipped with UV photodiode detector and q-ToF mass spectrometer. Lipoxygenase compounds were mapped on phylogenies of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia inferred from the nuclear encoded hyper-variable region of the LSU rDNA and the plastid encoded rbcL. Results showed that the genus Pseudo-nitzschia exhibits a rich and varied lipoxygenase metabolism of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), with a high level of specificity for oxylipin markers that generally corroborated the genotypic delineation, even among genetically closely related cryptic species. These results suggest that oxylipin profiles constitute additional identification tools for Pseudo-nitzschia species providing a functional support to species delineation obtained with molecular markers and morphological traits. The exploration of the diversity, patterns and plasticity of oxylipin production across diatom species and genera will also provide insights on the ecological functions of these secondary metabolites and on the selective pressures driving their diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2124624215,"Within tailed bacteriophages, interaction of the receptor-binding protein (RBP) with the target cell triggers viral DNA ejection into the host cytoplasm. In the case of phage T5, the RBP pb5 and the receptor FhuA, an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli, have been identified. Here, we use small angle neutron scattering and electron microscopy to investigate the FhuA-pb5 complex. Specific deuteration of one of the partners allows the complete masking in small angle neutron scattering of the surfactant and unlabeled proteins when the complex is solubilized in the fluorinated surfactant F6-DigluM. Thus, individual structures within a membrane protein complex can be described. The solution structure of FhuA agrees with its crystal structure; that of pb5 shows an elongated shape. Neither displays significant conformational changes upon interaction. The mechanism of signal transduction within phage T5 thus appears different from that of phages binding cell wall saccharides, for which structural information is available."

In addition to the α/β-hydrolase core, they showed unexpected structural similarities even in the cap region.

Conclusion: Hallmark features responsible for substrate binding and selectivity are conserved across species. Significance: The first structures of a monoacylglycerol lipase in complex with substrate analogs are presented. Understanding the molecular basis of enzyme substrate interactions is an important prerequisite for elucidating substrate structure-activity relationships. Structures of protein·ligand complexes are critical in delineating ligand interactions with the binding site, uncovering active site residues, and providing insight into the catalytic mechanism (1.Thornton J.M. Todd A.E. Milburn D. Borkakoti N. Orengo C.A. From structure to function: approaches and limitations.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 991-994Google Scholar). In addition, they also provide valuable information on the “druggability” of the binding site, laying the basis for structure-based drug design (1.Thornton J.M. Todd A.E. Milburn D. Borkakoti N. Orengo C.A. From structure to function: approaches and limitations.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 991-994Google Scholar, 2.Whittle P.J. Blundell T.L. Protein structure-based drug design.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 349-375Google Scholar). Lipases catalyze the hydrolysis of ester bonds in long chain acylglycerols releasing fatty acids and glycerol. Most lipases possess a lid or cap domain that covers the active site and is able to undergo conformational changes to carry out catalysis at the lipid-water interface (3.Brzozowski A.M. Derewenda U. Derewenda Z.S. Dodson G.G. Lawson D.M. Turkenburg J.P. Bjorkling F. Huge-Jensen B. Patkar S.A. Thim L.

The nature of these conformational changes is diverse across the lipase family and is poorly understood at an atomic level. In this study, we provide in-depth experimental insight into conformational changes and substrate binding observed in monoacylglyerol lipases (MGLs). 4The abbreviations used are: MGLmonoacylglycerol lipase1-LG1-(rac)-lauroylglycerolPDBProtein Data BankbMGLbacterial MGLhMGLhuman MGL1-OG1-oleoyl-rac-glycerolMGmonoacylglycerol. MGLs are a unique class of lipases (EC 3.1.1.23) because they specifically cleave monoacylglycerols (MGs) in contrast to other lipases, e.g. hormone-sensitive lipase, which accepts a broad range of substrates (triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, cholesterol esters, and MGs), and other fungal lipases (5.Liu L.

The physiological function of MGL is best understood in mammals, where it has an essential role in lipid metabolism for maintaining energy homeostasis (14.Taschler U. Radner F.P. Heier C.

Monoglyceride lipase deficiency in mice impairs lipolysis and attenuates diet-induced insulin resistance.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17467-17477Google Scholar). Additionally, MGL plays an important part in mediating endocannabinoid-based signaling rendering it an important pharmacological target (15.Dinh T.P. Kathuria S. Piomelli D.

Crystallographic studies of MGLs have resulted in the determination of three-dimensional structures of human MGL (hMGL) and its ortholog from a moderately thermophilic soil bacterium Bacillus sp. H-257 (bMGL) in free form and in complex with inhibitors (21.Labar G. Bauvois C. Borel F. Ferrer J.L. Wouters J. Lambert D.M.

H257 reveals unexpected conservation of the cap architecture between bacterial and human enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1012-1021Google Scholar). Both MGLs possess the expected α/β-hydrolase core domain harboring a catalytic triad. Additionally, the structures revealed an unexpected conservation of the overall cap architecture between hMGL and bMGL (24.Rengachari S. Bezerra G.A. Riegler-Berket L. Gruber C.C. Sturm C. Taschler U. Boeszoermenyi A. Dreveny I. Zimmermann R. Gruber K. Oberer M. The structure of monoacylglycerol lipase from Bacillus sp. H257 reveals unexpected conservation of the cap architecture between bacterial and human enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1012-1021Google Scholar). Thus, bMGL can be used as an excellent model system to study the mode of action of MGLs and relate these insights to eukaryotic MGLs. Interestingly, the cap domain of hMGL was reported to adopt open and closed conformations, whereas only an open conformation was observed for bMGL. Very little is known about the effect of these conformational changes on enzyme activity (23.Schalk-Hihi C. Schubert C. Alexander R. Bayoumy S. Clemente J.C. Deckman I. DesJarlais R.L.

Similarly, the structural basis for the different substrate turnover rates shown by bMGL is also poorly understood. Reportedly, bMGL possesses higher turnover rates for MGs with shorter chain length, i.e. C10:0 and C12:0, compared with longer chain MGs, i.e. C18:0 and C18:1 (25.Imamura S. Kitaura S.

Monoacylglycerol lipase from moderately thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain H-257: molecular cloning, sequencing, and expression in Escherichia coli of the gene.J.

In this work, we describe five crystal structures of bMGL in its free form and in complex with substrate analogs and the natural substrate 1-lauroylglycerol (1-LG). We discuss their structure-function relationship, enzymatic assays, and mutations of the bacterial MGL from Bacillus sp. H-257. The bMGL·ligand complexes reported here represent the first experimental structures of substrate or its analogs bound to an MGL. These complex structures provide experimental evidence for conformational plasticity in the cap region of bMGL. Additionally, these structures also elucidate the molecular basis of substrate binding and help to rationalize differences in substrate turnover rates. Site-directed mutagenesis (I145G, I145S, and D196N) was employed to introduce single point mutations in the bMGL gene. Primers (Invitrogen) used were as follows: I145G, forward, GCCGAGGTATCTGGATTCGGGCGGTTCGGACTTG, and reverse, CAAGTCCGAACCGCCCGAATCCAGATACCTCGGC; I145S, forward, GCCGAGGTATCTGGATTCGAGCGGTTCGGACTTG, and reverse, CAAGTCCGAACCGCTCGAATCCAGATACCTCGGC; and D196N, forward, TTTTGTCTCCGACGAAAATCACGTCGTGCCGC, and reverse, GCGGCACGACGTGATTTTCGTCGGAGACAAAA. PCRs were performed using standard protocols. After DpnI digestion, PCR products were transformed into TOP10 chemically competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing, and variant enzymes were expressed and purified as described previously (24.Rengachari S. Bezerra G.A. Riegler-Berket L. Gruber C.C. Sturm C. Taschler U. Boeszoermenyi A. Dreveny I. Zimmermann R. Gruber K. Oberer M. The structure of monoacylglycerol lipase from Bacillus sp. H257 reveals unexpected conservation of the cap architecture between bacterial and human enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1012-1021Google Scholar). The synthesis of the ligands with different alkyl chain lengths was carried out under an inert atmosphere. Two equivalents of sodium azide (1.15 g, 17.8 mmol) were added to a solution of diethyl-(3-bromopropyl)-phosphonate (2.30 g, 8.88 mmol) in 20 ml of THF/H2O (1:1), and the reaction mixture was heated for 5 h at 80 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the pH was adjusted to 10 by addition of solid NaOH. Extraction with Et2O (three times, 20 ml), drying over MgSO4, and concentrating in vacuo furnished diethyl-(3-azidopropyl)-phosphonate in quantitative yield. 500 mg (2.26 mmol) of the resulting crude product were dissolved in 2.1 ml of CH2Cl2 in a Schlenk tube. Trimethylsilyl bromide (0.92 ml, 7.0 mmol) was added, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. After concentration in vacuo (using a liquid nitrogen trap), crude bis(trimethylsilyl)-(3-azidopropyl)-phosphonate was produced. The yellow oil was again dissolved in 3 ml of CH2Cl2 in the same Schlenk tube. Oxalylchloride (4 eq) and a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide were added dropwise, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 75 min. After removal of all volatiles in vacuo (using a liquid nitrogen trap) crude dichloro-(3-azidopropyl)-phosphonate remained in the Schlenk tube. In an extra Schlenk tube, a solution of 2.26 mmol of alcohol (of different chain lengths), 0.46 ml of N,N-diisopropylethylamine, 0.41 ml of tetrazole, and 0.34 ml of diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in 2.1 ml of THF was prepared and then added in 0.5-ml portions to the other Schlenk tube containing the substrate. After overnight stirring, the resulting suspension, a solution of 4-nitrophenol (470.8 mg, 3.38 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.92 ml) in 2.1 ml of THF (which had been stirred overnight as well), was added. After stirring for 2 h at room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The crude product was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (30 ml) and washed with H2O (two times, 15 ml). After back-extraction with CH2Cl2 (20 ml), the combined organic phases were washed with brine (25 ml), dried over MgSO4, concentrated, and dried in an oil pump vacuum yielding the desired alkyl-4-nitrophenyl (3-azidopropyl)phosphonate product (e.g. dodecyl 4-nitrophenyl (3-azidopropyl)phosphonate). The dried crude product was purified by preparative HPLC. It should be noted that a substrate analog with a 12-carbon alkyl chain actually corresponds to monomyristoylglycerol (C14:0) rather than monolauroylglycerol (C12:0) (Fig. 1). For the bMGL·C12 ligand complex, a 0.9 mm solution of bMGL was mixed with 50 mg/ml of the C12 ligand dissolved in DMSO (Merck) to achieve a final concentration of 4.5 mm of the ligand. Crystallization trials were performed using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method with equal volumes of the bMGL·C12 complex and the Morpheus screen D4 (Molecular Dimensions, Suffolk, UK) reservoir solution containing 0.1 m MES/imidazole, pH 6.5, 12.5% w/v PEG 1000, 12.5% w/v PEG 3350, 12.5% v/v 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 0.02 m alcohols (0.2 m 1,6-hexanediol, 0.2 m 1-butanol, 0.2 m (RS)-1,2-propanediol, 0.2 m 2-propanol, 0.2 m 1,4-butanediol, 0.2 m 1,3-propanediol). Well diffracting crystals (1.7 Å) were obtained from the drop without further optimization within 2 weeks, and no additional cryoprotectant was used for flash cooling the crystals in liquid nitrogen. For the bMGL·C14 ligand complex, a 0.9 mm solution of bMGL was mixed with 50 mg/ml C14 ligand, dissolved in 99% EtOH (Sigma) to achieve a final ligand concentration of 4.5 mm, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Well diffracting crystals (1.8 Å) were obtained after 2 weeks using the hanging drop method in a crystallization condition containing 0.1 m citric acid, pH 5.2, and 18% PEG 3350. For the bMGL·C16 ligand complex, a 0.9 mm solution of bMGL was mixed with 50 mg/ml C16 ligand, dissolved in 99% EtOH (Sigma) to achieve a final ligand concentration of 4.5 mm, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Crystals diffracting to 2.2 Å were obtained in ∼10 days from the drop containing 0.1 m citric acid, pH 5.0, and 22% PEG 3350 using the hanging drop method. An ∼0.9 mm solution of bMGL(D196N) was mixed with 180 mm 1-LG (Sigma) dissolved in 99% EtOH to achieve a final protein/ligand ratio of 1:5. The protein/ligand mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Initial crystals were obtained using the Morpheus screen, condition 4, containing 0.03 m magnesium chloride, 0.03 m calcium chloride, 0.1 m MES/imidazole, pH 6.5, 12.5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 12.5% PEG 1000, and 12.5% PEG 3350. These crystals were used for preparing a seed stock. The optimized crystals were obtained in a drop containing 0.9 mm bMGL(D196N), 56% v/v MPD, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6.9, and 1:1000 dilution of seed stock in a ratio of 2:2:1 respectively. To increase the probability of 1-LG being bound in the structure, we also added 1-LG as powder to these crystallization drops and soaked the crystals for 8 h. Approximately 0.9 mm bMGL(D196N) was also crystallized in the presence of 140 mm 1-(rac)-oleoylglycerol (1-OG). Crystals diffracting to 1.7 Å were obtained from the drop containing 54% v/v MPD, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 6.9, and 1:1000 dilution of seeding stock in a ratio of 2:2:1, respectively. Datasets were recorded at beamlines indicated in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, TABLE 3. All structures were solved using molecular replacement with the structure of bMGL in its free form (PDB code 3RM3) as search template (24.Rengachari S. Bezerra G.A. Riegler-Berket L. Gruber C.C.

H257 reveals unexpected conservation of the cap architecture between bacterial and human enzymes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1821: 1012-1021Google Scholar). Models of the ligands were created with the program MAESTRO (Maestro, version 9.3, Schrödinger, LLC, New York) and were used as input for PHENIX.elbow for creating Crystallographic Information File (CIF) library files containing bond length and angle restraints (27.Moriarty N.W.

The models were then subjected to rigid body and restrained refinement cycles using the program REFMAC5, followed by several iterative rounds of refinement using PHENIX (28.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

https://openalex.org/W2014984324,"Emerin, a membrane component of nuclear ""lamina"" networks with lamins and barrier to autointegration factor (BAF), is highly O-GlcNAc-modified (""O-GlcNAcylated"") in mammalian cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed eight sites of O-GlcNAcylation, including Ser-53, Ser-54, Ser-87, Ser-171, and Ser-173. Emerin O-GlcNAcylation was reduced ~50% by S53A or S54A mutation in vitro and in vivo. O-GlcNAcylation was reduced ~66% by the triple S52A/S53A/S54A mutant, and S173A reduced O-GlcNAcylation of the S52A/S53A/S54A mutant by ~30%, in vivo. We separated two populations of emerin, A-type lamins and BAF; one population solubilized easily, and the other required sonication and included histones and B-type lamins. Emerin and BAF associated only in histone- and lamin-B-containing fractions. The S173D mutation specifically and selectively reduced GFP-emerin association with BAF by 58% and also increased GFP-emerin hyper-phosphorylation. We conclude that β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, an essential enzyme, controls two regions in emerin. The first region, defined by residues Ser-53 and Ser-54, flanks the LEM domain. O-GlcNAc modification at Ser-173, in the second region, is proposed to promote emerin association with BAF in the chromatin/lamin B ""niche."" These results reveal direct control of a conserved LEM domain nuclear lamina component by β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, a nutrient sensor that regulates cell stress responses, mitosis, and epigenetics."
https://openalex.org/W2108704161,"ErbB3 is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. It is unique because it is the only member of the family whose kinase domain is defective. As a result, it is obliged to form heterodimers with other ErbB receptors to signal. In this study, we characterized the interaction of ErbB3 with the EGF receptor and ErbB2 and assessed the effects of Food and Drug Administration-approved therapeutic agents on these interactions. Our findings support the concept that ErbB3 exists in preformed clusters that can be dissociated by NRG-1β and that it interacts with other ErbB receptors in a distinctly hierarchical fashion. Our study also shows that all pairings of the EGF receptor, ErbB2, and ErbB3 form ligand-independent dimers/oligomers. The small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and lapatinib differentially enhance the dimerization of the various ErbB receptor pairings, with the EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimer being particularly sensitive to the effects of erlotinib. The data suggest that the physiological effects of these drugs may involve not only inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity but also a dynamic restructuring of the entire network of receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2149618982,"Cell survival in complex, vascularized tissues, has been implicated as a major bottleneck in advancement of therapies based on cardiac tissue engineering. This limitation motivates the search for small, inexpensive molecules that would simultaneously be cardio-protective and vasculogenic. Here, we present peptide sequence QHREDGS, based upon the fibrinogen-like domain of angiopoietin-1, as a prime candidate molecule. We demonstrated previously that QHREDGS improved cardiomyocyte metabolism and mitigated serum starved apoptosis. In this paper we further demonstrate the potency of QHREDGS in its ability to enhance endothelial cell survival, metabolism and tube formation. When endothelial cells were exposed to the soluble form of QHREDGS, improvements in endothelial cell barrier functionality, nitric oxide production and cell metabolism (ATP levels) in serum starved conditions were found. The functionality of the peptide was then examined when conjugated to collagen-chitosan hydrogel, a potential carrier for in vivo application. The presence of the peptide in the hydrogel mitigated paclitaxel induced apoptosis of endothelial cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, the peptide modified hydrogels stimulated tube-like structure formation of encapsulated endothelial cells. When integrin αvβ3 or α5β1 were antibody blocked during cell encapsulation in peptide modified hydrogels, tube formation was abolished. Therefore, the dual protective nature of the novel peptide QHREDGS may position this peptide as an appealing augmentation for collagen-chitosan hydrogels that could be used for biomaterial delivered cell therapies in the settings of myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W1982769227,"When platelets are strongly stimulated, a procoagulant platelet subpopulation is formed that is characterized by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure and epitope modulation of integrin αIIbβ3 or a loss of binding of activation-dependent antibodies. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) formation, which is essential for the formation of procoagulant platelets, is impaired in the absence of cyclophilin D (CypD). Here we investigate the mechanisms responsible for these procoagulant platelet-associated changes in integrin αIIbβ3 and the physiologic role of procoagulant platelet formation in the regulation of platelet aggregation. Among strongly stimulated adherent platelets, integrin αIIbβ3 epitope changes, mPTP formation, PS exposure, and platelet rounding were closely associated. Furthermore, platelet mPTP formation resulted in a decreased ability to recruit additional platelets. In the absence of CypD, integrin αIIbβ3 function was accentuated in both static and flow conditions, and, in vivo, a prothrombotic phenotype occurred in mice with a platelet-specific deficiency of CypD. CypD-dependent proteolytic events, including cleavage of the integrin β3 cytoplasmic domain, coincided closely with integrin αIIbβ3 inactivation. Calpain inhibition blocked integrin β3 cleavage and inactivation but not mPTP formation or PS exposure, indicating that integrin inactivation and PS exposure are mediated by distinct pathways subsequent to mPTP formation. mPTP-dependent alkalinization occurred in procoagulant platelets, suggesting a possible alternative mechanism for enhancement of calpain activity in procoagulant platelets. Together, these results indicate that, in strongly stimulated platelets, mPTP formation initiates the calpain-dependent cleavage of integrin β3 and associated regulatory proteins, resulting in integrin αIIbβ3 inactivation, and demonstrate a novel CypD-dependent negative feedback mechanism that limits platelet aggregation and thrombotic occlusion."

https://openalex.org/W2004554673,"Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings, pioneers of cancer chemotherapy, taught that the search for selectivity in drug discovery often involved ‘enlightened empiricism’ together with a healthy dose of serendipity1. Two recently published clinical trials that report the remarkable antitumor effects of combination therapy using antibodies targeting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4)2,3, two negative immune regulatory molecules expressed on T cells, illustrate how these principles of drug development apply to cancer immunotherapy.

The passive transfer of tumor-reactive T cells via bone marrow transplantation and the use of tumor-selective antibodies are well-established cancer therapies, but the crafting of effective strategies to stimulate endogenous antitumor immunity has long proved elusive4. As many attempts at amplifying positive immune signaling networks failed to elicit clinically significant tumor destruction, an alternative approach aims to do the opposite—interfering with immune checkpoints that attenuate the function of activated T cells in the tumor microenvironment5. Inspired by promising findings in experimental tumor models, two large randomized studies showing that a fully human antibody to CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) prolonged survival in patients with advanced melanoma, with about 20% of treated subjects achieving durable clinical benefits (which in some cases exceeded ten years), finally took place. However, the treatment also caused a diversity of inflammatory pathologies, most commonly affecting the intestinal tract, skin and endocrine tissues, consistent with the phenotype of mice lacking CTLA-4. Serious toxicity was observed in about 20% of treated subjects, but this could be dissociated from the antitumor effects, indicating that tumor immunity and inflammatory pathology are closely related but, nonetheless, separable.

Motivated in large measure by the success of ipilimumab in patients, clinical exploration of blocking antibodies to PD-1 also began. Although many studies had delineated a key role for PD-1 in limiting T cell responses in diverse settings, including experimental tumors6, they did not anticipate the robust antitumor activities of anti–PD-1 antibodies in patients with cancer. The recent work with lambrolizumab2 and an earlier trial using nivolumab7 have convincingly established the ability of anti–PD-1 antibodies to trigger clinically significant tumor destruction in a high proportion of patients with advanced melanoma. The impressive durable regressions revealed in these two investigations exceed expectations gleaned from preclinical systems, highlighting some of the challenges in using murine models as a guide to designing new therapeutics for humans8 and illustrating the continuing role of serendipity in drug development.

About 38% of 135 individuals with metastatic melanoma treated at any dose-level of lambrolizumab and 52% at an apparently optimal level displayed a tumor response; remarkably, 77% of all patients showed some reduction in tumor burden2. Even though small-molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK, key oncogenic drivers in melanoma, may also accomplish tumor regressions in genetically defined subsets, these typically are of short duration because of the rapid emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells9. In contrast, most responses to PD-1 blockade were sustained, although longer follow-up is required to clarify the durability of tumor control more precisely.

Anti–PD-1 antibodies may have a more favorable safety profile compared to ipilimumab, although severe pneumonitis developed in a small number of patients7. The reduction in toxicity is in accordance with the milder inflammatory pathology in PD-1– compared to CTLA-4-deficient mice, which probably reflects the more restricted role of PD-1 in constraining ongoing immune responses in contrast to the requirement for CTLA-4 in immune homeostasis6. Encouraging anti-tumor effects and safety profiles have also been described with blocking antibodies to PD ligand-1 (PD-L1)10, underscoring the therapeutic potential of interfering with this pathway in different ways. Moreover, anti–PD-1 and anti–PD-L1 antibodies seem to be broadly active against cancer, provoking tumor regressions in patients with advanced non–small-cell lung carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and other tumor types11.

Given the clinical efficacy of infusing anti–CTLA-4 or anti–PD-1 antibodies as monotherapy and the related but distinct functions of the molecules in the immune system6, combinations of the two agents might prove to be more potent than either alone. Anti–PD-1 antibodies elicited similar response rates in patients who were previously treated with ipilimumab (and presumably derived minimal or no clinical benefit) and in those who were not2. This suggests PD-1–mediated immune inhibition may act, at least in some cases, to restrict the impact of CTLA-4 inhibition, which can increase amounts of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment (owing to an unleashed interferon-γ production by T cells) that can then engage PD-1 on activated T cells to dampen proliferation and cytotoxicity.

To explore this idea further, Wolchok et al.3 administered nivolumab and ipilimumab concurrently to 53 patients with metastatic melanoma. Antitumor effects were evident in 65% of subjects, including objective responses in 40%. In contrast to sequential treatment, the concurrent infusion of anti–CTLA-4 and anti–PD-1 antibodies led to a high rate of serious inflammatory toxicity (53% of patients), which often required immunosuppressive therapy for management. These results imply that CTLA-4 and PD-1 have nonredundant roles in the maintenance of immune tolerance in humans, an insight that should inform our understanding of the pathogenesis of some autoimmune disorders12. Randomized clinical trials to delineate more thoroughly the potential advantages and risks of concurrent or sequential combination therapy versus individual blockade of CTLA-4 or PD-1 are underway (Fig. 1).

The need to balance the antitumor activity and toxicity of single and combinatorial immunotherapies. Blocking the immune inhibitory molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1, alone or in combination, results in variable levels of antitumor activity and toxicity. Further ...



The elevated incidence of toxicity with simultaneous CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibition emphasizes the need to craft complementary strategies that afford a more favorable therapeutic index for antibody treatment. This might be accomplished through preferential targeting of antitumor T cells rather than homeostatic immune networks that preserve tissue integrity. Because CTLA-4 and PD-1 are both expressed upon T cell activation, combinatorial schemes should be directed toward enhancing the numbers of stimulated tumor-reactive T cells, which may allow less intense levels of immune checkpoint blockade to amplify tumor-specific immunity more selectively. Cancer vaccines that deliver tumor antigens in an optimal spatial and temporal fashion while promoting maturation of dendritic cells, which amplify antitumor T cell activation, constitute one promising approach to expand the effector T cell pool. Treatment strategies that may evoke immunogenic tumor cell death in situ, such as oncolytic viruses, focal radiation, tumor-directed antibodies (and drug conjugates) and some small-molecule inhibitors or cytotoxic agents, are also attractive options9. Antibodies targeting other immunoregulatory molecules expressed on T cells or natural killer cells, an innate cell population with potent antitumor cytotoxicity potential13, are additional compelling possibilities.

An alternative scheme to improve therapeutic index might aim to restore homeostatic networks that are compromised with immune checkpoint blockade. A recent clinical trial in patients with advanced melanoma suggests that systemic administration of the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF) may reduce the incidence of severe colitis and pneumonitis caused by anti–CTLA-4 antibodies yet increase overall survival14. Although the precise basis for these intriguing findings remains to be clarified, the roles of GM-CSF in both supporting regulatory T cells that attenuate inflammation in the intestinal and pulmonary mucosa and augmenting antitumor immunity might be involved15.

The clinical success of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade alone and together may come as a surprise to the greater cancer research and cancer medicine communities. Earlier uncertainty regarding a role for immunity in tumor pathogenesis reinforced the investigation of tumor cell–autonomous alterations and encouraged the evaluation of therapeutics using human tumor cell xenografts propagated in immune-deficient mice. Nonetheless, the demonstration that two molecules expressed on T cells may be the difference between survival and death in a significant proportion of patients with advanced cancer should prompt a reexamination of these research strategies and focus attention toward illuminating the ways in which specific steps of transformation are directly coupled to immune escape16. A deeper understanding of the links between oncogenesis and host evasion should accelerate the crafting of new combinatorial treatments that intensify tumor immunity but temper inflammatory pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1982194445,"Copper, an essential trace element acquired through nutrition, is an important co-factor for pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Decreasing bioavailable copper has been used as an anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer strategy with promising results. However, the role of copper and its potential as a therapy in mesothelioma is not yet well understood. Therefore, we monitored copper levels in progressing murine mesothelioma tumors and analyzed the effects of lowering bioavailable copper. Copper levels in tumors and organs were assayed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Mesothelioma tumors rapidly sequestered copper at early stages of development, the copper was then dispersed throughout growing tumor tissues. These data imply that copper uptake may play an important role in early tumor development. Lowering bioavailable copper using the copper chelators, penicillamine, trientine or tetrathiomolybdate, slowed in vivo mesothelioma growth but did not provide any cures similar to using cisplatin chemotherapy or anti-VEGF receptor antibody therapy. The impact of copper lowering on tumor blood vessels and tumor infiltrating T cells was measured using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Copper lowering was associated with reduced tumor vessel diameter, reduced endothelial cell proliferation (reduced Ki67 expression) and lower surface ICAM/CD54 expression implying reduced endothelial cell activation, in a process similar to endothelial normalization. Copper lowering was also associated with a CD4+ T cell infiltrate. In conclusion, these data suggest copper lowering is a potentially useful anti-mesothelioma treatment strategy that slows tumor growth to provide a window of opportunity for inclusion of other treatment modalities to improve patient outcomes."

In experimental mice skin colonization model, LZ1 significantly reduced the number of P. acnes colonized on the ear, P. acnes-induced ear swelling, and inflammatory cell infiltration. It ameliorated inflammation induced by P. acnes by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-1β. LZ1 showed little cytotoxicity on human keratinocyte and hemolytic activity on human blood red cells. Furthermore, LZ1 was very stable in human plasma. Combined with its potential bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties, simple structure and high stability, LZ1 might be an ideal candidate for the treatment of acne."
https://openalex.org/W2099723633,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of I-124 PET images with and without prompt gamma compensation (PGC) by comparing the recovery coefficients (RC), the signal to noise ratios (SNR) and the contrast to F-18 and Ga-68. Furthermore, the influence of the PGC on the quantification and image quality is evaluated.For measuring the image quality the NEMA NU2-2001 PET/SPECT-Phantom was used containing 6 spheres with a diameter between 10 mm and 37 mm placed in water with different levels of background activity. Each sphere was filled with the same activity concentration measured by an independently cross-calibrated dose calibrator. The ""hot"" sources were acquired with a full 3D PET/CT (Biograph mCT®, Siemens Medical USA). Acquisition times were 2 min for F-18 and Ga-68, and 10 min for I-124. For reconstruction an OSEM algorithm was applied. For I-124 the images were reconstructed with and without PGC. For the calculation of the RCs the activity concentrations in each sphere were determined; in addition, the influence of the background correction was studied.The RCs of Ga-68 are the smallest (79%). I-124 reaches similar RCs (87% with PGC, 84% without PGC) as F-18 (84%). showing that the quantification of I-124 images is similar to F-18 and slightly better than Ga-68. With background activity the contrast of the I-124 PGC images is similar to Ga-68 and F-18 scans. There was lower background activity in the I-124 images without PGC, which probably originates from an overcorrection of the scatter contribution. Consequently, the contrast without PGC was much higher than with PGC. As a consequence PGC should be used for I-124.For I-124 there is only a slight influence on the quantification depending on the use of the PGC. However, there are considerable differences with respect to I-124 image quality."
https://openalex.org/W1988267589,"Coagulation factor V (FV) circulates as an inactive procofactor and is activated to FVa by proteolytic removal of a large inhibitory B-domain. Conserved basic and acidic sequences within the B-domain appear to play an important role in keeping FV as an inactive procofactor. Here, we utilized recombinant B-domain fragments to elucidate the mechanism of this FV autoinhibition. We show that a fragment encoding the basic region (BR) of the B-domain binds with high affinity to cofactor-like FV(a) variants that harbor an intact acidic region. Furthermore, the BR inhibits procoagulant function of the variants, thereby restoring the procofactor state. The BR competes with FXa for binding to FV(a), and limited proteolysis of the B-domain, specifically at Arg(1545), ablates BR binding to promote high affinity association between FVa and FXa. These results provide new insight into the mechanism by which the B-domain stabilizes FV as an inactive procofactor and reveal how limited proteolysis of FV progressively destabilizes key regulatory regions of the B-domain to produce an active form of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2083846992,"Improved detection of anti-carbohydrate antibodies is a need in clinical identification of biomarkers for cancer cells or pathogens. Here, we report a new ELISA approach for the detection of specific immunoglobulins (IgGs) against carbohydrates. Two nanometer gold glyconanoparticles bearing oligosaccharide epitopes of HIV or Streptococcus pneumoniae were used as antigens to coat ELISA-plates. A ~3,000-fold improved detection of specific IgGs in mice immunized against S. pneumoniae respect to the well known BSA-glycoconjugate ELISA was achieved. Moreover, these multivalent glyconanoparticles have been employed in solid phase assays to detect the carbohydrate-dependent binding of human dendritic cells and the lectin DC-SIGN. Multivalent glyconanoparticles in ELISA provide a versatile, easy and highly sensitive method to detect and quantify the binding of glycan to proteins and to facilitate the identification of biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2116992125,"Traditional haymaking has created exceptionally high levels of plant species diversity in semi-natural grasslands of the Carpathian Mountains (Romania), the maintenance of which is jeopardized by recent abandonment and subsequent vegetation succession. We tested the hypothesis that the different life history strategies of dominant grasses cause different patterns of diversity loss after abandonment of traditional haymaking in two types of meadow. Although diversity loss rate was not significantly different, the mechanism of loss depended on the life history of dominant species. In meadows co-dominated by competitive stress-tolerant ruderals, diversity loss occurred following the suppression of dominant grasses by tall forbs, whereas in meadows dominated by a stress-tolerant competitor, diversity loss resulted from increased abundance and biomass of the dominant grass. We conclude that management for species conservation in abandoned grasslands should manipulate the functional turnover in communities where the dominant species is a weaker competitor, and abundance and biomass of dominant species in communities where the dominant species is the stronger competitor."
https://openalex.org/W2147871162,"Fluorescent protein-based indicators for intracellular environment conditions such as pH and ion concentrations are commonly used to study the status and dynamics of living cells. Despite being an important factor in many biological processes, the development of an indicator for the physicochemical state of water, such as pressure, viscosity and temperature, however, has been neglected. We here found a novel mutation that dramatically enhances the pressure dependency of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) by inserting several glycines into it. The crystal structure of the mutant showed that the tyrosine near the chromophore flipped toward the outside of the β-can structure, resulting in the entry of a few water molecules near the chromophore. In response to changes in hydrostatic pressure, a spectrum shift and an intensity change of the fluorescence were observed. By measuring the fluorescence of the YFP mutant, we succeeded in measuring the intracellular pressure change in living cell. This study shows a new strategy of design to engineer fluorescent protein indicators to sense hydrostatic pressure."

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a suite of RNA-binding proteins regulates expression of maternal mRNAs during oogenesis, the oocyte to embryo transition, and early embryogenesis. To understand how these RNA-binding proteins contribute to development, it is necessary to determine how they select specific mRNA targets for regulation. OMA-1 and OMA-2 are redundant proteins required for oocyte maturation—an essential part of meiosis that prepares oocytes for fertilization. Both proteins have CCCH type tandem zinc finger RNA-binding domains. Here, we define the RNA binding specificity of OMA-1 and demonstrate that OMA-1/2 are required to repress the expression of a glp-1 3′-UTR reporter in developing oocytes. OMA-1 binds with high affinity to a conserved region of the glp-1 3′-UTR previously shown to interact with POS-1 and GLD-1, RNA-binding proteins required for glp-1 reporter repression in the posterior of fertilized embryos. Our results reveal that OMA-1 is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein required to repress expression of maternal transcripts during oogenesis and suggest that interplay between OMA-1 and other factors for overlapping binding sites helps to coordinate the transition from oocyte to embryo.Background: OMA-1 is required for oocyte maturation and may function by regulating maternal mRNAs.Results: OMA-1 binds with high affinity to UA(A/U) motifs and regulates glp-1 via its 3′-UTR in live worms.Conclusion: OMA-1 is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that represses maternal mRNAs during oocyte maturation.Significance: This work reveals the nature of OMA-1 RNA binding activity, which will help identify targets that contribute to the maturation defective phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W1998487372,"For some authors, the human sensitivity to numerosities would be grounded in our ability to process non-numerical magnitudes. In the present study, the developmental relationships between non numerical and numerical magnitude processing are examined in people with Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic disorder known to associate visuo-spatial and math learning disabilities. Twenty patients with WS and 40 typically developing children matched on verbal or non-verbal abilities were administered three comparison tasks in which they had to compare numerosities, lengths or durations. Participants with WS showed lower acuity (manifested by a higher Weber fraction) than their verbal matched peers when processing numerical and spatial but not temporal magnitudes, indicating that they do not present a domain-general dysfunction of all magnitude processing. Conversely, they do not differ from non-verbal matched participants in any of the three tasks. Finally, correlational analyses revealed that non-numerical and numerical acuity indexes were both related to the first mathematical acquisitions but not with later arithmetical skills."
https://openalex.org/W2009205849,"Diastolic dysfunction suggestive of diabetic cardiomyopathy is established in children with T1DM, but its pathogenesis is not well understood. We studied the relationships of systemic inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and cardiac function in 17 children with T1DM during and after correction of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Twenty seven of the 39 measured cytokines/chemokines were elevated at 6-12 hours into treatment of DKA compared to values after DKA resolution. Eight patients displayed at least one parameter of diastolic abnormality (DA) during acute DKA. Significant associations were present between nine of the cytokine/chemokine levels and the DA over time. Interestingly, four of these nine interactive cytokines (GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-12p40, IL-17) are associated with a Th17 mediated cell response. Both the DA and CCL7 and IL-12p40, had independent associations with African American patients. Thus, we report occurrence of a systemic inflammatory response and the presence of cardiac diastolic dysfunction in a subset of young T1DM patients during acute DKA."
https://openalex.org/W2078852023,"The TolC-like protein HgdD of the filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 is part of multiple three-component ""AB-D"" systems spanning the inner and outer membranes and is involved in secretion of various compounds, including lipids, metabolites, antibiotics, and proteins. Several components of HgdD-dependent tripartite transport systems have been identified, but the diversity of inner membrane energizing systems is still unknown. Here we identified six putative resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) type factors. Four of them are expressed during late exponential and stationary growth phase under normal growth conditions, whereas the other two are induced upon incubation with erythromycin or ethidium bromide. The constitutively expressed RND component Alr4267 has an atypical predicted topology, and a mutant strain (I-alr4267) shows a reduction in the content of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol as well as an altered filament shape. An insertion mutant of the ethidium bromide-induced all7631 did not show any significant phenotypic alteration under the conditions tested. Mutants of the constitutively expressed all3143 and alr1656 exhibited a Fox(-) phenotype. The phenotype of the insertion mutant I-all3143 parallels that of the I-hgdD mutant with respect to antibiotic sensitivity, lipid profile, and ethidium efflux. In addition, expression of the RND genes all3143 and all3144 partially complements the capability of Escherichia coli ΔacrAB to transport ethidium. We postulate that the RND transporter All3143 and the predicted membrane fusion protein All3144, as homologs of E. coli AcrB and AcrA, respectively, are major players for antibiotic resistance in Anabaena sp.

https://openalex.org/W2032858694,"Here we report that in Streptomyces coelicolor, the protein stability of an ECF σ factor SigT, which is involved in the negative regulation of cell differentiation, was completely dependent on its cognate anti-σ factor RstA. The degradation of RstA caused a ClpP/SsrA-dependent degradation of SigT during cell differentiation. This was consistent with the delayed morphological development or secondary metabolism in the ΔclpP background after rstA deletion or sigT overexpression. Meanwhile, SigT negatively regulated clpP/ssrA expression by directly binding to the clpP promoter (clpPp). The SigT-clpPp interaction could be disrupted by secondary metabolites, giving rise to the stabilized SigT protein and retarded morphological development in a non-antibiotic-producing mutant. Thus a novel regulatory mechanism was revealed that the protein degradation of the ECF σ factor was initiated by the degradation of its anti-σ factor, and was accelerated in a dual positive feedback manner, through regulation by secondary metabolites, to promote rapid and irreversible development of the secondary metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2161555844,"The NO reductase from Paracoccus denitrificans reduces NO to N2O (2NO + 2H(+) + 2e(-) → N2O + H2O) with electrons donated by periplasmic cytochrome c (cytochrome c-dependent NO reductase; cNOR). cNORs are members of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily of integral membrane proteins, comprising the O2-reducing, proton-pumping respiratory enzymes. In contrast, although NO reduction is as exergonic as O2 reduction, there are no protons pumped in cNOR, and in addition, protons needed for NO reduction are derived from the periplasmic solution (no contribution to the electrochemical gradient is made). cNOR thus only needs to transport protons from the periplasm into the active site without the requirement to control the timing of opening and closing (gating) of proton pathways as is needed in a proton pump. Based on the crystal structure of a closely related cNOR and molecular dynamics simulations, several proton transfer pathways were suggested, and in principle, these could all be functional. In this work, we show that residues in one of the suggested pathways (denoted pathway 1) are sensitive to site-directed mutation, whereas residues in the other proposed pathways (pathways 2 and 3) could be exchanged without severe effects on turnover activity with either NO or O2. We further show that electron transfer during single-turnover reduction of O2 is limited by proton transfer and can thus be used to study alterations in proton transfer rates. The exchange of residues along pathway 1 showed specific slowing of this proton-coupled electron transfer as well as changes in its pH dependence. Our results indicate that only pathway 1 is used to transfer protons in cNOR."

Here, we identified that etoposide-induced 2.4 mRNA (Ei24)/p53-induced gene 8 (Pig8), a p53 target gene involved in apoptosis and autophagy, was up-regulated in Rb(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The Ei24 promoter was activated by E2F1 via multiple E2F-responsive elements, independently of the previously reported p53-responsive element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that E2F1 directly acts on the mouse Ei24 promoter. We observed that Ei24 expression was suppressed in p53(-/-) MEFs upon UVC irradiation, which was exacerbated in p53(-/-) E2f1(-/-) MEFs, supporting the positive role of E2F1 on Ei24 transcription. Furthermore, Ei24 knockdown sensitized p53(-/-) MEFs against UVC irradiation. Together, our data indicate that Ei24 is a novel E2F target gene contributing to the survival of p53-deficient cells upon UVC irradiation and thus may have a potential significance as a therapeutic target of certain chemotherapy for treating p53-deficient tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2162581351,"Background To describe structural and functional changes associated with diabetic macular oedema (DMO) treated with intravitreal bevacizumab over 24 months. Methods A post-hoc analysis of the data of 34 patients that completed 24 months follow-up in the intravitreal bevacizumab arm of a prospective, randomized controlled trial (BOLT study) was performed. The outcome measures previously used in clinical trials of intravitreal ranibizumab in DMO were employed to describe the visual acuity and macular thickness changes at 12 and 24 months. Results The standard outcomes of mean change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central macular thickness (CMT) in participants treated with bevacizumab were comparable to those reported in association with ranibizumab. However, exploratory analyses showed that thick maculae at baseline defined as CMT of ≥400 µm, remained significantly thicker than those <400 µm with intensive bevacizumab therapy, despite a comparable gain in visual acuity at both 12 and 24 months. The proportion of subjects that attained a dry macula doubled in both CMT groups between the 12 and 24-month time-points. Conclusions These findings provide valuable information both for clinical practice and trials. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of intravitreal bevacizumab on retinal thickness profiles in DMO."

https://openalex.org/W1984424049,"The soil bacterium Streptomyces reticuli secretes the octameric protein HbpS that acts as a sensory component of the redox-signalling pathway HbpS-SenS-SenR. This system modulates a genetic response on iron- and haem-mediated oxidative stress. Moreover, HbpS alone provides this bacterium with a defence mechanism to the presence of high concentrations of iron ions and haem. While the protection against haem has been related to its haem-binding and haem-degrading activity, the interaction with iron has not been studied in detail. In this work, we biochemically analyzed the iron-binding activity of a set of generated HbpS mutant proteins and present evidence showing the involvement of one internal and two exposed D/EXXE motifs in binding of high quantities of ferrous iron, with the internal E78XXE81 displaying the tightest binding. We additionally show that HbpS is able to oxidize ferrous to ferric iron ions. Based on the crystal structure of both the wild-type and the mutant HbpS-D78XXD81, we conclude that the local arrangement of the side chains from the glutamates in E78XXE81 within the octameric assembly is a pre-requisite for interaction with iron. The data obtained led us to propose that the exposed and the internal motif build a highly specific route that is involved in the transport of high quantities of iron ions into the core of the HbpS octamer. Furthermore, physiological studies using Streptomyces transformants secreting either wild-type or HbpS mutant proteins and different redox-cycling compounds led us to conclude that the iron-sequestering activity of HbpS protects these soil bacteria from the hazardous side effects of peroxide- and iron-based oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2112531370,"There is conflicting data on long-term CD4 immune recovery after combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings. Virologic suppression is rarely documented in cohorts from sub-Saharan Africa so objective evidence of adherence is biologically unsubstantiated. We sought to investigate long-term patterns of immune recovery in Ugandan patients on ART with sustained viral suppression.A prospective cohort of patients starting ART between April, 2004 and April, 2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute with sustained viral suppression (viral load ≤ 400 copies/ml at month 6 and 12) while on first-line ART. Propensity scores were used to adjust for treatment allocation (nevirapine or efavirenz) at ART initiation. Data were analyzed using Kaplan Meier methods and cross-sectional time series regression.Three hundred and fifty-six patients were included in the analysis.71.6% were female, 87% in WHO stage 3 or 4, median age was 37 years, (IQR:32-43), and median CD4 count was 108 cells/µL, (IQR:35-174) at ART start. At multivariable analysis, lower immune recovery (measured by change in CD4 from ART start at each time interval) was associated with male-gender (-59, 95% CI: 90, -28, P<0.001), baseline CD4 count of 101-200 cells/µL (-35, 95% CI: 62, -9, P=0.009) and >200 (-64, 95% CI: 101, -26, P=0.001), and use of AZT at baseline (-47, 95% CI: -74, -20, P=0.001). Median time to reach >400 cells/µL was longer in males (197.4 weeks, IQR:119.9-312.0), compared to females (144.7 weeks, IQR:96.6-219.7, P<0.001). The cumulative probability of attaining CD4 >400 cells/µL over 7 years was higher in females compared to males (P<0.001).There was long-term, continuous, immunologic recovery up to 7 years after ART initiation in an urban Ugandan cohort. Virologically suppressed women had better sustained immune recovery than men. Men take longer to immune reconstitute and have a lower probability of reaching a CD4 cell count >400 cells/µL. The biologic mechanisms of these gender differences need further exploration."

Therefore, this cross-sectional study describes the prevalence and risk factors of microsporidiosis among asymptomatic individuals in Malaysia. Methods/Findings Four hundred and forty seven stool samples were collected and examined for microsporidia after staining with Gram-chromotrope Kinyoun. Demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral information were collected by using a pre-tested questionnaire. Overall, 67 (15%) samples were positive for microsporidia. The prevalence of infection was significantly higher among individuals aged more than 15 years compared to those aged <15 years (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.08, 3.62; P = 0.028). Furthermore, logistic regression analysis confirmed that the presence of other family members infected with microsporidia (OR = 8.45; 95% CI = 4.30, 16.62; P<0.001) and being a consumer of raw vegetables (OR = 2.05; 95% CI = 1.15, 3.66; P = 0.016) were the significant risk factors of this infection. Conclusions These findings clearly show that exposure to microsporidia is common among Aboriginal population. Further studies using molecular approach on microsporidia isolates from asymptomatic individuals is needed to determine species-specific. The risk factors associated with microsporidiosis will help in identifying more clearly the sources of the infection in the environment that pose a risk for transmission so that preventive strategies can be implemented."

In contrast to MDR1, MRP1 also transports glutathione (GSH) and drugs conjugated to GSH. Due to its extraordinary transport properties, MRP1/ABCC1 contributes to several physiological functions and pathophysiological incidents. We previously found that nuclear translocation of MRP1 contributes to multidrug-resistance (MDR) of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). The present study investigated how MRP1 contributes to MDR in the nuclei of MEC cells.Western blot and RT-PCR was carried out to investigate the change of multidrug-resistance protein 1 (MDR1) in MC3/5FU cells after MRP1 was downregulated through RNA interference (RNAi). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of 127 cases of MEC tissues was scored with the expression index (EI). The EI of MDR1 and MRP1 (or nuclear MRP1) was analyzed with Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Using multiple tumor tissue assays, the location of MRP1 in other tissues was checked by HIC. Luciferase reporter assays of MDR1 promoter was carried out to check the connection between MRP1 and MDR1 promoter.MRP1 downregulation led to a decreased MDR1 expression in MC3/5FU cells which was caused by decreased activity of MDR1 promoter. IHC study of 127 cases of MEC tissues demonstrated a strong positive correlation between nuclear MRP1 expression and MDR1 expression. Furthermore, IHC study of multiple tumor tissue array sections showed that although nuclear MRP1 widely existed in MEC tissues, it was not found in normal tissues or other tumor tissues.Our findings indicate that nuclear MRP1 contributes to MDR mainly through regulating MDR1 expression in MEC. And the unique location of MRP1 made it an available target in identifying MEC from other tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2020655688,"Background Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) has been identified as a major preventable risk factor for anal incontinence. Objective Aim was to measure national variation in incidence of OASIS by socioeconomic status (SES). Methods A retrospective population based case-control study using the data derived from the Finnish Medical Birth Register for the years 1991–2010. A total population of singleton vaginal births was reviewed. We calculated unadjusted incidences of OASIS stratified by SES and vaginal parity, and adjusted risks for OASIS in each social class, after controlling for parity, birthweight, mode of delivery, maternal age and maternal smoking. SES was recorded into five categories based on mother’s occupation at time of birth; upper white-collar workers such as physicians, lower white-collar workers such as nurses, blue-collar workers such as cleaners, others such as students, and cases with missing information. Results Seven per thousand (6,404 of 980,733) singleton births were affected by OASIS. In nulliparae the incidence of OASIS was 18% higher (adjusted OR 1.18 95% CI 1.04−1.34) for upper white-collar workers and 12% higher (adjusted OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02−1.24) for lower white-collar workers compared with blue-collar workers. Among women in these higher SES groups, 40% of the excess OASIS risk was explained by age, non-smoking, birthweight and mode of delivery. Despite the large effect of SES on OASIS, inclusion of SES in multivariable models caused only small changes in estimated adjusted effects for other established risk factors. Conclusions OASIS at the first vaginal delivery demonstrates a strong positive social gradient. Higher SES is associated with a number of risk factors for OASIS, including higher birthweight and non-smoking, but only 40% of the excess incidence is explained by these known risk factors. Further research should address other underlying causes including differences in lifestyle or environmental factors, and inequalities in healthcare provision."
