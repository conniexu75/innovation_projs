https://openalex.org/W2036062947,"When massive stars exhaust their fuel, they collapse and often produce the extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that these long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find that the gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated in the very brightest regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae. Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are associated with the most extremely massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way."

https://openalex.org/W2083147729,"Ribosomal frameshifting is a translational mechanism involved in protein synthesis during the replication of many viral pathogens and in cellular genes more generally. A new set of images of an 80S ribosome stalled at an mRNA pseudoknot shows how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging is used to visualize a translating ribosome stalled during frameshifting. The triplet-based genetic code requires that translating ribosomes maintain the reading frame of a messenger RNA faithfully to ensure correct protein synthesis1. However, in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting2, a specific subversion of frame maintenance takes place, wherein the ribosome is forced to shift one nucleotide backwards into an overlapping reading frame and to translate an entirely new sequence of amino acids. This process is indispensable in the replication of numerous viral pathogens, including HIV and the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome3, and is also exploited in the expression of several cellular genes4. Frameshifting is promoted by an mRNA signal composed of two essential elements: a heptanucleotide ‘slippery’ sequence5 and an adjacent mRNA secondary structure, most often an mRNA pseudoknot6. How these components operate together to manipulate the ribosome is unknown. Here we describe the observation of a ribosome–mRNA pseudoknot complex that is stalled in the process of -1 frameshifting. Cryoelectron microscopic imaging of purified mammalian 80S ribosomes from rabbit reticulocytes paused at a coronavirus pseudoknot reveals an intermediate of the frameshifting process. From this it can be seen how the pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process and leading to a spring-like deformation of the P-site transfer RNA. In addition, we identify movements of the likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase and confirm a direct interaction between the translocase eEF2 and the P-site tRNA. Together, the structural changes provide a mechanical explanation of how the pseudoknot manipulates the ribosome into a different reading frame."

https://openalex.org/W2142924698,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of cellular energy balance and of the effects of leptin on food intake and fatty acid oxidation. Obesity is usually associated with resistance to the effects of leptin on food intake and body weight. To determine whether diet-induced obesity (DIO) impairs the AMPK response to leptin in muscle and/or hypothalamus, we fed FVB mice a high fat (55%) diet for 10-12 weeks. Leptin acutely decreased food intake by approximately 30% in chow-fed mice. DIO mice tended to eat less, and leptin had no effect on food intake. Leptin decreased respiratory exchange ratio in chow-fed mice indicating increased fatty acid oxidation. Respiratory exchange ratio was low basally in high fat-fed mice, and leptin had no further effect. Leptin (3 mg/kg intraperitoneally) increased alpha2-AMPK activity 2-fold in muscle in chow-fed mice but not in DIO mice. Leptin decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity 40% in muscle from chow-fed mice. In muscle from DIO mice, acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was basally low, and leptin had no further effect. In paraventricular, arcuate, and medial hypothalamus of chow-fed mice, leptin inhibited alpha2-AMPK activity but not in DIO mice. In addition, leptin increased STAT3 phosphorylation 2-fold in arcuate of chow-fed mice, but this effect was attenuated because of elevated basal STAT3 phosphorylation in DIO mice. Thus, DIO in FVB mice alters alpha2-AMPK in muscle and hypothalamus and STAT3 in hypothalamus and impairs further effects of leptin on these signaling pathways. Defective responses of AMPK to leptin may contribute to resistance to leptin action on food intake and energy expenditure in obese states."

https://openalex.org/W2161761145,"Individuals exposed to an increased nutrient supply before birth have a high risk of becoming obese children and adults. It has been proposed that exposure of the fetus to high maternal nutrient intake results in permanent changes within the central appetite regulatory network. No studies, however, have investigated the impact of increased maternal nutrition on the appetite regulatory network in species in which this network develops before birth, as in the human. In the present study, pregnant ewes were fed a diet which provided 100% (control, n = 8) or approximately 160% (well-fed, n = 8) of metabolizable energy requirements. Ewes were allowed to lamb spontaneously, and lambs were sacrificed at 30 days of postnatal age. All fat depots were dissected and weighed, and expression of the appetite-regulating neuropeptides and the leptin receptor (OBRb) were determined by in situ hybridization. Lambs of well-fed ewes had higher glucose (Glc) concentrations during early postnatal life (F = 5.93, P<0.01) and a higher relative subcutaneous (s.c.) fat mass at 30 days of age (34.9+/-4.7 g/kg vs. 22.8+/-3.3 g/kg; P<0.05). The hypothalamic expression of pro-opiomelanocortin was higher in lambs of well-fed ewes (0.48+/-0.09 vs. 0.28+/-0.04, P<0.05). In lambs of overnourished mothers, but not in controls, the expression of OBRb was inversely related to total relative fat mass (r2 = 0.50, P = 0.05, n = 8), and the direct relationship between the expression of the central appetite inhibitor CART and fat mass was lost. The expression of neuropeptide Y and AGRP was inversely related to total relative fat mass (NPY, r2 = 0.28, P<0.05; agouti-related peptide, r2 = 0.39, P<0.01). These findings suggest that exposure to increased nutrition before birth alters the responses of the central appetite regulatory system to signals of increased adiposity after birth."

These EWI proteins contain a stretch of basic charged amino acids in their cytoplasmic domains that may act as binding sites for actin-linking ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that EWI-2 and EWI-F colocalized with ERM proteins at microspikes and microvilli of adherent cells and at the cellular uropod in polarized migrating leukocytes. Immunoprecipitation studies showed the association of EWI-2 and EWI-F with ERM proteins in vivo. Moreover, pulldown experiments and protein-protein binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic domains of EWI proteins corroborated the strong and direct interaction between ERMs and these proteins. The active role of ERMs was further confirmed by double transfections with the N-terminal domain of moesin, which acts as a dominant negative form of ERMs, and was able to delocalize EWIs from the uropod of polarized leukocytes. In addition, direct association of EWI partner CD81 C-terminal domain with ERMs was also demonstrated. Functionally, silencing of endogenous EWI-2 expression by short interfering RNA in lymphoid CEM cells augmented cell migration, cellular polarity, and increased phosphorylation of ERMs. Hence, EWI proteins, through their direct interaction with ERM proteins, act as linkers to connect tetraspanin-associated microdomains to actin cytoskeleton regulating cell motility and polarity.

Recent reports have described a novel Ig subfamily named EWI proteins because of their characteristic Glu-Trp-Ile (EWI) extracellular motif (1Charrin S. Le Naour F. Labas V. Billard M. Le Caer J.P.

EWI-2 and EWI-F proteins have short cytoplasmic tails of 10 and 27 amino acids and an extracellular domain consisting of 4 and 6 Ig domains, respectively (2Charrin S. Le Naour F. Oualid M. Billard M.

Rubinstein E. Liu L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2665-2674PubMed Google Scholar), which inversely correlates with the metastatic potential of a variety of cancers (8Boucheix C. Duc G.H. Jasmin C. Rubinstein E. Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2001; 3: 1-17Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both EWI-2 and EWI-F are also found associated to CD151 (Tspan24), but in this case the interaction is indirect, through other tetraspanins, likely CD9 and CD81 (2Charrin S. Le Naour F. Oualid M.

Tetraspanins are a large family of ubiquitous membrane proteins characterized by their four transmembrane, two extracellular loops, one intracellular loop, and two short N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The second large extracellular loop contains the CCG and PXSC motifs, which are hallmarks of this family of type III proteins (9Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1189-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 11Tarrant J.M. Robb L. van Spriel A.B. Wright M.D. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 610-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Through their large extracellular domain, tetraspanins interact with themselves and with other proteins such as growth factors, complement regulatory proteins, proteoglycans, signaling enzymes, and integrins (11Tarrant J.M.

This ability of tetraspanins allows them to organize the cellular surface into structural and functional microdomains, named tetraspanin web or tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM) 2The abbreviations used are: TEM, tetraspanin-enriched-microdomains; ERM, ezrin-radixin-moesin; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; DIC, differential interference contrast; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; pAb, polyclonal antibody; siRNA, short interfering RNA; HCV, hepatitis C virus; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; oligo, oligonucleotide.

At this molecular network, tetraspanins are capable of modulating the functions of associated proteins. For example, tetraspanins modulate integrin-dependent migration (15Yáñez-Mó M. Alfranca A. Cabañas C. Marazuela M. Tejedor R. Ursa M.A. Ashman L.K. de Landazuri M.O. Sánchez-Madrid F. J.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1871-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, “outside-in” signaling and adhesion strengthening through α6β1 and α3β1 integrins are influenced by their lateral association with CD151 (17Lammerding J. Kazarov A.R. Huang H. Lee R.T. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7616-7621Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Kazarov A.R. Yang X. Stipp C.S. Sehgal B. Hemler M.E. J.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CD151 is also essential for the normal outside-in αIIbβ3 integrin signaling in platelets (20Lau L.M. Wee J.L. Wright M.D. Moseley G.W. Hogarth P.M. Ashman L.K. Jackson D.E. Blood. 2004; 104: 2368-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and modulates the activation-dependent conformation of integrin α3β1 (21Nishiuchi R. Sanzen N. Nada S. Sumida Y. Wada Y. Okada M. Takagi J. Hasegawa H. Sekiguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Tetraspanin microdomains also have a crucial role in the proper adhesive function of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 during leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration (22Barreiro O. Yáñez-Mó M. Sala-Valdés M. Gutierrez-López M.D. Ovalle S. Higginbottom A. Monk P.N. Cabañas C. Sánchez-Madrid F. Blood. 2005; 105: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Inside the TEM, it has been demonstrated that EWI-2 associates with α3β1 and α4β1 integrins through its association with tetraspanins (5Stipp C.S. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Kolesnikova T.V. Stipp C.S. Rao R.M. Lane W.S. Luscinskas F.W. Hemler M.E. Blood. 2004; 103: 3013-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Overexpression of EWI-2 in MOLT-4 cells impairs their spreading and ruffling on VCAM-1-coated surfaces and promotes the formation of CD81-α4β1 complexes with an increased apparent size (23Kolesnikova T.V. Stipp C.S. Rao R.M. Lane W.S. Luscinskas F.W. Hemler M.E. Blood. 2004; 103: 3013-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). EWI-2 also participates in the regulation of aggregation and motility of epidermoid carcinoma cells on laminin-5, forming complexes with CD9, CD81, and the α3β1 integrin, the laminin-5 receptor, and inducing the relocalization of CD81 to filopodia (5Stipp C.S. Kolesnikova T.V. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of EWI-2 in Du145 metastatic prostatic cancer cells inhibits cell migration on both fibronectin and laminin (7Zhang X.A. Lane W.S. Charrin S. Rubinstein E. Liu L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2665-2674PubMed Google Scholar). ERM proteins belong to the 4.1 band superfamily, which is a major component of cortical cytoskeleton involved in membrane-cytoskeletal associations (24Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 25Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). They are concentrated in actin-rich surface structures such as microvilli, filopodia, and membrane ruffles (24Tsukita S. Yonemura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34507-34510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 26Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In polarized leukocytes, ERM proteins are redistributed to the cellular uropod, a membrane protrusion at the rear part of the cell body (27Sánchez-Madrid F. del Pozo M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Two conformational states have been described for ERMs: an inactive form, soluble in the cytoplasm, and an unfolded active state (26Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Changes in conformation are regulated by the phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue in their C-terminal domain. This phosphorylation disrupts the intramolecular association between the N- and the C-terminal domains and the protein unfolds (26Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain contains an actin-binding site, whereas N-terminal domain of ERMs interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of different adhesion molecules, including CD44, CD43, PSGL-1, ICAM-1-3, and VCAM-1 (28Barreiro O.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins contain a positively charged amino acid cluster at a juxtamembrane position that determines their association with ERMs (33Yonemura S. Hirao M. Doi Y. Takahashi N. Kondo T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Despite their structural functions, ERMs are also implicated in cell signaling (26Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 34Tsukita S. Yonemura S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Several studies have demonstrated that ERM activation is linked to the Rho signaling pathway (26Louvet-Vallee S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that moesin and ezrin interact with Syk (35Urzainqui A. Serrador J.M. Viedma F. Yanez-Mo M. Rodriguez A. Corbi A.L. Alonso-Lebrero J.L. Luque A. Deckert M.

Poullet P. Louvard D. Arpin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7300-7305Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). EWI-2 and EWI-F have a net positive charge in their cytoplasmic tails that makes their association with ERMs feasible. Here we have studied the possible interaction between EWI-2 and EWI-F with ERM proteins in order to gain functional insights of the EWI proteins into the tetraspanin web. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that there is indeed an association of EWI proteins with ERMs. In vitro protein-protein binding assays confirmed that this association is strong and direct, but an indirect mechanism through tetraspanin CD81 also exists. Finally, by silencing the expression of endogenous EWI-2, we show a role of EWI-2 in ERM-dependent processes, such as cell polarization and migration.

https://openalex.org/W2086936470,"Grb2-associated binder 1 (GAB1) is a scaffold protein involved in numerous interactions that propagate signaling by growth factor and cytokine receptors. Here we explore in silico and validate in vivo the role of GAB1 in the control of mitogenic (Ras/MAPK) and survival (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt) signaling stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF). We built a comprehensive mechanistic model that allows for reliable predictions of temporal patterns of cellular responses to EGF under diverse perturbations, including different EGF doses, GAB1 suppression, expression of mutant proteins, and pharmacological inhibitors. We show that the temporal dynamics of GAB1 tyrosine phosphorylation is significantly controlled by positive GAB1-PI3K feedback and negative MAPK-GAB1 feedback. Our experimental and computational results demonstrate that the essential function of GAB1 is to enhance PI3K/Akt activation and extend the duration of Ras/MAPK signaling. By amplifying positive interactions between survival and mitogenic pathways, GAB1 plays the critical role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis."

Activation involves binding to an RNA stem-loop structure and recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor b. Tat also induces the remodeling of a single nucleosome in the HIV promoter. However, the mechanism of this remodeling has remained unclear. Knockdown of INI-1 and BRG-1, two components of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, suppressed Tat-mediated transactivation. Cells lacking INI-1 (G401 and MON) or BRG-1 (C33A) exhibited defective transactivation by Tat that was restored upon INI-1 and BRG-1 expression, respectively. Tat was co-immunoprecipitated with several SWI/SNF subunits, including INI-1, BRG-1, and β-actin. The SWI/SNF complex interacted with the integrated HIV promoter in a Tat-dependent manner. We also found that INI-1 and BRG-1 synergized with the p300 acetyltransferase to activate the HIV promoter. This synergism depended on the acetyltransferase activity of p300 and on Tat Lys50 and Lys51.

Once the virus is integrated into the host genome, nucleosomes are deposited at specific positions within the HIV promoter region (1.Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). A large nucleo-some-free region is present between nucleosome (nuc)-0 and nuc-1 and contains binding sites for transcription factors such as NF-κB and Sp1 and other basal transcription factors. Transcription is initiated within this nucleosome-free region. Transcriptional activation of the HIV promoter is associated with the remodeling of nuc-1, which is positioned immediately downstream of the transcription start site (1.Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In the early phase of HIV infection, cellular transcription factors activate transcription from the HIV promoter. However, the basal HIV promoter shows a striking elongation defect, resulting in the accumulation of short transcripts corresponding to the first ∼50 transcribed nucleotides. This elongation defect is presumed to occur because of deficient loading of the transcription elongation complex pTEFb at the HIV promoter. We propose that the presence of nuc-1 (immediately downstream of the transcription start site) accentuates the elongation defect of the polymerase complex assembled at the HIV promoter. However, the elongation defect of RNA polymerase II assembled at the HIV promoter is not absolute, and basal transcription leads to the accumulation of the viral Tat protein, a potent transactivator. Tat binds to TAR (an RNA stem-loop in the nascent viral RNA) and recruits pTEFb (which contains CDK9 and cyclin T1). The recruitment of pTEFb leads to phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and increased transcriptional elongation of the HIV promoter. Efficient transcription elongation of the HIV genome in response to Tat leads to more Tat synthesis and generates a Tat-dependent positive feedback loop (2.Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Tat expression also leads to the remodeling of nuc-1 (1.Verdin E. Paras Jr., P. Van Lint C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 3.el Kharroubi A. Martin M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This remodeling is thought to remove an obstacle to RNA polymerase II elongation. Both Tat activities (pTEFb recruitment and nuc-1 remodeling) are thought to synergize in enhancing the ability of RNA polymerase II to elongate. The molecular mechanism of this Tat-induced nucleosome-remodeling event has remained unclear. Chromatin-modifying complexes are classified into two main groups. The first contains factors that mediate covalent modifications of histones. The N-terminal tails of histone proteins are subject to extensive post-transcriptional modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation. The interaction of Tat with a number of histone acetyltransferase complexes such as p300/CBP, p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), and human GCN5 and their relevance to Tat-mediated activation of the HIV promoter have been established (4.Marzio G.

In addition to BRG-1 or BRM, the complexes include core subunits, which appear to be common to all SWI/SNF complexes, as well as specific subunits. Some subunits appear to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner (14.Olave I.A. Reck-Peterson S.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev.

The dramatic chromatin remodeling of nuc-1 that occurs at the HIV promoter in response to Tat suggests that Tat may recruit an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex to the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) to facilitate transcription. An attractive candidate for the regulation of HIV transcription and chromatin remodeling is the host cell factor INI-1 (integrase interactor-1), also known as SNF5 or BAF47, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex (13.Wang W.

To construct the retroviral vector LTR-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-luciferase-LTR (pEV677), the SalI fragment containing IRES-luciferase of pEV676 was inserted into the SalI-restricted retroviral vector pRRL-EGFP (pEV658). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused BRG-1 deletion constructs have been described previously (23.Rando O.J. Zhao K. Janmey P. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Lines—G401 and C33A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 5% penicillin/streptomycin. MON cells, Jurkat T cells, and Jurkat T cell clones A72 and A2 (24.Jordan A. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 25.Jordan A. Defechereux P.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), containing integrated latent LTR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and LTR-Tat-IRES-GFP, respectively, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 5% penicillin/streptomycin. Doxycycline-inducible INI-1 knockdown HCT116 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, blasticidin (10 μg/ml), and Zeocin (250 μg/ml). Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—To create polyclonal cell lines that contained an integrated LTR-luciferase-GFP reporter, G401 and MON cell lines were infected with viral LTR-luciferase-GFP. Vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped particles were produced as described (25.Jordan A. Defechereux P. Verdin E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) using vesicular stomatitis virus envelope, the NL4-3 packaging vector, and the retroviral vector LTR-EGFP-IRES-luciferase (pEV677). Forty-eight hours after infection, the cells were transfected with CMV-Tat to stimulate GFP expression in cells containing the integrated LTR-luciferase-GFP reporter. After 24 h, GFP-positive cells were sorted by flow cytometry and maintained in culture until they became GFP-negative upon dilution of the CMV-Tat expression vector. G401 and MON cells containing integrated LTR-luciferase-GFP were then used in transient transfection experiments. HCT116 cell lines expressing doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA against the INI-1 gene were generated essentially as described (26.van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Briefly, a monoclonal Tet repressor-expressing HCT116 cell line (HCT116TR) was first generated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions with pcDNA6TR (Invitrogen) and blasticidin selection. HCT116TR cells were then cotransfected with four pTER-INI-1 (for Tet-inducible RNA interference against INI-1) vectors generated by cloning gene-specific oligonucleotides against the INI-1 gene into pTER (26.van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Zeocin-resistant doxycycline-inducible INI-1 knockdown HCT116 cell lines were then tested for their ability to knock down INI-1 by Western blotting. Antibodies, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Protein-Protein Interactions—The specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitations were anti-YY1, anti-BRM, anti-BRG-1, anti-p300, anti-14-3-3, anti-PKD-1, anti-cyclin T1, and anti-CDK9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-INI-1 (anti-SMARCB1) (Abcam); and anti-acetyllysine (Cell Signaling Technology). For immunoprecipitations, Jurkat A2 cells were treated with 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 12–16 h to produce FLAG-Tat. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm tricho-statin A (TSA), 1 mm nicotinamide, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) for 20 min on ice and passed twice through a 26-gauge needle. Lysates were centrifuged, and 2 mg of whole cell protein lysate was incubated overnight with 20 μl of M2-agarose beads (Sigma) in immunoprecipitation buffer at 4 °C on a rotator. After five washes with immunoprecipitation buffer, the beads were resuspended in SDS loading buffer, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and identified by Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of the INI-1, BRG-1, and PKD-1 complexes, 3 μg of polyclonal antibody was incubated overnight with 5 mg of Jurkat cell lysate at 4 °C and bound to 60 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C, followed by extensive washes with immunoprecipitation buffer. The BRG-1, INI-1, and PKD-1 complex-coated beads were incubated for 2 h with reticulocyte lysate-expressed 35S-labeled Tat, washed extensively with immunoprecipitation buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For Tat immunoprecipitation with pTEFb and SWI/SNF, 293T cells were transfected with control pcDNA3.1 or N-terminally FLAG-tagged wild-type Tat (pEV280) or mutant Tat(K50R/K51R) (pEV537) in the presence or absence of p300 expression vector; 36 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 1 μm TSA and 5 mm nicotinamide for 6 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in phosphate lysis buffer (PLB; phosphate-buffered saline, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm TSA, 5 mm nicotinamide, and protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were centrifuged, and 2 mg of protein lysate was incubated overnight with 20 μl of M2-agarose beads at 4 °C on a rotator. After extensive washing with PLB, the beads were resuspended in SDS loading buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Coprecipitated proteins were identified by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. For GST pulldown experiments, GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione beads. GST-BRG-1 deletion peptides immobilized on beads were then incubated with synthetic acetylated or unacetylated biotinylated Tat in PLB for 2 h at 4°C on a rotator. The beads were washed extensively with PLB and wash buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1% Non-idet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm TSA, 1 mm nicotinamide, and protease inhibitor mixture) before addition of SDS loading buffer and electrophoresis. Acetylated and unacetylated biotinylated Tat proteins were detected by Western blotting using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-streptavidin antibody. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—G401, C33A, MON, and doxycycline-inducible INI-1 knockdown HCT116 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/35-mm plate and transfected the next day with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, transient transfections were carried out with 200 ng of LTR-luciferase reporter plasmid and expression vectors CMV-FLAG-Tat (5–30 ng), Rous sarcoma virus-FLAG-INI-1 (50–500 ng), CMV-BRG-1 (50 ng), CMV-p300 (50 ng), and CMV-Δp300 (50 ng) as indicated. The total DNA amount was adjusted using the corresponding empty vectors. Transfection efficiencies were >50% for all assays. Transfection efficiency was normalized using the cotransfected Renilla luciferase activity as an internal control. The cells were lysed after 24 h using luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system with a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The data shown are from representative experiments conducted a minimum of three times and in triplicate. AMAXA Nucleofection—Nucleofection of Jurkat cell clones was conducted using Nucleofector Kit R and program O28. Jurkat cell clones A72 and A2 were split to 300,000/ml 24 h before AMAXA nucleofection. Cells (5 × 106) were spun at 1000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature, resuspended in 100 μl of solution R, and nucleofected with 2 μg of either short interfering RNA (siRNA) or expression plasmid using program O28. Nucleofected cells were resuspended in 500 μl of prewarmed serum-free RPMI 1640 medium lacking antibiotics and allowed to recover at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 15 min, and 4 ml of prewarmed complete RPMI 1640 medium was added to the cells. Flow Cytometry—Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using the CellQuest program (BD Biosciences). Forward versus side scatter profiles were used to define the live population. Cells were further gated using forward scatter versus FL1 to differentiate between GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells. RNA Interference—Pre-designed Dharmacon siRNA pools targeting transcripts of the human SNF5 (INI-1) and BRG-1 genes, as well as a control siRNA pool, were used to knock down the respective genes in Jurkat A72 cells. siRNA was delivered into Jurkat cell clones by nucleofection (AMAXA). siRNA (2 μg) was used to nucleofect 5 million cells; and 24, 48, and 72 h after nucleofection, protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Jurkat cell clones A72 and A2 were fixed by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% for 15 min at room temperature. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 125 mm to stop the cross-linking. Nuclei were isolated by incubation in hypotonic buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Non-idet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) for 10 min, followed by homogenization 15 times in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were lysed in sonication buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture) and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments of 500–1500 bp. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and precleared by incubation with protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations were conducted by incubating 5 μg of the indicated antibodies with 800 μl of the sheared cross-linked chromatin overnight at 4 °C. Approximately 15 million cells were used per immunoprecipitation. Protein A-agarose beads were blocked by incubation overnight with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were bound to blocked protein A-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C and washed twice with each buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture), buffer B (50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture), and buffer C (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture). Immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 500 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated for 2 h on a shaker at 37 °C and overnight at 65 °C for reversion of cross-links. DNA was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 100 μl of H2O by shaking at 37 °C. Input and immunoprecipitated DNAs (10 μl) were subjected to 33 PCR cycles with primers 996 (5′-TTGCCTGTACTGGGTCTCTCTG-3′) and 997 (5′-TCGCTTTCAAGTCCCTGTTCG-3′). RNA Interference-mediated Depletion of INI-1 and BRG-1 Compromises Tat Transactivation—To examine whether INI-1-containing chromatin-remodeling complexes are involved in the transcriptional activation of the HIV promoter, we used a cell line containing a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA against the INI-1 gene. Cells were transfected with the HIV LTR-luciferase reporter construct in the presence or absence of Tat. Induction of the short hairpin RNA against INI-1 by doxycycline led to nearly complete suppression of INI-1 expression (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV promoter was compromised, whereas basal HIV promoter activity was unchanged (Fig. 1A). To confirm this result, we used INI-1-deficient G401 cells. These cells were transfected with the LTR-luciferase reporter vector in the presence or absence of expression vectors for Tat and INI-1. In the absence of Tat, INI-1 had no effect on basal HIV promoter activity (Fig. 1B). Expression of INI-1 enhanced the HIV LTR activation mediated by Tat (Fig. 1B). Expression of both Tat and INI-1 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that INI-1 is necessary for optimal Tat activation of the HIV promoter. Next, we studied the role of INI-1 and BRG-1 in HIV promoter activity in the Jurkat A72 T cell line. This clonal cell line was generated by infection of Jurkat cells with viral particles containing an HIV retroviral vector lacking the tat gene. In this vector, the HIV promoter drives expression of GFP (25.Jordan A. Defechereux P. Verdin E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). siRNAs specific for INI-1 or BRG-1 were transfected by nucleofection, resulting in transfection of ∼80% of the cells (data not shown) and leading to the specific depletion of either INI-1 or BRG-1 (Fig. 1C). Notably, depletion of INI-1 did not affect the expression of BRG-1, and conversely, depletion of BRG-1 did not deplete INI-1 (Fig. 1C). Cells were transfected with an expression vector for Tat or the control empty vector, and Tat-mediated transactivation was assessed by measuring GFP expression by flow cytometry. Depletion of either INI-1 or BRG-1 suppressed Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV promoter as indicated by a decrease in the percentage of GFP-positive cells (Fig. 1D). Similar results were also obtained when the mean fluorescence intensity was measured (siRNA control, mean fluorescence intensity = 92.9; siRNA for BRG-1, mean fluorescence intensity = 49.7; and siRNA for INI-1, mean fluorescence intensity = 58.6), indicating that depletion of INI-1 and BRG-1 decreases Tat-mediated transcriptional activation of the LTR. To ensure that the observed decrease in transactivation was not due to lowered activity of the CMV promoter and therefore lower Tat expression, we transfected Jurkat A72 cells lacking either INI-1 or BRG-1 with a CMV-luciferase reporter vector. Luciferase values in cells with or without INI-1 and BRG-1 were similar (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that Tat activation of the LTR depends on INI-1 and BRG-1. In addition, the reduced transactivation activity of Tat in the absence of BRG-1 suggests that INI-1 plays a role in the transactivation as a subunit of the BRG-1 complex. Tat Interacts with Subunits of the SWI/SNF Chromatin-remodeling Complex—Our results above showed that Tat requires INI-1 and BRG-1 for transcriptional activation. To determine whether Tat interacts with SWI/SNF components in cells, we used Jurkat A2 cells containing a latently integrated LTR-Tat-IRES-GFP virus (24.Jordan A. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). This cell line expresses detectable levels of FLAG-tagged Tat protein under the control of the HIV promoter only after stimulation of these cells with PMA (Fig. 2A, upper panel). We immunoprecipitated Tat from Jurkat A2 cell extracts after PMA stimulation and probed for association of Tat with endogenous components of SWI/SNF. The immunoprecipitations showed that Tat specifically associated with the core components of SWI/SNF: INI-1, BRG-1, and β-actin (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, Tat co-immunoprecipitated with BRG-1 but not BRM (Fig. 2A), indicating that Tat interacts specifically with the SWI/SNF complex containing BRG-1 as its catalytic subunit. We used the unrelated proteins 14-3-3 and PKD-1 as controls, and they did not co-immunoprecipitate with Tat. We also examined the interaction between Tat and SWI/SNF by immunoprecipitating the endogenous INI-1 or BRG-1 complexes using antibodies specific for each protein. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins confirmed that BRG-1 co-immunoprecipitated with INI-1 and vice versa (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Immunoprecipitated complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose beads were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled Tat, washed, and analyzed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. In vitro 35S-labeled Tat efficiently bound to both the BRG-1 and INI-1 complexes, but not to control or PKD-1-coated beads (Fig. 2B, lower panel). INI-1 Synergizes with Tat and the Transcriptional Coactivator p300—Previous studies showed that p300 is a cofactor in the Tat-dependent activation of the HIV LTR (4.Marzio G. Tyagi M. Gutierrez M.I.

https://openalex.org/W2003384075,"Expression of antioxidant and phase 2 xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme genes is regulated through cis-acting sequences known as antioxidant response elements. Transcriptional activation through the antioxidant response elements involves members of the CNC (Cap `n' Collar) family of basic leucine zipper proteins including Nrf1 and Nrf2. Nrf2 activity is regulated by Keap1-mediated compartmentalization in the cell. Given the structural similarities between Nrf1 and Nrf2, we sought to investigate whether Nrf1 activity is regulated similarly to Nrf2. Nrf1 also resides normally in the cytoplasm of cells. Cytoplasmic localization however, is independent of Keap1. Colocalization analysis using green fluorescent protein-tagged Nrf1 and subcellular fractionation of endogenous Nrf1 and fusion proteins indicate that Nrf1 is primarily a membrane-bound protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Membrane targeting is mediated by the N terminus of the Nrf1 protein that contains a predicted transmembrane domain, and deletion of this domain resulted in a predominantly nuclear localization of Nrf1 that significantly increased the activation of reporter gene expression. Treatment with tunicamycin, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer, caused an accumulation of a smaller form of Nrf1 that correlated with detection of Nrf1 in the nucleus by biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescent analysis. These results suggest that Nrf1 is normally targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and that endoplasmic reticulum stress may play a role in modulating Nrf1 function as a transcriptional activator.

Oxidative stress occurs as a result of imbalance between antioxidant defense and the production of reactive oxygen species (1Sies H. Exp.

In mouse, Nrf1 is indispensable for viability during embryonic development (16Chan J.Y. Kwong M. Lu R. Chang J. Wang B. Yen T.S. Kan Y.W.

Expression of ARE-bearing genes was severely impaired in fibroblasts deficient in Nrf1 and Nrf2, resulting in marked sensitivity to oxidative stress. Together, these studies indicate that Nrf1 have overlapping functions with Nrf2 during development and in mediating ARE function in the oxidative stress response. Controlling intracellular localization of transcription factors is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression. Nrf2 function appears to be regulated in part by Keap1-mediated compartmentalization and degradation of Nrf2 in the cell (20Kobayashi M. Yamamoto M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that Nrf2 is maintained as a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor through binding Keap1 via the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 (21Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to oxidative stress inducing stimulus, Nrf2 escapes Keap1-mediated repression and translocates to the nucleus where it activates transcription of target genes. Other studies have also shown that Nrf2 is a short-lived protein, and association with Keap1 promotes the degradation of Nrf2 through ubiquitin-proteosome-mediated pathway (22Cullinan S.B.

More recent studies suggest that Nrf2 may also be regulated through nuclear export mechanism mediated by Keap1 (27Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Nioi P. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32485-32492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 28Velichkova M. Hasson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast to Nrf2, little is known about how Nrf1 function is regulated. Beyond the CNC and bZIP domains, Nrf1 shares other structural similarities with Nrf2. In particular, Nrf1 also contains a Neh2-like domain near its N terminus, but the significance of this homology is not known. In addition, it has not been determined whether Nrf1 activity is also regulated through a mechanism involving differential localization in the cell. In this report, we present data to show that Nrf1 is found largely in the cytoplasm of cells. Although Nrf1 contains a functional Neh2 domain that interacts with Keap1, our results indicate that cytoplasmic localization is mediated through the N terminus region of Nrf1 that contains a putative transmembrane domain spanning amino acids 7-27 of the protein. The N terminus region of Nrf1 containing this hydrophobic transmembrane domain is sufficient to confer localization of a heterologous nuclear protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. Deletion of the Nrf1 transmembrane domain results in nuclear accumulation and strong activation of ARE-containing reporter gene. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress leads to generation of a smaller form of Nrf1 that correlated with nuclear accumulation of Nrf1. We propose that Nrf1 is normally localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and that ER stress may play an important role in regulating Nrf1 function through cleavage of the transmembrane domain. Reagents—Tissue culture media, fetal calf serum, and Lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. PCR primers and oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Biotechnologies (Huntsville, AL).

An antibody against Nrf1 was raised in rabbits using an Nrf1-glutathione transferase fusion protein (Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL). The antibody was affinity-purified using the immunizing protein, and specificity of the antibody was confirmed by immunoblot experiments using lysates from cells transfected with Myc-tagged Nrf1 (data not shown) and lysates from Nrf1 wild type and null fibroblasts. Chemiluminescent detection system for immunoblot (ECL) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitor mix was purchased from Pierce. Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Sigma-Aldrich.

The nuclear stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and all other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell Culture—COS-7, HeLa, NIH-3T3, Hepa1c1c7, and 293 HEK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or α-modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml of each streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were plated at least 8 h before transfection. The cells were harvested 24-48 h after transfection, and cellular extracts were prepared. Plasmids—The Myc-tagged expression vector encoding Nrf1 (pCMVNrf1-Myc) was generated by PCR amplification of the Nrf1 cDNA using the primers GGTCCTGTCGACATGCTTTCT and TGGCGGCCGCTCTCACTTTCTCCGGTCCTTTGG in which a SalI and NotI site were incorporated onto the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, to facilitate cloning and subsequent generation of deletion mutants. The amplified fragment was digested with SalI and NotI and inserted into the SalI and NotI sites of pCMV/Myc/Cyto plasmid (Invitrogen). The 5′ SalI site is downstream from the ATG in the NcoI site that is part of a Kozak consensus sequence in the expression plasmid to facilitate protein expression. The 3′ primer was designed such that the last coding triplet is in-frame to the C-terminal Myc tag. Construction of pCMVNrf1Δ6-Myc, pCMVNrf1Δ30-Myc, and pCMVNrf1Δ86-Myc were generated by PCR amplification using the following 5′ primers: Nrf1-(Δ6), CTGGTCGACTACTTAACGGAAGGAC; Nrf1-(Δ30), CGGTCGACTACCTGACCTCACAGCT; and Nrf1-(Δ86)-GACAGGGTCGACGTGCCAACC. The pCMVNrf1ΔNeh2-Myc was generated by digesting pCMVNrf1-Myc with BglII followed by religation to generate an in-frame deletion of the Neh2 domain in Nrf1 cDNA. M. Freeman at Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN) kindly provided the FLAG-tagged Keap1 expression plasmid. The pCMVNrf1n86/Npc/NLS/Myc was constructed by PCR amplification of Nrf1 (amino acids 1-86) by with TCAACCATGGTTTCTCTGAAGAAA and CACCTGGAAGTCGACCAGGGC in which an NcoI and SalI site were incorporated onto the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, for cloning between the NcoI and SalI sites of pCMV/NPc/NLS/Myc. The CMV-Npc/NLS/Myc vector containing Xenopus laevis nucleoplasmin core linked to the SV-40 large T antigen NLS (amino acid sequence PKKKRKVEDP) that was tagged with Myc was generously provided by T. S. Yen at Veterans Affairs Medical Center (San Francisco, CA). The underlined ATG in the 5′ primer represents the initiator methionine, and the 3′ primer was designed so that the Nrf1 peptide is in-frame with the Npc/NLS/Myc cassette. The construct containing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged Nrf1 was constructed using pEGFP-Nl vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), which allows in-frame fusion to the N terminus of EGFP. PCR amplification of Nrf1 was done using primers CGAATTCTGACCATGGTTTCTCTG and GGCTCACTTTACCGGTTCCTTTGGCTT corresponding to the N- and C-terminal regions of Nrf1 tagged with EcoRI and AgeI sites, respectively. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and AgeI and subcloned into EcoRI and AgeI sites 3′ of the EGFP-coding region of pEGFP-N1. Chimeras consisting of Nrf1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding and VP16 activation domain were generated by PCR amplification of the GAL4 of the Gal4-VP16 insert from a Gal4-VP16 plasmid using GTCGCCGTCGACAAGATGAAGCTACTG and CGCCGCGGCCCGCACCGTACTCGTC in which a SalI and NotI site were incorporated onto the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The amplified Gal4-VP16 insert was digested and cloned into the SalI and NotI sites in pCMV/Myc/Cyto to generate pCMVGal4VP16. The plasmid pCMVNrf1n86Gal4VP16 containing a GAL4 fusion to the C-terminal region of Nrf1 (amino acid residues 1-86) was generated by PCR amplification of the Nrf1 cDNA using the primers TCAACCATGGTTTCTCTGAAGAAA and CTGTTCCAAGTCGACTGGTGAC, and the pCMVNrf1n27Gal4VP16 plasmid containing the putative transmembrane domain of Nrf1 (amino acid residues 1-86) was generated using TCAACCATGGTTTCTCTGAAGAAA and GTAAGTGTCGACGTCCACCCGTAC. NcoI and SalI site were incorporated into the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, for cloning into the NcoI and SalI sites of pCMVGal4VP16. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. An equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) was added to cell lysates and boiled for 5 min. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20), the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the ECL system. Coimmunoprecipitation—Subconfluent 293 cells were transfected with Keap1 and Nrf1 expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 and were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer 48 h after transfection. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C followed by overnight incubation with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies or control (IgG) antibodies. The next day, protein G-Sepharose beads were added followed by a 2-h incubation in the cold. The beads were collected by brief centrifugation and then washed extensively with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The proteins were eluted in 1× SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, followed by immunoblotting with indicated primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Detection of peroxidase signal was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Immunofluorescent Staining and Microscopy—The cells were grown on coverslips, and the plasmids were transfected into cells using the Lipofectamine 2000. Two days after transfection, the coverslips containing the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by three washes with PBS. The cells on slides were permeablized with 0.1% Triton/PBS for 5 min and washed with PBS/Triton and blocked with 10% goat serum at room temperature. The slides were then incubated with 2-μg/ml anti-Myc monoclonal antibody labeled with AlexaFluor 488 using Zenon Mouse IgG-labeling kits according to the suppliers' protocols (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by several washes with PBS, mounted, and visualized with a Nikon epifluorescent microscope. For localization studies, Myctagged Nrf1 was also cotransfected with pcDNA-ER-DsRed (a generous gift from K. Moriishi, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) that expresses calreticulin fused with DsRed protein. Confocal images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 UV Confocal Microscopy system. The images are single confocal slices obtained using a 40× objective, and they are representative of the cell population. Membrane Preparation—The cell membranes were prepared using the Mem-PER mammalian membrane protein extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The solubilized protein mixture was centrifuged in the cold for 5 min to remove cellular debris. The clarified supernatant was then heated to 37 °C for 10 min followed by centrifugation to separate membrane and hydrophilic protein fractions. The top phase containing hydrophilic proteins was separated by micropipetting from the bottom phase containing hydrophobic membrane proteins. The hydrophobic fraction was normalized to the volume of the hydrophilic fraction using Mem-PER reagent B diluted 4-fold with purified water. The fractions were further diluted with diluted Mem-PER reagent B to decrease the detergent concentration and boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and followed by immunoblotting. Subcellular Fractionation—Subconfluent cells from a 150-mm dish were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose and protease inhibitors and homogenized by with syringing through a 23-gauge needle. Homogenates were then subjected to differential centrifugation to obtain a series of pellets and supernates. The cell homogenate was first centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet corresponded to the nuclear fraction (N). The resulting supernatant was then submitted to a centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet corresponded to the mitochondrial fraction (P10) and supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The final pellet corresponded to the fraction enriched with endoplasmic reticulum (P100), and the supernatant is referred to as the cytosolic fraction (S100). Equal proportions of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE and followed by Western blot analysis with indicated antibodies. Reporter Gene Assays—Hepa1c1c7 or COS-7 cells were transfected in 24-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000. The activity of full-length Nrf1 and N-terminal deletion variants were tested by cotransfection with the ARE-Luc plasmid that contains a luciferase reporter gene driven by the human NQO1-ARE (a gift from J. A. Johnson at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin). The activities of Gal4VP16 fusion constructs were tested by cotransfection with pGal4-tk-Luc plasmid, which contains the luciferase reporter driven by four GAL4-binding sites (a gift from Dr. S. Benson at California State University, Hayward, CA). Expression from Renilla luciferase plasmid under the control of a constitutive TK-promoter was used to determine transfection efficiency. After 24 h, the cells were lysed and subjected to the luciferase assay using the dual luciferase reporter system (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) and light units were measured on a TD20/20 Luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA). The assays were done in triplicate, and the data points represent the means ± S.D. from three experiments. Nrf1 Contains a Neh2 Domain—The similarity between Nrf1 and Nrf2 is highest within the CNC-bZIP domain that contains the Cap `n' Collar homology region, as well as the basic DNA-binding and leucine zipper regions. In addition, Nrf1 also contains a region that has significant homology to the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 that has been shown to interact with Keap1 (Fig. 1). This region encompassing amino acids 171-244 of Nrf1 shows 72% homology of the Neh2 domain of Nrf2. In addition, sequence alignment revealed complete conservation in the hydrophobic section and the ETGE motif within the Neh2 domain. These observations suggest that Nrf1 may also interact with Keap1. Nrf1 Interacts with Keap1—To investigate whether Nrf1 could interact with Keap1, coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed. Human kidney 293 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Nrf1 and FLAG-tagged Keap1 expression vectors, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG or control IgG antibody, and Nrf1 was detected by anti-Myc immunoblotting. Using this assay, Nrf1 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Keap1 but not with control rabbit IgG (Fig. 2 and data not shown). To confirm this result, we generated a mutant Nrf1 molecule (Nrf1ΔNeh2; Fig. 3a) in which the region encompassing the putative Neh2 domain (Δ173-286) was deleted and examined its binding with Keap1. As shown in Fig. 2, Nrf1ΔNeh2 did not exhibit binding to Keap1 by coimmunoprecipitation analysis. These data are consistent with the idea that Nrf1 also interacts with Keap1.FIGURE 3The N terminus of Nrf1 is required for cytoplasmic localization. a, schematic diagram of Nrf1 constructs used in immunofluorescence experiments. The full-length 741-amino acid Nrf1 is shown at the top, and the mutants, Nrf1ΔNeh2, Nrf1Δ6, Nrf1Δ30, and Nrf1Δ86, are shown below. The Myc epitope tag is fused to the C terminus of each protein and is not drawn to scale. b, Nrf1 constructs were transiently expressed in NIH-3T3 cells. Localization of the ectopically expressed proteins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence detection of the Myc epitope tag with mouse anti-Myc antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse antibody. The right panels show the same field showing DAPI fluorescence of nuclei. c, percentage of cells showing nuclear or cytoplasmic staining for each case was determined by counting at least 100 transfected cells/sample. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The N Terminus Determines Cytoplasmic Localization of Nrf1—We performed confocal analysis to further examine the localization of Nrf1 in the cell. Because the available antibodies were not of suitable sensitivity to detect endogenous Nrf1 by immunostaining, we examined NIH-3T3 cells transfected with a Myc-tagged full-length Nrf1-expressing construct to assess its subcellular localization (Fig. 3a). Confocal microscopy revealed that the Myc-tagged full-length Nrf1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3b). Treatment with leptomycin B, a drug that inhibits CRM1-mediated nuclear export, failed to cause retention of full-length Nrf1 in the nucleus (data not shown). Thus, cytoplasmic localization of Nrf1 does not appear to be regulated by nuclear export. Next, we examined the localization of the mutant Nrf1 molecule in which the region containing the putative Neh2 domain was deleted (Fig. 3a). Expression of Nrf1ΔNeh2 was also found in the cytoplasm, indicating that cytoplasmic retention is not mediated via this domain (Fig. 3b). Therefore, a series of Myc-tagged deletion mutants of Nrf1 were generated to identify domains in Nrf1 that mediate its localization in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3a). The Nrf1Δ86 construct, that contains a deletion of 86 amino acids from the N terminus of Nrf1 but still retaining the Neh2 domain was localized to the nucleus of cells (Fig. 3, b and c). Smaller deletions were then generated to better delineate the determinants of Nrf1 localization. Truncation of 30 amino acids from the N terminus (Nrf1Δ30) resulted in nuclear localization of Nrf1 (Fig. 3, b and c). However, a truncation of the first 6 amino acids (Nrf1Δ6) did not alter the cytoplasmic localization of Nrf1 (Fig. 3, b and c). Thus, the N-terminal region of Nrf1 encompassing the first 30 amino acids is necessary for cytoplasmic localization of the protein. Similar observations were made in COS-7 and 293 cells, thus excluding potential cell type-specific effects (data not shown). N-terminal Region of Nrf1 Is Sufficient to Confer Cytoplasmic Localization to a Heterologous Protein—To determine whether the N terminus of Nrf1 is sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the cytoplasm of cells, we transfected cells with an expression construct containing the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-86 of Nrf1 fused to the nucleoplasmin protein of X. laevis (Npc) that also contains the SV40 NLS and Myc epitope tag (Fig. 4). Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that the N86-Npc/NLS chimeric protein was localized to the cytoplasm of transfected cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, expression of NPc/NLS was localized to the nucleus as expected. To rule out the possibility that cytoplasmic localization of N86-Npc/NLS was due to export from the nucleus through CRM1-mediated pathways, we examined its distribution in cells treated with the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B (29Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Localization, however, was not affected after treatment with leptomycin B (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the N terminus of Nrf1 is sufficient to confer cytoplasmic localization to a heterologous protein. Nrf1 Is an Integral ER Membrane Protein—Sequence analysis of Nrf1 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/) revealed a potential transmembrane-spanning domain located between amino acid residues 7 and 24 of Nrf1 (Fig. 5a). Secondary structure analysis predicts an amphipathic α-helical structure that has been observed in membrane-associated proteins (30Martoglio B. Dobberstein B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 410-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). When the amino acids were projected on to a helical wheel, hydrophobic residues (Leu, Phe, Ile, and Gly) are found on one face of the helix,"

This switches a receptor from G-protein activation to G-protein desensitization, receptor internalization, and β-arrestin-dependent signal activation. However, the specificity of GRKs for recruiting β-arrestins to specific receptors has not been elucidated. Here we use the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), the archetypal nonvisual heptahelical receptor, as a model to test functional GRK specificity. We monitor endogenous GRK activity with a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay in live cells by measuring kinetics of the interaction between the β2AR and β-arrestins. We show that β2AR phosphorylation is required for high affinity β-arrestin binding, and we use small interfering RNA silencing to show that HEK-293 and U2-OS cells use different subsets of their expressed GRKs to promote β-arrestin recruitment, with significant GRK redundancy evident in both cell types. Surprisingly, the GRK specificity for β-arrestin recruitment does not correlate with that for bulk receptor phosphorylation, indicating that β-arrestin recruitment is specific for a subset of receptor phosphorylations on specific sites. Moreover, multiple members of the GRK family are able to phosphorylate the β2AR and induce β-arrestin recruitment, with their relative contributions largely determined by their relative expression levels.

The two nonvisual arrestins, β-arrestin1 and β-arrestin2, and the ubiquitous nonvisual GRKs, GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, and GRK6, together form an axis of receptor regulation critical to mammalian physiology (1.Pitcher J.A.

The β-arrestin/GRK system was first described as a means of desensitizing receptors (4.Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), but it is now known to mediate receptor internalization (5.Ferguson S.S. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S.

Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The primary switch in these regulatory pathways appears to be the recruitment of β-arrestins to receptors, a process facilitated by GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation, which enhances binding affinity for β-arrestins (7.Gurevich V.V.

These conformational changes regulate the ability of β-arrestin to couple to the endocytic machinery (10.Kim Y.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Indeed, it appears that β-arrestin may adopt functionally distinct conformations depending on specific features of receptor phosphorylation, as siRNA silencing of distinct GRKs has dramatically different effects on receptor internalization and β-arrestin-dependent signaling (11.Ren X.R.

GRKs appear to have low substrate specificity, perhaps to allow the small number of GRKs to regulate the diverse and numerous (more than 800) heptahelical receptors.

To the extent that GRKs may be attractive therapeutic targets (17.Iaccarino G. Koch W.J. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 1999; 8: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), this confounds any mechanistic understanding of the roles of specific GRKs. The β2AR is the archetypal nonvisual heptahelical receptor (18.Collins S. Lohse M.J. O'Dowd B. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Vitam. Horm. 1991; 46: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and has extensively characterized pharmacology and biochemistry (19.Johnson M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: S146-S153Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Indeed, the receptor has been a model for studying β-arrestins and GRKs (4.Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 20.Benovic J.L. Strasser R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, efforts to elucidate the influence of specific GRKs on β2AR function have relied primarily on overexpression. Given the low substrate specificity of GRKs, it is likely that overexpressed GRKs can exhibit compensatory phosphorylation, whereby one GRK can substitute for another GRK for a particular receptor substrate. Thus it has been difficult to ascribe roles for specific GRKs on the β2AR or other receptors. In this study, we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to report the interaction of β2AR and β-arrestins fused to the cyan and yellow variants of the green fluorescent protein (mCFP and mYFP). We reasoned that this assay would elucidate the kinetics of β-arrestin recruitment, which should in turn reflect the activities of endogenous GRKs. In addition, a kinetic assay should be more sensitive to changes in GRK activity than measurements of receptor phosphorylation or β-arrestin recruitment at equilibrium. We set out to validate this approach and then to use the kinetics of β-arrestin recruitment to answer several outstanding questions about GRK regulation of the β2AR. 1) What are the relative contributions of β2AR phosphorylation and β2AR agonist-induced conformational changes for generating affinity for β-arrestin? 2) Is there GRK specificity or redundancy for β-arrestin recruitment for the β2AR? 3) Does GRK specificity for β2AR phosphorylation correlate with GRK specificity for β-arrestin recruitment to the receptor? 4) Do different cell types, with differing GRK expression profiles, use distinct sets of GRKs to promote β-arrestin recruitment? The answers to these questions should illuminate the regulation of the many facets of β-arrestin functions. Materials—Isoproterenol was obtained from Sigma. [125I]Iodocyanopindolol was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. H-89 was obtained from EMD Biosciences. Antiphospho-β2AR (p355/p356) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-β-arrestin (A1CT) is described elsewhere (21.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Plasmids—Rat β-arrestin1 and rat β-arrestin2 were amplified by PCR to encode HindIII and SalI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, with the terminator codon replaced with a sequence encoding a diglycine linker. These products were cut, purified, and ligated into a pcDNA3.1-mYFP vector (22.Violin J.D. Zhang J. Tsien R.Y. Newton A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) to generate β-arrestin1-mYFP and β-arrestin2-mYFP. The β-arrestin-mYFP inserts were then transferred to a pcDNA3.1-zeo vector providing Zeocin resistance. The R169E mutation in β-arrestin1-mYFP was generated by the Quick-Change protocol (Stratagene). Rat β2AR was amplified by PCR to encode a HindIII restriction site, FLAG epitope, and signal peptide sequence at the 5′ end (23.Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

All plasmids were amplified in bacteria, kit purified (Qiagen), and validated by capillary electrophoresis sequencing. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Silencing of Gene Expression—Chemically synthesized double-stranded siRNA duplexes (with 3′ dTdT overhangs) were purchased from Dharmacon for the following targets, as described and validated elsewhere (11.Ren X.R.

A nonsilencing RNA duplex (5′-AAUUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) was used as a control for all siRNA experiments. A second GRK6 sequence (5′-AAGUGAACAGUAGGUUUGUAG-3′) was used to demonstrate that the siRNA effect was target-specific. HEK-293 cells were transfected with Gene Silencer (Gene Therapy Systems), and U2-OS cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to manufacturers' instructions. Silencing was quantified by immunoblotting. Only experiments with verified silencing were used; average silencing for these experiments was as follows: for HEK-293 cells, GRK2 (91%), GRK3 (97%), GRK5 (85%), and GRK6 (96%); for U2-OS cells silencing was GRK2 (94%), GRK3 (99%), and GRK5 (97%); GRK6 was not detected in U2-OS cells. Cell Culture—HEK-293 cells and U2-OS cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Sigma). HEK-293 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science); U2-OS cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All transfections used 3.0 μg of plasmid in a 10-cm tissue culture plate. Cells expressing β2AR-mCFP were selected with 400 ng/ml G418 (Sigma), and colonies of stable transfectants were isolated. A single line of stably transfected cells was chosen as representative based on membrane targeting and isoproterenol-induced internalization of the β2AR-mCFP. Surface expression of β2AR was measured by 125I-cyanopindolol binding as described (24.Shenoy S.K. Drake M.T. Nelson C.D. Houtz D.A. Xiao K. Madabushi S. Reiter E. Premont R.T. Lichtarge O.

Doubly stable cells were generated by transfecting β-arrestin2-mYFP-Zeo selecting single colonies with 150 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). β-Arrestin-mYFP overexpression was assessed by immunoblot and compared with endogenous β-arrestin (supplemental Fig. 1). Imaging—Cells were washed once, placed in imaging buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and imaged in the dark on a stage heated to 37 °C. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) with a Roper Micromax cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics) controlled by SlideBook 4.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). CFP and FRET images were obtained through a 436/20 excitation filter (20 nm band-pass centered at 436 nm), a 455DCLP (dichroic longpass mirror), and separate emission filters (480/30 for CFP and 535/30 for FRET). YFP intensity was imaged through a 500/20 excitation filter, 515LP dichroic mirror, and 535/30 emission filter. All optical filters were obtained from Chroma Technologies. Excitation and emission filters were switched in filter wheels (Lambda 10-2; Sutter). Integration times were varied between 100 and 300 ms to optimize signal and minimize photobleaching. Spectral bleed through was determined by acquiring CFP, FRET, and YFP intensity images of samples expressing CFP only and YFP only and was linear with respect to fluorophore expression. This imaging system exhibits 43% CFP/FRET bleed through and 24% YFP/FRET bleed through. CFP/YFP bleed through was undetectable. FRET intensity corrected for bleed through (FRETc) was defined as FRETc = FRET - 0.43 × CFP - 0.24 × YFP. FRETc for all FRET images was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for localization of FRET. In contrast, all graphs display calculations based on intensity from whole cells or sets of cells. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and adjusted to equal protein concentration by protein assay of a parallel set of cells, as described (25.Ahn S. Shenoy S.K. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35518-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were separated on 10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride membranes for immunoblotting. GRKs were detected with isoformspecific antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology for GRK2 (sc-562), GRK3 (sc-563), GRK5 (sc-565), and GRK6 (sc-566), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescent detection was performed with horseradish peroxidasecoupled secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and SuperSignal West Pico reagent (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was quantified by a charge-coupled device camera (Syngene ChemiGenius2); representative images are shown as inverted grayscale. Receptor Phosphorylation—Three days after transfection, HEK-293 cells plated in 100-mm dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in phosphate-free minimum Eagle's medium containing [32P]Pi (100 μCi/ml; 1 Ci = 37 GBq). The amount of 32Pi in the medium was increased to 200 μCi/ml in the GRK6 siRNA-transfected cells to normalize for a 50% decrease in the uptake found in these cells. After agonist stimulation, the lysate protein concentrations were normalized according to the relative receptor expression. Immunoprecipitation was carried out to determine phosphorylation as described (11.Ren X.R. Reiter E. Ahn S. Kim J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation—3 days after transfection with a FLAG-β2AR plasmid and the different siRNAs, 100-mm plates were incubated in 4.0 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 10 mm HEPES for 1 h at 37 °C and then stimulated. Cells were subjected to cross-linking by dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) from Pierce (26.DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the A1CT polyclonal antibody (1:3,000 dilution), which detects β-arrestin1 and -2 (21.Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J.

Statistics—All statistics were performed with GraphPad Prism 3.02 software. For determining association kinetics, both one-phase and two-phase associations were compared to determine the best fit. For comparison of experimental treatments, one-way analysis of variance was used, with a Bonferroni multiple comparison test as appropriate. In an attempt to elucidate β2AR signal modulation by the arrestin/GRK axis, we chose to use the HEK-293 cell line as a model system. These cells express the four ubiquitously expressed nonvisual GRKs (2.Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 3.Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol.

Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, and 6.Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar) and are readily transfected with either DNA plasmids or siRNA (11.Ren X.R. Reiter E. Ahn S. Kim J. Chen W. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 12.Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1442-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We chose to assay β-arrestin recruitment to the receptor by FRET to quantify both the kinetics and relative amount of β-arrestin recruitment. FRET has been used previously to assay β2AR interaction with β-arrestin2 (27.Krasel C. Bunemann M. Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), as was the similar bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay (28.Azzi M. Charest P.G. Angers S. Rousseau G. Kohout T. Bouvier M. Pineyro G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11406-11411Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Whereas BRET is more simply adapted to plate reader systems than FRET, only FRET is compatible with single cell and imaging assays. We thus generated FRET constructs for an imaging assay, allowing us to evaluate both the subcellular location and single cell kinetics of β-arrestin recruitment. Briefly, the monomeric cyan and yellow variants of the green fluorescent protein (mCFP and mYFP) were fused to the human β2AR and various β-arrestin constructs to generate β2AR-mCFP and β-arrestin-mYFP for coexpression. These constructs interact after addition of the agonist isoproterenol, and a portion of excited state CFP is nonradiatively transferred to YFP, resulting in yellow rather than cyan emission (Fig. 1A). The proportion of energy thus transferred (FRETc, corrected for spectral overlap (29.Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar)) is quantifiable as a percentage of total fluorescence emitted %F, analogous to fractional receptor occupancy as shown in Equation 1, FRET(%F)=100×FRETcCFP+FRETc %F differs from absolute FRET efficiency (%E) only in the absence of a term correcting for hardware-specific differences in the quantum yield of CFP and FRET emission (29.Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In addition, FRET can be imaged after correcting for spectral overlap, allowing localization of the β2AR-β-arrestin interaction (Fig. 1B). At higher resolution, this method of FRET imaging discriminates between β2AR-mCFP bound to β-arrestin-mYFP at the plasma membrane and internalized vesicular β2AR-mCFP, which has lost the association with β-arrestin-mYFP (supplemental Fig. 2). When FRET is measured for a field of cells, the kinetics of this interaction are monoexponential and rapidly reversed with addition of the antagonist propranolol (Fig. 1C). We tested the kinetics of recruitment in cells stably transfected with β2AR-mCFP and transiently transfected with β-arrestin2-mYFP. These cells express constant amounts of β2AR-mCFP (1 pmol/mg protein; data not shown) and varying amounts of β-arrestin2-mYFP. We used transiently transfected cells, for which single cell overexpression is highly variable, to assess the effects of β-arrestin expression on the β-arrestin-β2AR interaction. We found that in cells with low to moderate expression of β-arrestin-mYFP, as measured by single cell YFP fluorescence, isoproterenol-induced recruitment is monoexponential (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, higher β-arrestin2-mYFP expression yielded increased recruitment, as measured by maximum fractional FRET. In contrast, in cells with high expression of β-arrestin2-mYFP, recruitment is biphasic, exhibiting a rapid association (less than 5 s half-time) as well as the slow association seen with low expression. At all levels of β-arrestin2-mYFP expression, the slow rate was the same (t½ = 2.5 ±0.2 min, n = 15), with no correlation between β-arrestin2-mYFP expression and t½ (R2 = 0.18). This is consistent with a bimolecular interaction dependent on a single rate-limiting activity. Presumably, this limit is set by the rate of receptor phosphorylation by GRKs. To test this, we transiently expressed β-arrestin2-mYFP with either wild-type β2AR-mCFP or with a nonphosphorylatable mutant β2AR-mCFP (GRK-/PKA-) (30.Seibold A. Williams B. Huang Z.F. Friedman J. Moore R.H. Knoll B.J. Clark R.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1162-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As expected, the nonphosphorylatable receptor exhibits very low agonist-induced FRET (Fig. 2B). For this experiment, β-arrestin was highly expressed, and wild-type and GRK-/PKA-receptor recruited similar amounts of rapidly associating β-arrestin. The defect in GRK-/PKA-receptor is thus only in the slow phase of β-arrestin recruitment. This is consistent with conformation-dependent rapid association and phosphorylation-dependent slow association of β-arrestin2 with the β2AR. Indeed, as shown below, GRK activity influences only the slow phase of β-arrestin recruitment. We next established the relative affinities (kF) of these two states (agonist-induced conformation and the phosphorylated state) for β-arrestin2-mYFP by fitting the amplitude of slow and fast FRET changes with varying amounts of β-arrestin2-mYFP expression to a saturable binding model (Fig. 2C) shown in Equation 2, FRET(%F)=%Fmax·YFPYFP+KFRET It was not possible to accurately measure the relative affinity of the rapid, phosphorylation-independent component because the extremely high expression levels of β-arrestin2-mYFP necessary to saturate this component lead to YFP aggregation and altered receptor trafficking (data not shown). However, it is apparent from the data that the affinity of β-arrestin2-mYFP for the agonist-occupied phosphorylated receptor is at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than for the agonist occupied receptor prior to phosphorylation. These results suggest that β-arrestin2 recruitment kinetics can be used to assess both agonist-induced receptor conformation and agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation. β-Arrestin1 is reported to be less effective than β-arrestin2 for β2AR internalization (31.Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar), so we compared the kinetics and relative binding affinity of β-arrestin1-mYFP and β-arrestin2-mYFP. In addition, we tested the “phosphorylation-independent” mutant β-arrestin1-mYFP R169E (32.Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This mutant exhibits a disrupted “polar core,” which consists of closely aligned amino acid side chains of opposite charge. The R169E mutation mimics the disruption of this region that is thought to occur upon β-arrestin binding phosphorylated receptor, leading to a conformational change with higher affinity for receptor and several β-arrestin-scaffolded proteins (7.Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 105-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We found that β-arrestin1-mYFP is recruited with a slow rate similar to β-arrestin2-mYFP but with a lower affinity (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin1-mYFP (R169E) displays more pronounced biphasic association, with a much larger rapid association than β-arrestin1-mYFP or β-arrestin2-mYFP at equivalent expression levels. However, there is also a large slow component of β-arrestin1-mYFP (R169E) recruitment, most likely signifying a phosphorylation-dependent affinity. Interestingly, the relative affinity of this mutant is similar to that of β-arrestin2-mYFP. Together, these results suggest that β-arrestin2 binds the β2AR with higher affinity than β-arrestin1, but with similar kinetics, limited by the rate of receptor phosphorylation. Phosphorylation-independent β-arrestin1-mYFP (R169E) appears in this assay to be partially phosphorylation-independent, with an enhanced affinity contributed by the agonist-induced, unphosphorylated receptor. We next set out to address the roles of individual GRKs in regulating β-arrestin recruitment. To minimize variability in our β-arrestin recruitment assay, we generated cell lines stably expressing either β-arrestin1-mYFP, β-arrestin2-mYFP, or β-arrestin1-mYFP (R169E) in addition to β2AR-mCFP. Based on the findings above, these cell lines allow us to test the GRK requirements for both slow, phosphorylation-dependent, and rapid, phosphorylation-independent, β-arrestin recruitment. These cell lines each express 8-30-fold β-arrestin-mYFP over endogenous β-arrestin as shown by immunoblot (supplemental Fig. 1); however, because the phosphorylation-dependent phase of the β-arrestin-β2AR interaction is independent of β-arrestin expression (F"

These channels are composed of three homologous subunits, termed α, β, and γ, which have intracellular amino and carboxyl termini and two membrane-spanning domains connected by large extracellular loops. Maturation of ENaC subunits involves furin-dependent cleavage of the extracellular loops at two sites within the α subunit and at a single site within the γ subunit. The α subunits must be cleaved twice, immediately following Arg-205 and Arg-231, in order for channels to be fully active. Channels lacking α subunit cleavage are inactive with a very low open probability. In contrast, channels lacking both α subunit cleavage and the tract αAsp-206-Arg-231 are active when expressed in oocytes, suggesting that αAsp-206-Arg-231 functions as an inhibitor that stabilizes the channel in the closed conformation. A synthetic 26-mer peptide (α-26), corresponding to αAsp-206-Arg-231, reversibly inhibits wild-type mouse ENaCs expressed in Xenopus oocytes, as well as endogenous Na+ channels expressed in either a mouse collecting duct cell line or primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells. The IC50 for amiloride block of ENaC was not affected by the presence of α-26, indicating that α-26 does not bind to or interact with the amiloride binding site. Substitution of Arg residues within α-26 with Glu, or substitution of Pro residues with Ala, significantly reduced the efficacy of α-26.

In airway epithelia, ENaC has an important role in regulating the volume of airway surface liquids and mucociliary clearance.

Maturation of ENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes, Chinese hamster ovarycells, and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells involves furin-dependent proteolysis at two sites within the α subunit (after Arg-205 and Arg-231) and at a single site within the γ subunit (after Arg-143) (17Hughey R.P.

Proteolytic processing of ENaC likely occurs within the biosynthetic pathway as well as at the cell surface.

We recently reported that α subunits lacking either one or both cleavage sites exhibited a marked enhancement of the Na+ self-inhibition response, suggesting that α subunits must be cleaved at both furin consensus sites in order to activate the channel (28Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We now report that ENaCs with mutant α subunits lacking either one or both furin cleavage sites exhibited markedly reduced activity, confirming that cleavage at a single furin site in the α subunit was not sufficient to activate ENaC. A mutant lacking both furin cleavage sites at Arg-205 and Arg-231, as well as the intervening tract Asp-206-Arg-231 within the α subunit that is presumably excised following furin cleavage, was active when expressed in oocytes, suggesting that proteolytic processing of the α subunit releases a 26-mer fragment that is inhibitory within non-cleaved channels. Addition of a synthetic version of this 26-mer fragment (α-26) to the solution bathing Xenopus oocytes expressing ENaCs, or to the apical solution bathing monolayers of either a mammalian collecting duct cell line (mpkCCDc14) or primary cultures of human airway epithelial (HAE) cells, inhibited Na+ current in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that multiple proteolytic cleavage events within the α subunit are required to activate ENaC and that proteolytic activation of ENaC likely results through release of the inhibitory 26-mer peptide. Oocyte Expression— cRNAs for α, β, and γ mouse ENaC (wild-type and mutant) subunits and mouse prostasin were synthesized with T3 or T7 mMessage mMachine™ (Ambion, Austin, TX).

Peptides—Peptides were synthesized and purified by the Peptide Synthesis Facility of the Molecular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh or by GenScript Corporation. The sequences of the peptides were: α-26, DLRGALPHPLQRLRTPPPPNPARSAR; scrambled α-26 (SCR), PLTQPRPRLADHNPLSARRRPLPAGP; P/A (α-26 with all Pro substituted with Ala), DLRGALAHALQRLRTAAAANAARSAR; R/E (α-26 with all Arg substituted with Glu), DLEGALPHPLQELETPPPPNPAESAE. Peptides were amino-terminal acetylated and carboxyl-terminal amidated. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) was performed as previously described (29Carattino M.D. Hill W.G.

The extracellular solution (TEV solution) was (in mm): 110 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.54 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, or otherwise as indicated. The ENaC-mediated component of the whole cell Na+ current was determined by bath perfusion with TEV solution supplemented with 10 μm amiloride. ENaC-mediated whole cell Na+ currents, at -60 mV, were defined as the amiloride-sensitive component of the current. Experiments with oocytes co-expressing ENaC and prostasin and the corresponding controls were performed in the presence of aprotinin (1 μm) to impede any potential degradation of α-26 by prostasin. mpkCCDc14 Cell Culture—mpkCCDc14 cells were grown as previously reported (30Bens M.

At least 24 h prior to the experiments, the culture medium was replaced with a minimal medium (without drugs or hormones) that contained only Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12. Primary Cultures of HAE Cells—HAE cells were obtained from excess pathological tissue remaining after lung transplantation or from organ donor lungs deemed not suitable for transplantation under a protocol approved by the University of Pittsburgh Investigational Review Board. All cells were isolated from second through sixth generation bronchi and grown on permeable Transwell supports (Corning Inc.) as previously described (31Devor D.C. Pilewski J.M. Am. J.

Short Circuit Current Measurements—Cell culture inserts were mounted in modified Ussing chambers (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and the monolayers were continuously short-circuited with a voltage/current clamp system (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). A 2-mV bipolar pulse was applied periodically to measure the resistance of the monolayer. As previously described by Bridges et al. (32Bridges R.J. Newton B.B. Pilewski J.M. Devor D.C. Poll C.T. Hall R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L16-L23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the bath solution contained (in mm) 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 3.3 KH2PO4, 0.8 K2HPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, and 10 glucose. The pH of this solution was 7.4 when gassed with a mixture of 95% O2-5% CO2 at 37 °C. Single Channel Studies—Bath and pipette solutions contained (in mm) 110 LiCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 KCl, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4. Experiments were performed as previously described (33Carattino M.D. Sheng S.

Single channel currents were recorded in the cell-attached configuration of patch clamp, acquired at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz by a 4-pole low pass Bessel filter. Single channel currents were further filtered at 100-200 Hz with a Gaussian filter for display and analysis. Recordings were performed at an applied pipette potential of +60 mV. Western Blot—ENaC was immunoprecipitated from extracts of transiently transfected MDCK cells with goat anti-V5 antibody conjugated to agarose from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) and immunoblotted for the α subunit with mouse anti-V5 monoclonal antibody from Invitrogen as previously described (17Hughey R.P.

Data and Statistical Analyses—IC50 and mean time of inhibition are expressed as the mean with a 95% confidence interval (CI); otherwise, data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n), where “n” equals the number of independent experiments analyzed. IC50 was estimated from normalized currents plotted as a function of the peptide concentration fitted, as shown in Equation 1 y=t/(1+10(logX−logIC50))(Eq. 1) where y is the response variable, X is the concentration of peptide, and IC50 is the concentration of peptide that provokes a response half way between the baseline (t) and maximum response. The time course of inhibition in oocytes was estimated with the Equation 2, which described an exponential decay from a plateau y=m+(p−m)e(−k(T−T0))(Eq. 2) where y is the response variable, p and m are the plateau and maximal responses, k is the rate constant, T0 is the beginning of exponential decay, and T is time. For statistical analyses the normality and equality of the standard deviations of the data were tested. Based on these results a parametric or a nonparametric test was used. Fitting and statistical comparisons were performed with Sigmaplot 8.02 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and GraphPad 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The Lack of Furin Cleavage Destabilizes the Open State of ENaC—We previously reported that the α subunit of ENaC is cleaved twice, immediately following two furin consensus cleavage sites, at Arg-205 and Arg-231 (18Hughey R.P.

The introduction of Ala mutations at all three Arg in the α subunit (αR205A,R208A,R231A (αRtripleA)) prevented α subunit cleavage and significantly reduced the expression of ENaC whole cell currents in Xenopus oocytes (18Hughey R.P.

Whole cell currents measured in oocytes expressing wild-type or furin-insensitive mutant channels (αRtripleAβγ) increased to similar levels in response to external trypsin, suggesting that ENaC subunit proteolysis increases channel open probability rather than channel number (18Hughey R.P.

At the single channel level we confirmed that mutantαRtripleA had a markedly reduced open probability in the presence of a high external [Na+] (28Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P.

Physiol. 2005; 288: L813-L819Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have shown that a subpopulation of ENaCs with a low open probability and brief mean open times are converted by external trypsin or elastase to channels that have characteristic long open and closed times. Previous studies have shown that ENaC gating is modulated, in part, via a regulatory domain that has been localized to the region preceding the second membrane-spanning (pre-M2) domain (5Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen.

Channels with a specific mutation at a key site (the degenerin site) within the pre-M2 region of the β subunit (βS518K) have a very high open probability (35Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J.

Zhang H. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10085-10092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas channels that lack proteolysis of the α subunit have a very low open probability (28Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We used these mutants to examine whether the lack of proteolysis, or the introduction of a mutation at the degenerin site, exerted a dominant effect on ENaC activity when expressed in oocytes. Oocytes were co-injected with either (i) wild-type αβγ, (ii) wild-type β with α (αRtripleA) and γ (γR143A) subunits carrying mutations in the furin cleavage sites, (iii) wild-type α and γ with a β subunit degenerin mutation (βS518K), or (iv) three mutant subunits (αRtripleAβS518KγR143A). We found that oocytes expressing αRtripleAβS518KγR143A exhibited whole cell Na+ currents that were similar in magnitude to currents measured in oocytes expressing wild-type αβγ (p > 0.05). These currents were significantly greater than the currents measured in oocytes expressing αRtripleAβγR143A (p < 0.001) and significantly less than currents measured in oocytes expressing αβS518Kγ (p <0.05, n = 24-26) (Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric ANOVA) followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test) (Fig. 1A). At the single channel level, αRtripleAβS518KγR143A channels had a single channel conductance of 6.2 ± 0.1 pS (n = 5-6) similar to what we described previously for wild-type αβγ (33Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4393-4401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, analysis of αRtripleAβS518KγR143A at a single channel level showed frequent short openings and closures (Fig. 1C), whereas the αβS518Kγ mutant had a high open probability with long openings and brief closures (Fig. 1B). These data provide additional evidence in support of a major role for proteolytic processing of ENaC extracellular domains in the regulation of channel gating. Proteolytic Activation of ENaC Requires Cleavage at Multiple Sites within the α Subunit—As there are two furin cleavage sites within the α subunit, we examined whether the presence of a single furin cleavage site was sufficient for activation of ENaC. Xenopus oocytes expressing ENaCs with mutations at the proximal (αR205Aβγ), distal (αR231Aβγ), or at both furin cleavages sites (αR205A/R208A/R231Aβγ (αRtripleA)) exhibited significantly reduced amiloride-sensitive currents when compared with oocytes expressing wild-type channels (Fig. 2A). Subsequent treatment of these oocytes expressing either wild-type or mutant ENaCs with trypsin (2 μg/ml) increased amiloride-sensitive currents to similar levels (Fig. 2A), suggesting that similar numbers of channels were present on the plasma membrane in each case. These data support our previous finding that the α subunit must be cleaved twice during ENaC maturation for channels to exhibit normal activity (28Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which proteolysis increases ENaC open probability has not been elucidated. It is possible that non-cleaved subunits have an overall constrained structure that increases residency time in the closed state and/or reduces residency time in the open state. Alternatively, as the α subunit must be cleaved twice during ENaC maturation for channels to exhibit normal activity, the tract between both putative furin cleavages sites might be functioning as an inhibitor that acts by stabilizing the closed conformation of the channel. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we deleted the tract of amino acids that are putatively excised from the α subunit following furin processing (Asp-206-Arg-231). This mutant (αΔ206-231) still contains the first furin consensus site after Arg-205 and should be cleaved once. In addition, we generated an α subunit mutant with both the R205A mutation and deletion of the tract Asp-206-Arg-231 (R205A,Δ206-231) that should lack furin-dependent processing. ENaC currents were not significantly affected by the Δ206-231 mutation in the α subunit (p > 0.05) and were even modestly increased in the absence of α subunit furin cleavage (αR205A,Δ206-231 mutant) versus wild-type αβγ (p < .005, Kruskal-Wallis test (nonparametric ANOVA) followed by Dunn's multiple comparisons test). When co-expressed in MDCK cells with β and γ subunits, αΔ206-231 migrated slightly faster on SDS gels than wild-type α subunit as expected with the deletion of 26 amino acid residues (Fig. 2C), whereas both wild-type αβγ and αΔ206-231βγ exhibited evidence of α subunit cleavage (i.e. appearance of a carboxyl-terminal polypeptide of 65 kDa) consistent with previously described furin-dependent processing (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In contrast, no evidence of α subunit cleavage was observed when αR205A,Δ206-231βγ was expressed in MDCK cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, in channels lacking the α subunit tract Asp-206-Arg-231, proteolytic processing by furin is not required to activate the channel, indicating that this tract may function as an inhibitor that stabilizes the channel in the closed conformation. Our data suggest that a double cleavage event is required to dissociate a putative blocker (tract αAsp-206-Arg-231) from the channel. In the absence of this tract, the α subunit does not need to be cleaved for the channel to display normal activity. ENaC Is Inhibited by a Short Peptide Derived from Its Proteolytic Processing—As consequence of proteolytic processing of the α subunit, a peptide of 26 residues, corresponding to Asp-206-Arg-231, is predicted to be cleaved from the α subunit. We synthesized this 26-mer peptide (α-26) and examined whether it altered channel activity. Wild-type αβγ expressed in oocytes were inhibited by α-26 with an IC50 of 2.8 × 10-6 m (CI, 2.5 to 3.2 × 10-6 m) (Fig. 3A), but not by a control peptide with the sequence scrambled (Fig. 3B, SCR). IC50s determined at holding potentials of -20, -60, and -100 mV were 2.9 × 10-6 m (CI, 2.5 to 3.3 × 10-6 m), 2.8 × 10-6 m (CI, 2.5 to 3.2 × 10-6 m) and 2.9 × 10-6 m (CI, 2.6 to 3.4 × 10-6 m), respectively, indicating that the block of ENaC was not voltage dependent. The time required for 1 μm α-26 to achieve half maximal inhibition was 42 s (CI, 36.8-48.8 s) (Fig. 3C), suggesting that α-26 has a slow association rate when compared with amiloride, a prototypic voltage-dependent channel blocker that achieves half maximal inhibition within seconds (37Kleyman T.R. Cragoe Jr. E.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 105: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). α-26 was a reversible inhibitor of the channel (Fig. 3D). The IC50 for amiloride block of ENaC was not affected by the presence of α-26. The amiloride IC50 was 152 nm (CI, 116-198 nm) in the presence of 2.5 μm α-26 and 150 nm (CI, 136-165 nm) in the absence of peptide (Fig. 3E), suggesting that α-26 does not bind to or interact with the amiloride binding site. α-26 is rich in Pro and Arg residues. Substitution of all Pro with Ala, or alternatively all Arg with Glu, led to a significant reduction in the block of ENaC by 10 μm peptide (Fig. 3B). Channels that lack furin-dependent cleavage of the α subunit (αRtripleAβγ), as well as channels lacking both furin-dependent cleavage of the α subunit and the tract αAsp-206-Arg-231 (i.e. αR205A,Δ206-231βγ) were not blocked by 1 μm α-26 (Fig. 3F), indicating that the peptide does not have access to its effector binding site within the channel in the absence of α subunit cleavage. Single channel analyses using a patch pipette backfilled with α-26 (10 μm) demonstrated a reduction in the product of the number of channels and open probability (NPo) compared with controls (Fig. 4). For experiments performed with α-26, the tip of the pipette was filled with standard patch solution. Pipette resistances were similar in control (7.8 ± 0.4 mΩ) and α-26-treated patches (6.9 ± 0.6 mΩ) (p = 0.30, unpaired t test). Control patches that did not contain α-26 in the pipette remained active over the recording period (Fig. 4B). Unitary currents, at an applied pipette potential of +60 mV, were similar in both control (0.42 ± 0.2 pA, n = 5) and α-26-containing patches (0.39 ± 0.2 pA, n = 7) (p = 0.32, unpaired t test). Fig. 4C shows a representative tracing recorded with α-26 in the pipette. At the beginning of the experiment open times were similar to that observed in controls (Fig. 4B). Over the course of the experiment openings decreased and were shorter in duration compared with control until channels were fully closed. Assuming no changes in the number of channels during the recording, the changes observed in NPo due to the presence of α-26 in the pipette largely reflect a change in channel Po. Endogenous ENaCs Are Inhibited by α-26—We examined whether α-26 inhibited endogenous channels expressed in a primary culture of HAE cells and in a cell line derived from mouse CCDs (mpkCCDc14) by monitoring the effects of α-26 on the amiloride-sensitive component of the short circuit current (Isc).α-26 inhibited Isc in HAE (Fig. 5, A, C, and E) and mpkCCDc14 (Fig. 5, B, D, and F) monolayers with IC50s of 4.6 × 10-5 m (CI, 4.2 to 4.9 × 10-5 m) and 1.0 × 10-4 m (CI, 9.2 to 1.1 × 10-4 m), respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). The scrambled α-26 peptide (50 μm) did not inhibit Isc measured in HAE or in mpkCCDc14 monolayers (Figs. 5, C-F). Prostasin Reduces the Efficacy of α-26—The differences in the IC50s of α-26 for ENaCs expressed in oocytes versus HAE and mpkCCDc14 monolayers may represent differential proteolytic processing of ENaC subunits. ENaC is cleaved and activated by furin in Xenopus oocytes and MDCK and Chinese hamster ovary cells (18Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q. Carattino M.D. Johnson J.P. Stockand J.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18111-18114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), whereas other serine proteases, in addition to furin, are likely involved in the proteolytic processing and activation of ENaC in other mammalian epithelial cells (32Bridges R.J. Newton B.B. Pilewski J.M. Devor D.C. Poll C.T. Hall R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L16-L23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Pfister C. Bens M. Farman N. Courtois-Coutry N. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Hummler E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms for ENaC activation by proteases other than furin are unknown. Kunitz-type protease inhibitors that do not block furin activity reduced amiloride-sensitive currents in some cultured epithelial cells (20Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 32Bridges R.J. Newton B.B. Pilewski J.M. Devor D.C. Poll C.T. Hall R.L. Am. J.

Nephrol. 2000; 11: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prostasin is a serine protease that is blocked by Kunitz-type protease inhibitors and activates ENaC when co-expressed in oocytes (20Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). cRNAs for wild-type ENaC subunits (0.5 ng/subunit) were co-injected with or without prostasin cRNA (1 ng). Co-expression of prostasin and ENaC in oocytes led to an increase in amiloride-sensitive currents (-9.6 ± 1.3 μA, n = 28) compared with oocytes expressing wild-type ENaC alone (-5.3 ± 0.6 μA, n = 26) (p < 0.005, unpaired t test with Welch correction). Interestingly, co-expression of prostasin and ENaC significantly reduced the efficacy of α-26-dependent inhibition of ENaC (Fig. 5G). Proteolytic processing of ENaC subunits has a key role in the regulation of channel gating. Caldwell et al. showed that ENaCs with a low Po and brief mean open times were converted by external trypsin or elastase to channels that had characteristically long open and closed times on the order of seconds (25Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 26Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: L813-L819Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have shown that channels with non-cleaved α subunits, or with α subunits with a mutation of even a single furin cleavage site, have significantly reduced activity (Fig. 2 and Ref. 28Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that reflects enhanced inhibition of the channel by external Na+ (28Sheng S. Carattino M.D. Bruns J.B. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1488-F1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The degenerin mutation (αS518K) and the furin site mutations (αRtripleA and γR143A) exert opposing effects on ENaC gating. Channels with both mutations (i.e. αRtripleAβS518KγR143A) flicker between open and closed states (Fig. 1), suggesting that the tract αAsp-206-Arg-231 influences channel gating, at least in part, by destabilizing the open conformation of ENaC or stabilizing the closed conformation. Channels that lacked both α subunit furin cleavage sites as well as the tract between these sites (αR205A,ΔAsp206-Arg231) exhibited activity similar to wild type, suggesting that the tract αAsp-206-Arg-231 is a channel blocker. The corresponding synthetic peptide α-26 inhibited wild-type ENaCs in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner, whereas channels with mutations that prevent cleavage of the α subunit were not blocked by α-26, indicating that the binding site for α-26 is exposed by furin cleavage. Higher concentrations of α-26 were required to block channels co-expressed in oocytes with prostasin or channels expressed in HAE or mpkCCDc14 cells. These results suggest that differential proteolytic processing of ENaC subunits has an important role in determining the efficacy of α-26 as a channel blocker. Substitution of Arg residues within theα peptide with Glu, or substitution of Pro residues with Ala, significantly reduced the affinity of block by α-26, indicating that electrostatic interactions and structural constraints have important roles in α-26 interaction with ENaC. The IC50 of amiloride was not altered in the presence of α-26. Amiloride is proposed to bind to ENaC at a site adjacent to and including the selectivity filter of the channel (2Schild L.

These results suggest that amiloride and α-26 bind at different sites within ENaC. ENaCs have a key role in the regulation of urinary Na+ reabsorption, extracellular fluid volume homeostasis, and control of blood pressure (6Stockand J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F559-F576Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 7Eaton D.C. Malik B. Saxena N.C. Al-Khalili O.K. Yue G. J. Membr.

Kidney Blood Press Res. 1998; 21: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Increased ENaC-dependent Na+ transport across airway epithelia is thought to contribute to the poor mucociliary clearance observed in cystic fibrosis (43Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the mouse ENaC β subunit in mouse airway produced a phenotype similar to cystic fibrosis with airway surface liquid volume depletion, mucus obstruction, goblet cell metaplasia, neutrophil inflammation, and poor bacterial clearance (43Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that inhibition of airway ENaC activity may be of therapeutic benefit in cystic fibrosis. Amiloride is a relative high affinity ENaC inhibitor and is used clinically as a pharmacologic inhibitor of renal Na+ channels and a potassium-sparing diuretic. Inhaled amiloride is rapidly cleared from airways and has been ineffective in the treatment of cystic fibrosis lung disease (16Boucher R.C. Eur. Respir. J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 44Hirsh A.J. Sabater J.R. Zamurs A. Smith R.T. Paradiso A.M. Hopkins S. Abraham W.M. Boucher R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 311: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although α-26 is a relatively low affinity blocker of ENaC in HAE cells, analysis of α-26 derivatives may provide a basis to design higher affinity blockers of ENaC that could provide an alternative to amiloride and related compounds as inhibitors of airway Na+ channels. The mpkCCDc14 cells were a gift from Alain Vandewalle (Paris, France)."

The RNA-binding protein HuR associates with the p53 mRNA, as reported previously, and with the NPM mRNA, computationally predicted to be a target of HuR. Here, we show that HuR binds the NPM and p53 3′-untranslated regions and stabilizes these mRNAs in polyamine-depleted intestinal epithelial cells. Depletion of cellular polyamines by inhibiting ornithine decarboxylase with α-difluoromethylornithine dramatically enhanced the cytoplasmic abundance of HuR, whereas ectopic ornithine decarboxylase overexpression decreased cytoplasmic HuR; neither intervention changed whole-cell HuR levels. HuR was found to specifically bind the 3′-untranslated regions of NPN and p53 mRNAs. HuR silencing rendered the NPM and p53 mRNAs unstable and prevented increases in NPM and p53 mRNA and protein in polyamine-deficient cells. These results indicate that polyamines modulate cytoplasmic HuR levels in intestinal epithelial cells, in turn controlling the stability of the NPM and p53 mRNAs and influencing NPM and p53 protein levels.

The mammalian intestinal epithelium is a rapidly self-renewing tissue in the body, and its homeostasis is preserved through strict regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, growth arrest, and apoptosis (1Johnson L.R.

However, the exact mechanisms whereby polyamine depletion stabilizes NPM and p53 mRNAs remain elusive. Although gene expression is crucially modulated by transcription, the essential contribution of posttranscriptional events, such as mRNA processing, transport, turnover, and translation, is becoming increasingly recognized. In particular, altered mRNA turnover is shown to play a critical role in the activation of specific genes during the cellular response to mitogens, immunological triggers, stressful stimuli, and differentiation agents (16Bashirullah A.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). mRNA turnover is primarily controlled through the association of RNA-binding proteins that bind to specific RNA sequences and either increase or decrease the transcript half-life and thus alters the profiles of expressed gene products (18Gorospe M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 412-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The best characterized cis-acting elements of mRNA turnover are U- and AU-rich elements located in the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of many labile mRNAs, such as those of certain protooncogenes, cytokines, and cell cycle regulatory proteins (19Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The RNA-binding protein HuR prominently regulates gene expression through binding to mRNAs, which typically bear one or several hits of a recently described RNA motif (45Lopez de Silanes I.L. Zhan M. Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) that resembles an AU-rich element. Upon binding to a target mRNA, HuR has been shown to stabilize it, alter its translation, or perform both functions (18Gorospe M.

Although the precise processes regulating HuR function remain to be fully understood, its subcellular localization is intimately linked to its effects upon target transcripts. We (12Li L. Rao J.N.

Given the affinity of HuR for the p53 mRNA (21Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. de Slianes I.L. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S.

The data presented herein demonstrate that a decrease in the levels of cellular polyamines induced the cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR, whereas increasing cellular polyamines enhanced its nuclear concentration. Furthermore, the increased stabilization of NPM and p53 mRNAs was found to be functionally linked to the interaction of their 3′-UTRs with cytoplasmic HuR following polyamine depletion.

Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. ODC-overexpressing IEC-6 (ODC-IEC) cells were developed as described (25Liu L. Guo X. Rao J.N. Zou T. Marasa B.S. Chen J. Greenspon J. Casero Jr., R.A. Wang J.-Y. Biochem. J. 2006; 10 (1042/BJ 20060217)Google Scholar) and expressed a more stable ODC variant with full enzyme activity (26Ghoda L. van Daalen-Wetters T. Macrae M. Ascherman D. Coffino P. Science. 1989; 243: 1493-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). RNA Interference—The silencing RNA duplexes used (5′-AACACGCTGAACGGCTTGAGG-3′ (targeting HuR) and 5′-AAGTGTAGTAGATCACCAGGC-3′ (control small interfering RNA (siRNA)) were transfected with Lipofectamine (20 nm final siRNA) and harvested for analysis 48 h later. Assays for ODC Enzyme Activity and Cellular Polyamines—ODC activity was determined by measuring the amount of 14CO2 liberated from dl-[1-14C]ornithine (Sigma), as described (13Liu L. Li L. Rao N.J. Zou T. Zhang H.M. Boneva D. Bernard M.S. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C89-C99Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cellular polyamine content was analyzed as described previously (9Patel A.R. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1020-C1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Li L. Li J. Rao J.N. Li M.L. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C946-C954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Whole-cell lysates were prepared using 2% SDS, sonicated, and centrifuged (12,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were boiled for 5 min and size-fractionated (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1990; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide). After transferring proteins onto nitrocellulose filters, the blots were incubated with primary antibodies recognizing ODC, HuR, NPM, or p53 proteins; following incubations with secondary antibodies, immunocomplexes were developed by using chemiluminescence. RT-PCR and Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and used in reverse transcription and PCR amplification reactions as described (14Zou T. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Keledjian K.M. Zhang A.H. Lan X. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C686-C696Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Guo X. Rao J.N. Liu L. Zou T. Keledjian K.M. Boneva D. Marasa B.S. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G1159-G1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PCR primers for NPM were 5′-CGATGGACATGGACATGAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCCTCTACAGCTACTAGGT-3′ (antisense), yielding a 238-bp fragment (14Zou T. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Keledjian K.M. Zhang A.H. Lan X. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C686-C696Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primers for p53 were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN) and yielded a 397-bp fragment. The levels of β-actin PCR product were assessed to monitor the even RNA input in RT-PCR samples. Real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) was performed using an Applied Biosystems instrument (Foster City, CA) using specific primers, probes, and software (Applied Biosystems). The levels of NPM and p53 mRNAs were quantified by Q-PCR analysis and normalized glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels. Preparation of Synthetic RNA Transcripts—Complementary DNA from IEC-6 cells was used as a template for PCR amplification of the coding region (CR) and 3′-UTR of NPM and p53. The 5′ primers contained the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence (T7): 5′-CCAAGCTTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA-3′. To prepare the CR of NPM (positions 97-790), oligonucleotides (T7)5′-ATGGAAGATTCGATGGACATGGACATG-3′ and 5′-CCTGTTTCTTGAAGGATTCT-3′ were used. To prepare the NPM 3′-UTR template (spanning positions 771-1300), oligonucleotides (T7)5′-AGAATCCTTCAAGAAACAG-3′ and 5′-TACTTTATTAAAATACTGAG-3′ were used. To prepare the CR of p53 (positions 252-1439), oligonucleotides (T7)5′-ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGC-3′ and 5′-AGAATGTCAGTCTGAGTCAGGC-3′ were used. To prepare the p53 3′-UTR template (positions 1421-2629), oligonucleotides (T7)5′-TGACTCAGACTGACATTCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TGGCAGCAAAGTTTTATTGTAAAATAAGAGATCG-3′ were used. PCR-amplified products were used as templates to transcribe biotinylated RNAs by using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of biotin-cytidine 5′-triphosphate as described (21Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. de Slianes I.L. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). RNA-Protein Binding Assays—For biotin pull-down assays, biotinylated transcripts (6 μg) were incubated with 120 μg of cytoplasmic lysate for 30 min at room temperature. Complexes were isolated with paramagnetic streptavidin-conjugated Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) and analyzed by Western blotting. To assess the association of endogenous HuR with endogenous NPM and p53 mRNAs, immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous HuR-mRNA complexes was performed as described (21Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. de Slianes I.L. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 29Yang X. Wang W. Fan J.

Twenty million IEC-6 cells were collected per sample, and lysates were used for IP for 4 h at room temperature in the presence of excess (30 μg) IP antibody (IgG or anti-HuR). RNA in IP materials was used in RT followed by PCR or Q-PCR analysis to detect the presence of NPM and p53 mRNAs. Immunofluorescence Staining—Immunofluorescence was performed according as described (30Vielkind U. Swierenga S.H. Histochemistry. 1989; 91: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with minor changes (14Zou T. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Keledjian K.M. Zhang A.H. Lan X. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C686-C696Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde, and the rehydrated samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody anti-HuR diluted 1:300 in blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor-594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at room temperature. After rinsing, slides were incubated with 1 μm TO-PRO3 (Molecular Probes) for 10 min to stain nuclei, rinsed again, mounted, and viewed through a Zeiss confocal microscope (model LSM410). Images were processed using PhotoShop software (Adobe, San Jose, CA). Statistics—Values are means ± S.E. from 3 to 6 samples. Autoradiographic and immunoblotting results were repeated three times. The significance of the difference between means was determined by analysis of variance. The level of significance was determined using Duncan's multiple range test (31Harter J.L. Biometrics. 1960; 16: 671-685Crossref Google Scholar). Polyamine Depletion in IEC-6 Cells Enhances Cytoplasmic HuR Levels—Since HuR was interacts with the p53 3′-UTR (21Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. de Slianes I.L. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and was predicted to bind the NPM 3′-UTR (41Galban S. Martindale J.L. Mazan-Mamczarz K. Slianes I.L. Fan J. Wang W. Decker J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7083-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 45Lopez de Silanes I.L. Zhan M. Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), we sought to formally investigate whether HuR was involved in the polyamine-dependent regulation of these mRNAs. Consistent with our previous studies (10Li L. Li J. Rao J.N. Li M.L. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C946-C954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li L. Liu L. Rao J.N. Esmaili A. Strauch E.D. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 764-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), exposure of IEC-6 cells to 5mm DFMO for 4 and 6 days completely inhibited ODC activity and depleted cellular polyamines. Putrescine and spermidine were undetectable at 4 and 6 days after treatment with DFMO, and spermine had decreased by ∼60% (not shown). Treatment with DFMO for 4 or 6 days significantly enhanced cytoplasmic HuR levels (by 1.7- and 3.8-fold, respectively), reduced its nuclear abundance, and did not change its whole-cell levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Supplementation with the polyamine putrescine (10 μm) reversed the DFMO-triggered changes in HuR subcellular distribution, as did spermidine supplementation (data not shown). To monitor the quality and abundance of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, we examined the levels of lamin B (a nuclear protein, Fig. 1A) and β-tubulin (a cytoplasmic protein, not shown), respectively. Assessment of these markers revealed that there was no contamination between cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. These changes in HuR subcellular distribution were further studied by immunofluorescence staining. Consistent with the Western blotting results, HuR immunostaining was almost undetectable in the cytoplasm of untreated cells (Fig. 1C, panel a), but it increased significantly in DFMO-treated cells (Fig. 1C, panel b), associated with a decrease in its nuclear levels. Combined treatment with DFMO and putrescine prevented the increased cytoplasmic HuR signal, rendering a subcellular staining pattern similar to that of untreated cells (Fig. 1C, panel c). These results indicate that lowering cellular polyamines increased the cytoplasmic levels of HuR in intestinal epithelial cells. Increasing Cellular Polyamines by ODC Overexpression Inhibits the Cytoplasmic Levels of HuR—We employed two clones of stable ODC-expressing cells recently developed in our laboratory that exhibited high levels of ODC protein (Fig. 2A, panel a), greater than 50-fold increase in ODC enzyme activity (Fig. 2A, panel b), and elevated cellular polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine (by 12-fold, 2-fold, and 25% when compared with control populations, respectively; not shown). ODC overexpression decreased the levels of cytoplasmic HuR by ∼50% (from 1.05 ± 0.03 in controls to 0.47 ± 0.02 in ODC-IEC-C1 and 0.49 ± 0.02 in ODC-IEC-C2; n = 3, p < 0.05) and correspondingly increased its nuclear abundance; no net changes in whole-cell HuR levels were seen in ODC-IEC cells when compared with control cells (Fig. 2B). The effect of ODC overexpression on the subcellular distribution of HuR was not simply due to clonal variation since two stable clones, ODC-IEC-C1 and ODC-IEC-C2, showed identical responses. These results suggest that increasing cellular polyamines promotes the nuclear accumulation of HuR and reduces its cytoplasmic levels in intestinal epithelial cells. Cytoplasmic HuR Directly Binds the NPM and p53 3′-UTRs—Based on the association of HuR with the p53 mRNA (21Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. de Slianes I.L. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and its predicted affinity for the NPM mRNA (45Lopez de Silanes I.L. Zhan M. Lal A. Yang X. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2987-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) at their 3′-UTRs (Figs. 3A and 4A), we hypothesized that the NPM and p53 3′-UTRs bound HuR in IEC-6 cells and further postulated that this association would increase in the cytoplasm following polyamine depletion. To test these possibilities, we performed two experiments. First, we used biotinylated transcripts spanning the NPM or p53 3′-UTRs in RNA pull-down assays (see “Materials and Methods”) using cell lysates prepared from either untreated or polyamine-deficient cells. The NPM 3′-UTR transcript readily associated with cytoplasmic HuR, as detected by Western blot analysis of the pull-down material (Fig. 3B); the binding intensity increased significantly when using lysates prepared from cells that were treated with DFMO for 4 or 6 days (by 1.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively) but was reduced when cells had been treated with putrescine. Importantly, transcripts corresponding to the CR of NPM did not bind to HuR (Fig. 3B, panel b). Similarly, HuR binding to the p53 3′-UTR (but not the CR) also increased by 2.4- and 2.9-fold when using lysates prepared from DFMO-treated cells (Fig. 4B, panel a, and B, panel b). Again, administration of putrescine together with DFMO completely prevented this elevation in binding.FIGURE 4Binding of cytoplasmic HuR to p53 transcripts. A, schematic representation of p53 mRNA and AU-rich sequences in its 3′-UTR. B, pulldown analysis was performed as described in the legend for Fig. 3. Cytoplasmic lysates (120 μg of each) were prepared from control, DFMO-treated, or DFMO+PUT-treated cells (4 and 6 days) and then incubated with 6 μg of biotinylated p53 3′-UTR or CR for 30 min at 25 °C. Representative HuR immunoblots are shown for the 3′-UTR (panel a) or CR(panel b). Three experiments were performed that showed similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Second, we examined the in vivo association of endogenous NPM and p53 mRNAs with HuR in IEC-6 cells following polyamine depletion through IP of HuR under conditions that preserved its association with target mRNAs in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The RNP complexes immunoprecipitated using anti-HuR antibody did contain endogenous NPM and p53 mRNAs, as measured by conventional PCR and real-time (Q-PCR) analyses (Fig. 5, A and B). The association of endogenous NPM and p53 mRNAs with endogenous HuR increased significantly (∼4.6 and ∼5.3 times) in DFMO-treated cells. Importantly, the NPM and p53 mRNAs were undetectable or dramatically reduced in nonspecific IgG1 IPs (Fig. 5A, right). Together, these findings support the notion that cytoplasmic HuR in intestinal epithelial cells specifically binds to the 3′-UTRs of NPM and p53 and that binding increases following polyamine depletion. HuR Silencing Abolishes the Increased Stability of NPM and p53 mRNAs in Polyamine-deficient Cells—We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the HuR mRNA (siHuR) to reduce HuR levels and thus directly examine its putative role in the previously reported changes in NPM and p53 mRNA stability following polyamine depletion (12Li L. Rao J.N. Li J. Patel A.R. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C941-C953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zou T. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Keledjian K.M. Zhang A.H. Lan X. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C686-C696Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). With >95% cells transfected (data not shown), siHuR potently and specifically silenced HuR expression in polyamine-deficient cells (by ∼80% at 48 h after transfection, Fig. 6A). Consistent with our previous findings showing that polyamine depletion stabilized the NPM and p53 mRNAs (12Li L. Rao J.N. Li J. Patel A.R. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C941-C953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zou T. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Keledjian K.M. Zhang A.H. Lan X. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C686-C696Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the half-lives of NPM and p53 mRNAs in DFMO-treated cells increased dramatically; the increased stability of NPM and p53 mRNAs in polyamine-deficient cells was abolished by silencing HuR (Fig. 6B) as the half-lives of NPM and p53 mRNAs in DFMO-treated siRNA-transfected cells were similar to those of control cells (without DFMO). Furthermore, in HuR-silenced populations, the increased NPM and p53 protein levels following polyamine depletion were also prevented (Fig. 6C) and were reduced to the levels observed in control populations. Transfection with control siRNA had no effect on the stability of the NPM and p53 mRNAs or the levels of the corresponding proteins in polyamine-deficient cells. These findings strongly suggest that HuR critically contributes to the increased stability of NPM and p53 mRNAs in polyamine-depleted cells, in turn elevating NPM and p53 expression and thereby contributing to the inhibition of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation (11Li L.

Physiol. 1999; 276: G441-G450PubMed Google Scholar), primarily by controlling mRNA stability. Our previous studies showed that increases in the levels of cellular polyamines reduce the stability, and hence the steady-state abundance, of the NPM and p53 mRNAs, whereas decreases in cellular polyamines activate the expression of the NPM and p53 genes by stabilizing their mRNAs, in turn leading to increased arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (12Li L.

Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C686-C696Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present studies implicate HuR in these processes, thereby advancing our understanding of the regulation of NPM and p53 expression in intestinal epithelial cells. A significant body of literature has indicated that HuR-mediated transcript stabilization and translational control are closely linked to its cytoplasmic presence (18Gorospe M. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 412-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 46Tran H. Maurer F. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7177-7188Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here, DFMO-mediated depletion of cellular polyamines significantly induced the cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR but did not alter whole-cell HuR levels (Fig. 1). The specificity of these effects was demonstrated by the addition of exogenous putrescine, which completely prevented the cytoplasmic increase in HuR levels. Furthermore, ectopic ODC overexpression increased cellular polyamines and decreased the levels of cytoplasmic HuR, whereas it increased HuR in the nucleus (Fig. 2). Polyamines have been shown to influence multiple distinct signaling pathways leading to alterations of gene transcription (9Patel A.R. Wang J.Y. Am. J.

Although it remains to be formally shown that the role of HuR in the stabilization of NPM and p53 mRNAs in polyamine-deficient cells is linked to the cytoplasmic localization of HuR RNP complexes, our studies show that the cytoplasmic HuR specifically binds to 3′-UTR of NPM and p53 mRNAs following polyamine depletion. These findings are further supported by evidence that the endogenous NPM and p53 mRNAs associate with the endogenous HuR in the materials immunoprecipitated by anti-HuR antibody (Fig. 5) and further suggest that polyamine depletion increases HuR function in intestinal epithelial cells. How polyamines influence HuR abundance in the cytoplasm remains an open question, but we have preliminary evidence that supports the involvement of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a kinase previously shown to inhibit the cytoplasmic export of HuR (50Wang W.

Interventions to decrease cellular polyamines significantly reduced AMPK enzyme activity, whereas ectopic constitutive activation of AMPK prevented the elevation in cytoplasmic HuR levels in polyamine-deficient cells. The precise mechanisms by which polyamines modulate AMPK function and HuR distribution are the focus of our ongoing studies. Our observations are also consistent with studies demonstrating that HuR binds to AU-rich elements commonly found in the 3′-UTRs of labile mRNAs (40Fu L. Benchimol S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). The p53 mRNA contains several hits for the HuR motif and was formally shown to be a target of HuR (21Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. de Slianes I.L. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Those studies were performed in human colon carcinoma cells and implicated HuR in enhancing the translation of the p53 mRNA, not its stability; it remains to be investigated whether the effects of HuR on target mRNAs are cell type-specific and whether the translation of p53 is also influenced by HuR in IEC cells. Computational analysis of the NPM mRNA revealed that its 3′-UTR also has a HuR motif hit, thus making it a putative HuR target, as confirmed here. Future studies in polyamine-deficient cells must address the possible role of HuR in the stabilization of other mRNAs such as those encoding the aforementioned growth inhibitory genes p21 and TGF-β, encoded by mRNAs, which are also targets of HuR (45Lopez de Silanes I.L.

Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The transcript stability data presented in Fig. 6 further show that HuR levels critically influence NPM and p53 mRNA stability in polyamine-deficient cells. In keeping with our previous results (12Li L. Rao J.N. Li J. Patel A.R. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C941-C953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zou T. Rao J.N. Liu L. Marasa B.S. Keledjian K.M. Zhang A.H. Lan X. Bass B.L. Wang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C686-C696Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), polyamine depletion increased the half-life of NPM and p53 mRNAs, but this effect was abrogated in cells in which HuR expression was reduced by RNA interference, which in turn caused a marked reduction in the production of NPM and p53 proteins. Although the exact mechanisms whereby cytoplasmic HuR stabilizes NPM and p53 mRNAs following polyamine depletion are still unclear, it has been proposed that HuR acts by protecting the body of bound mRNAs from degradation, rather than by slowing the rate of deadenylation (48Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In summary, these results indicate that depletion of cellular polyamines does not affect the whole-cell levels of HuR but increases its abundance in the cytoplasm, where it binds the 3′-UTRs of NPM and p53 and increases the stability of these mRNAs. The silencing of HuR prevented the stabilization of NPM and p53 mRNAs and the expression of p53 and NPM proteins in polyamine-deficient cells. Since intracellular polyamines are highly regulated by the status of cell growth and stress stimulation, the current findings suggest that the polyamine-modulated distribution of HuR in intestinal epithelial cells can directly regulate the growth of the intestinal mucosa in vivo and thereby contribute to maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium under physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2155777324,"To delineate the molecular mechanism underlying the inverse agonist activity of olmesartan, a potent angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, we performed binding affinity studies and an inositol phosphate production assay. Binding affinity of olmesartan and its related compounds to wild-type and mutant AT1 receptors demonstrated that interactions between olmesartan and Tyr113, Lys199, His256, and Gln257 in the AT1 receptor were important. The inositol phosphate production assay of olmesartan and related compounds using mutant receptors indicated that the inverse agonist activity required two interactions, that between the hydroxyl group of olmesartan and Tyr113 in the receptor and that between the carboxyl group of olmesartan and Lys199 and His256 in the receptor. Gln257 was found to be important for the interaction with olmesartan but not for the inverse agonist activity. Based on these results, we constructed a model for the interaction between olmesartan and the AT1 receptor. Although the activation of G protein-coupled receptors is initiated by anti-clockwise rotation of transmembrane (TM) III and TM VI followed by changes in the conformation of the receptor, in this model, cooperative interactions between the hydroxyl group and Tyr113 in TM III and between the carboxyl group and His256 in TM VI were essential for the potent inverse agonist activity of olmesartan. We speculate that the specific interaction of olmesartan with these two TMs is essential for stabilizing the AT1 receptor in an inactive conformation. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the inverse agonism could be useful for the development of new G protein-coupled receptor antagonists with inverse agonist activity.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) 3The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; ARB, Ang II receptor antagonist; AT1, Ang II type 1; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; IP, inositol phosphate; TM, transmembrane; WT, wild-type. 3The abbreviations used are: Ang II, angiotensin II; ARB, Ang II receptor antagonist; AT1, Ang II type 1; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; IP, inositol phosphate; TM, transmembrane; WT, wild-type. receptor antagonists (ARBs) are highly selective for the Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, and block the diverse effects of Ang II. In addition to their blood pressure-lowering effects in hypertensive patients, ARBs have been shown to promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure or hypertensive diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria (1De Gasparo M. Catt J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 415-472PubMed Google Scholar). Many ARBs are available for clinical use. Because not all ARBs have the same effects, some benefits conferred by ARBs may not be class effects (2Miura S. Fujino M. Saku K. Curr. Hypertens. Rev. 2005; 1: 115-121Crossref Google Scholar). This notion represents an exciting new area in ARB-based therapy, which holds the promise of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Inverse agonists, such as the opioid receptor ligand ICI174864 (3Costa T. Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), block agonist-independent signal transduction by GPCRs. Many clinically important medications have been shown to behave as inverse agonists when tested against either wild-type (WT) or mutated GPCRs; e.g. olanzapine in the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors (4Herrick-Davis K. Grinde E. Teitler M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 226-232PubMed Google Scholar) and metoprolol in the β-adrenoreceptor (5Engelhardt S. Grimmer Y. Fan G.H. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 712-717PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneous receptor mutations leading to constitutive activity have been implicated in some human diseases (6Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 7Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). However, such spontaneous mutations have not been reported for the AT1 receptor, and the WT AT1 receptor shows slight constitutive activity (2Miura S. Fujino M. Saku K. Curr. Hypertens. Rev. 2005; 1: 115-121Crossref Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrates that the WT AT1receptor is activated by mechanical stretching of cultured rat myocytes without the involvement of Ang II, and this was suppressed by an inverse agonist (8Zou Y. Akazawa H. Qin Y. Sano M. Takano H. Minamino T. Makita N. Iwanaga K. Zhu W. Kudoh S. Toko H. Tamura K. Kihara M. Nagai T. Fukamizu A. Umemura S. Iiri T. Fujita T. Komuro I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The same study also demonstrates that cardiac hypertrophy induced by constricting the transverse aorta in angiotensinogen knock-out mice was attenuated by an inverse agonist, suggesting that the WT AT1 receptor is activated independent of Ang II by mechanical stimulation of the heart in vivo. In this way, an inverse agonist for the AT1 receptor may have pharmacotherapeutic relevance for the cardiovascular system. We have previously reported that EXP3174, an active metabolite of losartan, but not losartan itself, can act as an inverse agonist in the inositol phosphate (IP) production assay using a constitutively active AT1-N111G mutant (9Miura S. Saku K. Karnik S.S. Hypertens. Res. 2003; 26: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Most ARBs, including EXP3174 and losartan, have biphenyltetrazole and imidazole groups as common chemical moieties (see Fig. 1). In addition, EXP3174, but not losartan, has a carboxyl group in the imidazole ring. This difference in the chemical structure may be important for inverse agonist activity. Olmesartan, a potent ARB, has a hydroxyl group in the imidazole ring in addition to the carboxyl group and exhibits potent inverse agonist activity. We speculated that the hydroxyl group, together with the carboxyl group, may play an important role in inverse agonist activity. To explore this hypothesis, we systematically mutated the AT1 receptor and examined the interactions between the AT1 receptor and the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of olmesartan. We also analyzed whether these interactions could be important for inducing inverse agonism. Based on the results of these experiments, molecular modeling was performed to determine the specific sites for the interaction between olmesartan and the AT1 receptor. This report will address the molecular mechanism underlying the inverse agonist activity of ARB. Materials—Olmesartan and its related compounds, R-89059, R-90929, R-239470, and R-239471, were synthesized in the Research Laboratories of Sankyo Co., Ltd. The chemical structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1. 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Cultures and Transfections—COS1 cells were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin- and streptomycin-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell viability was >95% by trypan blue exclusion analysis in the control experiments. The WT and mutant AT1 receptors were transfected into COS1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 liposomal reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutagenesis and Expression of the AT1 Receptor and Membrane Preparation—The synthetic rat AT1 receptor gene, cloned in the shuttle expression vector pMT-2, was used for expression and mutagenesis (Fig. 2), as described previously (10Miura S. Feng Y.H. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To express the AT1 receptor protein, 10 μg of purified plasmid DNA/107 cells was used in the transfection. COS1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transfected cells that had been cultured for 72 h were harvested, and cell membranes were prepared by the nitrogen Parr bomb disruption method in the presence of protease inhibitors. Competition Binding Studies—The Kd and Bmax values of the receptor binding were determined by 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II-binding experiments under equilibrium conditions, as previously described (10Miura S. Feng Y.H. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Membranes expressing the WT or mutant AT1 receptor were incubated with 100 pm 125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II for 1 h at 22 °C in a volume of 125 μl. Binding was stopped by filtering the incubation mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters, and the residues were extensively washed further with binding buffer. The bound ligand fraction was determined from the counts/min remaining on the membrane. Binding kinetics values were determined as previously described (10Miura S. Feng Y.H. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). IP Formation Studies—Total soluble IP was measured by the perchloric acid extraction method, as described previously (10Miura S. Feng Y.H. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling of the AT1 Receptor—The structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1F88) was used as a template for the modeling of the AT1 receptor (11Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yomamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). We aligned the primary sequence of the human AT1 receptor with that of bovine rhodopsin. The amino acid mutations were performed with the program Modeler (Accelrys) followed by energy minimization using CHARMm (Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics) (Accelrys). Throughout the entire modeling process, the three-dimensional structure was monitored to ensure that the AT1 secondary structure was conserved. This model was used for docking olmesartan. First, manual docking was performed so that three interactions deduced by mutation experiments were satisfied. These interactions were between Tyr113 and the hydroxyl group of olmesartan, between Lys199 and the carboxyl group, and between Gln257 and the tetrazole group. The conformation of olmesartan was derived from the x-ray-determined structure of olmesartan and adjusted manually to satisfy the interactions described above. Energy minimization was then performed with a flexible olmesartan structure using a CHARMm force field. The three interactions mentioned above were constrained in this process. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of four or more independent determinations. Significant differences in measured values were evaluated with an analysis of variance using Fisher's t test and unpaired Student's t test. Statistical significance was set at <0.05. Binding of Olmesartan and Its Related Compounds to WT and Mutant AT1 Receptors—First, we selected the candidate residues (Ser105, Val108, Ser109, Tyr113, His166, His183, Lys199, His256, Gln257, Thr260, Met284, Thr287, Tyr292, and Asn295 in the AT1 receptor) for specific binding sites of olmesartan based on the molecular model of the AT1 receptor complex described in previous reports (12Noda K.

To determine the specific amino acids that bind to olmesartan, we examined the binding affinity of olmesartan and its related compounds (the chemical structures of which are shown in Fig. 1) to AT1 receptors mutated at the candidate amino acids mentioned above. The results are shown in Table 1. The expression levels of the WT and mutated AT1 receptors were within the same order of magnitude. The affinities of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II were almost the same in some mutants and were decreased in other mutants but not to <0.1 the affinity to the WT AT1 receptor.TABLE 1Maximal binding capacities (Bmax) and binding affinities (Kd) of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, olmesartan, and its related compounds to AT1 wild type and mutant receptors Numbers in parentheses show ratio of Kd (mutant)/Kd (wild type).ReceptorBmaxKd[Sar1, Ile8]Ang IIOlmesartanR-90929R-239470R-239471pmol/mg proteinnmWild type0.52 ± 0.040.7 ± 0.2 (1.0)2.2 ± 0.7 (1.0)24 ± 2 (1.0)0.8 ± 0.3 (1.0)61 ± 21 (1.0)S105A0.46 ± 0.061.7 ± 0.6 (2.4)8.4 ± 3.3 (3.8)66 ± 15 (2.8)4.5 ± 1.0 (5.6)177 ± 13 (2.9)V108G0.64 ± 0.050.5 ± 0.2 (0.7)15 ± 3 (6.8)52 ± 9 (2.2)7.7 ± 1.4 (9.6)817 ± 87 (13)V108A0.68 ± 0.150.7 ± 0.4 (1.0)4.7 ± 1.3 (2.1)25 ± 4 (1.0)1.1 ± 0.1 (1.4)56 ± 6 (0.9)S109A0.57 ± 0.081.4 ± 0.1 (2.0)7.6 ± 1.6 (3.5)25 ± 5 (1.0)1.7 ± 0.4 (2.1)90 ± 6 (1.5)Y113A0.39 ± 0.010.7 ± 0.2 (1.0)9.3 ± 2.7 (4.2)Y113F0.68 ± 0.132.6 ± 0.6 (3.7)52 ± 7 (24)103 ± 17 (4.3)17 ± 3 (21)3110 ± 311 (51)H166E0.28 ± 0.073.2 ± 0.3 (4.6)19 ± 4 (8.6)160 ± 12 (6.7)7.1 ± 1.4 (8.9)1813 ± 206 (30)H183E0.82 ± 0.091.2 ± 0.3 (1.7)11 ± 1 (5.0)52 ± 5 (2.2)2.5 ± 0.6 (3.1)172 ± 15 (2.8)K199Q0.23 ± 0.032.5 ± 1.3 (3.6)33 ± 6 (15)362 ± 43 (15)1.8 ± 0.3 (2.3)2655 ± 295 (44)H256A0.24 ± 0.060.6 ± 0.2 (0.9)36 ± 4 (16)34 ± 6 (1.4)1.1 ± 0.2 (1.4)242 ± 46 (4.0)Q257A0.08 ± 0.165.2 ± 2.0 (7.4)226 ± 4 (103)468 ± 39 (20)20 ± 2 (25)>105 (>1639)T260A0.72 ± 0.083.9 ± 1.9 (5.6)26 ± 3 (12)60 ± 13 (2.5)5.7 ± 1.3 (7.1)161 ± 12 (2.6)M284A0.47 ± 0.021.0 ± 0.3 (1.4)2.8 ± 0.6 (1.3)T287A0.43 ± 0.061.3 ± 0.2 (1.9)25 ± 4 (11)131 ± 25 (5.4)16 ± 6 (20)2400 ± 364 (39)Y292A0.73 ± 0.032.9 ± 1.8 (4.1)47 ± 15 (21)87 ± 18 (3.6)6.3 ± 3.8 (7.9)1585 ± 581 (26)Y292F0.79 ± 0.021.1 ± 0.3 (1.6)25 ± 4 (11)93 ± 22 (3.9)4.0 ± 0.8 (5.0)890 ± 345 (15)N295I0.46 ± 0.012.0 ± 0.5 (2.9)25 ± 3 (11)95 ± 5 (4.0)3.8 ± 0.5 (4.8)919 ± 140 (15) Open table in a new tab The affinity of olmesartan was reduced by >10-fold in Y113F, K199Q, H256A, Q257A, T260A, T287A, Y292A, Y292F, and N295I mutants compared with the WT AT1 receptor, suggesting that Tyr113, Lys199, His256, Gln257, Thr260, Thr287, Tyr292, and Asn295 in the AT1 receptor are involved in the binding to olmesartan. R-90929, which has a chemical structure similar to that of olmesartan but has no hydroxyl group, exhibited a >10-fold reduction in binding affinity to the K199Q (15-fold reduction) and Q257A (20-fold reduction) mutants compared with the WT AT1 receptor. R-239470, which has a non-acidic carbamoyl group instead of the carboxyl group in olmesartan, also exhibited a >10-fold reduction in affinity in the Y113F (21-fold reduction), Q257A (25-fold reduction), and T287A (20-fold reduction) mutants. R-239471, which has methoxymethyl and carboxyl groups instead of the hydroxyisopropyl and tetrazole groups in olmesartan, respectively, exhibited a total loss of affinity to the Q257A mutant and a >10-fold reduction of binding affinity to the Y113F, H166E, K199Q, T287A, Y292A, Y292F, and N295I mutants. These results suggest that Tyr113, Lys199, and Gln257 are essential for binding between olmesartan and the AT1 receptor. Olmesartan and R-239470, which have a hydroxyl group in the imidazole group, showed >10-fold decreases in binding affinity in the Y113F mutant, whereas R-90929, which does not have a hydroxyl group, showed only a 4.3-fold reduction in binding affinity, indicating that the hydroxyl group probably binds to Tyr113 of the AT1 receptor. Also, the binding affinity of R-239471 in the Y113F mutant was reduced to 1/51 that in the wild-type receptor, probably because of the lack of hydrogen bonding between the methoxymethyl group of R-239471 and the hydroxyl group of Tyr113 in the Y113F mutant. As for Lys199, olmesartan, R-90929, and R-239471, which have a carboxyl group in the imidazole group, showed a significant decrease in binding affinity (1/15, 1/15, and 1/40, respectively) in the K199Q mutant. On the other hand, R-239470, which has a carbamoyl group instead of a carboxyl group, showed only a 2.3-fold loss of affinity. These data suggest that Lys199 of the AT1 receptor has electrostatic interaction with the carboxyl group in the imidazole group. Olmesartan showed a 16-fold reduction in binding affinity in the H256A mutant, whereas the other related compounds showed only a slight reduction in binding affinity (1.4-4.0-fold reduction) despite the presence of a carboxyl group (Table 1). These results do not necessarily suggest interaction between the carboxyl group and His256, because the loss of binding caused by the mutation of His256 would have been compensated for by interaction between the carboxyl group and Lys199. Olmesartan, R-90929, and R-239470 showed large decreases in binding affinity (103-, 20-, and 25-fold decreases, respectively) in the Q257A mutant. Because the common functional group in all of the tested compounds is the tetrazole group, the carbamoyl group of Gln257 would interact with the tetrazole group. R-239471, in which the tetrazole group was replaced with a carboxyl group, showed a complete loss of binding affinity in this mutant. It has been known that ARBs having a tetrazole group are more potent than those having a carboxyl group, although the carboxyl and tetrazole groups have similar physicochemical and biological properties. There is very little information available on the interaction between Thr260 or Thr287 in the AT1 receptor and ARBs. Although olmesartan reduced the binding affinity in T260A by 12-fold, other related compounds showed <10-fold (only 2.5-7.1-fold) decreases in affinity in T260A. Thus, Thr260 is not very important for binding to olmesartan. Olmesartan reduced the binding affinity also in T287A by 11-fold, but Thr287 is located too far for direct binding to olmesartan in our molecular model, which is described below. We excluded the interaction of Tyr292 and Asn295 with olmesartan because of the large distances between these amino acids and olmesartan in our model. These amino acids have been reported to participate in the activation of the AT1 receptor (14Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol.

Asn295 has a close spatial proximity to Asn111, and the mutation of Asn295 leads to a large change in the conformation of the AT1 receptor, which results in a serious reduction in the binding affinity to non-peptide ARBs. Inverse Agonist Activity of Olmesartan and Its Related Compounds in WT, N111G, and F77A/N111G AT1 Receptors—Although no naturally occurring mutant AT1 receptor that induces constitutive activity has been found, a recombinant WT AT1 receptor expressed at a high density showed constitutive activity. The native WT AT1 receptor has, therefore, some constitutive activity and can be used for analyzing the molecular mechanism underlying the inverse agonist activity. The inverse agonist activity of olmesartan and its related compounds in the WT AT1 receptor was tested and the results are shown in Fig. 3. Only olmesartan significantly suppressed basal IP production among the compounds tested (Fig. 3a). However, the basal activity of the WT AT1 receptor is too low to evaluate the inverse agonist activity of the related compounds. We have previously reported that the AT1-N111G mutant receptor had high basal activity in the absence of Ang II (18Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and that the AT1 double mutant F77A/N111G receptor induced a change in the conformation of transmembrane (TM) VII to give higher basal activity than seen with the N111G mutant (20Miura S. Zhang J. Boros J. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3720-3725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, the basal IP production in the double mutant was comparable with that induced by Ang II in the WT AT1 receptor (Fig. 3c). In the N111G mutant, olmesartan and other related compounds, except for R-239470, which does not have a carboxyl group, significantly suppressed basal IP production (Fig. 3b). R-239470 failed to suppress IP production in the N111G mutant, although it showed the most potent binding affinity to the N111G mutant among the compounds tested (Table 2), indicating that binding affinity to the receptor does not necessarily parallel the inverse agonist activity. Electrostatic interaction of the carboxyl group with the receptor may be important for the inverse agonist activity, as observed in the difference between losartan and EXP3174 (9Miura S. Saku K. Karnik S.S. Hypertens. Res. 2003; 26: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the more active F77A/N111G mutant (Fig. 3c), olmesartan and R-89059, which have hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in the imidazole group, significantly suppressed high basal IP production, but the other compounds, such as R-90929 and R-239471, failed to do so, although there was no large loss of binding affinity to the F77A/N111G mutant (Table 2). These results suggest that the coexistence of both the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in the imidazole group are required for the potent inverse agonist activity of olmesartan.TABLE 2Maximal binding capacities (Bmax) and binding affinities (Kd) of [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, olmesartan, and its related compounds to AT1 wild type and mutant receptors Numbers in parentheses show ratio of Kd (mutant)/Kd (wild type).ReceptorBmaxKd[Sar1, Ile8]Ang IIOlmesartanR-89059R-90929R-239470R-239471pmol/mg proteinnmWild type0.52 ± 0.040.7 ± 0.2 (1.0)2.2 ± 0.7 (1.0)2.4 ± 1.0 (1.0)24 ± 2 (1.0)0.8 ± 0.3 (1.0)61 ± 21 (1.0)N111G0.38 ± 0.020.8 ± 0.6 (1.1)40 ± 18 (18)128 ± 24 (53)178 ± 11 (7.4)15 ± 10 (19)40 ± 10 (0.7)N111G/Y113F0.26 ± 0.111.0 ± 0.2 (1.4)25 ± 5 (11)54 ± 21 (23)1025 ± 230 (43)29 ± 8 (36)1350 ± 216 (22)N111G/K199Q0.31 ± 0.111.2 ± 0.9 (1.7)63 ± 27 (29)263 ± 124 (110)10 ± 5 (0.4)2.5 ± 1.4 (3.1)>105 (>1639)N111G/H256A0.24 ± 0.041.0 ± 0.5 (1.4)5.3 ± 1.6 (2.4)18 ± 4 (7.5)53 ± 7 (2.2)3.2 ± 0.7 (4.0)>105 (>1639)N111G/Q257A0.35 ± 0.031.0 ± 0.2 (1.4)26 ± 9 (12)41 ± 7 (17)272 ± 43 (11)6.1 ± 1.2 (7.6)579 ± 33 (9.5)N111G/Y113F/H256A0.15 ± 0.031.4 ± 0.2 (2.0)22 ± 7 (10)F77A/N111G0.54 ± 0.103.9 ± 0.5 (5.6)36 ± 6 (16)33 ± 6 (14)42 ± 9 (1.8)3.9 ± 1.1 (4.9)152 ± 18 (2.5)F77A/N111G/Y113F0.37 ± 0.092.3 ± 0.5 (3.3)228 ± 76 (104)F77A/N111G/K199Q0.36 ± 0.033.3 ± 0.9 (4.7)164 ± 25 (75)F77A/N111G/H256A0.39 ± 0.109.7 ± 2.3 (14)76 ± 11 (35)F77A/N111G/Q257A0.19 ± 0.0219 ± 5 (27)152 ± 32 (69)F77A/N111G/Y113F/H256A0.34 ± 0.081.6 ± 0.5 (2.3)29 ± 8 (13) Open table in a new tab Inverse Agonist Activity of Olmesartan and Its Related Compounds in Various Mutated AT1 Receptors—To delineate the participation of the interaction between olmesartan and the AT1 receptor in the inverse agonist activity, we examined the inverse agonist activity of olmesartan in receptors that had been further mutated at Tyr113, Lys199, His256, and Gln257 of N111G and F77A/N111G. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Interestingly, mutation at Tyr113, Lys199,orHis256 of N111G or F77A/N111G did not decrease inverse agonist activity of olmesartan. However, olmesartan lost inverse agonist activity in N111G/Y113F/H256A despite the same binding affinity to N111G and N111G/Y113F/H256A, as shown in Table 2. A similar result was observed in F77A/N111G/Y113F/H256A. These results again suggest that cooperative interactions between the hydroxyl group and Tyr113 (TM III) and between the carboxyl group and His256 (TM VI) are crucial for the potent inverse agonist activity of olmesartan. Olmesartan suppressed constitutive IP production in N111G/Q257A but not in F77A/N111G/Q257A. Consistent with these results, olmesartan showed a large decrease in binding affinity to F77A/N111G/Q257A (1/69 compared with binding to the WT AT1 receptor) but did not show a large loss of affinity to N111G/Q257A (1/12 of the affinity to the WT AT1 receptor), as shown in Table 2, suggesting that interaction between the tetrazole group and Gln257 is only a little involved in the inverse agonist activity of olmesartan. To elucidate the importance of the interaction of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups with the AT1 receptor, we examined the inverse agonist activity of olmesartan and its related compounds in N111G mutants that had been further mutated at Tyr113, Lys199, His256, and Gln257, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Olmesartan showed 60% inhibition of IP production, and R-89059 had ⅓ the ability of olmesartan in the N111G/Y113 mutant (Fig. 5a), whereas the other compounds, which have only a hydroxyl or carboxyl group, did not show inverse agonist activity. These results also suggest that coexistence of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups is essential for inverse agonist activity. R-89059 and R-90929 each showed ∼60% inhibition of IP production compared with olmesartan in the N111G/K199Q mutant but did not show inverse agonist activity in the N111G/H256A mutant. These results suggest that the interaction of His256 with the carboxyl group is more important than that of Lys199 for inverse agonist activity, although both Lys199 and His256 bind to the carboxyl group. In the N111G (Fig. 3b) and N111G/Q257A (Fig. 5d) mutants, the inverse agonist activity of the test compounds, except for R-239470, was not reduced, indicating that interaction of the tetrazole group with Gln257 is not important for the inverse agonist activity. Molecular Model of the Interaction Between Olmesartan and the AT1 Receptor—A molecular model was constructed considering the three interactions between the AT1 receptor and olmesartan that were suggested from the mutation experiments, between Tyr113 and the hydroxyl group of olmesartan, between Lys199 and the carboxyl group, and between Gln257 and the tetrazole group. After manual docking and energy minimization, we constructed a molecular model containing the three interactions mentioned above (Fig. 6). The distances between Tyr113 and the hydroxyl group, Lys199 and the carboxyl group, and Gln257 and the tetrazole group are 2.7, 2.8, and 3.1 Å, respectively, which are reasonable distances for contributing to electrostatic and/or hydrogen bond interactions. Lys199 is also close to the tetrazole group, the distance (2.8 Å) being the same as that between Lys199 and the carboxylic acid, suggesting the presence of electrostatic interaction between Lys199 and the tetrazole group. Carini et al. (21Carini D.J. Duncia J.V. Aldrich P.E. Chiu A.T. Johnson A.L. Pierce M.E. Price W.A. Santella III, J.B. Wells G.J. Wexler R.R. Wong P.C. Yoo S.E. Timmerman P.B.M.W.M. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2525-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) report that an acidic group, such as a carboxyl or tetrazole group, in the biphenyl moiety is important for binding to the AT1 receptor; i.e. replacement of the acidic group by a non-acidic group, such as a carbamoyl group, leads to a remarkable decrease in binding affinity, suggesting the presence of ionic interaction between the acidic group in the biphenyl moiety and the basic amino acid in the AT1 receptor. Lys199 was the only candidate amino acid for forming an ionic bond with the tetrazole group in our model. The carboxyl group of olmesartan is located at a distance of 5.8 Å from Gln257 in our model, which is consistent with the finding of a previous paper in which the distance between α-COO- of candesartan and Gln257 was determined to be 4.98 Å (13Takezako T. Gogonea C. Saad Y. Noda K. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15248-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The large loss in binding affinity of olmesartan and its related compounds in the Q257A mutant would be explained by the loss of the hydrogen bond interaction between the carboxyl or carbamoyl group of the tested compounds and the carbamoyl group of Gln257. The other amino acid His256, the mutant of which (H256A) showed a 16-fold reduction in binding affinity to olmesartan, is located 4.4 Å from the carboxyl group, suggesting the existence of interaction between them. The distance between the tetrazole group and His256 is 6.3 Å, which is shorter than that reported for candesartan (7.31 Å) (13Takezako T. Gogonea C. Saad Y. Noda K. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15248-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thr260, the other candidate amino acid for binding to olmesartan, cannot form hydrogen bonding with olmesartan but does have significant van der Waals contact, which could explain the decrease in affinity in the T260A mutant. The remaining candidates Tyr292 and Asn295 seemed to be too far away to directly bind to olmesartan. In addition, the T287A mutant showed a 10-fold loss of binding affinity for olmesartan compared with the WT AT1 receptor. Thr287 is located too far away to directly bind to olmesartan, but this amino acid is capable of forming a hydrogen bond with His256 in our model. The biphenyl group is positioned in the aromatic area consisting of Phe208, Phe249, and Trp253 in the model (3.7-4.5 Å), which is conserved in the class A family of GPCRs (22Bondensgaad K. Ankersen M. Thogersen H. Hansen B.S. Wulff B.S. Bywater R.P. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A recent study on the binding model between losartan and the AT1 receptor constructed by computational analysis suggested that Tyr113 strongly interacted with the tetrazole group (2.70 Å) and the neighboring phenyl group (2.70 Å) of losartan (23Baleanu-Gogonea C. Karnik S. J. Mol. Model. 2006; 12: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, R-90929, which has tetrazole and phenyl groups but not a hydroxyl group, showed only a slight reduction in binding affinity in the Y113F mutant (4.3-fold reduction) as mentioned above. The functional group closest to Tyr113 in the olmesartan-AT1 receptor binding model was the hydroxyl group (2.7 Å) and not the tetrazole (4.9 Å) or phenyl (4.0 Å) group. This suggests that the hydroxyl group is more suitable for interaction with Tyr113 than the tetrazole or phenyl group. The other amino acids Lys199, His256, and Gln257, which are involved in olmesartan binding and inverse agonist activity, were also suggested to interact with losartan. However, olmesartan is located deeper in the TM domain than losartan, and the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of olmesartan, which are not present in losartan, interact with the AT1 receptor. This mode of olmesartan binding, which is distinct from that of losartan, affords the potent inverse agonist activity. An Agonist and an Inverse Agonist Bind to the Same TMs but Induce Different Conformational Changes in the AT1 Receptor—The binding affinities and molecular model studies suggest that the interactions of the hydroxyl, carboxyl, and tetrazole groups of olmesartan with Tyr113, Lys199, His256, and Gln257 in the AT1 receptor play important roles in the tight binding between olmesartan and the receptor. Among these interactions, that between the hydroxyl group and Tyr113 (TM III) and that between the carboxyl group and His256 (TM VI), are important for the inverse agonist activity of olmesartan. Farrens et al. (24Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) and Gether et al. (25Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6737-6747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the activation of rhodopsin by ligands is initiated by anti-clockwise rotation of TM III and TM VI followed by changes in the conformation of the receptors. Similar changes in conformation are postulated to take place in constitutively active mutant receptors (26Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the case of the AT1 receptor, Ang II binding to Asn111 in TM III and to His256 in TM VI is critical for receptor activation (9Miura S. Saku K. Karnik S.S. Hypertens. Res. 2003; 26: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Similar changes in conformation take place in the constitutively active β2 adrenergic and mutant AT1 receptors (18Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We speculate that the specific interaction of olmesartan with these two TMs is essential for stabilizing the AT1 receptor in an inactive conformation, which does not allow G protein coupling. The agonist Ang II shifts the AT1 receptor in the [R′] state (partially active state) to the [R*] state (fully active state), whereas the inverse agonist olmesartan may shift the receptor in the [R′] state to the inactive state through conformational changes of TM III and TM VI. Therapeutic Relevance of Inverse Agonism toward AT1 Receptor—The extent to which inverse agonism could offer a therapeutic advantage depends on the role of constitutive GPCR activity in the pathology. A potential therapeutic area where this might be relevant is cancer. It has been shown that the chronic elevation of second messengers in cells produced by constitutive GPCR activity can lead to cell transformation (27Lyons J. Landis C.A. Harsh G. Vallar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.Y. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E. Bourne H.R. Science. 1990; 249: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). For example, receptors such as the α1-adrenoreceptor have been shown to be agonist-independent proto-oncogenes (28Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11354-11358Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Constitutively active GPCRs may also be important in autoimmune disease (29de Ligt R.A. Kourounakis A.P. Ijzerman A.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the AT1 receptor also has slight constitutive activity (2Miura S. Fujino M. Saku K. Curr. Hypertens. Rev. 2005; 1: 115-121Crossref Google Scholar) and there is no evidence regarding the pharmacotherapeutic relevance of ARBs as inverse agonists, we should consider the results of two very interesting studies. Losartan, which does not contain carboxyl or hydroxyl groups, prevented Ang II-induced, but not mechanical stretch-induced, vascular endothelial growth factor protein secretion in human mesangial cells (30Gruden G. Thomas S. Burt D. Zhou W. Chusney G. Gnudi L. Viberti G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 730-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ang II and stretching can each induce vascular endothelial growth factor production, suggesting that both Ang II- and stretch-induced AT1 receptor signals may exist. If losartan is an inverse agonist, the stretch-induced signal might be blocked. To resolve this question, Zou et al. (8Zou Y. Akazawa H. Qin Y. Sano M. Takano H. Minamino T. Makita N. Iwanaga K. Zhu W. Kudoh S. Toko H. Tamura K. Kihara M. Nagai T. Fukamizu A. Umemura S. Iiri T. Fujita T. Komuro I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) reported that mechanical stress activates the AT1 receptor independent of Ang II, and this activation can be inhibited by the inverse agonist candesartan. They examined pressure overload on the heart by constricting the transverse aortae of adult male angiotensinogen knock-out mice. Although treatment with candesartan did not reduce blood pressure, candesartan significantly attenuated the development of cardiac hypertrophy. These results suggest that mechanical stress can induce cardiac hypertrophy in vivo by activating the AT1 receptor independent of Ang II. They suggested a mechanism by which mechanical stress might activate the AT1 receptor without Ang II. Stretching of the cell membrane may directly change the conformation of the AT1 receptor, and candesartan, which contains the carboxyl group, may prevent such changes as an inverse agonist. The present study attempted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying inverse agonist activity of an ARB and provided a new perspective in the research of angiotensin receptors. A better understanding of the mechanism of inverse agonism would be useful for the development of new GPCR antagonists."

Aging. 1999; 20: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and the finding that tau is essential to Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons from human tau transgenic mice (4Rapoport M. Dawson H.N. Binder L.I. Vitek M.P. Ferreira A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6364-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Furthermore a recent study demonstrated that attenuation of tau overexpression in a neurodegenerative mouse model prevented further neuronal loss and memory impairment (5Santacruz K. Lewis J. Spires T. Paulson J. Kotilinek L. Ingelsson M. Guimaraes A. DeTure M. Ramsden M. McGowan E. Forster C. Yue M. Orne J. Janus C. Mariash A. Kuskowski M. Hyman B. Hutton M. Ashe K.H. Science. 2005; 309: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). These and other studies support the hypothesis that pathogenic alterations in tau contribute to the etiology of AD. Nonetheless the mechanisms leading to tau dysfunction and neurodegeneration have not been clearly elucidated. Tau is predominantly expressed in neurons where its primary function is to promote tubulin polymerization and microtubule stability (6Johnson G.V. Bailey C.D. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2002; 4: 375-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This physiological function of tau is regulated by tau phosphorylation. In AD tau is hyperphosphorylated at a number of sites (2Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4913-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2835) Google Scholar); this impairs its ability to bind and stabilize microtubules. It has been proposed that in AD brain this loss of tau function may result in the breakdown of axonal transport of vesicles and organelles (loss of function) and lead to neurodegeneration (7Alonso A.C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 8Zhang B. Higuchi M. Yoshiyama Y. Ishihara T. Forman M.S. Martinez D. Joyce S. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4657-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, in vitro studies showed that hyperphosphorylated tau can self-assemble into paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are similar in structure to those found in AD brain (gain of function) (9Alonso A.C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 10Alonso A. Zaidi T. Novak M. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6923-6928Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Although these and other studies clearly indicate that extensive hyperphosphorylation of tau occurs in pathological states, it is becoming increasingly evident that the phosphorylation of specific sites on tau play essential roles in regulating its function. For example, phosphorylation of tau at Thr231 by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) plays a critical role in regulating the ability of tau to bind and stabilize microtubules (11Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tau at Ser262 by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase not only decreases the microtubule binding ability of tau but also attenuates its assembly into PHFs (12Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Schneider A. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Although in situ studies using protein kinases to phosphorylate tau have provided important information about how site-specific phosphorylation of tau affects tau function, there are drawbacks to this approach. For example, tau is not the only substrate that the kinase phosphorylates, and therefore the observed changes in tau function may not be due to direct effect of phosphorylation. Furthermore protein kinases that phosphorylate tau invariably phosphorylate several up to many different sites, and phosphorylation events are often less than stoichiometric, which can complicate the interpretation of those data. Therefore, complementary approaches are needed to determine how the phosphorylation of specific sites affects tau function. One such approach is mutating serine or threonine residues to glutamic acid or aspartic acid (pseudophosphorylation) to mimic the effects of the addition of a phosphate group (14Eidenmuller J. Fath T. Hellwig A. Reed J. Sontag E. Brandt R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13166-13175Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Eidenmuller J. Fath T. Maas T. Pool M. Sontag E. Brandt R. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Previously it has been demonstrated that pseudophosphorylation of both Ser396/Ser404 and Ser422 enhances tau aggregation in vitro (16Abraha A. Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3737-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ferrari A. Hoerndli F. Baechi T. Nitsch R.M. Gotz J. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore it is critically important to understand how the phosphorylation of specific sites on tau modulates its physiological and pathological functions, and the use of pseudophosphorylation of specific residues is an important tool in this process. In addition to abnormal phosphorylation, aberrant cleavage is another pathological posttranslational modification of tau. In vitro, tau is a substrate for caspase-3 (19Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Tau truncated at Asp421, the caspase-3 cleavage site in tau, aggregates more rapidly and to a greater degree than full-length tau, and at the same time, the truncated tau is capable of accelerating filament formation of full-length tau (19Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Investig. 2004; 114: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In vivo, antibodies that specifically recognize tau truncated at Asp421 stain AD brains, and this staining frequently co-localizes with active caspase-3 and fibrillar tau pathologies (19Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Investig. 2004; 114: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Furthermore there is evidence in cultured cell models suggesting that caspase-3-cleaved tau may be neurotoxic (21Fasulo L. Ugolini G. Visintin M. Bradbury A. Brancolini C. Verzillo V. Novak M. Cattaneo A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 624-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Chung C.W. Song Y.H. Kim I.K. Yoon W.J. Ryu B.R. Jo D.G. Woo H.N. Kwon Y.K. Kim H.H. Gwag B.J. Mook-Jung I.H. Jung Y.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In cultured cortical neurons Aβ treatment results in caspase activation and tau cleavage (19Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Given these findings it has been suggested that the cleavage of tau by these proteases may be a key link between Aβ deposits and tau pathology in AD. Therefore, it is important to investigate how tau cleavage regulates its physiological function as a microtubule stabilizer as well as its pathological role in tau aggregation. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that tau truncated at Asp421, but not full-length tau, partitioned into Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction and formed thioflavin S-positive aggregates when co-expressed with GSK3β (23Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54716-54723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This indicates that a combination of phosphorylation and cleavage of tau may coordinate in regulating tau function. To further understand the role of phosphorylation and caspase cleavage in regulating the physiological and pathological functions of tau, we compared tau constructs containing full-length tau (T4) and tau truncated at Asp421 (T4C3), in the absence or presence of site-directed pseudophosphorylation, in regard to their ability to associate with cytoskeleton, bind and stabilize microtubules, and regulate tau self-association. We found that the 2EM (T231E/S235E), 2EC (S396E/S404E), and 4E (T231E/S235E/S396E/S404E) mutations all decreased the association of tau with cytoskeleton and microtubules except that the 2EC mutations had no obvious effect on the binding of T4 to microtubules. In transfected cells, T4C3 was more prevalent in the cytoskeletal and microtubule-associated fractions than T4, whereas in vitro purified recombinant T4 bound microtubules with higher affinity than did T4C3, indicating the importance of cellular factors in regulating tau-microtubule interactions and that, in the cells, phosphorylation of T4 might impair its microtubule binding ability more than caspase cleavage. All the pseudophosphorylation mutations of T4 attenuated the ability of tau to protect microtubules from nocodazole-induced depolymerization as did the 2EC and 4E mutations of T4C3. As demonstrated previously (23Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54716-54723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), co-expression of T4C3 and GSK3β, but not T4 or T4C3 alone, caused tau to form Sarkosyl-insoluble aggregates. Most interestingly, the 2EC mutation resulted in the partitioning of T4, but not T4C3, in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction, whereas the 2EM and 4E mutations had no effects on the partitioning pattern of either T4 or T4C3. Our data suggest that phosphorylation and caspase cleavage differentially affect tau function. In addition these findings support the hypothesis that tau self-association as an initiating step in aggregation may occur on microtubules, and thus microtubules may serve as a nucleation center for seeding tau aggregation (19Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmid Constructs—pcDNA3.1(–)-T4 containing human tau with four microtubule-binding repeats but without exons 2 and 3 and pcDNA3.1(+)-T4C3 with the last 20 amino acids deleted and thus mimicking caspase-cleaved tau have been described previously (23Cho J.H.

Mutant constructs T4-2EM (T231E/S235E), T4-2EC (S396E/S404E), T4-4E (T231E/S235E/S396E/S404E), T4C3-2EM (T231E/S235E), T4C3-2EC (S396E/S404E), and T4C3-4E (T231E/S235E/S396E/S404E) were generated by mutating the indicated threonine or serine to glutamic acid using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 5% bovine growth serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Cellgro). Cells at 50–70% confluency were transiently transfected with the different constructs using Effectene reagent according to manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After transfection, the cells were collected and processed as described below.

Cytoskeleton Association Assay—The assay was carried out as described previously with some modifications (32Fath T. Eidenmuller J. Brandt R. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9733-9741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 30 h after transfection, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline; scraped off the plate; collected by centrifugation; resuspended in prewarmed extraction buffer (0.1 m PIPES/KOH, pH 6.75, 2 m glycerol, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 0.5 μm okadaic acid; and then incubated for 8 min at 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 25 °C. The supernatant fractions (soluble) were collected, and the pellet fractions (cytoskeleton-associated) were resuspended in 2× SDS stop buffer and sonicated briefly. Equal amounts of pellet and supernatant fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and blotted with the Tau5/5A6 antibodies. In Situ Microtubule Binding Assay—The assay was carried out as described previously with some modifications (33Li G. Yin H. Kuret J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15938-15945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly 24 h after transfection, cells were rinsed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in warm microtubule-stabilizing buffer (80 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 30% glycerol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 0.5 μm okadaic acid, and 10 μm Taxol. The samples were then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and an aliquot of the supernatant was retained as the postnuclear lysate (T). The remaining postnuclear lysate was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant (S) was collected, and the pellet (P) was rinsed twice, resuspended in microtubule-stabilizing buffer, and sonicated briefly. Equal amounts of each of the fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and blotted with the Tau5/5A6 antibodies. In Vitro Microtubule Binding Assay—The coding regions for T4, T4C3, and T4C3-4E were subcloned into pGEX-6P-2 vector with glutathione S-transferase tagged to the N terminus of tau. The recombinant GST-tau fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) after induction overnight with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C and purified using an affinity column packed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The glutathione S-transferase tags were cleaved by using PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain purified tau proteins. Purified microtubules were prepared from mouse brain and stabilized with Taxol according to a protocol described previously (34Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). For the in vitro microtubule binding assay, purified tau protein and Taxol-stabilized microtubules were incubated in reaction buffer (80 mm PIPES/KOH, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 10 μm Taxol) for 10 min at 37 °C. The mixture was subsequently loaded onto 30% sucrose in reaction buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g at room temperature (35Leger J. Kempf M. Lee G. Brandt R. J. Biol.

The resultant supernatant (microtubule-unbound) and pellet (microtubule-bound) were collected, and the same percentage of the two fractions was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with Tau5 antibody. Nocodazole Treatment—40 h after transfection with the tau constructs, cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by the cytoskeleton association assay as described above. The pellet and supernatant fractions were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with Tau5 and anti-α-tubulin antibodies. Sarkosyl Fractionation Assay—The assay was carried out as described previously (23Cho J.H.

Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; scraped off the plate; collected by spinning at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; resuspended in Mes buffer (20 mm Mes at pH 6.8, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 20 mm NaF) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; and then homogenized with 30 strokes using a tissue grinder. The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei. Postnuclear lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min to depolymerize the microtubules and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (soluble fraction) were collected, diluted with 2× protein loading buffer, and incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in Mes buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 1% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sarkosyl); vortexed for 30 min at room temperature; incubated overnight at 4 °C; and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (Sarkosyl-soluble fraction) were collected and diluted with 2× protein loading buffer, and the pellets (Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction) were resuspended in 2× protein loading buffer and incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and blotted the Tau5/5A6 antibodies. Statistics—Data were analyzed using Student's t test, and values were considered significantly different when p was <0.05. Generation and Expression of Tau Constructs—To further understand the role of site-specific phosphorylation and caspase cleavage in regulating tau function, we made constructs of full-length tau (T4) or tau truncated at Asp421 (T4C3) that mimics caspase-3 cleavage in the absence or presence of site-directed pseudophosphorylation (T231E/S235E (2EM), S396E/S404E (2EC), and T231E/S235E/S396E/S404E (4E)) (Fig. 1A). The reasons for choosing these sites are that phosphorylation of Thr231 and Ser235 on tau has been suggested to play a critical role in regulating tau-microtubule interactions (11Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and pseudophosphorylation of Ser396/Ser404 was shown to be fibrillogenic in vitro (16Abraha A. Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3737-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to understand how these sites individually and cooperatively affect tau function in situ. HEK cells were transfected with these tau constructs to examine their expression and phosphorylation patterns (Fig. 1B). The Tau5/5A6 blot shows that these constructs were expressed at approximately equivalent levels. As expected, the T4C3 constructs migrated faster than the T4 constructs. T4C3-2EC and T4C3-4E exhibited decreases in electrophoretic mobility compared with their parent tau forms, and T4-2EC and T4-4E presented as a single slow migrating band that corresponded to the top band of the parent construct. These mobility changes are likely due to conformational changes caused by the pseudophosphorylation of Ser396/Ser404 sites on tau, similar to what occurs when these sites are phosphorylated (23Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54716-54723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol.

As expected, PHF-1 and AT-180 did not recognize T4/T4C3-2EC/4E and T4/T4C3-2EM/4E, respectively, due to the indicated mutations. The extent of endogenous phosphorylation of T4 at both"
https://openalex.org/W2046205577,"We have demonstrated earlier that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion is regulated by protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta)-dependent NF-kappaB activation in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs). Here we provide evidence for signaling pathways that regulate LPA-mediated transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the role of cross-talk between G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor-tyrosine kinases in IL-8 secretion in HBEpCs. Treatment of HBEpCs with LPA stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR, which was attenuated by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor (GM6001), heparin binding (HB)-EGF inhibitor (CRM 197), and HB-EGF neutralizing antibody. Overexpression of dominant negative PKCdelta or pretreatment with a PKCdelta inhibitor (rottlerin) or Src kinase family inhibitor (PP2) partially blocked LPA-induced MMP activation, proHB-EGF shedding, and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Down-regulation of Lyn kinase, but not Src kinase, by specific small interfering RNA mitigated LPA-induced MMP activation, proHB-EGF shedding, and EGFR phosphorylation. In addition, overexpression of dominant negative PKCdelta blocked LPA-induced phosphorylation and translocation of Lyn kinase to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, down-regulation of EGFR by EGFR small interfering RNA or pretreatment of cells with EGFR inhibitors AG1478 and PD158780 almost completely blocked LPA-dependent EGFR phosphorylation and partially attenuated IL-8 secretion, respectively. These results demonstrate that LPA-induced IL-8 secretion is partly dependent on EGFR transactivation regulated by PKCdelta-dependent activation of Lyn kinase and MMPs and proHB-EGF shedding, suggesting a novel mechanism of cross-talk and interaction between G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor-tyrosine kinases in HBEpCs."

To provide some insights into the functional role of this region, we studied a deletion variant of the Escherichia coli σ70 subunit that lacked amino acids 513–519 corresponding to the tip of the loop. The deletion had multiple effects on transcription initiation including: (i) a significant decrease in the amount of short abortive RNAs synthesized during initiation, (ii) defects in promoter escape, (iii) loss of the contacts between the σ subunit and the nascent RNA during initiation and, finally, (iv) dramatic increase in the Km value for the 3′-initiating nucleotide. At the same time, the mutation did not impair promoter opening and the binding of the 5′-initiating purine nucleotide. In summary, our data demonstrate an important role of σ region 3.2 in the binding of initiating substrates in RNA polymerase active center and in the process of promoter clearance.

In summary, our data demonstrate an important role of σ region 3.2 in the binding of initiating substrates in RNA polymerase active center and in the process of promoter clearance. The σ subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; nt, nucleotide(s). 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; nt, nucleotide(s). plays the key role in promoter-specific initiation of RNA synthesis. The σ subunit is involved in multiple processes during initiation including initial promoter recognition, DNA melting, abortive synthesis, and promoter clearance (1Gross C.A. Chan C. Dombroski A. Gruber T. Sharp M. Tupy J. Young B. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Recent progress in structural studies of RNAP together with the bulk of biochemical data allowed the creation of an integral picture of transcription initiation and a proposal of functional roles for individual domains of the σ subunit. In RNAP holoenzyme, the σ subunit occupies the upstream part of the main RNAP channel. Two DNA binding domains of σ, involved in the recognition of the –10 and –35 promoter elements, are formed by σ conserved regions 2 and 4 and interact with a coiled-coil element of the β′ subunit and the flap domain of the β subunit, respectively (2Campbell E.A.

Science. 2002; 295: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The promoter recognition domains of σ are connected by a flexible linker formed by conserved region 3.2 (amino acids 498–526 in Escherichia coli numbering). A hairpin-like loop from region 3.2 protrudes toward the active center of RNAP and occupies a part of the RNA exit channel (Fig. 1). This led to several predictions about the functional role of this region. First, the region 3.2 loop was proposed to directly participate in the binding of the 5′-initiating nucleotide in the i-site of the RNAP active center (6Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 7Young B.A. Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 417-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In support of this, E. coli σ70 was shown to cross-link to a 5′-initiating ATP analogue in a segment between amino acids 508 and 561 containing regions 3.2 and 4.1 (8Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no experiments were done demonstrating the functional role for this region in substrate binding. Second, region 3.2 was proposed to play an important role in the process of promoter escape (3Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 6Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A.

Biol. 2003; 13: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). As this region blocks the path for RNA exit (Fig. 1), the elongating RNA transcript must either displace it from the RNA exit channel thus promoting σ dissociation or dissociate itself from the complex and be released as an abortive product. Thus, direct competition between the elongating RNA transcript and region 3.2 may be one of the major causes for abortive initiation. In support of this, deletion of the C-terminal part of σ including region 3.2 was shown to lead to a significant decrease in the amount of abortive products synthesized during initiation from an extended –10 promoter (6Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the deletion also removed σ conserved region 4 that led to multiple defects during initiation and complicated interpretation of the experimental data. The role of region 3.2 in promoter escape has not been directly studied. Intriguingly, a finger-like domain of the eukaryotic general transcription factor TFIIB was found to occupy a similar position at the RNA exit channel of RNAP II and was proposed to clash with the growing RNA during initiation (10Bushnell D.A. Westover K.D. Davis R.E. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2004; 303: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This indicates that prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs may share a common mechanism of abortive synthesis and promoter escape (11Boeger H. Bushnell D.A. Davis R. Griesenbeck J. Lorch Y. Strattan J.S. Westover K.D. Kornberg R.D. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 899-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Pal M. Ponticelli A.S. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that, in agreement with structural predictions, displacement of region 3.2 by nascent RNA is required for efficient promoter escape. At the same time, we demonstrate that σ region 3.2 is not involved in the binding of the 5′-initiating nucleotide at the i-site but instead contributes to the binding of the 3′-substrate at the i+1 site of RNAP active center. Protein Purification—E. coli core RNAP bearing a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of the β′ subunit was purified as described (13Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Kashlev M. Martin E. Polyakov A. Severinov K. Nikiforov V. Goldfarb A. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 130: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mutant rpoD gene encoding the Δ513–519 σ70 subunit was obtained by standard PCR mutagenesis methods. Both wild type and mutant rpoD genes were cloned between the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the pET28 vector and overexpressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The resulting proteins contained a six-histidine tag at the N terminus. Bacterial pellet from 1 liter of cell culture was resuspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) and sonicated. Supernatant obtained after centrifugation was loaded onto a 5-ml chelating HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ and equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with buffer containing 35 mm imidazole, the σ subunit was eluted with 200 mm imidazole and precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The pellet was dissolved in 15 ml of buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and DEAE ion-exchange chromatography was performed as described (13Borukhov S. Goldfarb A. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Transcription in Vitro—DNA fragments bearing the sequences of either wild type or consensus T7A1 promoters (from –85 to +53 nucleotides relative to the starting point of transcription) were obtained by PCR from synthetic oligonucleotide templates. Holoenzyme RNAP was prepared by incubating the core polymerase (100 nm) and either the wild type or the mutant σ70 subunit (500 nm) in transcription buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2) for 5 min at 37 °C. The DNA template was added (30 nm), and the samples were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Nucleotide substrates were added (25 μm concentration of each NTP with addition of [α-32P]GTP, 3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and transcription was proceeded for 5 min. The CpA primer was present at 50 μm, when indicated. RNA products were separated on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Apparent Km values for the initiating substrates were measured on the wild type T7A1 promoter; reactions contained 100 nm core RNAP, 500 nm σ subunit, and 10 nm DNA in 10 μl of the transcription buffer. One of the two initiating nucleotides (ATP or UTP) was taken at 1 mm (with the addition of the corresponding α-32P-labeled nucleotide), while the concentration of the other was varied from 1 μm to 6 mm. The samples were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped with 10 μl of solution containing 8 m urea and 20 mm EDTA. Dinucleotide product was separated from mononucleotides on 30% polyacrylamide gel and quantified with PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The data were fit to the hyperbolic equation V = Vmax[NTP]/(Km + [NTP]) (where V is the observed rate of the reaction, and Vmax is the maximum rate at indefinite concentration of NTP) using GraFit software (Erithacus Software). KMnO4 Footprinting—The promoter DNA fragment used in the footprinting experiments contained a EcoRI site at position –81 relative to the starting point of transcription. DNA was treated with EcoRI and labeled at 3′-end of the template promoter strand with Klenow enzyme (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dATP. Holoenzymes containing either wild type or mutant σ subunits were incubated with the labeled promoter fragment (10 nm) in 10 μl of the transcription buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. 1 μl of 20 mm KMnO4 was added, and the reaction was stopped after 15 s by addition of 5 μl of stop-solution containing 1 m β-mercaptoethanol and 1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8. DNA was processed as described (15Minakhin L. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29710-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and analyzed on 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Cross-linking Experiments—Cross-linking of RNAP subunits with the initiating ATP analogue in the open promoter complex was performed as described (8Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the ATP analogue is shown on Fig. 4A. Prior to cross-linking, the aldehyde group of the reagent was reduced with 10 mm NaBH4 for 10 min at 25 °C. Open complexes formed by either wild type or mutant RNAP on the wild type T7A1 promoter were immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) through a hexahistidine tag present at the C terminus of RNAP β′ subunit and incubated with the ATP analogue (at 1 mm final concentration) for 1 h at 37°C. The uncross-linked reagent was removed by extensive washing with transcription buffer, and the samples were incubated with 100 μm [α-32P]UTP for another 0.5 h at 37 °C. Cross-linking products were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Role of σ Region 3.2 in NTP Binding—To clarify the role of region 3.2 during transcription initiation, we generated a deletion variant of the σ70 subunit lacking amino acids 513–519, which correspond to the tip of the loop formed by this region (amino acid sequence... 512-GDDEDSHLG-520..., the deleted residues are bold underlined) (Fig. 1). The activity of RNAP containing the mutant σ subunit was studied in an in vitro transcription test. Two variants of a T7A1 promoter were used as templates. The first one was the wild type T7A1 promoter; the second (T7A1cons) was based on the sequence of T7A1 but contained two nucleotide changes in the –10 element bringing it to the consensus (TATAAT instead of GATACT in the wild type promoter). Transcription was performed either in the absence or in the presence of a dinucleotide primer (CpA) that was complementary to the –1 and +1 nucleotides of the template promoter strand. The reaction was supplemented with [α-32P]GTP that allowed to label RNA products longer than 4 nucleotides (see the initial transcribed sequence of T7A1 on Fig. 2A). RNAP containing the wild type σ70 subunit was active on both promoters independently of the presence of the primer dinucleotide (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). In contrast, RNAP containing the mutant σ subunit was essentially inactive in the absence of the initiating primer (Fig. 2A, lanes 5 and 6, and Fig. 2C). KMnO4 footprinting demonstrated that the efficiency of promoter melting and the size of transcription bubble in the open promoter complex were the same for wild type and mutant RNAPs (Fig. 2B). Thus, inability of the mutant polymerase to initiate transcription could not be explained by abnormalities in promoter melting. The activity of the mutant RNAP was greatly stimulated in the presence of the initiating dinucleotide CpA (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8, and Fig. 2C). This suggested that the defect of the mutation may be in the binding of initiating substrates and the first phosphodiester bond formation. To test this hypothesis, we determined apparent Km values for the first (ATP, bound at the i-site) and the second (UTP, bound at the i+1-site) initiating NTPs for wild type and mutant RNAPs in a reaction of dinucleotide synthesis on the T7A1 promoter (Fig. 3). We found that the deletion of amino acids 513–519 from region 3.2 did not impair the binding of the 5′-initiating nucleotide (ATP). In fact, the mutant had even lower Km value for ATP than the wild type polymerase (450 ± 200 μm versus 920 ± 300 μm for wild type RNAP) (Fig. 3). This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the RNA polymerase initiation site, specific for purine nucleotides, is present in the core RNAP and neither the DNA template nor the σ subunit is required for its formation (16Naryshkina T. Mustaev A. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13308-13313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At the same time, the mutation had dramatic effect on Km for the second substrate (UTP) which was increased by about two orders of magnitude (250 ± 70 μm versus 3.3 ± 0.6 μm for wild type RNAP) (Fig. 3). From this, we conclude that inability of the mutant RNAP to start RNA synthesis from mononucleotides can be attributed to the defect in the binding of 3′-initiating NTP in the RNAP active center. To test whether region 3.2 could be involved in direct contacts with initiating nucleotides, we performed a cross-linking experiment using a γ-phosphate-modified initiating ATP analogue (Fig. 4A) (8Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alkylating group of the reagent has a broad specificity and can react with any nucleophilic amino acid side chain (17Severinov K. Mustaev A. Severinova E. Kozlov M. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29428-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Prior to the cross-linking, the aldehyde group of the analogue was reduced with NaBH4 that resulted in a significant increase of the reactivity of the alkylating group (17Severinov K. Mustaev A. Severinova E. Kozlov M. Darst S.A. Goldfarb A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29428-29432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Previously, this reagent was shown to cross-link between amino acids 508 and 561 of the σ70 subunit in the initiating promoter complex (8Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We repeated the cross-linking experiment with RNAP containing the Δ513–519 σ subunit. The experiment was done in two steps. First, open complexes formed by the wild type and mutant RNAPs on the T7A1 promoter were immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and incubated with the ATP analogue to allow its covalent attachment to RNAP subunits. Second, the uncross-linked reagent was removed by extensive washing and the samples were incubated with [α-P32]UTP. This resulted in the attachment of the radioactive label specifically to those ATP molecules that were cross-linked in the vicinity of the RNAP active center. In accordance with published data, in the case of wild type RNAP the cross-links were formed with the σ and β/β′ subunits (Fig. 4B, lane 2). In contrast, only the large subunit(s) was labeled in the case of the mutant RNAP (with the efficiency of about 40% as compared with the wild type polymerase) (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Core RNAP did not form any cross-links confirming that the reaction was specific for the open promoter complex (Fig. 4B, lane 1). The absence of cross-linking in the case of the mutant σ subunit strongly suggested that in the wild type σ the cross-link was localized between amino acids 513 and 519. Thus, in the open promoter complex the region 3.2 loop is located in a close proximity to the RNAP active site (the distance between σ and the 5′-carbon atom of the initiating ATP should be less than 18 Å, which is the length of the cross-linking arm in an extended conformation, Fig. 4A). This region of σ may therefore directly participate in substrate binding during initiation. It should be noted, however, that in the structure of the Thermus thermophilus holoenzyme RNAP this region is located too far from the active site to contact initiating NTPs (the closest distance between σ and initiating nucleotides in the model of the open promoter complex is more than 12 Å, Fig. 1) (3Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 18Artsimovitch I. Patlan V. Sekine S. Vassylyeva M.N. Hosaka T. Ochi K. Yokoyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus, during initiation of RNA synthesis, the region 3.2 loop may adopt a more extended conformation to allow direct contacts with initiating substrates. Alternatively, σ might contribute to the binding of the 3′-initiating substrate by an allosteric mechanism. Indeed, it was proposed that region 3.2 may affect the structure of the RNAP active center by changing the conformation of the template DNA strand (19Artsimovitch I. Vassylyeva M.N. Svetlov D. Svetlov V. Perederina A. Igarashi N. Matsugaki N. Wakatsuki S. Tahirov T.H. Vassylyev D.G. Cell. 2005; 122: 351-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The experimental validation of this hypothesis is a subject of further studies. Role of σ Region 3.2 in Abortive Initiation and Promoter Escape—Transcription on the mutant T7A1cons promoter resulted in the synthesis of a large number of short RNA transcripts up to 16 nucleotides in length (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Control experiments demonstrated that these RNAs were not associated with transcribing RNAP and therefore represented real abortive products (data not shown). In this property, the T7A1cons promoter is similar to the semisynthetic T5 N25antiDSR promoter (20Hsu L.M. Vo N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11588-11592Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, in the case of T5 N25antiDSR the appearance of long abortive products was associated with unfavorable initially transcribed sequence, while in the case of T7A1cons it is most likely a result of strong interactions between RNAP and the core promoter region. T7A1cons was therefore used as a model promoter to compare the processes of abortive synthesis and promoter escape by the wild type and mutant RNAPs. The reaction was performed in the presence of the CpA primer, i.e. at conditions when both RNAPs were active. The efficiency of the full-length RNA synthesis by wild type RNAP on T7A1cons was about 2-fold lower than on the wild type promoter indicative of the problems in promoter clearance (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4, and Fig. 2C). The defect in promoter clearance became more pronounced in the case of mutant RNAP that synthesized four times less of the full-length transcript on the consensus promoter as compared with the wild type template (Fig. 2A, lanes 7 and 8, and Fig. 2C). Analysis of the abortive products synthesized on the T7A1cons promoter in the presence of CpA revealed that the mutant RNAP produced much lower amounts of short 5–7-nt transcripts relative to the wild type polymerase (Fig. 2, A and D). At the same type, the ratio of longer abortive transcripts (8–16 nt) to the full-length RNA was severalfold higher for the mutant enzyme than for wild type RNAP (Fig. 2D). This indicated that although removal of σ region 3.2 stabilized short RNAs in the RNAP active center, it resulted in the increase of the amount of longer transcripts and led to a general defect in promoter escape. Our data are in agreement with the results of Hernandez et al. (21Hernandez V.J. Hsu L.M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18775-18779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that mutations in positions 504 and 506 of σ70 region 3.2 decreased the number of short abortive RNAs (4–8 nt) but stimulated synthesis of longer (9–10 nt) abortive transcripts. In general, these results suggest that direct competition between σ region 3.2 and growing RNA during initiation facilitates promoter clearance, probably by weakening the contacts of the σ subunit with core RNAP or/and the non-template DNA strand. This is consistent with the conclusions made from structural consideration (6Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 7Young B.A. Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 417-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The increase in the amount of long abortive transcripts in the case of the mutant σ subunit is likely explained by steric clashing of growing RNA with the C-terminal part of the σ subunit further upstream of the RNAP active site (see Fig. 1). Remarkably, the longest abortive transcript that was synthesized in large quantities by both wild type and mutant RNAPs had the length of 16 nucleotides. Longer transcripts were present in much lower quantities and their synthesis did not differ between the two polymerases (Fig. 2 and data not shown). These data are in agreement with the recently proposed model that region 4 of σ70 bound to the β-flap domain presents a barrier to the RNA elongation past 16 nucleotides (3Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 22Nickels B.E. Garrity S.J. Mekler V. Minakhin L. Severinov K. Ebright R.H. Hochschild A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The RNA-mediated displacement of σ region 4 from the β-flap results in the formation of a stable elongation complex and stopping of abortive synthesis. As the length of long abortive products does not differ for the wild type and mutant RNAPs, this final step of promoter clearance is apparently unaffected by the mutation. It is interesting to compare our results with the results of Zenkin et al. (23Zenkin N. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), who studied initiation of primer RNA synthesis on the single stranded DNA replication origin of bacteriophage M13. On that template, the core enzyme alone was able to synthesize the first phosphodiester bond from two initiating NTPs but was unable to elongate RNA beyond the second position in the absence of the σ70 subunit or in the case of mutant σ lacking amino acids 507–519 from region 3.2 (23Zenkin N. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although core RNAP possessed certain defects in the binding of the 3′-substrate (whose apparent Km was increased ∼10 times in comparison with the holoenzyme), 3N. Zenkin, personal communication. these defects could not explain its inability to synthesize the full-length RNA as the core was unable to escape into elongation even in the presence of high concentrations of a dinucleotide primer. It was therefore proposed that the main role of the σ subunit was to stabilize short abortive transcripts in the RNAP active center and allow them to be elongated (23Zenkin N. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4396-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that, during initiation on the double stranded T7A1 promoter, region 3.2 of σ is indispensable for the binding of the 3′-initiating nucleotide and the first phosphodiester bond formation but is not absolutely required for the subsequent cycles of nucleotide addition. This demonstrates that RNAP can use different mechanisms for initiation of RNA synthesis on different kinds of templates. We thank N. Zenkin, V. G. Nikiforov, and L. Minakhin for helpful discussions and I. Artsimovitch for reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2019070114,"The Nef protein is a key determinant of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pathogenicity that, among other activities, sensitizes T-lymphocytes for optimal virus production. The initial events by which Nef modulates the T-cell receptor (TCR) cascade are poorly understood. TCR engagement triggers actin rearrangements that control receptor clustering for signal initiation and dynamic organization of signaling protein complexes to form an immunological synapse. Here we report that Nef potently interferes with cell spreading and formation of actin-rich circumferential rings in T-lymphocytes upon surface-supported TCR stimulation. These effects were conserved among Nef proteins from different lentiviruses and occurred in HIV-1-infected primary human T-lymphocytes. This novel Nef activity critically depended on its Src homology 3 domain binding motif and required efficient association with Pak2 activity. Notably, whereas overall signaling microcluster formation immediately following TCR engagement occurred normally in Nef-expressing cells, the viral protein inhibited the concomitant activation of the actin organizer N-Wasp. During the subsequent maturation phase of the stimulatory contact, Nef interfered with the translocation of N-Wasp to the cell periphery, the overall induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, and the selective recruitment of phosphorylated LAT to stimulatory contacts. Consistent with such a critical role of N-Wasp in this process, Nef also blocked morphological changes induced by the known N-Wasp regulators Rac1 and Cdc42. Together, our results demonstrate that Nef alters both the amount and composition of signaling microclusters. We propose modulation of actin dynamics as an important mechanism for Nef-induced alterations of TCR signaling. The Nef protein is a key determinant of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pathogenicity that, among other activities, sensitizes T-lymphocytes for optimal virus production. The initial events by which Nef modulates the T-cell receptor (TCR) cascade are poorly understood. TCR engagement triggers actin rearrangements that control receptor clustering for signal initiation and dynamic organization of signaling protein complexes to form an immunological synapse. Here we report that Nef potently interferes with cell spreading and formation of actin-rich circumferential rings in T-lymphocytes upon surface-supported TCR stimulation.

Whereas the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, Nef facilitates immune evasion of infected cells and directly boosts virus spread. These effector functions probably reflect the ability of Nef to serve as a protein-interaction adaptor that modulates cellular vesicle transport and signal transduction machineries (5Arora V.K.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In CD4+ T-lymphocytes, one of the major HIV-1 target cell populations in vivo, Nef lowers the threshold of TCR activation possibly to induce an intermediate activation state that is permissive for HIV-1 replication (7Schrager J.A.

Several protein assemblies, including the association with the Nef-associated kinase complex, the guanine exchange factors Vav and DOCK2-ELMO1, and the TCR ζ chain, are involved in the modulation of TCR signaling by Nef (13Baur A.S.

Med. 1999; 189: 1489-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, it has not been addressed how Nef affects early events of TCR signal initiation. Physiologically, TCR triggering occurs in the context of a close contact between a T-cell and antigen presenting cell referred to as the immunological synapse (IS). Within this highly dynamic structure, spatial redistribution of select cell surface receptors leads to receptor clustering as well as subsequent recruitment and activation of receptor-proximal signaling machineries, and this then initiates signal transduction (17Dustin M.L. Cooper J.A. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 18Friedl P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Whereas stable synapse formation is not an absolute prerequisite for signaling (19Lee K.H. Dinner A.R. Tu C. Campi G. Raychaudhuri S. Varma R. Sims T.N. Burack W.R. Wu H. Wang J. Kanagawa O. Markiewicz M. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Chakraborty A.K. Shaw A.S. Science. 2003; 302: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), the profound actin rearrangements that parallel IS formation conceivably drive segregation of surface receptors and receptor-proximal signaling machineries to modulate, amplify, and stabilize output signals.In a well established experimental system for studies of early TCR signal transduction events, incubation of T-cells on TCR-stimulatory surfaces leads to the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia cell protrusions that contact the substratum to cause rapid cell spreading. This process is paralleled by marked rearrangements of F-actin into a pronounced circumferential actinrich ring (20Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2001; 14: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 21Parsey M.V. Lewis G.K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 1881-1893PubMed Google Scholar, 22Douglass A.D. Vale R.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 937-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Initial contact with the stimulatory surface triggers immediate clustering of TCR molecules and proximal machinery into microclusters at the contact sites in the cell center, leading to rapid induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. This experimental system thus reflects the hallmarks of TCR signal transduction, closely parallels the dynamic events triggered by major histocompatibility class I-mediated antigen presentation on planar bilayers, and is particularly well suited for the time-resolved analysis of actin dynamics upon TCR engagement (23Barda-Saad M.

Med. 2005; 202: 1031-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Of note, signaling microclusters are highly dynamic; within minutes, maturation of cell-substratum contacts by cell spreading is paralleled by the continuous induction of such clusters at the cell periphery. Recent data suggest an important role of peripheral as well as central microclusters for initiation and duration of TCR signals (26Yokosuka T. Sakata-Sogawa K. Kobayashi W. Hiroshima M. Hashimoto-Tane A. Tokunaga M. Dustin M.L. Saito T. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Presumably reflecting the physical association of the TCR with the actin cytoskeleton, microcluster formation requires intact F-actin filaments. Experimental disruption of F-actin prior to TCR stimulation blunts signal transmission (20Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E.

Consistent with such a role of actin dynamics, the Wave2 actin-organizing complex was recently demonstrated to play a critical role in morphological changes and signal transduction on TCR-stimulatory surfaces (29Nolz J.C.

For T-cell spreading, the monoclonal antibodies anti-CD3 (clone HIT3a) and anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2) were used (both from BD Pharmingen). Further analyses were performed with the following antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-p24CA (31Muller B. Daecke J. Fackler O.T. Dittmar M.T. Zentgraf H. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10803-10813Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine (BD Pharmingen), rabbit anti-phospho-Zap70, rabbit anti-Pak1/2/3 (both from Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-LAT (Upstate Technology, Inc.), rabbit anti-phospho-N-Wasp (Abcam), and monoclonal antibodies phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD3 (clone SK7 and HIT3a, respectively) (BD Pharmingen). The allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was from Jackson ImmunoResearch, and all other secondary fluorescent antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. For F-actin stain tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated (Sigma and Cytoskeleton) or Alexa Fluor 660-conjugated (Molecular Probes), phalloidin was used. The N-Wasp inhibitor wiskostatin was obtained from Calbiochem.Expression Constructs—Most expression constructs for Nef.GFP fusion proteins and the bicistronic Nef expression vectors as well as the HIV-1 wild type and Δnef proviruses along with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein expression plasmid were described recently (32Michel N. Allespach I. Venzke S. Fackler O.T. Keppler O.T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 714-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The expression constructs for GFP fusion proteins for the Δ12-39 and Δ12-39/EDAA Nef variants were generated accordingly. To create the expression construct for Nef.RFP, the gene encoding for mRFP1 was amplified using pRSETB mRFP1 as template (kindly provided by Roger Tsien) (33Campbell E.M. Nunez R. Hope T.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5745-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The amplified mrfp1 gene was used to replace the egfp gene in the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) by using two newly introduced 5′ BamHI and 3′ NotI sites. The resulting pmRFP-N1 expression vector has intermediate sequences between the multiple cloning site and the fluorescent gene open reading frame identical to those of the pEGFP-N1 vector, as has been confirmed by sequence analysis. The HIV-1SF2 nef gene was subsequently introduced via BglII and EcoRI, resulting in the vector pmRFP-Nef. Correct expression of RFP and Nef.RFP was confirmed using confocal microscopy. Co-expression of Nef.GFP and Nef.RFP in CHO cells resulted in a very pronounced colocalization of both proteins (Fig. S5). The expression constructs for GFP fusion proteins of activated Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 have been described (34Gasteier J.E. Madrid R. Krautkramer E. Schroder S. Muranyi W. Benichou S. Fackler O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38902-38912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The expression construct for GFP-tagged N-Wasp was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Way.Analysis of TCR-mediated Cell Spreading and Actin Ring Formation—T-cell spreading on stimulatory surfaces was analyzed essentially as described (20Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2001; 14: 315-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Briefly, microscope cover glasses (Marienfeld) were cleaned with 1 m HCl, 70% ethanol for 30 min and dried at 60 °C for 30 min before treating with a 0.01% poly-l-lysine (Sigma) solution for 5 min. For antibody coating, dried cover glasses were then covered with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies diluted in PBS (each 7 μg/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, the cover glasses were stored in PBS at 4 °C. 5 × 106 Jurkat TAg cells were transfected via electroporation (15-40 μg of total plasmid DNA, 960 microfarads, 250 V; Bio-Rad Genepulser). 24 h post-transfection (48 h in the case of the bicistronic Nef expression vectors and associated controls; 17 h after infection), 3 × 105 Jurkat cells were plated on the treated cover glasses and incubated for various time periods at 37 °C and were subsequently fixed for 10 min by directly adding 3% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min, cells were blocked with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by incubating cells with 1:50-1: 800 diluted primary antibodies for 2 h (overnight for anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phospho-Zap70, and anti-phospho-LAT, which were diluted in Tris-buffered saline). After washing with PBS, fluorochrome-labeled secondary antibodies (1:2000) were added for 30 min. For F-actin staining, cells were treated with fluorochrome-conjugated phalloidin (1:400-1:1000) in combination with the secondary antibodies or directly after the blocking step. Nuclei were stained with 2.5 ng/μl Hoechst (Sigma). Cover glasses were mounted in Histomount (Linaris) and analyzed with a LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss). Images were taken using a ×100 oil immersion objective and processed using Adope Photoshop. For real time imaging, eight-chambered cover glasses (Lab-Tek) were coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies as described above. 24 h post-transfection, 5 × 105 Jurkat cells in 50 μl of complete RPMI 1640 medium were injected into the chambers that were preloaded with 100 ml of medium. Real time imaging was performed at 37 °C with 5% CO2 using the ×100 oil objective (numerical aperture 1.4) of an Axiovert 200M epifluorescent microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a CCD camera (Cascade II; Roper Scientific). Time lapse images were taken every 15 s, edited using Metamorph Software (Molecular Devices), and exported as Quick Time videos.HIV-1 Production and Infection—Virus stocks were generated by co-transfection of proviral HIV plasmids into 293T cells as described (32Michel N. Allespach I. Venzke S. Fackler O.T. Keppler O.T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 714-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For infection of Jurkat cells, virus stocks were generated in the presence of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. Two days after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested. The HIV-1 p24 antigen concentration was determined by a p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 250-9000 ng of p24 were used to infect 1 × 106 Jurkat cells. 17 h postinfection, cells were subjected to actin ring formation analysis as described above, except that the cells were stained for F-actin and p24CA to identify productively infected cells. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated as described previously (35Keppler O.T. Allespach I. Schuller L. Fenard D. Greene W.C. Fackler O.T. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 1655-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in complete RPMI and stimulated with 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma) and 20 nm human recombinant interleukin-2 (a gift from Chiron Corp.) for 2 days before infection with 200 ng of p24. After 7 days of culturing the infected cells in the presence of interleukin-2, actin ring formation was analyzed analogous to the Jurkat cell infections.Intensity and Cell Diameter Measurements—F-actin levels of transiently transfected Jurkat cells on stimulatory surfaces were analyzed by determination of the pixel intensity of the F-actin fluorescent preparations. Serial confocal sections of x-y images from individual cells along the z-axis were obtained scanning a representative number of cells from the top to the bottom. Using ImageJ software, stacks of single sections were projected to one image, and the integrated pixel density of the phalloidin stain was determined for each cell. Mean cell diameters were analyzed using an Olympus IX-70 microscope and a distant measurement tool of Soft Imaging System Analysis software. Analyses of total pixel intensities of anti-phosphoimmunofluorescence preparations were obtained similarly as described for F-actin intensities. Contact site recruitment of the respective protein was determined by comparing the integrated pixel intensity of the confocal section representing the surface contact with the total integrated pixel intensity. Statistical analyses were performed with Student's t test.Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Analyses were performed using a FACSCalibur with BD CellQuest Pro 4.0.2 Software (BD Pharmingen) at 24 h post-transfection. To determine the steady-state F-actin intensity, Jurkat T-lymphocytes were washed with PBS and fixed in solution by adding an equal volume of 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were pelleted and resuspended with 1:1000 diluted fluorescent-conjugated Phalloidin in PBS, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% saponin. After a 45-min incubation, cells were washed with PBS and analyzed. For quantification of steadystate cell surface levels, cells were pelleted and stained for 30 min on ice in PBS with an allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD3 (clone HIT3a) and nonconjugated anti-CD28 antibody (clone CD28.2) (both from BD Pharmingen), respectively. Incubation with a secondary allophycocyanin-conjugated antimouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min on ice followed the anti-CD28 stain.In Vitro Kinase Assay (IVKA)—IVKA from total lysates was performed as described earlier (36Krautkramer E. Giese S.I. Gasteier J.E. Muranyi W. Fackler O.T. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4085-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).RNAi—For Pak2 knockdown experiments, 1 × 107 Jurkat cells were transfected via electroporation as described above with 15 μg of total plasmid DNA of the expression construct for Nef.GFP together with 500 pmol of small interfering RNA oligonucleotide specific for Pak2 (5′-AGAAGGAACUGAUCAUUAATT-3′) or a nonspecific control oligonucleotide (5′-AGGUAGUGUAAUCGCCUUGTT-3′) (both from MWG-Biotech).RESULTSNef Prevents Circumferential Actin Ring Formation of Jurkat T-cells on TCR-stimulatory Surfaces—Nef has been proposed to functionally interact with the actin cytoskeleton (14Fackler O.T. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Campbell E.M. Nunez R. Hope T.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5745-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 37Quaranta M.G. Mattioli B. Spadaro F. Straface E. Giordani L. Ramoni C. Malorni W. Viora M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, effects of Nef on actin organization in T-lymphocytes have not been studied. We therefore investigated the impact of Nef on TCR-induced actin rearrangements in Jurkat T-lymphocytes that were plated on glass surfaces coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Most GFP-expressing control Jurkat T-lymphocytes spread on the cover glass surface within 10 min and displayed thick circumferential F-actin rings that contained multiple pronounced F-actin bundles with perpendicular orientation (Fig. 1A, GFP, bottom). Very similar phenotypes were induced by stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies alone (data not shown). Uncoated surfaces allowed cell adhesion and some spreading including the accumulation of some F-actin at the contact site, at cell-cell contacts, and at the periphery, where sometimes membrane ruffling and the formation of microspikes was observed. However, no formation of F-actin rings was observed under these conditions (Fig. 1A, GFP, top). In sharp contrast, Jurkat T-cells expressing a fusion protein of Nef from HIV-1SF2 with GFP (Nef.GFP) were markedly impaired in the formation of actin-rich rings and in spreading in response to TCR engagement despite the accumulation of F-actin at the cell periphery (Fig. 1A, Nef.GFP, bottom). Actin rings also did not appear at later time points in Nef.GFP-expressing cells (data not shown). Whereas Nef.GFP was present at cell-substratum contacts, the viral protein was not particularly enriched in distinct clusters and was found most prominently at the plasma membrane and at a membranous organelle in the cytoplasm. The disruption of actin organization by Nef was most prominent upon specific TCR engagement and did not significantly affect the behavior of cells on uncoated cover glasses (Fig. 1A, Nef.GFP, top) in most experiments. Occasionally, however, we observed that, even on uncoated cover glasses or cover glasses coated with an irrelevant isotype-matched control antibody, Nef.GFP-expressing cells appeared less efficiently spread and with less pronounced F-actin structures than GFP-expressing controls (data not shown). Consistent with this, Nef.GFP-expressing Jurkat T-lymphocytes in suspension displayed ∼20% reduced steady-state F-actin levels relative to GFP-expressing control cells (Fig. S1). A quantification of the inhibitory effect of Nef.GFP on TCR-induced actin rearrangements revealed that only 10-15% of cells expressing Nef.GFP were able to induce the formation of pronounced actin rings, whereas 65-70% of GFP-expressing (GFP) or untransfected (mock) control cells readily responded to TCR stimulation (Fig. 1B). Of note, steady-state cell surface levels of the CD3 and CD28 receptors required for stimulation were unaffected by Nef.GFP expression (Fig. S2). To monitor the impact of Nef on the dynamics of actin polymerization in the process of contact maturation, live cell imaging was performed on cells expressing actin fused to GFP together with mRFP1 (RFP) or a fusion protein of Nef with mRFP1 (Nef.RFP) (see Fig. S5 for the characterization of Nef.RFP fusion proteins). Individual cells were monitored starting from the initial contact with the stimulatory surface. Selected frames from the indicated time points are presented in Fig. 1C, the corresponding movies can be viewed as supplemental material. In RFP expressing control cells, initial contact immediately resulted in the increase of actin polymerization in particular at the cell periphery resulting in the formation of a circumferential actin ring and pronounced cell spreading within the first 2 min. Subsequently, cell spreading was maintained, and local waves of actin polymerization induced highly dynamic lamellipodia at the cell periphery over the entire period of observation. In sharp contrast, the induction of actin polymerization and cell spreading was potently suppressed in cells expressing Nef.RFP (bottom). While these cells remained attached to the initial contact site, only localized bursts of actin polymerization at the periphery were observed that sometimes led to formation of individual protrusions (see 180 s time point). These Nef.RFP-expressing cells, however, failed to develop mature circumferential actin rings and did not spread. More detailed analysis of this phenomenon on fixed cells after a 10-min incubation on stimulatory surfaces corroborated a net effect of Nef on cell spreading; diameters of Nef.GFP-expressing cells (26.0 ± 8.0 μm(n = 32)) were significantly reduced relative to the GFP-expressing control cells (43.6 ± 8.6 μm(n = 32)) (Fig. 2, A and B). Despite this reduction in cell spreading, Nef.GFP had no detectable effect on the ability of cells to contact and adhere to the stimulatory surface (Fig. S3). To distinguish whether the Nef-induced disruption of F-actin ring formation was due to a failure in the distribution of F-actin to the contact site or caused by an overall reduction in F-actin levels, z-sections of the cells were taken from top to bottom, and the overall F-actin fluorescence was quantified (Figs. 2, C and D). Expression of Nef.GFP significantly reduced F-actin levels in cells following TCR stimulation relative to the GFP control (35,870 ± 16,070 arbitrary units (n = 36) versus 81,710 ± 30,630 arbitrary units (n = 30)). Thus, Nef.GFP efficiently disrupts actin rearrangements and T-lymphocyte spreading in response to TCR engagement, and this is paralleled by a reduction of overall cellular F-actin levels.FIGURE 2Nef interferes with cell spreading and actin polymerization following TCR engagement.

During attempts to understand the mode of regulation of H2A.z, we found that overexpression of silent information regulator 2alpha (Sir2α) specifically induced down-regulation of H2A.z via NAD-dependent activity. This effect was reversed by the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin, suggesting a Sir2α-mediated ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent mechanism for degradation of H2A.z. An increase in Sir2α also resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the response to hypertrophic stimuli, whereas its inhibition resulted in enhanced hypertrophy and apoptosis. We have shown that Sir2α directly deacetylates H2A.z. Mutagenesis proved that lysines 4, 7, 11, and 13 do not play a role in the stability of H2A.z, whereas Lys-15 was indispensable. Meanwhile, Lys-115 and conserved, ubiquitinatable Lys-121 are critical for Sir2α-mediated degradation. Fusion of the C terminus of H2A.z (amino acids 115-127) to H2A.x or green fluorescence protein conferred Sir2α-inducible degradation to the former protein only. Because H2A.x and H2A.z have conserved N-tails, this implied that both the C and N termini are critical for mediating the effect of Sir2α. In short, the results suggest that H2A.z is required for cardiac hypertrophy, where its stability and the extent of cell growth and apoptosis are moderated by Sir2α. We also propose that Sir2α is involved in deacetylation of H2A.z, which results in ubiquitination of Lys-115 and Lys-121 and its degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathway.

H2A.z is an essential histone variant. Disruption of H2A.z in mice is embryonic lethal at a very early stage (E 4.5) (1Faast R. Thonglairoam V. Schulz T.C. Beall J. Wells J.R. Taylor H. Matthaei K. Rathjen P.D. Tremethick D.J. Lyons I. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1183-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Likewise, H2A.z is vital for the development of Drosophila melanogaster (2van Daal A. Elgin S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and is indispensable in Tetrahymena thermophila (3Liu X. Li B. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4305-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In yeast, disruption of H2A.z results in slow growth and formamide sensitivity and is not rescued by the major H2A but is rescued by T. thermophila H2A.z variant (4Jackson J.D. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3811-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These reports provide evidence that H2A.z has a vital and non-redundant role and that it is conserved among species. One of the mechanisms for transcriptional regulation involves the replacement of core histones with more specialized variants. A report by Abbott et al. (5Abbott D.W. Ivanova V.S. Wang X. Bonner W.M. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41945-41949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) shows that nucleosomes harboring H2A.z are destabilized, being less compact than nucleosomes harboring the core histone H2A. This is also supported by the crystal structure of a nucleosome core containing H2A.z that exhibits subtle differences compared with the H2A nucleosomes, which account for instability between the H2A.z-H2B dimer and the H3-H4 tetramer (6Suto R.K. Clarkson M.J. Tremethick D.J. Luger K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1121-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a role for H2A.z in nucleosomal remodeling to reduce its structural compactness, thereby facilitating the binding of transcription factors. It should be noted though that this might not be the sole function of H2A.z in the cell. It has been shown that during development H2A.z is first turned on at the onset of differentiation and appears to localize to the pericentric heterochromatin (7Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1599-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), where it has been suggested to play a role in chromosome segregation (8Rangasamy D. Greaves I. Tremethick D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In yeast, there is an abundance of evidence that suggests that H2A.z is a transcriptional regulator, for which multiple mechanisms have been described. One mechanism proposes that H2A.z recruits RNA polymerase II (9Adam M. Robert F. Larochelle M. Gaudreau L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6270-6279Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The study showed that depletion of H2A.z abrogates GAL1-10 expression, which was rescued by H2A.z replacement but not by a mutant with a C-terminal domain of H2A. This domain of H2A.z interacted with RNA polymerase II and recruited it to the GAL1-10 promoters. Another mechanism for H2A.z function that has proven operational in yeast is reminiscent of nucleosomal remodeling, which is a prerequisite for recruitment of transcriptional factors. Nucleosomal remodeling is a function of the SNF/SWI complex, which can be to a great extent substituted for by H2A.z in a SNF deletion mutant (10Santisteban M.S. Kalashnikova T. Smith M.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). A third mechanism proposes that H2A.z prevents the spread of silent heterochromatin into euchromatin regions. Microarray studies showed that H2A.z is bound to genes near the telomeres (11Meneghini M.D. Wu M. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Deletion of H2A.z silenced those genes, but interestingly a second deletion of the telomere-silencing gene Sir2 3The abbreviations used are: Sir2α, silent information regulator 2α; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; SirT1, silent information regulator T1; Cdk7, cyclin-dependent kinase 7; NAM, nicotinamide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ad, adenovirus; Et, endothelin. 3The abbreviations used are: Sir2α, silent information regulator 2α; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; SirT1, silent information regulator T1; Cdk7, cyclin-dependent kinase 7; NAM, nicotinamide; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Ad, adenovirus; Et, endothelin. rescued the phenotype. This suggested that H2A.z functions by antagonizing the spread of Sir2-dependent gene silencing. Sir2 is a class III histone deacetylase (12Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar), also known to deacetylate p53 (13Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D. Su F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W. Cell. 2001; 107: 137-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, it has been proposed that SirT1 (the human homologue of Sir2) functions by deacetylating H3-Lys-16 and H3-Lys-9, recruiting H1, thereby promoting formation of heterochromatin (14Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Similar to yeast, it has been shown that calorie restriction in mammalian cells activates SirT1, which reduces stress-induced apoptosis, thus increasing the life span of the cell (15Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Likewise, in cardiac myocytes Sir2α (the mouse homologue of Sir2) is anti-apoptotic (16Alcendor R.R. Kirshenbaum L.A. Imai S. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). There are 7 isoforms of mammalian Sir2 that exhibit differential cellular and tissue distribution where SirT1 appears to have the highest homology to yeast Sir2. Noteworthy is that disruption of its gene in a mouse model resulted in embryonic lethality due to cardiac defects (17Cheng H.L. Mostoslavsky R. Saito S. Manis J.P. Gu Y. Patel P. Bronson R. Appella E. Alt F.W. Chua K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10794-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that H2A.z and Sir2α oppose one another to regulate cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Both are found up-regulated in the hypertrophic heart, where H2A.z is essential for the expression of some of the growth-related genes such as cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) and ribosomal S6. On the other hand, Sir2α induces H2A.z degradation and reduces hypertrophy. The effect of Sir2α is NAD-dependent and mediated through the N- and C-tails of H2A.z. The results suggest that Sir2α deacetylates Lys-15, resulting in ubiquitination of Lys-115 and Lys-121 and degradation of H2A.z. Culturing Cardiac Myocyte and Adenovirus Infection—Cardiac myocytes were prepared as previously described (18Abdellatif M. Mcllelan W.R. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15423-15426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were isolated from 1-2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. After dissociation the cells were subjected to Percoll gradient centrifugation followed by differential preplating to enrich for cardiac myocytes and deplete non-myocytes. Cells were then plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham F12 with 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 0.5-1 × 105 cells/cm2. 24 h after plating, serum was removed and the cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10-20 particles/cell. These cells were analyzed 20-24 h after infection unless otherwise indicated. For cells infected with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expressing virus, the cells were harvested after 96 h to allow enough time for depletion of endogenous proteins. Mutagenesis—H2A.z and H2A.x were cloned by PCR from a mouse heart cDNA library. The H2A.z mutants were generated by PCR where the mutations were built into the primers. All constructs were subsequently validated by sequencing and then cloned into adenoviruses. H2A.x/H2A.z and GFP/H2A.z were likewise constructed by a PCR reaction in which the 3′-primer included the H2A.z tail (bp 440-482). The H2A.x/H2A.z fusion excludes the H2A.x C-tail. Construction of Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed, propagated, and determined as previously described by Dr. Frank Graham (19Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 7. The Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 109-128Google Scholar). Briefly, pBHGloxΔE1,3Cre (Microbix), including the ΔE1 adenoviral genome, was cotransfected with the pDC shuttle vector containing the gene of interest into 293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Through homologous recombination, the test genes integrate into the E1-deleted adenoviral genome. The viruses were propagated on 293 cells and purified using CsCl2 banding followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-buffered saline with 2% glycerol. Titering was performed on 293 cells overlaid with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% equine serum and 0.5% agarose. All viruses listed in this report were constructed in the laboratory except for the Sir2α virus, which was kindly provided by Dr. Sadoshima. Construction of shRNA Adenoviral Expression Vectors—pSilencer 1.0-U6 expression vector was purchased from Ambion. The U6 RNA polymerase III-dependent promoter and the polycloning region were subcloned into the adenoviral shuttle vector pDC311 (Microbix). The hairpin-forming oligo corresponding to bases 460-480 of mouse H2A.z, GenBank™ accession number NM_016750, and its antisense with ApaI- and Hind III-compatible overhangs, were synthesized, annealed, and subcloned distal to the U6 promoter (20Yue Y. Lypowy J. Hedhli N. Abdellatif M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12883-12889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus was generated using homologous recombination in 293 as described above. Cell Fractionation and Western Blotting—Cells were fractionated into cytosol, membranes, nuclei, and cytoskeleton using the Subcellular ProteoExtract kit from Calbiochem according to the manufacturer's directions. 10 μg of protein was analyzed on a 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Criterion gels; Bio-Rad). The antibodies used include anti-Sir2, anti-H2A, anti-H2A.x, anti-acetyl-H3, anti-acetyllysine, anti-SirT2, anti-H2B, and anti-phospho-H2B (Upstate Biotechnologies); anti-Cdk7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and anti-ribosomal S6 (Cell Signaling). Development of H2A.z Monoclonal Antibody—A 19-mer peptide (VIPHIHKSLIGKKGQQKTVC-KLH) was synthesized by Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc. The conjugate, mixed with the adjuvant (Titermax Gold for the first injection and Freund's incomplete adjuvant for subsequent boost doses), was used to immunize Balb/C mice. The mouse with highest anti-body titer was used for fusion of the spleen cells with mouse myeloma cells Sp2/0 using standard hybridoma technique. The CELLine device CL-1000 (BD Biosciences) was used for producing high titer monoclonal antibody, which was purified using an Immunopure IgG purification kit (Pierce Biotechnolgy). The specificity of the antibody was verified using recombinant H2A and H2A.z proteins (Upstate). Immunocyochemistry—The cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde plus 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 5 min followed by 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 25 °C for 20 min. The cells were then incubated with anti-myosin heavy chain (MF-20) at 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin. After an overnight incubation the cells were washed and the secondary antibody Alexa-598 plus phalloidin Alex488 (Molecular Probes) were added to the cells. After washing, the slides were mounted using Prolong Gold anti-fade with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Cell Stretching—Cells were cyclically stretched by 15% for 24 h, using the Flexercell Tension Plus FX-4000T, which is a computer-controlled apparatus that mimics strain conditions using vacuum suction to deform cells cultured on special flexible, matrix-bonded growth surfaces. Monitoring Protein Synthesis—Protein was monitored by the incorporation of [3H]leucine into total cellular protein and normalized to the DNA content as previously described (21Abdellatif M. Packer S.E. Michael L.H. Zhang D. Charng M.J. Schneider M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6729-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transverse Aortic Constriction—Mice were anesthetized (intraperitoneal) with a mixture of ketamine (0.066 mg/g), xylazine (0.013 mg/g), and acepromazine (0.002 mg/g). The animals were then ventilated via tracheal intubation connected to a rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus) with a tidal volume of 0.2 ml and a respiratory rate of 110 breaths/min. The left chest was opened at the second intercostal space, and the thymus glands were superiorly reflected. The transverse thoracic aorta between the innominate artery and left common carotid artery was dissected and a 7-0 nylon suture tied around the aorta against a 27-gauge needle. A control group underwent thoracotomy and aortic dissection without constricting the aorta. Deacetylation Reaction—Cardiac myocytes were infected with adenovirus overexpressing H2A.z or an H2A.Z(K4,7,11,13R) mutant. Cells were lysed, and H2A.z was immunoprecipitated. The complex was washed with HDAC assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol). The precipitate was resuspended in HDAC assay buffer plus 4 mm NAD cofactor in the absence or presence of 1 μg of active SirT1. The suspension was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, shaking. The reaction was terminated by adding loading dye and analyzed by Western blotting. Using subtractive hybridization, we have previously found that histone H2A.z mRNA was differentially up-regulated during pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy in the mouse (22Johnatty S.E. Dyck J.R. Michael L.H. Olson E.N. Abdellatif M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1a we show that this is paralleled by an increase in nuclear H2A.z protein, but not the core histone H2A. Sir2α, previously reported to antagonize H2A.z in yeast (11Meneghini M.D. Wu M. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), was also up-regulated in the cytosol, membranes, and nucleus. Interestingly, H2A.z is uniformly expressed in all neonatal rat organs tested but is reduced in the adult rat heart and skeletal muscle and, to a lesser extent, in the brain (Fig. 1b). Thus, the expression pattern of H2A.z positively correlates with growth and proliferation. To address the significance of H2A.z in cardiac growth, we knocked down the protein using short hairpin H2A.z (H2A.z-shRNA) delivered to the myocytes via recombinant adenovirus. After 4 days the cells were subjected to mechanical stretch for an additional 24 h. Stretch is used to mimic mechanical load as a stimulus for hypertrophic growth. The results show that stretch-induced up-regulation of growth-related genes ribosomal S6 and Cdk7 was abrogated in the absence of H2A.z, but acetylation of H3 was unchanged (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, membrane-associated and nuclear Sir2α were consistently up-regulated in the absence of H2A.z. Similarly, endothelin (ET-1)-induced myocyte spreading and sarcomere organization that characterize cellular hypertrophy were also inhibited by pretreatment with H2Az-shRNA (Fig. 2b). In addition, protein synthesis, as monitored by [3H]leucine incorporation, was significantly inhibited after 24, but not 9, h of hypertrophic stimulation by endothelin or stretch. This may suggest that H2A.z is not directly involved in protein synthesis but that H2A.z-dependent de novo gene expression is required for sustaining growth. In contrast, overexpression of H2A.z was insufficient for induction of protein synthesis or cell spreading (data not shown). Thus, we propose that H2A.z is required, but not sufficient, for hypertrophic growth through regulating the expression of growth-related genes. In yeast, it has been shown that H2A.z antagonizes heterochromatin formation by Sir2α (11Meneghini M.D. Wu M. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 725-736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the relationship between H2A.z and Sir2α in cardiac cells, we overexpressed the latter in a time-dependent fashion. In addition, the cells were supplemented with adenoviral-delivered H2A.z to augment the signal/noise ratio. We had expected possible inhibition of the effect of H2A.z on gene expression. What we found was a dose-dependent reduction of total H2A.z accompanied by inhibition of its induction of Cdk7 expression (Fig. 3a), a previously reported marker of cellular hypertrophy (21Abdellatif M. Packer S.E. Michael L.H. Zhang D. Charng M.J. Schneider M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6729-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, Sir2α did not affect endogenous H2A.x. Also, this effect was not reproduced by overexpressing the close family member, SirT2 (Fig. 3b). To address the possibility of Sir2α inhibiting the cytomegalovirus promoter that drives the expression of the virally delivered H2A.z, the experiment was repeated with overexpression of cytomegalovirus-driven H2A.x, the outcome of which eliminated that possibility (Fig. 3c). Sir2 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase (12Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2774) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed effect required this activity, the myocytes were treated with Si2α in the absence or presence of high concentrations of the inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM), which is a product of the deacetylase reaction. The results demonstrate that Sir2α-induced H2A.z degradation was inhibited dose dependently by NAM. In corroboration, H2A.z-induced Cdk7 expression was also rescued by NAM. Interestingly, there was more H2A.z accumulated in the presence of NAM plus Sir2α than in control or NAM-only treated cells. It is plausible that excess inactive Sir2α stabilizes H2A.z. Thus, the results suggest that Sir2α specifically regulates the translation and/or degradation of H2A.z and/or mRNA stability through a NAD-dependent deacetylase activity. To address whether a proteasome/ubiquitin pathway is involved in the down-regulation of H2A.z, we inhibited proteasomal activity using epoxomicin. This approach resulted in a dramatic increase in H2A.z protein abundance and the inhibition of its Sir2α-dependent degradation (Fig. 4). It should be noted that the levels of H2A.z in the nucleus appear to be saturable and any excess accumulates extra-nuclear. The results indicate that Sir2α induces H2A.z degradation via a proteasome/ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. To investigate the significance of the up-regulation of both H2A.z and Sir2α during hypertrophy, we determined the effect of the hypertrophic growth factor ET-1 on cells overexpressing, or inhibited in, Sir2α. Western blot analysis revealed that ET-1 treatment in the presence of the Sir2α inhibitor NAM resulted in increased H2A.z, as well as the hypertrophic marker Cdk7. However, it was previously reported that Sir2α has an anti-apoptotic effect in cardiac myocytes (16Alcendor R.R. Kirshenbaum L.A. Imai S. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In agreement, our results showed that 2, 5, or 10 mm NAM treatment induced the apoptotic marker phospho-H2B 1.45-, 2.6-, 3.9-fold, respectively, after normalization to total H2B (Fig. 5a). This is in contrast to the effects seen with overexpression of Sir2α that resulted in reduced H2A.z and Cdk7 but had no effect on phospho-H2B. It should by noted that chronic hypertrophy is associated with apoptosis, which would not be detected in our relatively short-term (24 h) experimental hypertrophy. Morphological analysis also confirmed normal or slightly exaggerated ET-1-induced cell spreading and organization of sarcomeres in the presence of 10 mm NAM, which was minimized in the presence of Sir2α, although alone Sir2α appeared to slightly enhance cell size (Fig. 5b). To confirm these results we monitored protein synthesis by [3H]leucine incorporation in the absence or presence of these molecules. In corroboration, NAM dose-dependently enhanced protein synthesis, whereas Sir2α inhibited it. The inhibition seen by Sir2α reached a plateau at ∼50% of control value (Fig. 5c). Thus, we propose that Sir2α curbs both hypertrophy and apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether the inhibition of apoptosis is primary or secondary, or both, to inhibition of hypertrophy. Sir2α is a histone deacetylase known to deacetylate H3 (acetyl-Lys-9 and -Lys-14) and H4 (acetyl-Lys-16). In addition, we have shown above that its effect on H2A.z requires its NAD-dependent deacetylase activity. Thus, a plausible mechanism for its effect is the deacetylation of a critical lysine. To identify any potential lysine targets, we individually mutated the 5 lysines (Lys-4, Lys-7, Lys-11, Lys-13, Lys-15) in the N-tail of H2A.z into arginine. The results show that the Arg-4, Arg-7, Arg-11, Arg-13 mutants were stably expressed in the myocytes and were down-regulated upon overexpression of Sir2α, similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. 6, a-c). It should be noted though that the Arg-7 mutant did not integrate into the nucleus but remained sensitive to Sir2α (Fig. 5b). In contrast, we detected the mRNA, but not the protein, of the Arg-15 point mutant or an encompassing deletion mutant (not shown), which leads us to predict that Lys-15 is critical for H2A.z protein stability. Therefore, neither Lys-4, Lys-7, Lys-11, nor Lys-13 plays a role in the effect of Sir2α on H2A.z, whereas Lys-15 is a potential candidate, equivalent to H4-Lys-16. To confirm direct deacetylation of H2A.z by Sir2α, we used an in vitro deacetylase assay. First, we immunoprecipitated H2A.z or an Arg (4Jackson J.D. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3811-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J.

The immunoprecipitate was then incubated with recombinant glutathione S-transferase-SirT1 lacking the N terminus, in the presence of NAD cofactor. The resultant reaction was analyzed by Western blotting. The data show that H2A.z and the Arg (4Jackson J.D. Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3811-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Rangasamy D. Berven L. Ridgway P. Tremethick D.J.

Although H2A and its variants H2A.z and H2A.x possess unique C-tails, there are 2 lysine residues that are conserved among them (Lys-118-Lys-119 in H2A and H2A.x, corresponding to Lys-120-Lys-121 in H2A.z) (Fig. 7a, boxed residues), where Lys-119 is well known to be ubiquitinated in H2A, affecting its function but not stability (23Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the lysines in the C-tail of H2A.z, we individually mutated Lys-115, Lys-120, Lys-121, and Lys-125 into Arg residues (Fig. 7a, bold residues). The results demonstrate that Arg-115 and Arg-121 mutants were resistant to Sir2α-induced degradation via overexpressing Sir2α or activating it by resveratrol (Fig. 7, b and c), whereas Arg-125 mutant retained the wild-type characteristic (Fig. 7d) and Arg-120 resulted in no detectable protein (not shown). In agreement, H2A.z(Arg-115 or Arg-121)-induced Cdk7 and ribosomal S6 expression was unaffected by Sir2α. Interestingly though, resveratrol independently down-regulated Cdk7 and S6. Thus, Lys-115 and Lys-121 are both required for Sir2α-induced H2A.z degradation. It should be noted that Lys-115 does not have a match in H2A or H2A.x, which may account for the difference in response to Sir2α and the stability of the molecules. From the above results we know that both Lys-115 and Lys-121 in the C-tail are necessary for Sir2α-induced degradation. However, because the Arg-15 mutant protein is unstable, at best we can conclude its necessity for H2A.z stability, but we are unable to conclusively prove the requirement of the N-tail for the sensitivity toward Sir2α. To partially address this issue, we made a fusion of GFP or H2A.x with amino acids 115-127 of the C-tail of H2A.z (GFP.z and H2A.xz, respectively). H2A.x is homologous to H2A.z, with the most divergence in the C-tail sequence, whereas its N terminus retains conserved lysines corresponding to Lys-7, Lys-11, and Lys-15 of H2A.z (Fig. 8a). The assumption was that if the N terminus, in addition to the C terminus, of H2A.z is indispensable for responsiveness to Sir2α, then H2A.xz, but not GFP.z, will be destined for degradation in the presence of Sir2α. However, if only the C terminus is required, then both would be degraded. The results show that H2A.xz, but not GFP.z, was down-regulated by overexpressing Sir2α in cardiac cells. Thus, both the N- and C-tails of H2A.z are necessary for conferring Sir2α-dependent degradation to a protein. Although we know that H2A.z is essential for development in mammals, we do not know its mechanism of function or mode of regulation. Here we have shown that it is differentially regulated during development, where its levels drop significantly in the adult heart unless induced to undergo hypertrophic growth. Whereas in yeast it has been mainly reported to differentially regulate transcription, in mammalian cells it has been shown to play a role in chromosomal segregation. Now in addition our results showed that knockdown of H2A.z inhibited the expression of hypertrophy-induced genes, including Cdk7 and ribosomal S6, and consequently hypertrophic growth. Although overexpression of H2A.z induced the expression of these genes, it was incapable of induction of fulminate hypertrophy. This suggests that H2A.z is necessary but not sufficient for induction of hypertrophy and that its effect on Cdk7 and ribosomal S6 is possibly direct. The full spectrum of genes that are regulated by H2A.z in the heart is still under investigation. Therefore, the results are consistent with its role as a transcriptional regulator. This also agrees with its expression pattern wherein the neonatal, but not the adult, heart undergoes hypertrophic growth. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of H2A.z regulation, we turned to previous studies in yeast cells for clues. There it was shown that H2A.z antagonized Sir2 and the spread of heterochromatin. This prompted us to test the relationship between Sir2α and H2A.z in cardiac myocytes. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of Sir2α resulted in an ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of H2A.z and, vice versa, knockdown of H2A.z resulted in an increase in Sir2α protein seen in the membrane and nuclear fractions. Thus, it appears that H2A.z and Sir2α negatively regulate each other. In this study we have determined that Sir2α regulated the protein stability of H2A.z, but we have not yet determined the mode of action of H2A.z on Sir2α. In accordance with its role as a transcriptional regulator, we think that it negatively regulates Sir2α at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, inhibition of Sir2α by NAM not only inhibited its effect on H2A.z but also reversed it; therefore, excess, NAM-inhibited Sir2α stabilizes H2A.z. We predict that there are other deacetylases for H2A.z that are competitively displaced by excess inactive Sir2α. We have also knocked down Sir2α using shRNA, which resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis (data not shown). In this experiment, though, we did not observe an increase in H2A.z. This further supports the idea that there are other H2A.z deacetylases. H2A.z is an H2A variant, unique mainly in the N and C termini. In Tetrahymena it has been shown that if all 6 lysines in the N terminus are mutated to arginine, it results in a lethal phenotype (24Ren Q. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1329-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Replacing any one of these with an acidic amino acid or retaining at least one lysine restores viability, although growth of the organism becomes very slow. Similarly, deletion of the whole domain restores growth. These results imply that the N-terminal lysine residue serves as a positive charge patch that requires acetylation to neutralize it. On the other hand, in Drosophila deletion of the C terminus tail of its H2A.z proved it to be an essential domain that confers the H2A.z-specific functionality (25Clarkson M.J. Wells J.R. Gibson F. Saint R. Tremethick D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our results establish the importance of both the N- and C-tails of mouse H2A.z. Unlike in Tetrahymena, deletion of the N terminus resulted in an unstable protein. Upon individually mutating the lysines in the N terminus, we found the Lys-15 was critical for protein stability, whereas Lys-7 was important for nuclear localization. On the other hand, the C-terminal Lys-115 and Lys-121 were necessary for H2A.z degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. It is important to note that mutations of these lysines into arginine did not affect H2A.z-induced Cdk7 or ribosomal S6 expression. It is known that the conserved Lys-121 in H2A is ubiquitinated (23Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), but in that case ubiquitination is associated with Polycomb silencing. Similarly, H2B is ubiquitinated at Lys-123, which regulates histone H3 methylation (26Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). The difference in the effect of ubiquitination on H2A versus H2A.z might be attributed to Lys-115, present in the latter protein only where its mutation completely inhibited H2A.z degradation by Sir2α. In short, both the N- and C-tails of H2A.z function to regulate the activity, localization, and stability of the protein. Although the role of histones has not been studied in cardiac growth before, circumstantial evidence is provided from studies involving the histone deacetylases and histone acetyl transferases. Zhang et al. (27Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Chang S. Antos C.L. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) found that during hypertrophy a novel kinase phosphorylates and deactivates class II histone deacetylases. Overexpression of a histone deacetylase mutant resistant to deactivation in cultured myocytes inhibited cardiac hypertrophy and the associated gene expression. This was associated with reduction of acetyl-H3 associated with the promoters of the hypertrophic markers atrial natriuretic factor and β-myosin heavy chain. In vivo studies of a histone deacetylase 9 knock-out mouse that developed a late onset cardiac hypertrophy and exhibited early hypersensitivity to hypertrophic stimuli confirmed that histone deacetylase is an inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy. On the other hand, overexpression of the transcriptional co-activators p300 and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein induced cardiac hypertrophy, dependent on their histone acetyl transferase activity (28Gusterson R.J. Jazrawi E. Adcock I.M. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6838-6847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We found that during hypertrophy both H2A.z and Sir2α are up-regulated. Sir2α is anti-apoptotic in cardiac myocytes, at least partly through deacetylation of p53 (16Alcendor R.R. Kirshenbaum L.A. Imai S. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 971-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that Sir2α induces degradation of H2A.z, which is required for hypertrophic growth, through up-regulating Cdk7 and ribosomal S6. In accordance, overexpression of Sir2α partially reduced hypertrophy. In contrast, inhibiting Sir2α with NAM resulted in exaggerated hypertrophy associated with increased apoptosis. Although initially hypertrophy is compensatory, its progression is associated with increasing apoptosis, which culminates in cardiac failure. Thus, it is likely that Sir2α protects the cells by moderating the extent of hypertrophy and, thereby, secondary apoptosis. We also showed that resveratrol, a polyphenol compound found mainly in the skin of red grapes and a known activator of Sir2, induces H2A.z degradation. Therefore, resveratrol may be beneficial for patients with cardiac hypertrophy and failure. We thank Dr. S. Vatner, Chairman of the Dept. of Cell Biology and Molecular Medicine, for advice and support."

Physiol. 2000; 278: C1200-C1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have two motifs similar to LDADD in AE1. Moreover, isothermal titration calorimetry and pulldown assays suggest that, at least under non-reducing conditions, the common C terminus of NBCe1-A/B interacts with CA II in vitro (12Gross E. Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Fedotoff O. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 679-685Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Similarly, Pushkin and co-workers (12Gross E. Pushkin A. Abuladze N.

(Lond.). 2004; 559: 55-65Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar) working with a mouse proximal convoluted tubule (mPCT) cell line stably transfected with NBCe1-A, concluded that CA II enhances the current carried by NBCe1-A.For three reasons, we set out to verify the hypothesis that CA II enhances the activity of NBCe1-A. First, a pHi measurement, as in the AE1 study, is an indirect index of the rate of HCO3- transport (JHCO3). After transport of HCO3- into the cell, pHi does not increase until the reactions, HCO3- + H+ → H2CO3 → CO2 + H2O, consume cytosolic H+. Obviously, CA will augment the rate of pHi increase even if JHCO3 is constant. Second, technical issues in the mPCT studies may make it difficult to measure NBC currents reproducibly and precisely. A goal of the mPCT approach is to control cytosolic composition by using amphotericin B to permeabilize the apical membrane of high-resistance monolayers in an Ussing chamber. Although the only data analyzed were those in which the current sensitive to dinitrostilbene disulfonate was at least 10-fold larger than that of the corresponding mock transfected cells, the dinitrostilbene disulfonate-sensitive current was in fact smaller than the background current (e.g. see Fig. 3C in Ref. 14Gross E. Hawkins K. Abuladze N. Pushkin A. Cotton C.U. Hopfer U. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 531: 597-603Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Third, preliminary data from our laboratory shows that in oocytes co-expressing NBCe1-A and the extracellular CA IV, inhibiting CA IV markedly increases the pH gradient near the surface of the cell but has little effect on the NBCe1-A current (16Grichtchenko I.I. Boron W.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A795Google Scholar). If extracellular CA IV does not enhance NBCe1 activity, then we reasoned that cytosolic CA II should not enhance it either.In the present study, we expressed human NBCe1-A in Xenopus oocytes and demonstrated by two-electrode voltage clamp that the NBCe1-A current (INBC) was 10-20-fold greater than the background currents. We found that injecting a recombinant human CA II protein into oocytes markedly accelerated hydration of intracellular CO2 but had no effect on the slope conductance of INBC. Moreover, exposing CA II-injected oocytes to the membrane-permeant CA II inhibitor ethoxzolamide (EZA) reversed the effect of CA II on CO2 hydration without affecting the slope conductance of INBC. Finally, we created a double fusion protein consisting of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fused to the N terminus of NBCe1-A and human CA II fused to the C terminus of NBCe1-A. This EGFP-e1-CAII construct accelerated hydration of intracellular CO2, an effect blocked by EZA. However, the current of EGFP-e1-CAII was insensitive to EZA and was no different from the current of an EGFP-e1 fusion protein that lacked CA II.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of NBCe1-A and Co-injection with CA II in Xenopus OocytescDNA encoding human NBCe1-A had been cloned into the pGH19 expression vector (17Trudeau M.C.

The RNA concentration was determined by ultraviolet absorbance, and its quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis.Stage V-VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis were isolated as described previously (19Romero M.F. Fong P. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Phisiol. 1998; 274: F425-F432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One day later, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of deionized water (Ambion) containing 0.5 ng/nl of mRNA encoding hNBCe1-A. Three days after injecting the cRNA, we injected oocytes with 50 nl of either 50 mm Tris buffer or recombinant human CA II dissolved in the buffer (300 ng or 10-11 mol/oocyte). 4We injected 10-11 mol of CA II per oocyte. Assuming an H2O content of 37% (24Horowitz S.B. Fenichel I.R. J. Cell Biol. 1970; 47: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), [CA II]i ≅ 24 μm, about 20% higher than the level in red blood cells. The CA II was synthesized and purified as follows. A bacterial T7 expression vector (pET31F1) that encodes human CA II was generously provided by Dr. David N. Silverman (Department of Pharmacology and Biochemistry, University of Florida), and expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (20Tanhauser S.M. Jewell D.A. Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Laipis P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recombinant CA II was purified by affinity chromatography (21Whitney P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 57: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with an agarose resin to which p-aminomethylbenzenesulfonamide was covalently attached (Sigma), and then further purified by gel filtration chromatography (AKTA FPLC) using a Superdex 75 HR 16/60 column (GE Healthcare). Purity of the protein was assessed by PAGE, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (SynPep Corp., Dublin, CA). Concentration of CA II was determined spectrophotometrically by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar absorptivity at 280 nm (5.5 × 104 m-1 cm-1).Expression of EGFP-e1 and EGFP-e1-CAII Constructs in Xenopus OocytesEGFP-e1—The e1-EGFP cDNA construct was a gift from Dr. Leila Virkki, consisting of human NBCe1-A fused in-frame at its 3′ end to EGFP (Clontech), and subcloned into pGH19 Xenopus expression vector (17Trudeau M.C. Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Science. 1995; 269: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The EGFP was flanked by AgeI sites. We obtained the EGFP-e1 construct as follows. (i) We used QuikChange (Stratagene) to introduce a silent mutation (CCATGG → CGATGG) that eliminated the NcoI site in EGFP of the e1-EGFP construct. (ii) In parallel, we used QuikChange to create in the 5′ untranslated region of NBCe1-A an AgeI site that was separated by 60 nucleotides from the ATG of the start methionine of NBCe1-A. (iii) We used AgeI to cut the silently mutated EGFP from the aforementioned vector and ligated it nondirectionally into the newly created AgeI site in the 5′ untranslated region of NBCe1-A. Thus, when translated, this construct would consist of EGFP that has its NcoI site silently mutated, followed by a 20-amino acid linker (QLWQINSPSAEFGLGGLAGK), which in turn would be followed by the start methionine of NBCe1-A.e1-CAII—We made the e1-CAII construct as follows. (i) We used PCR with the aforementioned CA II construct to synthesize CA II cDNA flanked at both ends by AgeI sites (underlined).

(ii) Meanwhile, we used AgeI to excise the EGFP sequence from e1-EGFP (see above). (iii) We used AgeI to cut the PCR product in step i, which we then ligated nondirectionally into the AgeI site at the 3′ end of NBCe1-A, obtained in step ii. (iv) We performed another round of QuikChange (upstream sense, 5′-ccttgaacgccacacatcatgcgggctcaccggtggttccgcggg-3′; downstream antisense, 5′-cccgcggaaccaccggtgagcccgcatgatgtgtggcgttcaagg-3′). Thus, when translated, the construct would consist of NBCe1-A, followed by an 8-amino acid linker (GLTGGSAG), and the start methionine of CA II.EGFP-e1-CAII—We obtained the EGFP-e1-CAII construct from the EGFP-e1 and e1-CAII constructs as follows. (i) Both EGFP-e1 and e1-CAII have one unique NcoI site in the NBCe1-A coding sequence as well as one unique NotI site in the pGH19 vector. Therefore, we used NcoI/NotI to liberate NotI-EGFP-e1-NcoI from one construct and NcoI-e1-CAII-NotI from the other. (ii) We ligated these fragments to generate EGFP-e1-CAII.SolutionspHi Experiments on Injected CA II and All Voltage-clamp Experiments—The nominally CO2/HCO3--free ND96 solution contained (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES at a pH of 7.50.

For experiments, we diluted this stock to prepare 400 μm EZA in ND96, and pH adjusted to 7.5 with 5 m HCl.In experiments in which we blocked NBCe1-A with tenidap (5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-3-(hydroxy-2-thienylmethylene)-2-oxo-1H-indole-1-carboxamide, a gift of Pfizer Inc., Groton, CT), we made a fresh 1 m stock solution of tenidap powder in Me2SO, and then diluted this 1:1000 into a CO2/HCO3- solution. Parallel experiments (not shown) proved that 1:1000 Me2SO does not affect the NBCe1-A current.Electrophysiological MeasurementsWe placed an oocyte in a chamber and constantly superfused at a flow of 4 ml/min. We delivered bath solutions using syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA), and switched among solutions with pneumatically operated valves (Clippard Instrument Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH).Measurement of Intracellular pH—We impaled the oocyte with two microelectrodes, one for sensing membrane potential (Vm) and the other for sensing pHi. A calomel electrode served as the reference in the bath. We fabricated and used the electrodes as described previously (1Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 23Siebens A.W. Boron W.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 799-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Microelectrodes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass (catalog number 30-0077, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and had resistances ∼0.3 megaohm when filled with 3 m KCl. The tip of the pH electrode contained a liquid, pH-sensitive membrane (Hydrogen Ionophore I, mixture B, Fluka Chemical Corp., Ronkonkoma, NY). The Vm electrode was filled with 3 m KCl. We obtained the voltage due to pHi by subtracting the signal of the Vm electrode from that of the pH electrode. We obtained Vm by subtracting the signal of the calomel electrode from that of the Vm electrode. Voltages were measured with an FD-223 electrometer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), and data were acquired with software written in-house. The pH electrodes were calibrated with buffered pH standards at pH 6.0 and 8.0. An additional single-point calibration was performed with the HEPES-buffered solution (pH 7.50) in the bath before the oocyte was impaled.Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—We measured whole cell ionic currents in oocytes using a model OC-725C oocyte clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) controlled by the Clampex module of pCLAMP software (version 8, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). We held oocytes at a voltage close to the spontaneous Vm until initiating the voltage-clamp protocol. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were generated by stepping the holding potential from -160 to +20 mV in 20-mV increments, each of which lasted 60 ms. We used the Clampfit module of pCLAMP to analyze the data. All pHi and voltage-clamp experiments were performed at room temperature (∼22 °C).Preparation of Oocytes for ImmunocytochemistryFixing—Single oocytes were fixed at room temperature by washing twice for 10 min in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), once for 60 min in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% paraformaldehyde, and three times for 10 min in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. We prepared phosphate-buffered saline from tablets (catalog number P-4417, Sigma).Dehydration—We dehydrated fixed oocytes by consecutive washes for 10 min in 1 ml of each of the following: 70% EtOH, 95% EtOH, 100% EtOH, and polypropylene oxide.Permeation and Embedding—We prepared embedding medium using an Embed 812 Kit (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA). Fixed, dehydrated oocytes were permeated by incubation for 60 min in a 1:1 mixture of embedding medium and polypropylene oxide. We subsequently transferred the oocytes to individual Easy Mold™ embedding capsules (Size “00,” Electron Microscopy Science) that were filled with 100% embedding medium. Finally, the resin was cured overnight in an oven at 60 °C.Mounting—We sectioned oocytes to a thickness of 3 μm using a Leica Ultracut UCT (Leica-Microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK). We mounted slices on Superfrost™ Plus microscope slides (Electron Microscopy Science), laying each slice onto a water drop and heating the slide on a Lab-Line™ Slide Warmer (Barnstead Instruments, Dubuque, IA) to evaporate the H2O.Immunocytochemistry on OocytesEtching—We immersed slides in a 2:1 mixture of 20% (w/v) NaOH/methanol and polypropylene oxide for 5 min, then the slides were washed in methanol (2 times for 5 min) and Tris-buffered saline (TBS; once for 5 min). TBS consisted of 100 mm Tris base and 149 mm NaCl.Antigen Retrieval—We preheated 500 ml of citrate buffer (pH 6.0, prepared by mixing 1/9 (v/v) 0.1 m citric acid and 0.1 m sodium citrate) for 4 min at 100% power in a 700-watt microwave. Slides placed in a glass rack were immersed in this solution and boiled at 40% power in the microwave twice for 10 min, followed by cooling in the solution at room temperature.ImmunofluorescencePrior to antibody staining, we washed slides in each of the following: TBS (three times for 5 min), 0.5 m NH4Cl (once for 15 min), TBS (once for 5 min), TBS + 1% SDS (once for 5 min), and TBS (once for 5 min). Slides were blocked by washing (once for 15 min) in TBS + 0.1% BSA + 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). We incubated the preparations with mouse monoclonal anti-EGFP (BD Biosciences; 1:100 in TBS + 0.1% BSA + 10% goat serum) and rabbit polyclonal anti-human CA II (Rockland, Gilbertville, PA; 1:1000 in TBS + 0.1% BSA + 10% goat serum) overnight. The preparations were then washed three times for 5 min with high-salt TBS (100 mm Tris base + 427 mm NaCl) + 0.1% BSA, and then incubated once for 1 h with the secondary antibody: goat anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (1:200 in TBS + 0.1% BSA + 10% goat serum) and goat anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 594 (1:200 in TBS + 0.1% BSA + 10% goat serum). Finally, the slides were washed twice for 5 min in high-salt TBS + 0.1% BSA and once for 5 min in TBS before mounting in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).Confocal Microscopy on OocytesWe qualitatively localized EGFP-e1-CA II and EGFP-e1 by obtaining confocal images of fixed oocyte slices using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Gottingen, Germany) equipped with Argon 2 and HeNe1 laser units. For the images labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, excitation/emission filters were set at band pass 488 nm/long pass 505 nm. For the images labeled with Alexa Fluor 594, excitation/emission filters were set at band pass 543 nm/long pass 560 nm. Images are the result of 8-fold scan averaging, and assembled using LSM Image Browser (version 3.5).StatisticsWe obtained the initial rate of pHi change (dpHi/dt) from the slope of a linear regression line fitted to a portion of the pHi versus time record that represented the maximal rate of pHi decline soon after the addition of CO2/HCO3-. We obtained the slope conductance of the NBC current by subtracting, at each voltage, the current in ND96 from the total current in CO2/HCO3-. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. Means were compared using paired Student's t tests (two tails), considering p < 0.05 as significant.RESULTSEffect of Injected CA II on CO2-induced pHi Changes—In Fig. 1, we outline our experimental design for studies in which we examined the effect of injected, recombinant, human CA II protein or the effect of CA II fused to the C terminus of NBCe1-A.The following narrative applies to the pHi experiments done for studies in which we examined the effect of injected CA II protein. After injecting the cRNA encoding NBCe1-A into Xenopus oocytes (Day 0/Step 1), we waited 3 days and randomized the oocytes into the “CA II + Tris” group and the “Tris” group. Later on the same day, we injected either CA II protein in Tris buffer or just Tris buffer (Day 3/Step 3). We then used pHi measurements (Day 4/Step 4) to verify that the CA II could catalyze the reaction CO2 + H2O → HCO3- + H+. Exposing oocytes to 5% CO2/33 mm HCO3- (pH 7.50) caused the pHi to decrease much faster in a CA II + Tris oocyte (Fig. 2A, Pre-EZA) than in a Tris oocytes (Fig. 2B, Pre-EZA). The solid bars in Fig. 2C summarize the initial, CO2-induced dpHi/dt values for a total of 8-10 oocytes in each group, and confirm that CA II-injected oocytes acidify far more rapidly than the controls.FIGURE 2Effect of EZA on initial, CO2-induced acidification rate (dpHi/dt) in oocytes expressing hNBCe1-A and injected with CA II + Tris or Tris. A, representative pHi records from an oocyte injected 3 days earlier with cRNA encoding NBCe1-A and 1 day earlier with CA II + Tris. The solid record (Pre-EZA) and the dotted record (Post-3h EZA) were obtained from the same oocyte, separated by a 3-h exposure of the oocyte to the ND96 solution supplemented with 400 μm EZA. The extracellular solution was ND96 at the beginning of the experiment and, during the indicated time, 5% CO2/33 mm HCO3- (pH 7.50). B, representative pHi records from an oocyte injected 3 days earlier with cRNA encoding NBCe1-A and 1 day earlier with Tris buffer. C, summary of data from experiments like those in panels A and B. Values are mean ± S.E., with numbers of oocytes as indicated. The statistical comparisons between adjacent bars were made using a paired, two-tailed t test (***, p < 0.001). The left arrow represents the average effect of EZA on CA II + Tris oocytes. The right arrow represents the difference between the solid bar for the CA II + Tris oocytes and the average of the solid and hatched bars for the Tris oocytes. The ratio of the two arrows is an inhibition of 96%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After obtaining these pre-EZA data, we exposed the same oocytes from each group for ∼3 h to 400 μm EZA, a permeant CA II inhibitor (Day 4/Step 5) and then repeated the pHi measurements (Day 4/Step 6). For the CA II + Tris cell, EZA reduced the initial CO2-induced dpHi/dt (Fig. 2A, Post-3h EZA) to about the value observed in the Tris oocyte, pre-EZA (Fig. 2B, Pre-EZA). However, EZA had no effect on the Tris oocyte (Fig. 2B, Post-3h EZA). The hatched bars in Fig. 2C summarize the initial, CO2-induced dpHi/dt values for 8-10 oocytes in each group, and shows that EZA treatment blocked the CA II effect by 96%. Thus, the injected CA II markedly enhances the conversion of CO2 + OH- to HCO3-.Effect of Injected CA II on NBCe1-A Currents—Fig. 3 summarizes data obtained on an oocyte expressing NBCe1-A, but before injection of either CA II + Tris or Tris. In our experiments using a two-electrode voltage-clamp, we define the current through NBCe1-A (INBC) as the difference in currents measured in the presence of CO2/HCO3- (Fig. 3A, open diamond curve) versus the absence of CO2/HCO3- (i.e. ND96 solution, Fig. 3A, black square curve). In separate experiments, we found that in the presence of CO2/HCO3-, the current measured in the presence of near-saturating levels (1 mm) of tenidap 5Under the conditions of these experiments, the apparent Ki of tenidap is ∼20 μm (J. Lu and W. F. Boron, unpublished observations). (Fig. 3A, open triangle curve), an inhibitor of NBCe1-A (25Ducoudret O. Diakov A. Muller-Berger S. Romero M.F. Frömter E. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 442: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is virtually the same as the current measured in the absence of CO2/HCO3- (Fig. 3A, black square curve). However, because tenidap is not totally reversible, we did not routinely use this inhibitor in this study. The INBC-V relationship in Fig. 3B (open diamond curve) is the difference between the open diamond and black square curves in Fig. 3A. The dashed line in Fig. 3B represents a linear fit to the INBC-V relationship, and has a slope of 14 μS. A comparison of the two plots shows that the INBC-V relationship is slightly concave upward. However, the deviation from linearity is very slight, so that we regarded the slope of the dashed lines as a reasonable indicator of the slope conductance of NBCe1-A throughout our study.FIGURE 3Current-voltage relationships in an oocyte expressing NBCe1-A. A, representative current-voltage (I-V) relationships for an oocyte expressing NBCe1-A, generated by stepping the holding potential from -160 to +20 mV in 20-mV steps. Data were acquired in the ND96 solution (black squares), CO2/HCO3- solution (open diamonds), and with 1 mm tenidap (open triangles) added to the CO2/HCO3- solution. B, the derived I-V relationship for NBCe1-A (INBC). The symbols (open diamonds) represent the result of subtracting the currents measured in the presence of tenidap (open triangles in A) from those measured in CO2/HCO3- without tenidap (open diamonds in A). The dashed line represents a linear fit to the INBC-V relationship. The equation in B indicates that this NBCe1-A slope conductance is 14 μS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4 summarizes the effect of injected CA II protein on NBCe1-A activity. As outlined in Fig. 1, we serially measured NBCe1-A currents as many as three times for each oocyte: (i) Day 3/Step 2, 3 days after injecting the NBCe1-A cRNA, but immediately before injecting CA II + Tris or Tris; (ii) Day 4/Step 4, 1 day after i"

Potassium is the major monovalent intracellular cation of Escherichia coli as well as of other prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Potassium has four major roles in E. coli; it is an osmotic solute, an activator of intracellular enzymes, a regulator of intracellular pH, and a second messenger to stimulate accumulation of compatible solutes (1.Brown A.D. Microbial Water Stress Physiology: Principles and Perspectives. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1990Google Scholar, 2.Epstein W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 75: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic pools of K+ are tightly regulated in bacteria by a number of different transport systems that vary with regard to kinetics, energy coupling, and regulation (3.Stumpe S. Schlösser A.

The list of E. coli K+ transport systems is incomplete with respect to potassium efflux. These K+ efflux systems may not have been studied extensively because potassium is a major monovalent intracellular cation and because of the belief that living cells accumulate K+ and extrude the smaller Na+ ion. However, recent data indicate that excessive amounts of K+ can be toxic for living cells and that cells regulate K+ levels via K+ efflux systems (15.Putnoky P. Kereszt A. Nakamura T. Endre G.

Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The only well studied K+ efflux systems in E. coli utilize KefB and KefC. The activity of these systems is manifested by rapid but reversible loss of K+ when cells are treated with N-ethylmaleimide (18.Meury J. Kepes A. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19.Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. FEBS Lett. 1982; 140: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, KefB and KefC act to acidify the cytoplasm only when activated by toxins and are probably not involved in regulating intracellular pH under other conditions (20.Ferguson G.P. Trends Microbiol. 1999; 7: 242-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The kch gene of E. coli encodes a protein homologous to eukaryotic K+ channels (9.Milkman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3510-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, despite the possibility that physiological roles of Kch involve bulk K+ uptake or membrane potential regulation (21.Loukin S.H. Kuo M.M.-C. Zhou X.-L. Haynes W.J. Kung C. Saimi Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), to date no Kch channel activity has been detected. Deletion of kch has no detectable effect on bacterial growth in various media or on their survival under various applied stresses (22.Kuo M.M.-C. Haynes W.J. Loukin S.H. Kung C. Saimi Y. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 145-170Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, wild-type and Δkch mutant bacteria do not differ in their cytoplasmic K+ concentrations (23.Kuo M.M.-C. Saimi Y. Kung C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4049-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Energetic and physiologic considerations suggest the existence of unrecognized K+ efflux system(s) in E. coli, and K+/H+ antiporters are ideal candidates for these unrecognized systems. The energetic argument is based on the high electrical membrane potential (interior negative) maintained by bacteria growing in neutral or alkaline pH. A membrane potential of –120 mV would concentrate K+ 100-fold. For example, in a situation where the external K+ concentration is 500 mm, the bacterial cytoplasm would be expected to contain 50 m K+ at equilibrium, a situation clearly not compatible with bacterial growth. Potential reasons for the growth of E. coli in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 500 mm K+ are the presence of an energy-coupled efflux system to prevent excessive accumulation of K+ (17.Radchenko M.V. Waditee R. Oshimi S. Fukuhara M. Takabe T. Nakamura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and inhibition of K+ uptake systems by the high concentration of K+ in the environment or cytoplasm (24.Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 730: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25.Rhoads D.B. Waters E.B. Epstein W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1978; 72: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The physiologic argument for the existence of new K+ efflux systems is based on the requirement of bacteria to reduce intracellular K+ when turgor pressure is dangerously high. Mechanosensitive channels can mediate rapid efflux of K+, which lowers the cytoplasmic osmolarity. However, gradual K+ efflux was seen when medium osmolarity was progressively diluted (26.Meury J. Robin A. Monnier-Champeix P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This suggested the existence of a pathway more specific than the mechanosensitive channels, and K+/H+ antiporters are possible candidates for mediating this type of K+ efflux. K+/H+ antiporter activity has been demonstrated by the effect of monovalent cations on the pH gradient formed by oxidation of lactate in inverted membrane vesicles from E. coli (27.Brey R.N. Rosen B.P. Sorensen E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 39-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of cytoplasmic pH by K+/H+ exchange was postulated, where protons that were returned to the cytoplasm by the K+/H+ antiporter prevented cytoplasmic alkalinization during proton extrusion associated with the formation of a proton motive force or during growth at alkaline pH (28.Plack R.H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3824-3825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar K+/H+ antiporter activity has been demonstrated in Vibrio algoinolyticus (29.Nakamura T. Tokuda H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 692: 389-396Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30.Nakamura T. Tokuda H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 776: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Despite the indirect evidence for the existence of the K+/H+ antiporter systems in bacteria, the candidate genes remain elusive. However, we recently cloned the first bacterial K+(specific)/H+ antiporter, which is encoded by the gene nhaP2, and demonstrated that proteins NhaA and NhaB are Na+(K+)/H+ antiporters of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (17.Radchenko M.V. Waditee R. Oshimi S. Fukuhara M. Takabe T. Nakamura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, recent study showed that MdfA multidrug resistance transporter is able to mediate alkaline pH tolerance by Na+/H+ or K+/H+ exchange (13.Lewinson E. Padan E. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14073-14078Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14.Padan E. Bibi E. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1717: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The affinity of MdfA to Na+ and K+ ions is very low (in the range of 50 mm) (13.Lewinson E. Padan E. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14073-14078Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because of the lack of knowledge about genes encoding K+/H+ antiporter systems of E. coli described by Rosen and coworkers (27.Brey R.N. Rosen B.P. Sorensen E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 39-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Plack R.H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3824-3825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we attempted to identify K+/H+ antiporter(s) of this bacterium. Our previous data indicated that E. coli strain TO114, which lacks the genes nhaA, nhaB, and chaA, cannot mediate K+ efflux under diethanolamine (DEA) 2The abbreviations used are: DEA, diethanolamine; LB, Luria Bertani; CAPSO, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: DEA, diethanolamine; LB, Luria Bertani; CAPSO, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid. pressure, whereas E. coli strain LB2003, which carries nhaA, nhaB, and chaA, extrudes K+ under the same conditions (17.Radchenko M.V. Waditee R. Oshimi S. Fukuhara M. Takabe T. Nakamura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the genes nhaA, nhaB, and chaA as possible candidates to mediate K+ efflux from E. coli. Our data indicate that the protein encoded by chaA is not only a Na+(Ca2+)/H+ antiporter but also a K+/H+ antiporter.

Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), LB2003 (F– kup1 ΔkdpABC5 ΔtrkA rpsL metE thi rha gal) (3.Stumpe S. Schlösser A. Schleyer M. Bakker E.P. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. 2. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1996: 474-531Google Scholar), and LB2005 (LB2003 chaA::Cmr) (this study) were used to study chaA. These strains were grown in solid or liquid LBK medium containing 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 25 mm Tris, and KCl (final concentration of K+ varied from 10 to 800 mm and was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry), at pH 6.5 or 8.5 adjusted by HCl. Media containing 10, 30, 100, 300, 500, 600, 700, and 800 mm K+ are referred to here as LBK10, LBK30, LBK100, LBK300, LBK500, LBK600, LBK700, and LBK800, respectively. No KCl was added to LBK10, but residual amounts of K+ (10 mm) were detected by flame spectrophotometry, and therefore we do not refer to this medium as LBK0. E. coli K-12 strain DH5α (recA1 gyrA (Nal) Δ(lacIZYAargF) (ϕ80dlac Δ[lacZ]M15), pir RK6) (33.Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8146) Google Scholar), and E. coli SY327 λpir (Δ(lac pro) argE(Am) rif nalA recA56) (34.Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar) were used for routine cloning procedures and were grown and harvested in LB medium (35.Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Construction of E. coli LB2005—A mutation strategy was designed to replace the entire open reading frame of the target gene chaA with the gene cat-1 (Fig. 1). QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen Sciences) was used to purify chromosomal DNA of E. coli LB2003. Using the E. coli genome sequence as a template, two pairs of restriction site-containing sense and antisense PCR primers (LSf, 5′-ATGAGCTCCCCGCCAGGATCGGTGCC-3′; LSr, 5′-CGGGATCCCAGTATATCTCCTCCG-3′; RSf, 5′-GCGGATCCTATGGTTATCCCTTTGCA-3′; RSr1, 5′-GCGAATTCTCTCTTCTGGCAGTCGAT-3′) were designed to amplify two fragments of 1000 base pairs (bp) flanking chaA. Plasmid pSTV28 was used as a template to amplify a 1000-bp fragment containing cat-1 (CMf, 5′-CCGGATCCATGGAGAAAAAAATCACT-3′; CMr, 5′-ATGGATCCTTACGCCCCGCCCTGCCCA-3′). PCR was performed according to the instructions accompanying iTaq™ DNA Polymerase (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Using the DNA ligation kit Ver.2.1 (TaKaRa Bio, Inc., Shiga, Japan), all PCR products were inserted into pT7Blue T-Vector (Novagen) by TA cloning (Fig. 1). The resulting recombinant plasmids were named pLS (containing the 1000-bp PCR product flanking the left shoulder of chaA), pRS (containing the 1000-bp PCR product flanking the right shoulder of chaA), and pCAT-1 (containing the 1000-bp PCR fragment of cat-1) (Fig. 1). Plasmid pRS was digested with the enzymes BamHI and EcoRI to obtain a 1000-bp PCR product. This product was purified from agarose gels with QFX PCR DNA and Gel Purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites of pLS to obtain the pLSRS recombinant plasmid. Using a SacI-containing sense primer (LSf, 5′-ATGAGCTCCCCGCCAGGATCGGTGCC-3′), a SalI-containing antisense primer (RSR2, 5′-GCGTCGACTCTCTTCTGGCAGTCGAT-3′), and pLSRS as a template, a 2-kbp fragment flanking chaA was amplified (creating a PCR product with the entire chaA gene deleted). This 2-kbp PCR fragment was cloned into pT7Blue T-Vector and then subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the pCVD442 suicidal vector (36.Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4310-4317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the unique SacI and SalI restriction sites. The resulting plasmid was named pCLR (Fig. 1). Plasmids pCLR and pCAT-1 were digested with BamHI, and a 1-kbp fragment containing cat-1 was cloned into the 2-kbp PCR fragment of pCLR. Thus, cat-1 in the plasmid was flanked by the same 1-kbp sequences as chaA in the E. coli genome. This ligation mixture was introduced into E. coli strain SY327 λ pir, and the resulting plasmid was named pCLR-1 (Fig. 1). Using the calcium chloride technique, recombinant plasmid pCLR-1 was transformed into E. coli LB2003, and the cells were plated on LB agar medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) to obtain partial merodiploid cells containing the integrated pCLR-1 (35.Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To select for second recombination events, the overnight LB/ampicillin and chloramphenicol culture was plated in LB. Serial dilutions were plated on LB and modified LB plates in which NaCl was replaced with 5% sucrose and further incubated for 24 –32 h at 30 °C. Sucrose-resistant colonies were checked for ampicillin sensitivity and chloramphenicol resistance. Colonies that proved to be ampicillin sensitive and sucrose/chloramphenicol resistant were checked by PCR to determine whether they retained chaA or whether it was replaced with cat-1. To purify vectors and recombinant plasmids during construction of the LB2005 strain, the Quantum Prep® Plasmid miniprep kit (Qiagen Sciences) was used. Measurement of DEA-dependent K+ Extrusion—Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C under aerobic conditions in LBK300 medium at pH 7.0 adjusted by HCl. A sample of preculture (200 μl) was transferred into 40 ml of LBK300 and was grown to OD660 nm 0.7 to 0.8. The resultant cell cultures were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, washed in 1 ml of 0.4 m KCl, and resuspended in 100 μl of 0.4 m KCl. These suspended cells were stored on ice before immediate use. A 4-μl aliquot of cells was added to 100 μl of reaction buffer (25 °C) containing 10 mm CAPSO free acid and 0.4 m NaCl at pH 9.0 adjusted by NaOH. At different time intervals (15 s and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 min), 2 ml of 0.4 m choline chloride containing 10 mm Tris at pH 7.4 adjusted by HCl was added to the tube to stop the reaction, and the cells were collected on 0.45-μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane filters (Advantec) using vacuum filtration. To efficiently collect reaction samples, reaction tubes were rinsed once more with 2 ml of choline chloride buffer, and these solutions were transferred onto the appropriate filters. Similar experiments were conducted with 100 μl of reaction buffer (25 °C) containing 50 mm DEA. DEA causes alkalinization of the cytoplasm by consuming intracellular H+. The K+/H+ antiporter catalyzes the exchange of intracellular K+ for extracellular H+. If the stoichiometry of the exchange process is one K+ (or Na+) for nH+ (where n >1), then the internal concentration of H+ becomes higher than the external concentration. Thus, the balance between neutral and protonated forms of amine inside the cell shifts toward the protonated form. This prompts the exchange activity of electrogenic antiporters in an alkaline pH environment, and the extrusion of cations can be detected with the filtration assay. The filtration was performed with a vacuum/pressure pump (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filters were immersed into 4 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the K+ contents were immediately determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AA-6200; Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). A standard K+ solution (K+ 1000 ppm) (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto North Office, Japan) was used as a control. Control samples were diluted in trichloroacetic acid (5%), and concentrations of K+ were 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 ppm, respectively. The intracellular concentrations of K+ in E. coli were calculated as described previously (29.Nakamura T. Tokuda H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 692: 389-396Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) assuming 5.4 μl of internal water space/mg of cell protein. Measurement of DEA-dependent K+ Efflux Against a K+ Chemical Gradient—This method was similar to the method described above, except the reaction buffer contained 20 mm N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid, 0.4 m KCl at pH 9.0 adjusted by KOH. In this buffer, K+ efflux under DEA pressure went against an outward K+ chemical gradient. Measurement of K+/H+ Exchange Activities Detected by the Acridine Orange Fluorescence Quenching Method—All activities were examined on inverted membrane vesicles prepared from cells grown in LBK300 as previously described (37.Hamada A. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Takabe T. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed, and resuspended in 10 ml of TCDS buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.14 m choline chloride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.25 m sucrose. The cells were applied to a French Pressure cell (4000 psi), and then the solution was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C and the pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of TCDS buffer. The antiporter activity was based upon the establishment of a transmembrane pH gradient (ΔpH) by the addition of salt to the reaction mixture that contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (titrated with HCl to the indicated pH), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.14 m choline chloride, 1 μm acridine orange, and membrane vesicles (100 μg of protein) in a final volume of 2 ml. The ΔpH was monitored at 25 °C with acridine orange as a probe at an extinction wavelength of 492 nm (bandwidth 1.5 nm) and emission wavelength of 525 nm (bandwidth 3.0 nm) using a Shimadzu RF-5300PC spectrophotometer. Before the addition of salt, Tris-dl-lactate (2 mm) was added to initiate fluorescence quenching due to respiration. Lactate energizes the vesicle and accumulates H+ within vesicles, which causes the accumulation of dye and fluorescence quenching. Upon the addition of salt (10 –100 mm), fluorescence increases because of the excretion of H+ by antiporters and therefore allows monitoring of dequenched fluorescence. Then, NH4Cl (25 mm) was added to dissipate ΔpH. The K+/H+ antiporter activity is expressed as percent dequenching, when quenching is equal to 100%. Data represent the average of six separate determinations ± S.D. Assays were conducted at a pH range from 7.0 to 9.0. Bacterial Growth Experiments—Cells of E. coli TO113, E. coli TO114, E. coli LB2003, and E. coli LB2005 cultures were grown in LBK30 (due to deficient K+ uptake systems) in the presence and absence of 100 mm NaCl up to the middle of the stationary phase (OD660 nm = 1.2). The cultures were diluted 100-fold into different fresh broths (LBK10, only in case of TO113 and TO114, LBK30, LBK100, LBK300, LBK500, LBK600, LBK700, LBK800 in the presence and absence of 100 mm NaCl at pH 6.5 or 8.5). Optical densities (660 nm) of the cultures were monitored every hour with a miniphoto 518R spectrophotometer (Taitec, Koshigaya-shi, Saitama-prefecture, Japan). Measurement of K+ Efflux From E. coli Cells by the DEA-dependent Method Using Na+ Buffer—To examine the K+ efflux activity of wild-type E. coli strain W3110 and mutants TO112, TO113, TO114, and TO116, the DEA-dependent method was used as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 2 shows the effect of DEA on K+ efflux from E. coli W3110 and E. coli TO114. In buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl and 10 mm CAPSO at pH 9.0, cells maintained ∼150 –200 nmol K+/mg of protein. Upon the addition of 50 mm DEA, W3110 cells released ∼150 –230 nmol K+/mg of protein (Fig. 2A), whereas TO114 cells were unable to mediate K+ efflux (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that genes nhaA, nhaB, and chaA are possible candidates for K+/H+ exchange in E. coli. To establish which gene was responsible for K+ efflux activity, we studied strains TO110, TO112, TO113, and TO116. TO113 cells, containing the chaA gene, released ∼114 –120 nmol K+/mg of protein upon addition of 50 mm DEA (Fig. 3C). Negligible K+ efflux (10 –30 nmol K+/mg of protein) was observed with TO116 cells, containing nhaA, and TO112 cells, containing nhaB (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). The release of K+ from TO110 cells was similar to the K+ release from TO114 cells described in Fig. 2B (data not shown).FIGURE 3Effect of diethanolamine on K+ efflux from normal cells of E. coli TO112 (B), TO113 (C), and TO116 (A). Cells were suspended in 0.4 m NaCl and 10 mm CAPSO at pH 9.0 (closed symbols). 50 mm diethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5, was added to the buffer after 2 min (open symbols). All data are the means ± S.D. of six independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The release of K+ from W3110 (wild-type) cells confirmed previously reported results (28.Plack R.H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3824-3825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Nakamura T. Tokuda H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 692: 389-396Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The data obtained with the strains described above, especially data for TO110, TO113, and TO114 cells, indicated that the chaA gene plays a major role in K+/H+ exchange under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the absence of chaA, K+ efflux from E. coli was not observed. The absence of K+ efflux from TO112 and TO116 suggested that nhaA and nhaB do not mediate K+/H+ exchange in E. coli. However, experiments were performed using whole cells, and therefore it is possible that the proteins encoded by these genes have minor K+ efflux activity. Based on the experimental data described above (Figs. 2 and 3), further experiments were conducted exclusively with chaA. Measurement of K+ Extrusion from E. coli by the DEA-dependent Method Using K+ Buffer—To determine whether ChaA can mediate K+ exchange against, as well as with, a K+ concentration gradient, we examined DEA-dependent K+ efflux from cells in K+ buffer. Experimental conditions were established whereby any release of K+ had to go against a K+ concentration gradient (see “Experimental Procedures”). The TO113 (chaA-positive) cells and TO114 (chaA-negative) cells maintained ∼250 –300 nmol K+/mg of protein in buffer containing 0.4 m KCl, 20 mm N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-3-propanesulfonic acid, 0.2% glucose, pH 9.0 (Fig. 4, A and B). After 16 min under these conditions, only negligible (i.e. 5–15 nmol K+/mg of protein) K+ efflux was observed. Upon addition of 50 mm DEA, TO113 cells released ∼115–145 nmol K+/mg of protein (Fig. 4A), whereas TO114 showed no significant K+ efflux (Fig. 4B). The experiment was repeated six times, and each time TO113 cells released <145 nmol K+/mg of protein into K+ buffer. The moderate release of K+ may have been due to the presence of K+ uptake systems that interfered with K+ efflux systems in TO113 cells. LB2003 and LB2005 cells were used to determine whether ChaA can maintain K+ efflux against a K+ concentration gradient. Strain LB2003 has deficient K+ uptake systems, and thus K+ uptake probably would not interfere with K+ efflux in these cells. chaA was deleted from the LB2003 strain to derive the LB2005 strain, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In K+ buffer, LB2003 and LB2005 cells maintained ∼250 –300 nmol K+/mg of protein (Fig. 4, C and D). Upon addition of 50 mm DEA, LB2003 cells released ∼205–240 nmol K+/mg of protein (Fig. 4C), whereas LB2005 cells did not significantly release K+ (Fig. 4D). K+/H+ Exchange Activities of E. coli-inverted Membrane Vesicles and Effects of pH and KCl Concentrations on K+/H+ Exchange—The data described above suggested that chaA encodes a protein responsible for K+ efflux under DEA pressure. Next, the K+/H+ exchange activity of ChaA was studied by using inverted membrane vesicles generated from LB2003 and LB2005 cells. Exchange activities were monitored by measuring acridine orange fluorescence quenching upon the addition of d-lactate, with subsequent dequenching upon addition of KCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The K+/H+ exchange activity was detected in inverted membranes made from LB2003 cells but not in those from LB2005 cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the extent of dequenching increased with increasing KCl concentration (Fig. 5B). Addition of 10 mm KCl yielded 14 –15% dequenching, whereas addition of 50 and 100 mm KCl yielded 33–38 and 48 –50% dequenching, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). When LB2005 inverted membranes were used, only negligible (2–3%) dequenching was observed, irrespective of KCl concentration (Fig. 5, A and B). The K+/H+ exchange activities of inverted membranes were pH dependent and increased with increasing pH, with prominent dequenching of fluorescence at pH 9.0 upon the addition of KCl (Fig. 5C). These results suggested that ChaA has K+/H+ exchange activity with an estimated Km >10 mm for K+ (Fig. 5). Toxic Effect of KCl on the Growth of E. coli Cells—Next, the effects were determined of different K+ concentrations and pH on the growth of chaA-containing strains (LB2003 and W3110) and chaA-deficient strains (LB2005 and TO110). The growth of E. coli cells is sensitive to high concentrations of KCl (Fig. 6). For example, to reach an optical density (OD) of 1.0 at pH 6.5, cultures required approximately twice as much time when grown in LBK700 compared with growth in LBK100 (data not shown). Fig. 6 shows the growth (OD of cultures) after 9 h under conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells lacking chaA (LB2005 and TO110) were more sensitive to high KCl concentrations in alkaline conditions than wild-type cells (Fig. 6). Furthermore, strains grown in medium containing 100 mm NaCl were even more sensitive to high KCl concentrations than in media with residual amounts of NaCl (5–8 mm) (Fig. 6). This effect was especially prominent after 24 h of incubation in LBK500 and LBK600 containing 100 mm NaCl at pH 8.5 (Fig. 7). For example, strains W3110 and LB2003 were able to grow in LBK containing 600 and 500 mm KCl, respectively, whereas strains lacking chaA (TO110 and LB2005) were unable to grow under these conditions (Fig. 7). These results indicated that chaA is required for optimal growth in high concentrations of KCl and alkaline pH.FIGURE 7Effects of different KCl concentrations and alkaline pH 8.5 on bacterial strains after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Two-way analysis of variance was used, and the differences were considered significant at p < 0.001. All data are the means ± S.D. of three independent determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The only well studied genes of E. coli involved in K+ efflux are kefB and kefC. However, they act to acidify the cytoplasm only when activated by toxins and are probably not involved in regulating internal pH under other conditions (2.Epstein W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 75: 293-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Recent study shows that MdfA participates in regulation of E. coli pH homeostasis at external alkaline pH (up to pH 10) by Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange (13.Lewinson E. Padan E. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14073-14078Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence suggest the existence of K+/H+ antiporters in bacteria (27.Brey R.N. Rosen B.P. Sorensen E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 39-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data obtained from V. alginolyticus indicate that the K+ requirements for pH homeostasis are not identical at acidic and alkaline pH (29.Nakamura T. Tokuda H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 692: 389-396Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30.Nakamura T. Tokuda H. Unemoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 776: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38.Nakamura T. Kawasaki S. Unemoto T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutant of Enterococcus hirae was isolated that was totally defective in K+/H+ antiporter activity at pH 9.5 and did not grow above pH 9.0 (39.Kakinuma Y. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4103-4105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recent cloning of the gene nhaP2 from V. parahaemolyticus revealed a K+/H+ electrogenic antiporter system that is active at alkaline pH and high KCl concentrations (17.Radchenko M.V. Waditee R. Oshimi S. Fukuhara M. Takabe T. Nakamura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data suggest that bacteria, in general, have K+/H+ antiporters actively operating in alkaline pH environments. Our previous work (17.Radchenko M.V. Waditee R. Oshimi S. Fukuhara M. Takabe T. Nakamura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) indicated that nhaA, nhaB, and nhaP2 from Vibrio are plausible candidates for maintaining K+ efflux under DEA pressure and that E. coli had similar transporter(s). The present study revealed that chaA encodes an antiporter with the ability to mediate K+ efflux and K+/H+ exchange (Figs. 3C, 4A and C, and 5A and C) and therefore represents a potential K+/H+ antiporter. Previous (14.Padan E. Bibi E. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1717: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and present studies showed that nhaA and nhaB appear not to be involved in K+ efflux from E. coli cells. This reveals a difference in the physiologies of E. coli and V. parahaemolyticus. NhaA and NhaB of V. parahaemolyticus are Na+(K+)/H+ antiporters, although the K+/H+ exchange activity of these proteins appears to be secondary to the Na+/H+ antiporter activity (17.Radchenko M.V. Waditee R. Oshimi S. Fukuhara M. Takabe T. Nakamura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous studies of chaA indicate that it has a physiological role in sodium (40.Shijuku T. Yamashino T. Ohashi H. Saito H. Kakegawa T. Ohta M. Kobayashi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and calcium (32.Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) ion extrusion. The apparent K+/H+ antiport activity was not detected in the initial characterization of this antiporter, probably due to the fact that ChaA was not assayed at high enough pH and [KCl]. The present study reveals that chaA encodes a K+/H+ antiporter. ChaA extrudes K+ against both outwardly (Fig. 3C) and inwardly (Fig. 4, A and C) directed K+ concentration gradients. The K+/H+ exchange activity of ChaA is pH dependent and active at alkaline pH. We did not detect exchange activities of inverted membrane vesicles at pH lower than 8.0, but the activity became prominent at pH 9.0 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the ChaA affinity for K+ increased with increasing KCl concentration (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that ChaA is involved in KCl salinity tolerance. A similar K+/H+ exchange activity has been described in plants (42.Fukada-Tanaka S. Inagaki Y. Yamaguchi T. Saito N. Iida S. Nature. 2000; 407: 581Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 43.Venema K. Belver A. Marín-Manzano C. Rodríguez-Rosales M.P. Donaire J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22453-22459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and humans (44.Numata M. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17387-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Existence of at least two different K+/H+ antiporters (MdfA (13.Lewinson E. Padan E. Bibi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14073-14078Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and ChaA) has been demonstrated in E. coli and at least three (NhaA, NhaB, NhaP2) in V. parahaemolyticus (17.Radchenko M.V. Waditee R. Oshimi S. Fukuhara M. Takabe T. Nakamura T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 59: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The issue of why cells have so many antiporters with overlapping specifications is an interesting question, and it seems that the answer may be that they each have value at slightly different pH and concentration ranges as well as having different and sometimes multiple monovalent cation profiles. Our physiological study of E. coli strains revealed another interesting finding. Concentrations of KCl higher than 500 mm in medium were found to be toxic (Figs. 6 and 7). KCl toxicity was more prominent at alkaline pH (Figs. 6 and 7). KCl toxicity may not have been studied previously because of the generally accepted idea that bacteria use K+ as a primary solute for osmotic regulation. However, most bacteria, with the exception of halophilic species, use K+ only under conditions of low osmolarity and utilize polar molecules under conditions of higher osmolarity. This is consistent with the current finding that environments containing excessive amounts of K+ are toxic and that a K+/H+ antiporter is required to remove excess K+ under such conditions. Our results indicate the importance of chaA for cell survival and adaptation (Figs. 6 and 7). E. coli strains containing chaA were able to adapt to conditions of high KCl concentration and alkalinity more easily and were able to grow under these conditions at least two times faster than strains lacking chaA (Figs. 6 and 7). In summary, these findings indicate that chaA encodes a physiologically significant K+/H+ antiporter. Antiporter activation is triggered by alkaline pH and high external or internal KCl concentration.

Emerging data indicate that the arabinans of AG and LAM are distinguished by virtue of the additional presence of linear termini in LAM, which entails some unknown feature of the EmbC protein for proper synthesis. In common with the two paralogous EmbA and EmbB proteins functionally implicated for the arabinosylation of AG, EmbC is predicted to carry 13 transmembrane spanning helices in an integral N-terminal domain followed by a hydrophilic extracytoplasmic C-terminal domain. To delineate the function of this C-terminal domain, the embC knock-out mutant of Mycobacterium smegmatis was complemented with plasmids expressing truncated embC genes. The expression level of serially truncated EmbC protein thus induced was examined by EmbC-specific peptide antibody, and their functional implications were inferred from ensuing detailed structural analysis of the truncated LAM variants synthesized. Apart from critically showing that the smaller arabinans are mostly devoid of the linear terminal motif, β-d-Araf(1→2)-α-d-Araf(1→5)-α-d-Araf(1→5)-α-d-Araf, our studies clearly implicate the C-terminal domain of EmbC in the chain extension of LAM. For the first time a full range of arabinan chains as large as 18-22 Araf residues and beyond could be released intact by the use of an endogenous endo-d-arabinanase from M. smegmatis, profiled, and sequenced directly by tandem mass spectrometry. In conjunction with NMR studies, our results unequivocally show that the LAM-specific linear termini are an extension on a well defined inner branched Ara-(18-22) core. This hitherto unrecognized feature not only allows a significant revision of the structural model of LAM-arabinan since its first description a decade ago but also furnishes a probable molecular basis of selectivity in biosynthesis, as conferred by the EmbC protein. d-Arabinofurans, attached to either a galactofuran or a lipomannan, are the primary constituents of mycobacterial cell wall, forming the unique arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), respectively.

Through this phenomenal volume of work, some unique features pertaining to these components have been clarified. The d-arabinan, a common constituent of both LAM and AG, is a unique homopolymer of about 40-70 d-arabinofuranose (Araf) residues, assembled mostly into stretches of -[α-d-Araf(1→5)-α-d-Araf]n-with critically spaced α3,5-Araf-branched sites. In AG, the nonreducing termini invariably form a well defined [β-d-Araf(1→2)-α-d-Araf]2-3,5-α-d-Araf(1→5)-α-d-Araf motif (5McNeil M.R. Robuck K.G. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), of which the terminal β-Araf and the penultimate α2-Araf serve as the anchoring points for the mycolic acids (6McNeil M. Daffe M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two such characteristic terminal Ara6 motifs with additional α5-Araf residues at the reducing end are assembled into a unique Ara22-mer, the largest structurally defined arabinan unit to date (7Besra G.S. Khoo K.-H. McNeil M.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4257-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Up to 3 such units are in turn attached in as yet unknown manner to the 5-position of the 6-β-d-galactofuranose residues of the d-galactofuran, located in close proximity to the linker region Rha(1→4)GlcNAc (8McNeil M.

In contrast to such an elaborate architecture of AG with highly structured arabinan, LAM on the other hand boasts a more heterogeneous structural entity based on several aspects such as charge distribution, size, and additional substituents within the molecule (10Treumann A.

A tripartite structure of LAM has been established and shown to consist of an arabinan chain on a mannan backbone with a phosphatidylinositol anchor that intercalates into the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the nonreducing ends of these arabinans are capped to varying degrees with mannose residues responsible for much of the LAM biological roles relating to host pathogen interaction. In M. smegmatis, a non-pathogen, this capping function is restricted to inositol phosphate on a minor fraction of the termini (13Khoo K.-H. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1990; 1: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Nigou J. Gilleron M. Cahuzac B. Bounéry J.D. Herold M. Thurnher M. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23094-23103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to the branched nonreducing terminal Ara6 motif as found in AG, a major difference that identifies the arabinan of LAM from that of AG is the distinctive presence of linear termini (15Chatterjee D. Bozic C.M. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9652-9660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chatterjee D. Khoo K.-H. McNeil M.R. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12380-12389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A commonly held view is to attribute its formation to incomplete α-3-branching off the α-5-arabinan backbone before termination by β-2-arabinosylation, thus forming a linear Ara4, β-d-Araf(1→2)-α-d-Araf(1→5)-α-d-Araf(1→5)-α-d-Araf, instead of the branched Ara6 motif. The exact architectural setting and the underlying molecular basis governing their selective biosynthesis are largely unknown except that EmbA and EmbB are involved in this branching. The genetics and biosynthesis of arabinan remain a gray area even with the availability of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence (18Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6406) Google Scholar). The only biosynthetic information has come from the identification of a two-gene locus from Mycobacterium avium, the overexpression of which could render an otherwise susceptible M. smegmatis host resistant to ethambutol (19Belanger A.E. Besra G.S. Ford M.E. Mikusova K. Belisle J.T. Brennan P.J. Inamine J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11919-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Three paralogous genes in an operon encoding putative targets of ethambutol in M. smegmatis, M. tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium leprae were subsequently cloned and sequenced (20Telenti A. Philipp W.J. Sreevatsan S. Bernasconi C. Stockbauer K.E. Wieles B. Musser J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 21Lety M.A. Nair S. Berche P. Escuyer V. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2629-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these genes were similar to the embA and embB described in M. avium, as was the third paralog, embC, also similar to embA and embB. Although the Emb proteins have never been isolated nor their functions unequivocally established, critical biochemical analyses have demonstrated that (22Escuyer V.E. Lety M.A. Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Tang J.B. Rithner C.D. Frehel C. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48854-48862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in individual knock-out mutants of embA and embB in M. smegmatis, AG defective at the nonreducing ends (because of the absence of the branched Ara6 termini) was obtained; whereas the knock-out mutant of embC was unable to synthesize any LAM, synthesis of LM remained unaffected (23Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recent work has identified short amino acid sequences within the Emb proteins that conform to the proline-rich motif found in a family of bacterial membrane proteins known as polysaccharide chain length determinants (24Becker A. Puhler A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 395-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Daniels C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, Emb proteins have been determined to belong to the glycosyltransferase superfamily C (26Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of an aspartic acid in the glycosyltransferase superfamily C motif of EmbC led to ablation of LAM synthesis, suggesting an arabinosyltransferase activity (27Berg S. Starbuck J. Torrelles J.B. Vissa V.D. Crick D.C. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5651-5663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, introduction of point mutations in the conserved proline motif of EmbC proximal to the C-terminal domain led to synthesis of smaller arabinans largely devoid of linear Ara4, thus generating a structure similar to AG. This finding is reminiscent of an earlier work in which replacing the C-terminal domain of EmbC with the corresponding domain of EmbB likewise disfavored the synthesis of linear termini (23Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the C-terminal domain of the Emb proteins, in contact and perhaps acting in concert with the proximal proline motif, are mainly responsible for selective AG versus LAM-like arabinan formation. Our present work aims to substantiate the contribution of this domain using a recombinant cloning approach to delete various numbers of amino acids from the C-terminal end of EmbC. We demonstrate that C-terminal truncation of EmbC halts LAM-specific linear extension from an AG-like inner arabinan core structure. Collectively, our data reveal a new model that implicates this inner branched Ara-(18-22)-mer core structure as a shared intermediate utilized by enzymes destined for either LAM or AG synthesis. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) was grown at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani medium with or without ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or hygromycin (50 μg/ml). M. smegmatis mc2155 (22Escuyer V.E. Lety M.A. Torrelles J.B. Khoo K.H. Tang J.B. Rithner C.D. Frehel C. McNeil M.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48854-48862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and recombinant strains were grown at 37 °C in either 7H9 (liquid) or 7H11 (solid, Difco) supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment and glycerol with or without kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and hygromycin (50 μg/ml). Transformation of E. coli was carried out according to standard procedure. Transformation of M. smegmatis mc2155 was performed by electroporation as described (28Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The status of LAM/LM/PIMs was examined in the total extracts from colonies grown and harvested over 4 days (late logarithmic phase to stationary phase for M. smegmatis). After 4 days of growth, the cellular content of LAM detected was minimal in all strains. After this observation, to delineate the LAM-arabinan in the mutants, cells were harvested only in log phase (2.5 days for cells cultured in liquid medium). Construction of Recombinant Plasmids Encoding the Truncated EmbC Proteins—The 3225-bp open reading frame of embC from M. smegmatis was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using primers (embC-f 5′-GTT AGC ATC TAG ACA TAT GAC CGG TCC GCA TGC AG-3′; embC-r 5′-AAG CTT CAA CTC AGC CGC AGG GGC GCC GGG-3′) including NdeI and HindIII restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pSTBlue-1 (Novagen) for sequence confirmation and subsequently integrated into pVV16 (derived from pMV261 after digestion with NdeI and HindIII). To construct the recombinant strains with truncated EmbC proteins, the forward primer was combined with one of six reverse primers (listed in supplemental Table 1) for PCR amplification of the desired fragments. The final plasmids were electroporated into M. smegmatisΔembC as described (23Zhang N. Torrelles J.B. McNeil M.R. Escuyer V.E. Khoo K.H. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The recombinant strains were termed as EmbCΔ50c, EmbCΔ100c, EmbCΔ200c, EmbCΔ300c, EmbCΔ368c, and EmbCΔ407c, symbolizing an increased deletion of amino acids from the C-terminal end of EmbC. On one occasion, the above plasmids were also electroporated into M. smegmatis mc2155. Polyclonal Antibody to M. smegmatis EmbC-specific Peptide—The sequence 162DDDDPGEAVRGERSGYDFR180 of M. smegmatis EmbC was selected for peptide synthesis based on the following criteria. The peptide shares low or no sequence identity with M. smegmatis EmbA, EmbB, and other antigens putatively expressed from the genome of M. smegmatis according to BLAST searches performed at The Institute for Genomic Research. Also, the peptide is part of the first predicted loop of M. smegmatis EmbC and contains a low number of hydrophobic residues. Peptide (5 mg) was synthesized and conjugated to carrier diphtheria toxoid via the linker maleimidocaproyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Mimotopes, Roseville, MN). Polyclonal antiserum was raised in BALB/c mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) immunized with an emulsion containing 50 μg of the M. smegmatis EmbC peptide coupled to the carrier diphtheria toxoid in a 1:1 ratio of phosphate-buffered saline and incomplete Freund's adjuvant injected at two abdominal sites subcutaneously. Booster injections of 50 μg of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant emulsion were repeated every 3 weeks, with test bleeds taken for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after the first and second booster. The titer of the antiserum after the third boost was >1:5000 as measured by Western blot against the native protein enriched in the membrane fraction of M. smegmatis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay by testing serial 2-fold dilutions of the serum against the free peptide (coated on ELISA plate wells at 1 μg/well). Detection of EmbC in M. smegmatis Wild-type and Recombinant Strains by Western Blot—Cells were suspended in a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercap-toethanol, pH 8.0, in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and disrupted by intermittent probe sonication (Soniprep 150, Sanyo Gallenkamp PLC) for 10 cycles (60-s bursts/90 s of cooling). Individual sonicated samples were digested with 10 mg/ml DNase and RNase for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell walls were obtained by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants from this step were recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h to provide a sediment enriched in membrane. Protein concentration in each of the cell wall, membrane, and cytosolic fractions was determined by BCA assay before subjecting to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described (29Spencer J.S. Kim H.J. Marques A.M. Gonzalez-Juarerro M. Lima M.C. Vissa V.D. Truman R.W. Gennaro M.L. Cho S.N. Cole S.T. Brennan P.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3161-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked overnight with 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline incubated with polyclonal mouse serum (1:2000) for 4 h. After washing, the membranes were incubated with anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma). The substrates nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Sigma FAST BCIP) were used for color development. Extraction of LAM/LM/PIMs from M. smegmatis Wild-type and Recombinant Strains—Cells harvested from 4-liter lots of broth cultures in log phase were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lyophilized. Dry cells were delipidated with organic solvents and disrupted mechanically with the Soniprep 150. The resulting homogeneous suspension was refluxed in 50% ethanol at 80 °C (3 × 2 h each). The combined supernatants were evaporated and digested with proteinase K (Invitrogen; 1 mg/ml). After dialysis, LAM/LM/PIMs fractions were dried (10Treumann A. Xidong F. McDonnell L. Derrick P.J.

Size Fractionation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—For purification of LAM/truncated LAM from all strains used in this study, size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Rainin SD 200 series liquid chromatography system fitted with a Sephacryl S-200 HiPrep 16/60 column in tandem with a Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (30Khoo K.H.

Fractions were re-analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with mAb CS-35 as described previously (31Prinzis S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2649-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) to check for purity before detailed analysis. Digestion with Endoarabinanase and Subsequent Analyses—Preparation of Cellulomonas gelida endoarabinanase has been described (5McNeil M.R. Robuck K.G. Harter M. Brennan P.J. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To ensure complete digestion of LAMs, the reaction mixture was incubated overnight, and the digestion products were analyzed directly by Dionex analytical high pH anion exchange chromatography performed on a Dionex liquid chromatography system fitted with a Dionex Carbopac PA-1 column. The oligoarabinosides were detected with a pulse-amperometric detector (PAD-II) (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Monosaccharide Composition—Samples were hydrolyzed with 2 m trifluoroacetic acid, converted to alditol acetates, and analyzed by gas chromatography (33McNeil M. Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. Brennan P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 215-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) on a Hewlett Packard gas chromatography model 5890 fitted with a SP 2380 column (30-m × 0.25-mm inner diameter) at an initial temperature of 50 °C for 1 min, increasing to 170 °C by 30°/min followed by 270 °C by 5 °C/min. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) of the methylated alditol acetates were carried out on a ThermoQuest Trace Gas Chromatograph 2000 (ThermoQuest, Austin, TX) connected to a GCQ/Polaris MS mass detector (ThermoQuest). The derivatives were dissolved in hexanes before injection on a DB-5 column (10-m × 0.18-mm inner diameter, 0.18-μm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) at an initial temperature of 60 °C for 1 min, increasing to 130 °C at 30°/min and finally to 280 °C at 5°/min. Digestion with Msm-arabinanase—Preparation of Msm-arabinanase has been described (34Xin Y. Huang Y. McNeil M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). More recently this enzyme has been sufficiently purified for use as a structural tool via ammonium sulfate precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (35Dong X. Bhamidi S. Scherman M. Xin Y. McNeil M.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Purified LAM (2 mg) from each of the recombinant strains was digested with 250 μl of the Msm-arabinanase in 25 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The digestion products containing both the mannan core and the released oligoarabinosides were separated using Amicon Microcon YM-30 (Millipore) and centrifuging at 6,500 × g for 20 min. The flow-through was then directly permethylated (36Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) for MS analysis or after further purification by high performance liquid chromatography (Waters) on a Super-dex™ Peptide 10/300 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with water at the rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution profile was monitored using the Waters refractive index detector, model 2414. The fractions were pooled and analyzed. MALDI-MS and MS/MS Analyses—The arabinan fragments released by Msm-arabinanase were either permethylated or prereduced and permethylated using the NaOH/dimethyl sulfoxide slurry method as described (36Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). For MALDI-TOF MS glycan profiling, the permethyl derivatives in acetonitrile were mixed 1:1 with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix (10 mg/ml in water) for spotting onto the target plate. MS data acquisition in the reflectron mode was performed on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with an Nd:YAG laser (355-nm wavelength, <500-ps pulse, and 200-Hz repetition rate). MALDI-MS/MS was performed on a dedicated quadrupole TOF Ultima MALDI instrument (Micromass) in which case the permethylated samples in acetonitrile were mixed 1:1 with α-cyano-4-hydrocinnamic acid matrix (in acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 99:1 v:v) for spotting onto the target plate. The nitrogen UV laser (337-nm wavelength) was operated at a repetition rate of 10 Hz under full power (300 μJ/pulse). MS survey data were manually acquired, and the decision to switch over to collision-induced dissociation MS/MS acquisition mode for a particular parent ion was made on-the-fly upon examination of the summed spectra. Argon was used as the collision gas with a collision energy manually adjusted (between 50∼200 V) to achieve optimum degree of fragmentation for the parent ions under investigation. NMR Spectroscopy of LAM Samples—Spectra were acquired after several lyophilizations in D2O of 4-5 mg/0.6 ml in 100% D2O. Two-dimensional 1H,13C{13C} heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (NIH-SIG RR11981) using the supplied Varian pulse sequences. The HSQC data were acquired with a 7-kHz window for proton in F2 and a 15-kHz window for carbon in F1. The total recycle time was 1.65 s between transients. Composite pulse, GARP, decoupling was applied to carbon during proton acquisition. Pulsed field gradients were used throughout for artifact suppression but were not used for coherence selection. The data set consisted of 1000 complex points in t2 by 256 complex points in t1 using States-TPPI. Forward linear prediction was used for resolution enhancement to expand t1 to 512 complex points. Cos2 weighting functions were matched to the time domain in both t1 and t2, and zero-filling was applied to both t1 and t2 before the Fourier transform. The final resolution was 3.5 Hz/point in F2 and 15 Hz/pt in F1. Two-dimensional 1H,13C{13C} proton-detected single quantum coherence-filtered total correlation spectroscopy (HSQC-TOCSY).

The HSQC-TOCSY data were acquired with a 5.5-kHz window for proton in F2 and a 15-kHz window for carbon in F1. The TOCSY mixing time was 0.120 ms applied with a 7-kHz field. The total recycle time was 1.65 s between transients. GARP decoupling was applied to carbon during proton acquisition.

The final resolution was 3 Hz/point in F2 and 15 Hz/point in F1. Expression of C-terminal-truncated EmbC Proteins and Synthesis of Truncated LAM Variants—A prime focus of this work is to assign functions to the predicted C-terminal domain of the EmbC protein. To this end, primers were designed (supplemental Table I) to generate a series of EmbC proteins truncated from the C-terminal domain as depicted in Fig. 2.

https://openalex.org/W2013964647,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays an essential role in chondrocyte maturation. It stimulates chondrocyte proliferation but inhibits chondrocyte differentiation. In this study, we found that TGF-beta rapidly induced beta-catenin protein levels and signaling in murine neonatal sternal primary chondrocytes. TGF-beta-increased beta-catenin induction was reproduced by overexpression of SMAD3 and was absent in Smad3(-/-) chondrocytes treated with TGF-beta. SMAD3 inhibited beta-transducin repeat-containing protein-mediated degradation of beta-catenin and immunoprecipitated with beta-catenin following TGF-beta treatment. Both SMAD3 and beta-catenin co-localized to the nucleus after TGF-beta treatment. Although both TGF-beta and beta-catenin stimulated cyclin D(1) expression in chondrocytes, the effect of TGF-beta was inhibited with beta-catenin gene deletion or SMAD3 loss of function. These results demonstrate that TGF-beta stimulates cyclin D(1) expression at least in part through activation of beta-catenin signaling."

FVIIa consists of a trypsin-like protease domain and an N-terminal light chain composed of a membrane-binding γ-carboxyglutamate-rich domain (Gla domain) and two epidermal growth factor-like domains (EGF1 and EGF2) (1Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Upon tissue injury, tissue factor (TF) becomes exposed, and the TF ·FVIIa complex forms and serves as the initiator of the blood coagulation cascade (2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Numerous coagulation proteases function optimally only when complexed to cofactors, and substantial biochemical evidence supports the concept that several of these cofactors induce allosteric changes in the conformation of their cognate enzymes (1Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). TF functions to localize FVIIa and as an allosteric regulator, which dramatically enhances the activity of FVIIa. Similar to the trypsinogen-trypsin pair, zymogen FVII is converted to FVIIa by proteolysis of an internal peptide bond. A canonical “activation domain” was defined in trypsin, which includes the N terminus created upon endoproteolytic activation and three loops referred to as the activation loops (3Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In trypsin, the newly generated N-terminal tail spontaneously inserts itself into a cavity close to the three activation loops, termed the activation pocket, resulting in the formation of a critical salt bridge between the N-terminal Ile-16 and Asp-194 of the active site or Ile-153(16) and Asp-343(194) in FVIIa (the chymotrypsin numbering is denoted in superscript with parentheses). This salt bridge leads to the formation of a correctly assembled S1 pocket of the active site and full activity. FVIIa, however, has very low activity following endoproteolytic activation and does not spontaneously rearrange into the active form. The three-dimensional structure of FVIIa bound to TF has been solved providing important structural details of the complex and the active form of FVIIa (4Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In the complex, parts of the light chain and the protease domain of FVIIa form an extended interface with the N-terminal domain of TF (Fig. 1A). Crystal structures of FVIIa in the absence of TF had also been solved, but crystallizations were performed in the presence of active site inhibitors that locked FVIIa in the active form (5Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Roberts S.M. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8925-8930Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 6Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.P.

No structural information is available for zymogen FVII and FVIIa in solution as they circulate in the blood prior to vascular injury, and the structural details of TF-induced activation are therefore unclear. Amide hydrogen exchange (HX) monitored by mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be a powerful technique for investigating the conformational properties of proteins in solution (7Hoofnagle A.N. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Liang Z.X. Lee T. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2005; 12: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Altered HX rates between protein states can act as sensitive probes for changes in the dynamics of protein structure, and for native protein structures, a decrease in the observed exchange rate correlates with increased local structural stability and vice versa (10Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Using HX coupled with MS detection, we have studied zymogen FVII and FVIIa along with the effects of TF binding to these different FVII/FVIIa forms. We also studied the HX kinetics of FVIIa in the presence of an active site inhibitor (IN18), which is derivatized from the amidinophenyl family of inhibitors (11Klingler O. Matter H. Schudok M. Bajaj S.P. Czech J. Lorenz M. Nestler H.P. Schreuder H. Wildgoose P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) known to lock FVIIa in the active conformation (5Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Roberts S.M. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8925-8930Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Both TF and IN18 induce the active conformation but bind at different sites on FVIIa, and the latter data set is important for distinguishing between HX effects (12Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 25: 158-170Crossref Scopus (658) Google Scholar) observed in FVIIa upon TF binding. Regions that are affected by both molecules represent regions in FVIIa responding to activation, whereas regions that respond to only one of the molecules can be disregarded as due to the steric effects at binding interfaces. With these tools, we were able to characterize the structural properties of the different states of FVII/FVIIa, which are of biological relevance during activation in the blood. Regions of FVIIa undergoing structural rearrangements or changes in dynamics upon transition to the active form are revealed, providing novel insights into the molecular nature of the allosteric activation of this cofactor-dependent trypsin-like protease. HX Sample Preparation—Recombinant human FVIIa and FVIIR152A (13Thim L. Bjoern S. Christensen M. Nicolaisen E.M. Lund-Hansen T. Pedersen A.H. Hedner U. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7785-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and soluble human TF-(1-219) (14Freskgård P.O. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were expressed and purified as reported previously. The amidinophenylurea-based FVIIa inhibitor IN18 was synthesized and purified essentially as described (Ref. 11Klingler O. Matter H. Schudok M. Bajaj S.P. Czech J. Lorenz M. Nestler H.P. Schreuder H. Wildgoose P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; IN18 is identical to compound 18 in this reference). FVIIa and FVIIR152A were deglycosylated to enable MS detection by 5 units/μl PNGase F (New England Biolabs) in 10 mm glycyl-glycine, pH 6.6, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA at 30 °C for 18 h. N-Deglycosylated FVIIa was subsequently purified by anion-exchange chromatography and eluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm CaCl2. All proteins were buffer-exchanged and concentrated in 20 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.0, 25 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 3% glucose and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by A280, and full activity of FVIIa was verified by an amidolytic assay in the presence of TF as described (15Persson E. Kjalke M. Olsen O.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Amide 1H/2H hydrogen exchange was initiated by a 12-fold dilution of a protiated protein stock solution in the presence or absence of cofactor/inhibitor into the corresponding deuterated buffer (i.e. 20 mm bis-Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, 99% D2O, pH 6.0 (uncorrected value)). A low salt buffer was used to avoid solubility problems during preparation of the stock solution of exchange-in buffer. Furthermore, 10 mm CaCl2 was used in the exchange buffer rather than a more physiological concentration to compensate for the decreased affinity of FVIIa for Ca2+ at pH 6.0. pH 6.0 was used in the exchange-in experiments to allow for improved resolution of fast-exchanging amides. Nondeuterated controls were prepared by dilution into an identical protiated buffer. Experiments at pH 7.4 were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 99% D2O, pH 7.4 (uncorrected value). All HX reactions were carried out at 25 °C and contained 4.3 μm FVII/FVIIa protein in the absence or presence of either 21 μm soluble TF-(1-219) or 1 mm IN18. At appropriate time intervals, aliquots of the HX reaction were quenched by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold quenching buffer (1.25 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride adjusted to pH 2.15 using NaOH) resulting in a final pH of 2.3 (uncorrected value). Quenched samples were immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. Rapid Desalting and MS Analysis—The apparatus for rapid desalting was configured as described (16Jørgensen T.J. Gårdsvoll H. Danø K. Roepstorff P. Ploug M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15044-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The setup consisted of two high pressure liquid chromatography pumps (Agilent 1100 series), an injection valve (Rheodyne 7725i) with an injection loop containing a 4.3 × 50-mm column packed with immobilized pepsin (Pierce), and a 10-port switching valve (Valco Instruments Inc.) equipped with a micro-column (approximately 2-μl bed volume of Poros 20R2) in addition to an analytical C18 column (Jupiter 4u, Phenomenex). The entire plumbing system was immersed in an ice bath. Samples were loaded directly onto the pepsin column and digested for 2 min. The resulting peptide mixture was flushed onto the micro-column and desalted for 3 min at 250 μl/min in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Subsequently, the micro-column was automatically switched in line with the analytical column, and peptides were eluted into an electrospray ion source at 50 μl/min by a 10-min gradient of 20-80% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Positive ion-electrospray ionization mass spectra of eluted peptides were acquired on a LCT mass spectrometer (Waters Inc.). Data Analysis—Peptic peptides were identified in separate experiments using standard MS/MS methods. Average masses of peptide isotopic envelopes were determined from lockmass-corrected centroided data (processed using MassLynx software, Waters Inc.) using an Excel spreadsheet. Complete deuteration of control samples was achieved by incubation for 70 h at 37 °C in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride (deuterated). Average back-exchange (i.e. deuterium loss) was measured to be 14% for the analyzed peptides. However, no corrections were made for this deuterium loss because only the relative levels of deuterium incorporation of all samples were compared. Mass determination of replicate samples of FVIIa at 100 s of deuteration showed a standard deviation in mass measurements, < 0.1 Da (n = 4). Representative HX curves of deuterium incorporation versus time were fitted by nonlinear least squares regression to a triexponential equation as described (16Jørgensen T.J. Gårdsvoll H. Danø K. Roepstorff P. Ploug M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15044-15057Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In all fits, kfast was set to a value of 20 s−1. Fits to the triexponential equation were not significantly influenced by the random error of the experimental data (S.D. < 0.1 Da). HX kinetics of zymogen FVII (inactivable FVIIR152A) and FVIIa in the presence or absence of TF along with FVIIa in the presence of the active site inhibitor IN18 were studied. HX experiments were initiated by dilution of proteins into deuterium, and the subsequent time-resolved deuterium incorporation was localized to various regions of FVII/FVIIa by mass analysis of peptides produced by peptic proteolysis. In this manner, 57 peptides of FVIIa (Fig. 1B; supplemental Fig. 1, A-C) were identified and used to monitor HX kinetics of 311 of 407 amide hydrogens (44% FVIIa light chain, 98% FVIIa protease domain). Corresponding peptides were similarly identified for zymogen FVIIR152A (supplemental Fig. 1, A-C), allowing comparison of HX kinetics relative to FVIIa. HX time course plots of representative peptides were fitted to a triexponential model to categorize exchanging amides into a fast kinetic component and two slower kinetic components (see supplemental Table 1). All exchange-in experiments were carried out at pH 6.0 to better resolve the fast exchanging amides and in the presence of Ca2+. To ensure a correlation between the experimental conditions and those found in the blood, the HX kinetics of FVIIa and TF-bound FVIIa were also monitored at physiological pH and ionic strength (pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and found to reliably reflect those observed at pH 6.0 (data not shown). Furthermore, an exchange-in experiment using fully glycosylated FVIIa in the presence and absence of TF showed similar effects upon TF binding as observed for N-deglycosylated FVIIa (data not shown). Visualization of the Allosteric Response of FVIIa—The transition of FVIIa into an active form following binding of TF (or binding of the active site inhibitor IN18) results in dramatically decreased deuterium incorporation (i.e. HX rates) as shown in Fig. 1C for a peptide spanning β-strand A2. These effects are primarily observed in peptides of the second β-barrel and several surface loops, and thus the majority of peptides displaying reduced HX rates are seen to localize across one face of the protease domain of FVIIa (Fig. 2). In all the affected regions of the FVIIa structure, the active (TF-bound) form displays decreased HX rates compared with the free form, indicating that the active form is more stable and less dynamic than the free form. As illustrated in Fig. 2, decreased HX rates of the active form are seen in the TF-binding helix (α1) and the neighboring 170-loop (peptide 306-325(164-178)). Regions around the active site cleft also show decreased HX rates as seen in activation loop 3 (localized to residues 370-377(221-228) in peptide 361-377(212-228)) and in the 94-shunt (peptide 228-245(88-105)). However, several areas remote from the active site and the TF-binding region also display decreased HX rates demonstrating more widespread allosteric effects on the FVIIa structure. The N-terminal tail of the protease domain shows significantly decreased HX rates (peptide 153-169(16-32)), and this effect is mirrored in β-strands A2 (peptide 275-287(129F-144)) and B2 (peptide 297-302(155-160)), which form part of the cavity for N-terminal insertion referred to as the activation pocket. Helix α0 (peptide 264-275(124-129F)) that extends C-terminally from β-strand A2 likewise shows reduced HX rates, and a dramatic reduction in HX rates is seen in the Ca2+-binding loop (peptide 207-220(67-80)). Interestingly, a region of the light chain (peptide 133-141), which contains the disulfide interchain linkage between the protease domain and the light chain of FVIIa, displays reduced HX rates in the active form (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the first EGF-like domain in the light chain (peptide 63-80) has decreased HX rates in the active form. Importantly, most peptides displaying decreased HX rates in the presence of the physiological cofactor TF also display reduced HX rates upon binding of the reversible active site inhibitor, IN18 (supplemental Fig. 1, A-C). The only exceptions are peptides 40-44 and 361-369(212-221A), which selectively show decreased HX rates upon either TF or IN18 binding, respectively. In agreement with structures of FVIIa inhibitor (5Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Roberts S.M. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8925-8930Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Klingler O. Matter H. Schudok M. Donghi M. Czech J. Lorenz M. Nestler H.P. Szillat H. Schreuder H. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) complexes, these effects are strictly due to the steric solvent exclusion by IN18 or TF at the binding interfaces. In contrast, all of the other peptides displaying decreased HX rates upon binding of both TF and IN18 must be, to some extent, subject to allostery in the FVIIa structure originating from the TF-binding region and/or the active site. Structural Properties of Zymogen FVII—To gain further insight into the events surrounding FVII activation, we studied the HX kinetics of zymogen FVII in the presence and absence of TF. Because FVII can be autoactivated to FVIIa during purification, we constructed the zymogen variant FVIIR152A. Similar to a previously reported R152E variant (19Wildgoose P. Berkner K.L. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the R152A mutation in FVII abolishes the proteolytic cleavage site (Arg-152/Ile-153(16)), which is required for conversion of zymogen FVII to FVIIa (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, the HX behavior of zymogen FVIIR152A is highly similar to that of FVIIa in the sense that corresponding peptides of the two proteins show identical HX rates. TF has been shown previously to bind to zymogen FVII with equal affinity compared with FVIIa (20Kelley R.F. Yang J. Eigenbrot C. Moran P. Peek M. Lipari M.T. Kirchhofer D. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the HX kinetics of TF-bound zymogen FVIIR152A show decreased HX rates for only a subset of the peptides affected in TF-bound FVIIa (Fig. 3). The zymogen response to TF binding was located to helix α1/170-loop (peptide 306-325(164-178)), activation loop 3 (peptide 361-377(212-228)), helix α0 (peptide 264-275(124-129F)), and most of β-strand A2 (localized via peptides 281-287(138-144) and 275-287(129F-144)), which constituted part of the activation pocket. However, the decreased HX rates observed in activation loop 3 (peptide 361-377(212-228))of zymogen FVIIR152A following TF binding did not involve the fast kinetic component as was the case when TF bound to FVIIa. Likewise, the remaining segments of the activation pocket (peptides 281-287(138-144) and 297-302(155-160)), the Ca2+-binding loop (peptide 207-220(67-80)), and the interchain linkage region of the light chain (peptide 133-141) showed unaltered HX rates in TF-bound zymogen FVIIR152A. Recently, the role of even subtle changes in structural dynamics in regulating enzymatic function has become increasingly evident (8Liang Z.X. Lee T. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9556-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Wong L. Lieser S.A. Miyashita O. Miller M. Tasken K. Onuchic J.N. Adams J.A. Woods Jr., V.L. Jennings P.A. J.

Biol. 2005; 351: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). High-resolution, sensitive techniques are needed to detect the elusive signals that mediate the dynamic interplay of distant sites in a protein structure. Amide HX offers a highly sensitive probe for monitoring these important fluctuations of protein structure in solution during function and regulation (12Wales T.E. Engen J.R. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2005; 25: 158-170Crossref Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In the present work, we studied the HX kinetics of zymogen FVII, FVIIa, TF-bound zymogen FVII, and active FVIIa (TF- or IN18-bound) to characterize the various activation states of FVII/FVIIa. Substantial indirect biochemical evidence has documented an allosteric linkage between the TF-binding region, the active site, and the activation region of FVIIa (23Ruf W. Dickinson C.D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The present study directly correlated localized changes in dynamics throughout the FVIIa structure with the allosteric activation afforded by TF upon initiation of blood coagulation. Allosteric Response of FVIIa to TF Is Revealed by HX—Our results demonstrate that when free FVIIa attains the active form (either by TF or IN18 binding), decreased HX rates can be observed primarily in the second β-barrel of the protease domain and several interconnecting loops, spanning 45 Å from the TF-binding region to the Ca2+-binding loop, straight across one face of the protease domain. Apart from two interconnecting loops, the secondary structure of the first β-barrel seems to be largely unaffected by these allosteric effects. Remarkably, the allosteric activation signal is not confined to the protease domain as structural stabilization is observed upon either TF or IN18 binding even in remote regions of the light chain of FVIIa located approximately 50 Å from the active site. Decreased HX rates in activation loop 3 and the 94-shunt demonstrate an allosteric linkage between the TF-binding region and these two loops of the active site. Activation loop 3 encompasses the bottom of the S1 pocket (Gly-375(226) and Val-376(227)) and the Cys-368(220)-Cys-340(191) disulfide bond, both of which are an integral part of the S1 pocket of the active site, and stabilization of this loop could facilitate maturation of the active site. Interestingly, the 94-shunt of FIXa contains a Tyr residue at the position corresponding to Thr-239(99) in FVIIa, which blocks access to the active site but is rearranged upon activation (24Hopfner K.P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of Thr-239(99) or the neighboring Val-240(100) in FVIIa has been shown to result in decreased activity towards the macromolecular substrate FX (17Dickinson C.D. Kelly C.R. Ruf W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The decreased HX rates in the 94-shunt of FVIIa observed upon TF binding correlate well with previous findings and strongly suggest that allosteric stabilization of this active site loop in FVIIa is important for activation. Surprisingly, HX rates of activation loop 2 (localized in peptide 332-356(184-207)) are unaltered between FVIIa and TF-bound FVIIa. Activation loops 1-3 are seen to undergo structural rearrangements during activation of trypsinogen to trypsin (25Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and it suggests that in FVIIa, activation loop 2 does not play a major role in allosteric activation. The decreased HX rates observed in the light chain of FVIIa in the active form (following binding of TF or the active site inhibitor IN18) present new intriguing insights into the activation response of FVIIa. The functional consequences of this interchain transfer of an activation signal are at present unknown. Interestingly, the decreased HX rates in the EGF1 domain correlate with studies of an antibody specific for the EGF1 domain, which binds to FVIIa with increased affinity in the presence of a covalent active site inhibitor known to induce the active conformation (26Leonard B.J. Clarke B.J. Sridhara S. Kelley R. Ofosu F.A. Blajchman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34894-34900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+-binding to the EGF1 domain has been shown to increase the amidolytic activity (27Persson E. Olsen O.H. Østergaard A. Nielsen L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study provide a structural rationale for these previously inexplicable observations. The decreased HX rates observed in the EGF1 domain are likely to be linked to the structural stabilization of the interchain linkage region. The effects of activation observed in the light chain might also contribute to the increased affinity with which TF has been shown to bind to active site-inhibited FVIIa (28Sørensen B.B. Persson E. Freskgård P.O. Kjalke M. Ezban M. Williams T. Rao L.V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11863-11868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In general, decreased HX rates upon transition to the active form include both fast and slow kinetic components in peptides of FVIIa but as indicated in Fig. 2, they mainly concern slow kinetic components. These effects are due to the stabilization of existing main-chain secondary or tertiary structure because amides categorized as fast kinetic components are expected to be fully solvent-exposed and unstructured in solution, whereas slower kinetic components engage in some type of secondary structure or intramolecular interactions. However, several peptides (e.g. 153-169(16-32), 207-220(67-80), 306-325(164-178), or 361-377(212-228)) also display decreased HX rates for fast kinetic components, and such effects indicate structural rearrangements involving the formation of stable intramolecular interactions in previously unstructured or very flexible solvent-exposed regions (29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14705-14710Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Zymogen FVII Is Structurally Very Similar to FVIIa but Has a Crippled Allosteric Response—Remarkably, the HX rates of zymogen FVIIR152A are virtually identical to those of FVIIa. This strongly indicates that the solution structures of zymogen FVII and FVIIa are highly similar, save for differences in the N-terminal tail. The HX rates of TF-bound zymogen FVIIR152A show that TF binding to the zymogen induces only a crippled allosteric response. Evidently, several of the incremental rearrangements and dynamic effects in the FVIIa structure following TF binding are energetically favorable by themselves and do not require a complete global, concerted transition into an active FVIIa form to occur. This observation is supported by findings with a FVIIa variant, which displays enhanced activity without an accompanying increased burial of the N terminus as assessed by carbamylation experiments (30Persson E. Bak H. Østergaard A. Olsen O.H. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The HX rates of the Ca2+-binding loop and the interchain linkage region of the light chain are unaltered in zymogen FVIIR152A upon TF binding, and thus insertion of the N-terminal tail into the activation pocket seems to be necessary for induction of an allosteric response in these two regions. These results demonstrate a tight linkage between the dynamics of the N-terminal tail and the Ca2+-binding loop and identify the N-terminal tail as a structural relay switch in FVIIa, capable of transmitting the allosteric signal to the Ca2+-binding loop and to the interchain linkage region of the light chain. Interestingly, HX rates in peptide 297-302(155-160) comprising β-strand B2 are similarly unaltered in TF-bound zymogen FVIIR152A as opposed to TF-bound FVIIa. As seen in the FVIIa/TF crystal structure, Val-299(157) of β-strand B2 makes a main chain hydrogen bond to Lys-157(20) of the N-terminal tail, suggesting that the presence of this interaction is required for allosteric stabilization of the Ca2+-binding loop and the interchain linkage region and that this interaction cannot form in TF-bound zymogen FVII. The Ca2+-binding loop is a conserved feature of trypsin and several related proteases. Results presented here open the possibility that in addition to the known Ca2+ stimulation of FVIIa activity, stabilization of the Ca2+-binding loop via the N-terminal tail might be a common allosteric feature during the activation of several trypsin-like proteases. Allosteric Linkage—A crystal structure of zymogen FVII in complex with an exosite inhibitor, A183, has been solved (31Eigenbrot C. Kirchhofer D. Dennis M.S. Santell L. Lazarus R.A. Stamos J. Ultsch M.H. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The most striking feature of this structure is a three-residue reregistration of β-strand B2. The hypothesis that this reregistration plays a fundamental role in the activation of FVII has been challenged recently by the demonstration of plausible crystal packing effects on the structure of the FVII·A183 complex (32Perera L. Pedersen L.G. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 1543-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and by mutagenesis studies (33Olsen O.H. Nielsen P.F. Persson E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14096-14103Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, we identified a peptide (residues 302-308(160-166))in zymogen FVIIR152A, comprising the residues of β-strand B2 involved in the alleged reregistration. The conformation of this region in the FVII-A183 crystal structure rotates residues Arg-304(162) and Leu-305(163) such that their amide hydrogens are placed in a fully solvent-exposed environment and no longer participate in hydrogen bonds with the neighboring β-strand A2 as in previous structures of FVIIa (4Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 5Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Roberts S.M. Olsen O.H. Persson E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8925-8930Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This would cause the amide hydrogens of Arg-304(162) and Leu-305(163) to exchange several orders of magnitude faster in zymogen FVII. However, peptide 302-308(160-166) of zymogen FVIIR152A shows HX rates identical to those seen for free and TF-bound FVIIa. In fact, the HX rates of peptide 302-308(160-166) of both FVIIa and zymogen FVIIR152A are slow and characteristic of amides participating in strong hydrogen bonding. In conjunction with the work of Perera and Pedersen (32Perera L. Pedersen L.G. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 1543-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), the results presented here strongly indicate that the solution structure of this region is conserved in zymogen FVII, free and TF-bound FVIIa. If the allosteric activation of FVIIa by TF is not propagated via reregistration of β-strand B2, what is the pathway? In thrombin, residues of activation loop 3 are critical for mediating allosteric activation (34Pineda A.O. Carrell C.J. Bush L.A. Prasad S. Caccia S. Chen Z.W. Mathews F.S. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31842-31853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The proximity of allosterically stabilized segments in helix α1, the 170-loop, and activation loop 3 of FVIIa imply that one or more hydrogen bonds between these regions are absent in free FVIIa but present in TF-bound FVIIa. This is supported by the decreased number of fast kinetic components in peptide 361-377(212-228) of activation loop 3 upon TF binding. Importantly, however, the number of fast kinetic components of peptide 361-377(212-228) in zymogen FVIIR152A are unaltered upon TF binding (in contrast to FVIIa). Evidently, a crippled stabilization of activation loop 3 seems to correlate to the absence of N-terminal insertion and active site maturation in TF-bound zymogen FVII. Taken in conjunction, these observations suggest that activation loop 3 constitutes an essential part of the structural element through which a TF-induced allosteric change is conveyed to the active site and that this loop could function as a conformational switch necessary for TF to turn on the activity of FVIIa. In summary, many of the coagulation proteases function optimally only when bound to cofactors, and considerable biochemical evidence supports the concept that several of these cofactors induce allosteric changes in their cognate enzymes (1Furie B. Furie B.C. Cell. 1988; 53: 505-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Through the use of HX monitored by MS, we detected extensive allostery and dynamic interplay between functional sites in FVIIa upon TF binding, revealing the potential for allosteric regulation in the trypsin family of proteases. In the framework of these findings, the zymogen form displays a crippled allosteric response to TF, despite having a highly similar solution structure to FVIIa. The results imply the strength of the experimental approach to investigate structural dynamics in solution of the numerous proteins and protein systems subject to structural transitions during function.

One structurally defined region of the core, the L1 loop (residues 112-124), is a mutational “cold spot” in which relatively few tumor-derived mutations have been identified. To further understand the L1 loop, we subjected this region to both alanine- and arginine-scanning mutagenesis and tested mutants for DNA binding in vitro. Select mutants were then analyzed for transactivation and cell cycle analysis in either transiently transfected cells or cells stably expressing wild-type and mutant proteins at regulatable physiological levels. We focused most extensively on two p53 L1 loop mutants, T123A and K120A. The T123A mutant p53 displayed significantly better DNA binding in vitro as well as stronger transactivation and apoptotic activity in vivo than wild-type p53, particularly toward its pro-apoptotic target AIP1. By contrast, K120A mutant p53, although capable of strong binding in vitro and wild-type levels of transactivation and apoptosis when transfected into cells, showed impaired activity when expressed at normal cellular levels. Our experiments indicate a weaker affinity for DNA in vivo by K120A p53 as the main reason for its defects in transactivation and apoptosis. Overall, our findings demonstrate an important, yet highly modular role for the L1 loop in the recognition of specific DNA sequences, target transactivation, and apoptotic signaling by p53.

Overall, our findings demonstrate an important, yet highly modular role for the L1 loop in the recognition of specific DNA sequences, target transactivation, and apoptotic signaling by p53. The tumor suppressor p53 is central to a complex cellular network that mediates signals from various forms of stress and numerous cellular outcomes (1.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5777) Google Scholar). p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that undergoes extensive modification following stress (2.Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Underscoring its importance as a tumor suppressor, p53 is found mutated in over 50% of all human cancers (8.Beroud C. Soussi T. Hum.

Mutat. 2002; 19: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), and mice deficient for p53 expression are highly tumor-prone (10.Donehower L.A. Harvey M. Slagle B.L. McArthur M.J.

In fact, p53 was the first commercially available gene therapy treatment to be approved (12.Pearson S. Jia H. Kandachi K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). TP53 possesses a number of functional domains as follows: an acidic N-terminal region with a bipartite transactivation domain (residues 20-40 and 40-60), a proline-rich region with a proposed role in apoptosis (residues 60-90), a core sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (residues 100-300), a tetramerization domain (residues 325-355), and a basic C-terminal region that possesses sequence nonspecific nucleic acid binding properties and facilitates linear diffusion along DNA (reviewed in Ref. 57.Laptenko O. Prives C. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Highlighting the major function of p53 as a transcription factor is the observation that the great majority of tumor-derived mutations reside within the core domain of p53, with six of them clustering into “hot spot” missense point mutations (Fig. 1A). Core domain mutations have effects that include global unfolding, local perturbations, or loss of an essential DNA contact residue, as evidenced by biochemical and structural data (13.Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P.

Frequently, the end result is a decrease in affinity of p53 for many if not virtually all versions of its consensus sequence, which consists of two copies of the 10-bp motif 5′-RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3′ separated by 0-13 bp (16.Hoh J.

As a result, many tumor-related mutant forms of p53 are impaired or completely prevented from transactivating most p53 downstream target genes. p53 also has been shown to bind to and repress a range of promoters, yet the exact mechanism underlying this process is still poorly understood (19.Hoffman W.H.

The L1 loop (residues 112-124) is part of the loop-sheethelix motif of the core that contains the only three residues that contact DNA bases directly (see Fig. 1, A and B). Surprisingly, even though it contains Lys-120 that makes both direct base and backbone contact with DNA, this region is not mutated in a significant number of cancers. Furthermore, individual L1 loop residues have arisen in a number of yeast screens that sought to isolate mutations with enhanced transcriptional activation, a toxic phenotype, or second-site suppressor characteristics (23.Brachmann R.K.

With the exception of T123P, which behaves like wild-type p53, and S121F, which was reported to exhibit altered sequence specificity and an increased ability to induce apoptosis (28.Menendez D.

Recently, molecular dynamics simulations identified a superstable mutation within the L1 loop and challenged the classical interpretation of the crystal structure of p53 bound to DNA, due mostly in part to the predicted stability of the loop when in a dimerized state (6.Attardi L.D.

Additionally, crystal structures of mouse p53, Caenorhabditis elegans p53, a quadruple mutant of human p53, and NMR solution structures have revealed a significant structural difference in this region when comparing DNA-free and DNA-bound states, indicating a potential conformational shift upon DNA recognition and binding (32.Zhao K.

Based on these findings we have performed a systematic mutational analysis of the L1 loop by alanine and arginine scanning followed by characterization of select mutants in vitro and in vivo to reveal more information about this interesting region of p53. Our data indicate a role for this small segment of the core domain in the recognition of specific DNA sequences by p53 and its apoptosis-inducing function. Plasmids, Site-specific Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Alanine and arginine point mutations were introduced into pRSETb-p53 (37.Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing from the T7 promoter (GeneWiz). Mammalian expression vectors for transfection were similarly created using pCDNA3-p53. Vectors for the inducible cell line creation were made by subcloning the NheI-EcoRV fragment from pRSETb-p53 into pTRE2-hyg (Invitrogen), which removed the His tag but maintained an Omni epitope. Histagged p53 proteins were induced with 84 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in a BL21(DE3)/pLysS strain of Escherichia coli at 22 °C for 4 h and then harvested. Solubilized protein was isolated by stepwise lysis with hypotonic (50 mm Tris-HCl, 25% sucrose) and hypertonic buffers (1 m KCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors (1 μm benzamidine, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml bacitracin, 1 μg/ml macroglobulin)) followed by sonication and centrifugation. The proteins were then bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen), packed into a column, and washed with 40 column volumes of medium salt buffer (MSB) (600 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) followed by 20 column volumes of MSB with 40 mm imidazole.

Electromobility Shift Assay—EMSA reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm spermidine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 50× mutant GADD45 oligonucleotide (5′-AGCTGATATCGAATTCTCGAGCAGAAAATTTCTAAGAATTCTGGGCTCGAGAATTCCTGCAGCGCT-3′), and 4 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide. After incubation at room temperature for 20 min, the mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer at 165 V for 1.25 h at room temperature. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film. DNA-protein complexes were quantified by phosphorimaging with ImageQuant software. The 44-bp blunt oligonucleotide probes (Invitrogen) used had the following sequences (deviations from the p53 consensus sequence (18.el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Experiments with bacterially expressed p53 used 80 and 160 ng of protein, and in vitro translation experiments contained 4 and 8 μl of the 50-μl reaction mixture. Supershifts were achieved by addition of 1 μl of affinity-purified monoclonal mouse pAb 421 antibody. Transfection and Western Blot Analysis—Transfections were performed in 6-well plates using a 1:2 ratio of plasmid to Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (38.Urist M. Tanaka T. Poyurovsky M.V. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3041-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). p53 protein was visualized by separating 4 μg of whole-cell lysate (40 μg for inducible cells) or an indicated amount of reticulocyte lysate on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferring to nitrocellulose, followed by immunoblotting with a mixture of anti-p53 antibodies (1801 and DO-1) for 45 min at room temperature. Other antibodies used were anti-p21 (40 μg of whole-cell lysate loaded) at a 1:500 dilution (C19, Oncogene Research Products) and anti-actin at a 1:3000 dilution (Sigma). For in vitro translation, 0.5, 1, and 2 μ l of the reaction mixtures were run on a 10% SDS gel prior to transfer and immunoblotting as above. RT-PCR—RNA was extracted from cell pellets using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and quantitated by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. cDNA was created using oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcriptase using 4 μg of total RNA and the Superscript III first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). PCR was then performed using a dNTP mixture (Roche Applied Science) and Taq 2000 DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Conditions for linear amplification were established through template and cycle curves. The cycling conditions were as follows: a denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 20 cycles (for p21, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and PIG3) or 31 cycles (for AIP1) at 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s (58 °C for AIP1), and 70 °C for 30 s, with a final extension of 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products (40% of reaction mixture) were then separated on 2.5% agarose gels, and bands were visualized with ethidium bromide and imaged with a Gel Logix 100 imaging system (Eastman Kodak Col). Sequences for the primers used are listed as follows: p21 forward, 5′-GTTCCTTGTGGAGCCGGAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGTACAAGACAGTGACAGGTC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-CAACTACATGGTTTACATGTTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCAGTGGACTCCACGAC-3′; PIG3 forward, 5′-GCAGCTGCTGGATTCAATTAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCCTATGTTCTTGTTGGCCTC-3′; and AIP1 forward, 5′-GGCCCTAACAACAAATGAGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACCAAGATCCAGACGAGACT-3′. Tet-off Inducible Cell Lines—H1299-derived inducible cell lines were created using a two-step tetracycline-regulated system and clonally selected with 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen), as described previously (39.Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml tetracycline, 100 μg/ml hygromycin B, and 200 μg/ml G418. FACS Analysis—For cell cycle analysis, H1299 cells were plated to a density of 90% after 16 h in a 6-well plate, and following transfection fresh medium was added after 5 h. For inducible lines, 2 × 105 cells were seeded per 60-mm plate without tetracycline. 22 h after plating, the cells were washed, and tetracycline was added as needed to equilibrate protein levels. 5-Fluorouracil (0.33 mm) was added 24 h after induction as indicated, and 48 h later, cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed overnight with -20 °C methanol as described previously (40.Baptiste N. Friedlander P. Chen X. Prives C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Fixed cells and fragmented DNA were spun down for 5 min at 2400 rpm (1660 × g), resuspended with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, and rehydrated for 30 min on ice (41.Berger M. Haupt Y. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 234: 245-256PubMed Google Scholar). After another spin, cells were resuspended in 0.9 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution containing RNase (50μg/ml) and propidium iodide (60 μg/ml, Sigma) and incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature. Stained cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Cell cycle profiles including apoptotic sub-G1 DNA content of cells were quantitated using the ModFit LT program. Transfected cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection and analyzed as above after selecting for green fluorescent protein-positive, cotransfected cells. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Inducible cells were seeded to 80% density in 10-cm plates, and protein expression was induced for 24 h as described above. Cross-linking, lysis, sonication, immunoprecipitation, purification, and PCR were performed as described previously (42.McKinney K. Mattia M. Gottifredi V. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Input chromatin samples were diluted 1:10 to remain in the linear range for PCR. Samples were resolved on 2.5% agarose gels and visualized as described above. Primer sequences are listed as follows along with their respective annealing temperatures and cycles in parentheses: p21-5′ (56 °C, 29 cycles) forward, 5′-CTGGACTGGGCACTCTTGTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CTCCTACCATCCCCTTCCTC-3′; p21-neg (56 °C, 29 cycles) forward, 5′-GGAGTCCTGTTTGCTTCTGG-3′, and reverse 5′-CTTTGGCCACACTGAGGAAT-3′; PIG3 (56 °C, 29 cycles) forward, 5′-AGGAGGCGAGTGATAAGGATCC-3′, and reverse, 5′AACCTCTTGGCGGGCGGATTGG-3′; and AIP1 (57 °C, 34 cycles) forward, 5′-CTCCCTTCTCCTAGCTCTGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CAGCATCAGGAAGTTCATCT-3′. Alanine and Arginine Scanning of the p53 L1 Loop Reveals Mutations with Enhanced DNA Binding and Altered Sequence Specificity—We first examined the role of the L1 loop in the DNA binding activity of p53 by individually mutating each amino acid (residues 112-124; Fig. 1A) to alanine. In each set of experiments two mutant proteins expressed in and purified from bacteria were tested alongside wild-type p53 to internally control protein activity. Protein concentrations were equilibrated (Fig. 1C), and the DNA-binding properties of p53 variants were tested using the EMSA in which DNA binding was assayed against a 44-bp oligonucleotide probe containing the 5′ p53 response element from the p21 promoter. The results for all mutants are summarized in Table 1. Based on the relatively rare occurrence of tumor-derived L1 loop mutants, it was somewhat unexpected that mutation to alanine of the majority of L1 loop residues (G112A, F113A, H115A, S116A, G117A, T118A, C124A, and T125A) either partially or completely ablated the affinity of the protein for DNA. Nevertheless, four L1 loop p53 mutants (L114A, K120A, V122A, and T123A) demonstrated unique DNA-binding properties in that they each possessed a greater affinity (2-3-fold) for the p21 probe than wild-type p53. Results from a typical purification and EMSA are shown in Fig. 1D, with assays always being performed using an excess of labeled probe (data not shown). These findings were recapitulated when p53 was “supershifted” with the C terminus-specific monoclonal antibody pAb 421 demonstrating that the increased binding was a function of the core domain, as opposed to a nonspecific or structure-specific effect of the C terminus (43.Kim E. Deppert W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).TABLE 1L1 loop mutations possess “super-binding” properties as well as altered sequence specificityAlanine scanArginine scanL1 loop mutantRelative to wild-type p53 DNA bindingSequence specificityL1 loop mutantRelative to wild-type p53 DNA bindingSequence specificityG112A⇓−G112R↓−F113A⇓−F113R⇓−L114A↔+L114R↔−H115A↓−H115R↓−S116A↓−S116R↓−G117A⇓−G117R↓−T118A↓−T118R↔−A119NANAA119R↔+K120A⇑+K120R↑+S121A↔−S121R↑−V122A⇑+V122R↓+T123A⇑+T123R↓+C124A↓−C124R⇓−T125A↓−T125R⇓− Open table in a new tab Because p53 core domain mutants vary in their affinities for different versions of the p53 consensus sequence (Ref. 27.Resnick M.A. Inga A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9934-9939Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and references therein), we tested oligonucleotide probes with binding sites derived from p53 downstream targets involved in apoptosis. Three mutants (L114A, K120A, and V122A) possessed lesser affinity for DR5, AIP1, and PUMA site oligonucleotides than to the p21 5′ site, with K120A and V122A binding significantly worse than wild-type p53 to DR5 and AIP1 (Fig. 1D). By contrast, T123A showed markedly enhanced binding to DR5 and AIP1 and, in contrast to the other versions of p53, also bound these sites to levels even greater than those of p21. Averages and standard deviations of three independent EMSA experiments for fold binding over wild-type of all four mutants on the four different targets are shown in Fig. 1E. It was reported that substitution to positively charged residues within the p53 core domain could both create novel DNA contacts and rescue binding of hotspot mutants (44.Wieczorek A.M. Waterman J.L. Waterman M.J. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore mutated each L1 loop amino acid to arginine and similarly tested DNA binding of purified bacterially expressed p53 proteins. Unexpectedly, this set of mutants yielded only one variant p53 (K120R) with slightly enhanced DNA affinity when compared with wild-type p53 (data not shown and summarized in Table 1). Although their overall binding was weak, as was seen with the alanine mutants, a number of L1 loop arginine mutations exhibited altered DNA affinities when tested against apoptotic probes. In particular A119R, K120R, and V122R displayed nearly negligible binding to DR5 and AIP1, although T123R had properties similar to T123A in that it bound to DR5 and AIP1 better than p21 (data not shown). To further characterize the DNA-binding properties of the K120A, V122A, and T123A mutants, we examined them as proteins translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. After checking to make sure equal protein amounts were loaded (Fig. 2A), EMSAs were performed with the same four DNA probes as used previously. Two representative gels are shown in supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, with the average and standard deviation of three independent experiments charted in Fig. 2B. Here K120A, V122A, and T123A p53 proteins failed to possess an affinity for the p21 site oligonucleotide that was more than 2-fold greater than that of wild-type p53. However, as seen with bacterially expressed proteins, K120A and V122A p53 variants each displayed much weaker binding to AIP1 than did wildtype p53. Although V122A approximated wild-type p53 in binding to DR5, K120A was essentially inert in interacting with either DR5 or AIP1, suggesting a possible function of this lysine in recognizing weaker promoters. Binding to PUMA by all three mutants as in vitro translated proteins was more robust than to p21 with V122A possessing 5-fold greater binding than wildtype p53. Once again, T123A possessed DNA-binding properties unique from the other mutants, binding p21 to a similar extent as wild-type but having a significantly greater affinity for DR5 and PUMA, averaging 5-fold higher. Most striking was binding of T123A to AIP1. Although this mutant had demonstrated a 4-fold enhancement when expressed bacterially, here it bound upwards of 25 times better than wild-type p53. In fact, although AIP1 has traditionally been a very weak target of p53 (45.Oda K. Arakawa H. Tanaka T. Matsuda K. Tanikawa C. Mori T. Nishimori H. Tamai K. Tokino T. Nakamura Y. Taya Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 849-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar), binding of T123A to AIP1 was even greater than the recognition of a p21 probe by wild type. Thus L1 mutants K120A, V122A, and T123A display unique sequence-specific variations in their interactions with DNA when compared with each other and to wild-type p53. Additionally, the source of p53 protein (bacterial or reticulocyte lysate) has a significant impact on their relative sequence selectivity. Another goal of generating the L1 loop mutants in reticulocyte lysates was to determine whether or not the enhanced DNA-binding properties of T123A could be used to rescue binding by two p53 hot spot tumor-derived mutants (R175H and R273H) by co-translationally expressing the two different proteins (differentially tagged) to create a mixed tetramer. Unfortunately, even though hetero-oligomers were efficiently formed between either wild-type or T123A p53 and either R175H or R273H, in no cases were the resulting p53 complexes capable of binding better than either of the hot spot mutants alone to p21 or AIP1 probes (data not shown). Thus, as shown previously (46.Chene P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the dominant-negative properties of these tumor-derived hot spot mutants are too great to allow for their rescue even by a super-binder such as T123A. Transcriptional Activities of Transfected L1 Loop p53 Proteins—We then turned to examine the behavior of the three alanine substitution mutants (K120A, V122A, and T123A) in transiently transfected human cell lines. Constructs were generated in which these mutants were expressed under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. In H1299 cells, although the p53 proteins were efficiently expressed at equal concentrations (Fig. 3A, top panel), they conferred different effects on endogenous targets. Under these experimental conditions, K120A behaved almost exactly like wild-type p53 by inducing similar levels of p21 protein (Fig. 3A) and p21, PIG3, and AIP1 mRNA as measured by RT-PCR (Fig. 3B). Unfortunately, we were unable to detect significant induction of either DR5 or PUMA mRNA above basal levels by exogenously expr"
https://openalex.org/W2064901407,"A rare hereditary disorder, Fanconi anemia (FA), is caused by mutations in an array of genes, which interact in a common FA pathway/network. These genes encode components of the FA “core” complex, a key factor FancD2, the familial breast cancer suppressor BRCA2/FancD1, and Brip1/FancJ helicase. Although BRCA2 is known to play a pivotal role in homologous recombination repair by regulating Rad51 recombinase, the precise functional relationship between BRCA2 and the other FA genes is unclear. Here we show that BRCA2-dependent chromatin loading of Rad51 after mitomycin C treatment was not compromised by disruption of FANCC or FANCD2. Rad51 and FancD2 form colocalizing subnuclear foci independently of each other. Furthermore, we created a conditional BRCA2 truncating mutation lacking the C-terminal conserved domain (CTD) (brca2ΔCTD), and disrupted the FANCC gene in this background. The fancc/brca2ΔCTD double mutant revealed an epistatic relationship between FANCC and BRCA2 CTD in terms of x-ray sensitivity. In contrast, levels of cisplatin sensitivity and mitomycin C-induced chromosomal aberrations were increased in fancc/brca2ΔCTD cells relative to either single mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that FA proteins work together with BRCA2/Rad51-mediated homologous recombination in double strand break repair, whereas the FA pathway plays a role that is independent of the CTD of BRCA2 in interstrand cross-link repair. These results provide insights into the functional interplay between the classical FA pathway and BRCA2.

To date, 12 genetic FA subgroups have been identified on the basis of complementation analysis, and 11 of these have been cloned (FancA/B/C/D1/D2/E/F/G/J/L/M) (10Thompson L.H. Hinz J.M. Yamada N.A.

Among them, eight gene products interact with each other, forming the FA core complex (FancA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M). This complex is thought to be a multisubunit ubiquitin E3 ligase (12Meetei A.R. de Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. van de Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E.

Monoubiquitination is both necessary and sufficient for FancD2 to be targeted to chromatin following DNA damage, form subnuclear foci, and participate in DNA repair (15Montes De Oca R.

It is likely that the core complex functions not only in the monoubiquitination of FancD2 but also in other roles required for the targeting of FancD2 to chromatin, as well as for DNA repair (16Matsushita N.

Indeed, the FA core complex carries subunits that are required not only for monoubiquitinating FancD2 (E3 ligase FancL) but also for DNA modification (FancM) (17Meetei A.R. Medhurst A.L. Ling C.

Thus the core complex seems to have multiple effector arms, which probably cooperate with FancD2 in DNA repair (16Matsushita N. Kitao H. Ishiai M. Nagashima N. Hirano S. Okawa K. Ohta T. Yu D.S.

However, the precise biochemical function of FancD2 is still unknown. Importantly, any patient-derived mutation found in the core complex components appears to disrupt the structural integrity of the complex and may cause complete or partial loss of function in effector molecules. It is currently unclear how the FA pathway couples with DNA repair pathways such as HR or TLS. Besides the core complex components and FancD2, two additional FA proteins, FancD1 and FancJ, have been identified, both of which are intimately linked to familial breast cancer. In FANCD1 mutant cells, biallelic hypomorphic mutations of breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 have been identified (23Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Olson S. Cox B. Waisfisz Q. De Die-Smulders C.

Science. 2002; 297: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), whereas FANCJ was found to be the BRCA1-interacting helicase, Brip1 (also known as BACH1) (24Levitus M.

Individuals carrying monoallelic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancer (28Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). FANCD1 or FANCJ mutant cells display normal FancD2 monoubiquitination following DNA damage (24Levitus M. Rooimans M.A. Steltenpool J. Cool N.F. Oostra A.B. Mathew C.G. Hoatlin M.E. Waisfisz Q. Arwert F. De Winter J.P. Joenje H. Blood. 2004; 103: 2498-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), indicating that these genes function independently, or downstream, of the core complex-FancD2 (“classical FA”) pathway. How BRCA2/FancD1 or the Brip1/FancJ helicase functionally interact with the rest of the FA proteins is largely unknown. In this study, we have focused on the functional relationship between BRCA2 and the classical FA pathway. A major cellular function of BRCA2 is to regulate the Rad51 recombinase, which catalyzes the initial strand invasion reaction in HR (28Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar, 29West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Rad51 forms subnuclear foci upon DNA damage, and this could reflect Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments polymerized onto the single-stranded DNA ends generated by nucleolytic processing of DSB (29West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). This foci formation is severely impaired in BRCA2-deficient cells (28Venkitaraman A.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Consistent with a connection between the classical FA pathway and BRCA2, the nuclear foci of FancD2 co-localize with both BRCA2 and Rad51 foci, and monoubiquitinated Fanc-D2 coimmunoprecipitates with BRCA2 from chromatin fractions (14Taniguchi T.

Biol. 2004; 24: 5850-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). To elucidate the functional hierarchy between FA genes and HR factors, analysis of Rad51 focus formation has been employed. However, this has yielded conflicting results to date. Although several groups have reported that Rad51 nuclear foci formation is significantly attenuated in FA cells (30Wang X. Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5850-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 31Yang Y.G. Herceg Z. Nakanishi K. Demuth I. Piccoli C. Michelon J. Hildebrand G. Jasin M. Digweed M.

Furthermore, siRNA treatment against BRCA2 does not increase the frequency of MMC-induced quadriradial chromosome formation in FANCA-deficient fibroblasts, whereas siRNA against BRCA1 does (38Bruun D. Folias A. Akkari Y. Cox Y. Olson S. Moses R. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the other hand, another study found that depletion of BRCA2 or Rad51 by siRNA further sensitizes FANCD2-deficient human cells against MMC (33Ohashi A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chen J. Couch F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14877-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To dissect the functional relationship between the classical FA pathway and BRCA2 more precisely, we analyzed MMC-induced Rad51chromatin loading and foci formation in cells with or without a functional FA pathway or BRCA2. We observed that BRCA2, but not FANCC or FANCD2, is indispensable for the loading of Rad51 to chromatin. We also found that FancD2 and Rad51 act independently of each other in terms of DNA damage-induced foci formation. To mimic the phenotype of FA-D1 patients (23Howlett N.G. Taniguchi T. Olson S. Cox B. Waisfisz Q. De Die-Smulders C. Persky N. Grompe M. Joenje H. Pals G. Ikeda H. Fox E.A. D'Andrea A.D. Science. 2002; 297: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), we generated a BRCA2 truncating mutation immediately downstream of BRC repeats, which resulted in deletion of the C-terminal domain (CTD) including the OB folds that bind single-stranded DNA (CTD truncation) (39Yang H.

Based on this BRCA2 CTD truncation mutant, we created fancc/brca2ΔCTD double mutant cells. Phenotypic analysis of this set of mutant cells revealed that there is a complex interplay between the BRCA2-Rad51 and FancC-FancD2 pathways depending on the type of DNA damage. Cells Lines and Gene Targeting—Wild type and various mutant chicken DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 39.5 °C. Generation of fancc (22Hirano S. Yamamoto K. Ishiai M. Yamazoe M. Seki M. Matsushita N. Ohzeki M. Yamashita Y.M. Arakawa H. Buerstedde J.M. Enomoto T. Takeda S. Thompson L.H. Takata M.

Sonoda E. Kikuchi K. Yonetani Y. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) cells has been described previously. In the brca2ΔBRC cell line, one allele was designed to produce chicken BRCA2 truncated at a point immediately downstream of the BRC3 repeat, whereas the second allele was rendered conditionally null by using inducible MerCreMer recombinase (40Hatanaka A. Yamazoe M. Sale J.E. Takata M. Yamamoto K. Kitao H. Sonoda E. Kikuchi K. Yonetani Y. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The generation of brca2ΔCTD and fancc/brca2ΔCTD cells is shown schematically in Fig. 3B. We constructed the BRCA2-CTD truncation vector by replacing the upper homology arm of the BRCA2-BRC truncation vector (40Hatanaka A. Yamazoe M. Sale J.E. Takata M. Yamamoto K. Kitao H. Sonoda E. Kikuchi K. Yonetani Y. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1124-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with an ∼1 kb genomic PCR fragment. The BRCA2-BRC truncation vector was kindly provided by Drs. Mitsuyoshi Yamazoe and Shunichi Takeda (Kyoto University). The genomic PCR fragment harbored a sequence change to introduce the truncating mutation (CTD truncation) downstream of the BRC8 repeat (codon 2151 was changed to stop codon). As with brca2ΔBRC cells, the BRCA2-CTD truncation was achieved in cells also harboring conditionally null allele of BRCA2 (a kind gift from Drs. Mitsuyoshi Yamazoe and Shunichi Takeda), resulting in BRCA2ΔCTD/con cells (Fig. 3B). Then FANCC gene disruption was achieved using the previously described FANCC targeting vector (22Hirano S. Yamamoto K. Ishiai M. Yamazoe M. Seki M. Matsushita N. Ohzeki M. Yamashita Y.M. Arakawa H. Buerstedde J.M. Enomoto T. Takeda S. Thompson L.H. Takata M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The deletion of BRCA2 conditionally null allele was induced by the addition of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen into both BRCA2ΔCTD/con and fancc/BRCA2ΔCTD/con and was further verified by subcloning. Genomic Southern blotting and RT-PCR analysis were done as described previously (22Hirano S. Yamamoto K. Ishiai M. Yamazoe M. Seki M. Matsushita N. Ohzeki M. Yamashita Y.M. Arakawa H. Buerstedde J.M.

A GFP-FancD2 expression vector was made by subcloning the chicken FANCD2 cDNA into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alt, CA). A point mutation to remove the monoubiquitination site (K563R) was introduced using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transfections were done by electroporation as described previously (6Yamamoto K. Ishiai M. Matsushita N. Arakawa H. Lamerdin J.E. Buerstedde J.M. Tanimoto M. Harada M. Thompson L.H. Takata M. Mol.

Focus Formation Assay—Visualization of subnuclear foci of Rad51 or GFP-FancD2 was done as described previously (7Yamamoto K. Hirano S. Ishiai M. Morishima K. Kitao H. Namikoshi K. Kimura M.

To detect subnuclear γH2AX foci, cytospin slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and were further treated with 70% ethanol. After blocking, slides were stained with anti-γH2AX monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at 1:1000 dilution followed by detection with Alexa594-conjugated antimouse IgG (Invitrogen) at a 1:250 dilution. Cell Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Cell growth and cell cycle distribution were analyzed using FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) as described (6Yamamoto K. Ishiai M. Matsushita N. Arakawa H.

Anti-BrdUrd antibody was purchased from BD Pharmingen. Mitotic index was determined as described previously (41Xu B. Kim S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell.

Briefly, washed cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with anti-phosphorylated histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and analyzed with FACSCalibur. Sensitivity of Cells to Treatment with DNA-damaging Agents—Colony formation was assayed in medium containing 1.4% methylcellulose. Serially diluted cells were irradiated with 4-MV x-rays (Linear Accelerator; Mitsubishi Electric, Inc., Tokyo) as described previously (6Yamamoto K. Ishiai M. Matsushita N. Arakawa H. Lamerdin J.E. Buerstedde J.M. Tanimoto M. Harada M. Thompson L.H. Takata M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5421-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cells were exposed for 1 h to MMC (Kyowa-Hakkou, Tokyo) or continuously to cisplatin (Nihon-Kayaku, Tokyo) and methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) (Sigma). Analysis of Chromosomal Aberrations—Chromosome analysis was performed as previously described (6Yamamoto K. Ishiai M. Matsushita N. Arakawa H. Lamerdin J.E. Buerstedde J.M. Tanimoto M. Harada M. Thompson L.H. Takata M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5421-5430Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, colcemid (0.1 mg/ml) was added immediately following x-ray irradiation, and cells were harvested 3 h later. In some cases, cells were cultured in medium containing 2.5 or 5 ng/ml MMC for 24 h, and colcemid was added 2 h before harvesting. Scoring was performed, as described previously (6Yamamoto K.

Disruption of FANCC or FANCD2 Does Not Significantly Attenuate MMC-induced Chromatin Loading of Rad51—We have shown previously that MMC-induced Rad51 nuclear focus formation is not significantly impaired in fancg (6Yamamoto K.

We also found that the human fancd2 cell line PD20 and PD20 cells complemented with human FancD2 displayed similar levels of Rad51 foci following both x-ray and MMC treatments (supplemental Fig. S1). Given a number of contradictory results reported in the literature (30Wang X. Andreassen P.R. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5850-5862Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 31Yang Y.G. Herceg Z. Nakanishi K. Demuth I. Piccoli C. Michelon J. Hildebrand G. Jasin M. Digweed M. Wang Z.Q.

Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we wished to evaluate the efficiency of Rad51 relocalization after DNA damage in a more quantitative manner. To this end, we separated cell lysates of wild type, fancc, fancd2, and brca2ΔBRC chicken DT40 cells into detergent-soluble and -insoluble (chromatin) fractions, as described previously (16Matsushita N. Kitao H. Ishiai M. Nagashima N. Hirano S. Okawa K. Ohta T. Yu D.S. McHugh P.J. Hickson I.D. Venkitaraman A.R. Kurumizaka H. Takata M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 841-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and quantified the abundance of Rad51 in the chromatin fraction by Western blotting with an anti-Rad51 antibody. In wild type cells, we observed a significant increase of Rad51 protein in the chromatin fraction in response to MMC treatment, which probably reflects nucleoprotein Rad51 filament formation (Fig. 1). Strikingly, we found similarly increased levels of chromatin-bound Rad51 protein in fancc or fancd2 cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, we were not able to detect this induction in brca2ΔBRC cells, in which BRCA2 is not functional (Fig. 1). However, chromatin loading of FancD2, which is dependent on its monoubiquitination, was normal in brca2ΔBRC but was compromised in fancc cells, which is consistent with previous studies (16Matsushita N. Kitao H. Ishiai M. Nagashima N. Hirano S. Okawa K. Ohta T. Yu D.S. McHugh P.J. Hickson I.D. Venkitaraman A.R. Kurumizaka H. Takata M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 841-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These results strongly suggest that following DNA damage, Rad51 loading onto single-stranded DNA ends is regulated by BRCA2/FancD1 but not by monoubiquitinated FancD2. DNA Damage-induced FancD2 or Rad51 Focus Formation Proceeds Independently of Each Other—Next, we examined Rad51 foci formation in relation to FancD2. To conveniently visualize FancD2 distribution in wild type or fancc cells, we expressed a chicken FancD2 protein fused to GFP in fancd2 DT40 cells (designated GFP-FancD2 WT cell). We also then deleted FANCC gene in those cells (GFP-FancD2 fancc cells). We also expressed GFP-FancD2 protein devoid of the monoubiquitination site by mutating lysine 563 to arginine in fancd2 cells (GFP-FancD2 KR cells). GFP-FancD2 WT protein was converted to L-form (monoubiquitinated form) following DNA damage, whereas in the other two mutant cell line, this conversion was not detectable. Consistently, only GFP-FancD2 WT cells showed cisplatin tolerance comparable with that of wild type DT40 cells. 4N. Matsushita and M. Takata, manuscript in preparation. In GFP-FancD2 WT cells, MMC or x-ray treatment induced robust Rad51 focus formation (Fig. 2A), and the majority of these foci co-localized with GFP-FancD2 foci (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Although GFP foci formation was completely defective in GFP-FancD2 KR or GFP-FancD2 fancc cells (Fig. 2A), Rad51 foci formation occurred with similar kinetics, there appeared to be some reduction in the fraction of Rad51 focipositive cells following x-ray exposure (Fig. 2, A and B). In these two cell lines, Rad51 foci appeare"
https://openalex.org/W2057703748,Backswimmers (Notonectidae) are common diving insects found around the world that exploit the mid-water zone for predation--they breathe by using an air bubble collected at the surface. Here we show that backswimmers achieve prolonged periods of neutral buoyancy by using oxygen stored in their haemoglobin to stabilize the volume of the bubble as they breathe from it. This enables them to maintain their position in the water column without continually swimming.

A coordinated adaptive program called the unfolded protein response is triggered and includes translation inhibition, transcriptional activation of a set of genes encoding mostly intracellular proteins, and ultimately apoptosis. Here we show that insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), a secreted protein that modulates IGF bioavailability and has other IGF-independent effects, is potently induced during ER stress in human hepatocytes. Various ER stress-inducing agents were able to increase IGFBP-1 mRNA levels, as well as cellular and secreted IGFBP-1 protein up to 20-fold. A distal regulatory region of the human IGFBP-1 gene (–6682/–6384) containing an activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) composite site was required for promoter activation upon ER stress. Mutation of the ATF4 composite site led to the loss of IGFBP-1 regulation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed an ER stress-inducible complex that was displaced by an ATF4 antibody. Knockdown of ATF4 expression using two specific small interfering RNAs impaired up-regulation of IGFBP-1 mRNA, which highlights the relevance of ATF4 in endogenous IGFBP-1 gene induction. In addition to intracellular proteins involved in secretory and metabolic pathways, we conclude that ER stress induces the synthesis of secreted proteins. Increased secretion of IGFBP-1 during hepatic ER stress may thus constitute a signal to modulate cell growth and metabolism and induce a systemic adaptive response.

Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The most immediate response associated with ER stress is transient attenuation of protein synthesis to decrease the load on the ER (1Harding H.P. Calfon M. Urano F. Novoa I. Ron D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 4Ron D. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 5Kaufman R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 152-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The second part of the response consists of specifically up-regulating ER protein folding, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) efficiencies, and expression of a set of genes involved in the general adaptation to stress. Target genes include molecular chaperones such as BiP, GRP94, and calreticulin (6Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar) and ERAD components such as EDEM (7Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), genes involved in amino acid metabolism and resistance to oxidative stress (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). In addition to the recovery from ER stress, the UPR initiates proapoptotic pathways that could lead to programmed cell death if the stress is sustained (9Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar).The diversity of these responses is mediated by three ER transmembrane transducer proteins that sense the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER lumen and activate signaling pathways. These transducers include the precursor form of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and two kinases as follows: the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK) and the kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1 (10Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25935-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Upon ER stress, PERK phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2α), which reduces the level of eIF2-GTP available for translation initiation, leading to a general attenuation of translation (5Kaufman R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 152-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, eIF2α phosphorylation also increases translation of selective mRNAs such as the mRNA coding for the bZIP-activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which regulates the expression of some UPR target genes (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). Thus, by phosphorylating eIF2α, the PERK pathway regulates both translation and transcription during ER stress. The second transmembrane ER kinase, IRE1, is an endoribonuclease that splices XBP1 (X-box binding protein-1) mRNA in response to ER stress; this generates the potent bZIP transcription factor, XBP1, which regulates the transcription of a set of UPR target genes (11Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Activation of the third transmembrane ER transducer, the precursor form of ATF6, in response to ER stress leads to its transport to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved, releasing a cytoplasmic fragment, the bZIP transcription factor called ATF6 that activates transcription of UPR target genes (11Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar).The three signaling pathways of the UPR allow the regulation of gene expression by three transcription factors as follows: ATF4, XBP1, and ATF6, which bind to different cis-acting elements. ER stress-response element (ERSE, CCAATN9CCACG) binds both XBP1 and ATF6 factors in the presence of the general transcription factor nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) (12Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2904) Google Scholar, 13Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). UPRE sequences (consensus TGACGTG(G/A)) specifically binds XBP1 without assistance of NF-Y (7Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 12Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24120-24127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), C/EBP-ATF composite site in the Herp promoter (18Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34864-34873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In the CHOP promoter, the ATF4 composite site binds ATF4 in combination with ATF2 (16Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (Correction (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 15706): 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); in the ASNS promoter, the NSRE1 site binds different transcriptional factors with a sequential order (20Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); during the initial phase following the stress (amino acid deprivation), NSRE1 mainly binds ATF4, and ASNS gene transcription is increased. Subsequently, binding of C/EBPβ and ATF3-full-length to NSRE1 increased and ASNS transcription declined.The three signaling pathways differ in their activation pattern. Although Ire1/XBP1 and ATF6 pathways are specific to ER stress, the PERK pathway shares phosphorylation of eIF2α and the induced “integrated stress response” with unrelated stress: amino acid deprivation, viral infection, and heme deficiency that activate specific kinases (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar).UPR target genes encode mostly intracellular proteins that carry biological functions helping the cell to cope with the accumulation of unfolded proteins or leading to cell death (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the UPR also includes the activation of signals involved in cell-cell communication. The possibility that secreted proteins expression could be regulated by ER stress is an important issue, because in this case the stressed cell would communicate the information to other cells and trigger a response at the tissue or systemic levels.Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are a family of secreted proteins that bind insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) with high affinities. The concentration of free IGFs is believed to represent the primary determinant of the tissue response to IGFs; free IGFs bind to the IGF type I receptor and modulate developmental growth and metabolism. By regulating IGF transport and half-life, IGFBPs modulate IGF bioactivity. But IGFBPs also act on cell migration, growth, and death by interacting with cell surface extracellular or intracellular partners (22Firth S.M. Baxter R.C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 824-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar).IGFBP-1 displays tissue-specific expression; it is mostly secreted by hepatocytes, decidualized uterine endometrium, ovarian granulosa cells, and kidney (23Lee P.D. Giudice L.C. Conover C.A. Powell D.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 216: 319-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). IGFBP-1 acts both as an “endocrine” and an “autocrine/paracrine” factor. Although all the functions of IGFBP-1 are not understood, IGFBP-1 is known to influence glucose homeostasis and to play a role in the female reproductive functions (23Lee P.D. Giudice L.C. Conover C.A. Powell D.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 216: 319-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 24Nayak N.R. Giudice L.C. Placenta. 2003; 24: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Indeed, various transgenic mice overexpressing the IGFBP-1 gene consistently display impaired glucose tolerance and abnormalities in insulin action in addition to alterations of reproduction, intrauterine, and postnatal growth restrictions (25Crossey P.A. Pillai C.C. Miell J.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26Crossey P.A. Jones J.S. Miell J.P.

Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2080-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gene knock-out studies in mice suggested another function of IGFBP-1 in the liver; IGFBP-1 may act as a pro-mitogenic and a protective protein of the injured liver probably through an IGF-independent mechanism (30Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Craig L.E. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1251-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Leu J.I. Crissey M.A. Taub R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).IGFBP-1 differs from the other IGFBPs in its rapid regulation by metabolic status; IGFBP-1 serum level decreases following food intake and increases between meals; insulin down-regulation of IGFBP-1 gene is believed to be responsible for this daily fluctuation (32Lee P.D. Conover C.A. Powell D.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 204: 4-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased concentrations of glucocorticoids and proinflammatory cytokines are believed to strongly regulate IGFBP-1 synthesis in catabolic conditions (33Li Y.H. Fan J. Lang C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: R1990-R1997PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lang C.H. Nystrom G.J. Frost R.A. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 2001; 11: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Lang C.H. Nystrom G.J. Frost R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G719-G727PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these regulations, amino acid depletion and hypoxia were shown to up-regulate IGFBP-1 gene expression (36Jousse C. Bruhat A. Ferrara M. Fafournoux P. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Tazuke S.I. Mazure N.M. Sugawara J. Carland G. Faessen G.H. Suen L.F. Irwin J.C. Powell D.R. Giaccia A.J. Giudice L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that the environmental contaminant dioxin induced IGFBP-1 gene expression (38Marchand A. Tomkiewicz C. Marchandeau J.P. Boitier E. Barouki R. Garlatti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During the course of exploring the mechanisms of dioxin action, in particular the contribution of induced ER-localized cytochromes P450, we observed a potent induction of IGFBP-1 upon ER stress. We show here that IGFBP-1 is highly induced during ER stress in human hepatocytes; both mRNAs and secreted proteins are induced up to 20-fold by different chemicals inducing the UPR. This induction requires the transcription factor ATF4 that binds to a distal regulatory region of the human IGFBP-1 gene promoter.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—All chemical products, including tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and thapsigargin, were obtained from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Qiagen (Les Ulis, France) and siRNA from Eurogentec (Angers, France).Cell Culture—Human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 50% Dulbecco's minimal essential medium complemented with nonessential amino acids and 50% Ham's F-12 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.5 mg/ml amphotericin B (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) in a humidified atmosphere in 5% CO2. Human hepatocytes were a kind gift from Dr. P. Maurel (INSERM 128, Montpellier, France) and were maintained as described previously (39Isom H.C. Secott T. Georgoff I. Woodworth C. Mummaw J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3252-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Northern Blots—Total RNAs were isolated by using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen. Northern blots were performed using 10 μg of total RNA per lane. The probes used to detect IGFBP-1, BiP, and GRP94 mRNAs were described previously (38Marchand A. Tomkiewicz C. Marchandeau J.P. Boitier E. Barouki R. Garlatti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Herp probe was isolated by reverse transcription of HepG2 RNAs and specific amplification by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: Herp forward 5′-CTTCCAAAGCAGGAAAAACG-3′; Herp reverse 5′-GGCTCCAGGATTAACAACCA-3′. These probes were labeled using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridizations were performed using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed for 45 min at 65 °C with 2× standard saline citrate and 0.1% SDS and for 35 min with 0.5× standard saline citrate, and 0.1% SDS. Quantifications were performed with a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Reverse transcription was performed on each RNA sample (2 μg) using the cDNA high-capacity archive kit from Applied Biosystems (Courtaboeuf, France) in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Sequences of oligonucleotides were described previously (38Marchand A. Tomkiewicz C. Marchandeau J.P. Boitier E. Barouki R. Garlatti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) except for CHOP (16Averous J. Bruhat A. Jousse C. Carraro V. Thiel G. Fafournoux P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (Correction (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 15706): 5288-5297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Additional oligonucleotides are as follows: GRP94 forward 5′-TTGGTGTCGGTTTCTATTCC and GRP94 reverse GCTGGGTATCGTTGTTGTG; Herp forward 5′-CTCCAGCCCCTATTCACAAC-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCAATCCAACCAATCTCG -3′; and EDEM forward 5′-GAAATGAAAGGGGACAGAAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCAGCAAAGTGAAGAGAC-3′.Real time quantitative RT-PCR was performed with 40 ng of cDNA, 300 nm each primer, and SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (AbGene) to a final volume of 10 μl. Quantitative RT-PCR measurements were performed on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems). PCR cycles proceeded as follows: Taq activation (15 min), denaturation (15 s, 95 °C), annealing (30 s, 60 °C), and extension (30s, 72 °C). The relative mRNA levels were estimated by the standard method using ribosomal protein L13a as the reference gene.Cellular and Medium Protein Extracts—Ten million HepG2 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin, 0,25 μm thapsigargin, 0,25 μg/ml brefeldin A or the appropriate vehicle (ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)) in 6 ml of serum-free medium over 24 h. Culture supernatants containing secreted IGFBP-1 were saved, and protein extracts from cells were prepared. Cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA containing an antiprotease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by sonication 30 s with a Vibracell (Fisher). Centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 rpm was then performed, and the pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of 100 mm NaPO4, 10mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol, pH 7.4. Protein concentration of cell lysates and medium extracts were measured using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard.Western Blots—Each sample (40 μg of cellular protein extracts or 20 μg of culture cell medium) in 10% glycerol, 75 μm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, and 0.005% pyronine were run in a 9% polyacrylamide gel. Blots were incubated for 3 h in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 with 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Sigma) and then overnight at 4 °C with either a mouse monoclonal anti-human IGFBP-1 (Mediagnost, Reutlingen, Germany) or a goat polyclonal BiP antibody (tebu-bio, Le Perray en Yvelines, France).Cloning of IGFBP-1 and BiP Genes Fragments and Plasmid Construction—The first 1205-bp fragment of the human IGFBP-1 promoter was already cloned and sequenced (40Suwanichkul A. Cubbage M.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21185-21193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of this sequence with the GenBank™ data base (BLAST) allowed us to identify BAC number RP11-132L11 (GenBank™ accession number AC091524), which contains 7400 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site of the human IGFBP-1 gene. By using this sequence, we designed oligonucleotides that allowed the amplification of various fragments of the promoter. Nucleotide numbering represents the distance 5′ (negative) or 3′ (positive) to the mRNA capsite (nucleotide 1). The oligonucleotides used are as follows: OL+1135, 5′-TCATGTTCTTAGGGGGCAAC-3′; OL+493, 5′-CTGCGTGCAGGAGTCTGA-3′; OL+102, 5′-CCAAACTCTGGGCAAGTGAT-3′; OL-1618, 5′-AAGGATGCCCCAGGATTTAT-3′; OL-2523, 5′-GGAACTGACCAACGGTTTTG-3′; OL-2644, 5′-TTGCAAGCTGAGGAAGTCAG-3′; OL-3778, 5′-TGGTCTTGGAGGGTAAGTGG-3′; OL-3966, 5′-CCTGCCTGTTATTCCAGCTC-3′; OL-4030, 5′-CCACCACCACAGGGGTATAA-3′; OL-4429, 5′-TCCTCCCTTTCCTCCATTCT-3′; OL-6288, 5′-TCACCAGCAGCTGAAAATTG-3′; OL-6384, 5′-CAGGGACACCTCAGAAAGGA-3′; OL-6682, 5′-GCTTTGGCCTGGACACAT-3′; OL-6819, 5′-CTGCCCTATGTTTGGCACTT-3′; and OL-7129, 5′-GGAGTGGTTTTGTGCAAGTG-3′.PCR fragments were generated using the HotStar TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen) and HepG2 genomic DNA as a matrix and subcloned into pGL3 Basic vector (Promega, Charbonnieres, France). Fragments +493/+1135, –3966/–2523, –4429/–3778, –6819/–4030, 7129/–6288, and –6682/–6384 were subcloned into p-TATA-FL vector (which consists of pGL3 Basic in which the sequence AGGGTATATAATG was inserted between XhoI and BglII sites). The inserts of the resulting p–2644/+102-FL, p+493/+1135-TATA-FL, p– 3966/–2523-TATA-FL, p–4429/–3778-TATA-FL, p–6819/–4030-TATA-FL, p–7129/–6288-TATA-FL, and p–6682/–6384-TATA-FL were sequenced. The sequence corresponds to the one present in the GenBank™ data base (accession numbers AC091524 and AY434089). A fragment of the human BiP promoter containing the proximal ERSE motifs was also generated by PCR and subcloned into PGL3 basic vector p–339/+41-BiP-FL.Site-directed Mutagenesis—The human IGFBP-1 promoter was mutated between nucleotides –6629 and nt –6622 (UPRE2 motif) or between nt –6481 and nt –6473 (ATF4 composite site) (see sequences on Fig. 5B) by a two-step PCR to give rise, respectively, to p–6682/–6384-mutUPRE2-TATA-FL and p–6682/–6384-mutATF4-TATA-FL.Transient Transfection Experiments—Expression vector of human ATF4 (pMycATF4) and its control vector (pCMV5myc vector) were the generous gifts from Dr. A. S. Lee (41Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcouwer S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37375-37385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Expression vector of the human α1-antitrypsin mutant Hong-Kong, pA1ATΔTC, was a kind gift from Dr. N. Hosokawa (42Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar).HepG2 cells (4 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate) were transfected in triplicate by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique (2 μg of plasmid-FL/well) except that glycerol shock was omitted. Thirty hours later, cells were treated with Me2SO or 2 μg/ml tunicamycin over 16 h, and cells were lysed in 200 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase was assayed with the Promega kit. When cotransfection experiments were performed, either 500 ng of pMycATF4 or pCMV5myc or 2 μg of pA1ATΔTC vectors were included in the precipitate, and firefly luciferase was assayed 40 h after transfection.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Eight million HepG2 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin or Me2SO for 5 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (38Marchand A. Tomkiewicz C. Marchandeau J.P. Boitier E. Barouki R. Garlatti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Synthetic double-stranded DNA probes (4 pg) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) and the large Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). HepG2 nuclear extracts (10 μg) were pre-incubated on ice for 15 min in the presence of 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a reaction mixture containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.75 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol in the presence or absence of a 75-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitors.

Previously our laboratory used in vivo labeling/mass spectrometry to identify phosphorylation sites of activated MLK3. Seven of 11 identified sites correspond to the consensus motif for phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases. Based on these results, we hypothesized that JNK, or another proline-directed kinase, phosphorylates MLK3 as part of a feedback loop. Herein we provide evidence that MLK3 can be phosphorylated by JNK in vitro and in vivo. Blockade of JNK results in dephosphorylation of MLK3. The hypophosphorylated form of MLK3 is inactive and redistributes to a Triton-insoluble fraction. Recovery from JNK inhibition restores MLK3 solubility and activity, indicating that the redistribution process is reversible. This work describes a novel mode of regulation of MLK3, by which JNK-mediated feedback phosphorylation of MLK3 regulates its activation and deactivation states by cycling between Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble forms.

Protein kinases and their signaling cascades are dynamically regulated through protein-protein interactions, subcellular targeting, and phosphorylation. By differential integration of these regulatory mechanisms, a protein kinase and its signaling pathway can lead to distinct cellular responses. In addition, many protein kinases are subjected to feedback regulation, and biological signaling pathways are modulated by positive and negative regulatory feedback loops. MLK3 (mixed lineage kinase 3) is a widely expressed mammalian serine/threonine kinase that functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) 2The abbreviations used are: MAPKKK, MAPK kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; Hsp, heat shock protein; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; JNKK, JNK kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MEKK1, MEK kinase 1; MKK, MAPK kinase; MCF-7, MI Cancer Foundation 7. and can activate multiple MAPK pathways (1Gallo K.A.

In addition to its catalytic domain, MLK3 contains several other regions important for its regulation, including an N-terminal Src homology 3 domain and a centrally located zipper followed by a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif. Notably, the COOH-terminal region of MLK3 is rich in Ser, Thr, and Pro residues, with the final 220 amino acids of MLK3 being composed of 12, 13, and 24%, respectively, of these amino acids. Activated forms of the small GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac, can bind to MLK3, cause retardation of MLK3 electrophoretic mobility, increase MLK3 catalytic activity, and potentiate its signaling to JNK (11Tibbles L.A.

Our recent work demonstrates that binding of activated Cdc42 promotes phosphorylation of Thr277 and Ser281 within the activation segment of MLK3, leading to increased MLK3 activity (20Du Y. Bock B.C. Schachter K.A. Chao M. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42984-42993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, Cdc42, in a prenylation-dependent fashion, induces translocation of MLK3 to cellular membranes (20Du Y. Bock B.C. Schachter K.A. Chao M. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42984-42993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whereas GTPase binding activates MLK3, MLK3 is autoinhibited through a (presumably) intramolecular interaction between its Src homology 3 domain and a proline-containing sequence located between its zipper region and the Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif (21Zhang H. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45598-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Oligomerization of MLK3 through its zipper region is required for full activation of MLK3 as well as for proper substrate phosphorylation and down-stream signaling (22Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Vacratsis P.O. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27893-27900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that activated Cdc42 promotes dimerization of MLK3 (22Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 24Nihalani D. Meyer D. Pajni S. Holzman L.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In our current model, binding of the activated GTPase disrupts Src homology 3-mediated autoinhibition, leading to induced dimerization and activation segment (auto)phosphorylation. Membrane targeting seems to further enhance MLK3 catalytic activity. MLK3 is multiphosphorylated in vivo. Several in vivo phosphorylation sites of MLK3 have been identified using metabolic labeling coupled with mass spectrometry (25Vacratsis P.O. Phinney B.S. Gage D.A. Gallo K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5613-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Strikingly, seven of the identified sites, serines 524, 705, 727, 740, 758, 770, and 793, are followed immediately by a proline, thus conforming to the consensus for phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases. The identification of sites of proline-directed phosphorylation of MLK3, together with the ability of MLK3 to activate multiple MAPK pathways, led us to hypothesize that MLK3 might be regulated through feedback phosphorylation by MAPKs. Herein we present evidence for JNK-mediated phosphorylation of MLK3 in cells. JNK also phosphorylates MLK3 in vitro. We further demonstrate that manipulation of JNK activity in cells dramatically impacts the levels of MLK3 in cellular lysates. We show that hyperphosphorylated MLK3 distributes to a Triton-soluble fraction, whereas blockade of JNK induces hypophosphorylation of MLK3 and redistribution of MLK3 to a detergent-insoluble fraction. Taken altogether, our data provide evidence for a novel positive feedback loop in which the activated MAPKKK, MLK3, is phosphorylated by the downstream MAPK, JNK, leading to preferential distribution of MLK3 in Triton-soluble domains. Enforcement of such a positive feedback loop is expected to result in sustained JNK signaling and, as such, may have important implications in irreversible biological decisions that occur during development and in apoptosis.

Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate technique or using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. MCF-7/iFLAG-MLK3 cells inducibly expressing FLAG-MLK3 have been described elsewhere (9Zhang H. Wu W. Du Y. Santos S.J. Conrad S.E. Watson J.T. Grammatikakis N. Gallo K.A. J. Biol.

Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 1% Triton lysis buffer, containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4PPi, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Following sonication for 40 s in a sonication bath to enhance disruption of organelles, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. For immunoprecipitations, antibodies against the proteins of interest were prebound to Protein A-agarose beads at room temperature for 30 min and incubated with clarified cellular lysates for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed as previously described (19Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For the Triton X-100 biochemical fractionation, the cells were lysed as described above, and the Triton-insoluble pellets were washed in lysis buffer and then resuspended in 2× SDS loading buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Cellular lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were immunoblotted using appropriate antibodies. Western blots were developed by the chemiluminescence method as described previously (19Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol.

Pro-Q Diamond and Silver Staining—HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding MLK3 or MLK3 K144M as described. MLK3 was immunoprecipitated as described above and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Pro-Q Diamond stain (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The image was acquired using a Molecular Imager FX Pro Plus scanner and PDQuest version 7.4 (Bio-Rad). The gel was then silver-stained using SilverQuest (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitations were done by densitometry (ImageJ; available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). In Vivo Labeling and Phosphopeptide Mapping—12 h after transfection, HEK 293 cells were washed twice with phosphate-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology)) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then pretreated with the different MAPK pathway inhibitors (40 μm SP600125, 6 μm SB203580, or 10 μm U0126) or vehicle Me2SO for 1 h before the addition of 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and further incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed as described above. MLK3 was immunoprecipitated as described above and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of radiolabel into MLK3 was quantified by phosphorimaging and normalized to the MLK3 expression levels, determined by densitometry (ImageJ). Radiolabeled bands were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin (Roche Applied Science), and phosphopeptide maps were developed as described previously (25Vacratsis P.O. Phinney B.S. Gage D.A. Gallo K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5613-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of MLK3—HEK 293 cells were transfected with a vector encoding MLK3 K144M. 20 h after transfection, the cells were washed and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. MLK3 K144M was immunopurified from clarified cellular lysates. Kinase reactions were carried out in 50 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol) containing 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 0.5 μg (57 milliunits) of recombinant, activated JNK1α1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the incorporation of radioactivity into MLK3 was measured by phosphorimaging. JNK Is Required for in Vivo Phosphorylation of MLK3—Using mass spectrometry coupled with comparative phosphotryptic peptide mapping, we previously identified 11 in vivo phosphorylation sites on MLK3 (25Vacratsis P.O. Phinney B.S. Gage D.A. Gallo K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5613-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our strategy, HEK 293 cells expressing MLK3 with its activator Cdc42V12 for 16 h were subsequently labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for an additional 4 h. After affinity purification and trypsin digestion of MLK3, the resultant radiolabeled phosphotryptic peptides were resolved by chromatography, and their sequences were determined using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Thus, only those sites that are relatively labile (dephosphorylated) and incorporate substantial radiolabel (rephosphorylated) during the 4-h labeling period could potentially be identified. MLK3 contains 27 potential proline-directed kinase sites, most of which are found in the COOH-terminal region, which is rich in proline, serine, and threonine (26Gallo K.A. Mark M.R. Scadden D.T. Wang Z. Gu Q. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15092-15100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the identified phosphorylation sites revealed that seven of the 11 sites conform to the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases, and six of the seven sites reside in the COOH-terminal region. This suggests that MLK3 is phosphorylated by proline-directed kinases. Additionally, we have found that, whereas wild type MLK3 incorporates substantial radiolabel under our experimental conditions, a kinase-defective MLK3 variant incorporates very little radiolabel. 3P. O. Vacratsis and K. A. Gallo, unpublished data. Total phosphate incorporation into MLK3 was determined using the Pro-Q diamond dye. This fluorescent stain detects phosphate groups attached to tyrosine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in a protein (27Schulenberg B. Goodman T.N. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Patton W.F. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2526-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Steinberg T.H. Agnew B.J. Gee K.R. Leung W.Y. Goodman T. Schulenberg B. Hendrickson J. Beechem J.M. Haugland R.P. Patton W.F. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1128-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). MLK3 or a kinase-inactive version MLK3 K144M was expressed in HEK 293 cells. Immunopurified MLK3 variants were resolved by SDS-PAGE. After staining the gel with Pro-Q Diamond, densitometry was used to quantitate the relative incorporation of Pro-Q Diamond stain into the MLK3 variants (Fig. 1A). After correcting for expression levels, the extent of Pro-Q diamond staining was determined to be 40% less for kinase-defective MLK3 than for wild type MLK3. The increased phosphorylation of wild type MLK3 over that of inactive MLK3 is consistent with MLK3 autophosphorylation and/or feedback phosphorylation emanating from active MLK3. Given that MLK3 is implicated in the activation of multiple MAPK pathways, it is reasonable to hypothesize that, upon MLK3-induced activation, MAPKs might phosphorylate MLK3. To decipher which MAPK(s) might contribute to proline-directed phosphorylation of MLK3, the impact of MAPK pathway inhibitors on the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into MLK3 was determined using the same conditions we used in our original mass spectrometry studies. Concentrations of SP600125, U0126, and SB203580 required for inhibition of JNK, ERK (through inhibition of its upstream activator MEK), and p38, respectively, were experimentally determined in HEK 293 cells coexpressing MLK3 and activated Cdc42 (data not shown). Cells were pretreated with MAPK pathway inhibitors prior to and during in vivo labeling and, after affinity purification and SDS-PAGE, the incorporation of radiolabel into MLK3 was quantitated by phosphorimaging. Based on three independent experiments, incorporation of radiolabel into MLK3 was reduced by 70% in the presence of SP600125 (Fig. 1B). In contrast, inhibition of the p38 and ERK pathways does not reduce in vivo phosphorylation of MLK3 (Fig. 1B). In fact, treatment with SB203580 enhances the phosphorylation of MLK3 by about 2-fold. This may reflect the established antagonism between p38 and JNK signaling (29Hall J.P. Davis R.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Phosphotryptic peptide maps of MLK3 isolated from cells treated with each of the MAPK pathway inhibitors separately, as well as all three together, were generated. The radiolabeled MLK3 was excised from the gel and trypsin-digested, identical cellular equivalents of the phosphotryptic peptides were resolved by thin-layer electrophoresis/TLC, and radioactive phosphopeptides were detected by phosphorimaging. Phosphotryptic peptide maps from the different samples were processed and imaged in parallel so that the intensities of spots between maps could be directly compared. Treatment of cells with SP600125, but not with other MAPK pathway inhibitors, yielded phosphopeptide maps that showed a decrease in intensity of essentially all of the spots corresponding to identified phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1C). Given that more than 80% of the total intensity of phosphotryptic peptides is accounted for by phosphopeptides containing proline-directed kinase sites, these findings are not altogether unexpected. Thus, the activity of JNK, but not of other MAPKs, is apparently responsible for the dynamic COOH-terminal proline-directed phosphorylation of MLK3. Manipulation of JNK Activity Alters the Phosphorylation of MLK3—Coexpression with activated Cdc42 retards the electrophoretic mobility of MLK3 due to phosphorylation at sites other than in the activation segment (20Du Y. Bock B.C. Schachter K.A. Chao M. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42984-42993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reduced in vivo phosphorylation of Cdc42-activated MLK3 observed upon treatment of cells coexpressing activated Cdc42 and MLK3 with SP600125 is correlated with a more rapidly migrating, hypophosphorylated form of MLK3 (Fig. 1). Because SP600125 may target other protein kinases in addition to JNK (30Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar), we sought alternative means to manipulate cellular JNK activity so as to provide further support for the idea that JNK phosphorylates MLK3 in vivo. MLK3 activates the JNK pathway through phosphorylation of MKK4 (2Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and MKK7/JNKK2 (31Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7337-7342Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Catalytically inactive versions of MKK4 (MKK4 K129R) and MKK7/JNKK2 (MKK7 K165A) can function as dominant negative proteins to block JNK activity in cells. The blockade of JNK activation is most efficient when the inactive versions of MKK4 and MKK7 are coexpressed (32Liu Y.F. Dorow D. Marshall J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, increasing amounts of expression vectors for MKK4 K129R and MKK7 K165A were simultaneously transfected into HEK 293 cells, together with vectors encoding MLK3 and activated Cdc42. Upon introduction of increasing amounts of dominant negative MKK4 and MKK7, efficient inhibition of the Cdc42-MLK3-induced JNK activity in cells was achieved, as judged by the decrease in phospho-c-Jun levels (Fig. 2A, second panel). Under these conditions of efficient JNK inhibition, the electrophoretic mobility of MLK3 was restored to that observed for MLK3 in the absence of Cdc42. These results are similar to the effects of SP600125 on MLK3, suggesting that the effects of SP600125 are, indeed, mediated through inhibition of JNK and that the retarded mobility of MLK3 observed upon coexpression with Cdc42 is mediated, at least in part, through JNK phosphorylation. In a complementary approach, we sought to determine whether selective activation of the JNK pathway would promote phosphorylation of MLK3. However, the numerous extracellular stimuli that activate the JNK pathway invariably activate other MAPK pathways as well. The only MKK that has been shown to activate exclusively the JNK pathway is MKK7/JNKK2 (33Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1569-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant forms of the appropriate upstream MKKs (MEK1, MKK3, and MKK6), in which the activation loop sites have been replaced with acidic residues to mimic phosphorylation, can selectively activate ERK and p38 (34Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 35Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding mutant of MKK7/JNKK2 is not highly active (36Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, fusion of MKK7/JNKK2 to JNK1 results in a constitutively active JNK when expressed in cells (36Zheng C. Xiang J. Hunter T. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28966-28971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To determine whether selective activation of JNK promotes MLK3 phosphorylation, HeLa cells were transfected with expression vectors for MLK3 and the fusion protein JNKK2-JNK1. As shown in Fig. 2B, the introduction of activated JNK in cells results in the appearance of slower migrating forms of MLK3, indicative of phosphorylation of MLK3. Since the majority of the identified phosphorylation sites of MLK3 conform to the consensus for proline-directed kinases, the simplest explanation for our data is that JNK directly phosphorylates MLK3 in cells. To determine whether recombinant, activated JNK can directly phosphorylate MLK3 in vitro, it was necessary to eliminate the background of MLK3 autophosphorylation, and therefore a kinase-defective version of MLK3 (K144M) was expressed, immunopurified from HEK 293 cells, and used as a substrate for recombinant, active JNK in an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2C, JNK phosphorylates MLK3 K144M in vitro, and this phosphorylation results in a decreased electrophoretic mobility of MLK3 (Fig. 2C, bottom). These data support the hypothesis that MLK3 is a direct substrate of JNK. Feedback Phosphorylation Regulates MLK3 Protein Levels in Cellular Lysates—One intriguing observation in the experiments described above was an apparent correlation between the cellular levels of activated JNK and the levels of MLK3 protein present in cellular lysates. As shown in Fig. 2A, when JNK activity is diminished, less MLK3 is detected. This effect is specific to MLK3, since the levels of FLAG-Cdc42 in cellular lysates, which is expressed using an identical vector, are unchanged in response to JNK inhibition. Likewise, the amount of MLK3 in cellular lysates (Fig. 2B) increases when the corresponding cells express the constitutively active JNK fusion protein, whereas the levels of green fluorescent protein used as a transfection"
https://openalex.org/W2072873811,"The mitochondrial genome of trypanosomes, termed kinetoplast DNA (kDNA), contains thousands of minicircles and dozens of maxicircles topologically interlocked in a network. To identify proteins involved in network replication, we screened an inducible RNA interference-based genomic library for cells that lose kinetoplast DNA. In one cloned cell line with inducible kinetoplast DNA loss, we found that the RNA interference vector had aberrantly integrated into the genome resulting in overexpression of genes down-stream of the integration site (Motyka, S. A., Zhao, Z., Gull, K., and Englund, P. T. (2004) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 134, 163–167). We now report that the relevant overexpressed gene encodes a mitochondrial cytochrome b5 reductase-like protein. This overexpression caused kDNA loss by oxidation/inactivation of the universal minicircle sequence-binding protein, which normally binds the minicircle replication origin and triggers replication. The rapid loss of maxicircles suggests that the universal minicircle sequence-binding protein might also control maxicircle replication. Several lines of evidence indicate that the cytochrome b5 reductase-like protein controls the oxidization status of the universal minicircle sequence-binding protein via tryparedoxin, a mitochondrial redox protein. For example, overexpression of mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase, which utilizes tryparedoxin, also caused oxidation of the universal minicircle sequence-binding protein and kDNA loss. Furthermore, the growth defect caused by overexpression of cytochrome b5 reductase-like protein could be partially rescued by simultaneously overexpressing tryparedoxin.

Trypanosoma brucei is a flagellated protozoan parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and related disease in cattle. Trypanosomes are early branching eukaryotes and one of the first to contain a mitochondrion (1Sogin M.L. Silberman J.D. Int. J. Parasitol. 1998; 28: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The single mitochondrion is a tubular structure, which contains an unusual DNA termed “kinetoplast DNA” (kDNA). 3The abbreviations used are: kDNA, kinetoplast DNA; RNAi, RNA interference; tet, tetracycline; CBRL, cytochrome b5 reductase-like; GFP, green fluorescent protein; UMS, universal minicircle sequence; UMSBP, universal minicircle sequence-binding protein; b5R, cytochrome b5 reductase; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. kDNA is a planar network composed of several thousand topologically interlocked DNA circles. Within the mitochondrial matrix the network is condensed into a disk-shaped structure that is positioned near the flagellar basal body. The network contains two types of circles known as maxicircles and minicircles. Maxicircles (23 kb each) number in the dozens and code for ribosomal RNAs and some mitochondrial proteins such as subunits of respiratory complexes. Many of the maxicircle transcripts are cryptic and require editing to form functional mRNAs. Editing involves insertion and/or deletion of uridylate residues at precise internal locations in the transcript. Several thousand minicircles (1 kb each) encode the many guide RNAs that are templates for editing (see Ref. 2Stuart K.D. Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Panigrahi A.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 97-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar for review on editing). The minicircles and maxicircles replicate once per cell cycle, and the progeny segregate into the two daughter cells. The network structure of the kDNA imposes a complex replication mechanism. Replication involves release of covalently closed minicircles from the network into the kinetoflagellar zone, a region between the kDNA disk and the mitochondrial membrane near the flagellar basal body (3Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Free minicircles initiate replication in the kinetoflagellar zone and their progeny, which contain gaps, are then thought to migrate to a pair of antipodal sites located on opposite sides of the kDNA disk. Several of the later stages of replication, including removal of RNA primers and repair of some (but not all) gaps, occur in the antipodal sites. Finally, the newly replicated minicircles, still containing one or more gaps, reattach to the network periphery in a reaction mediated by a topoisomerase II (4Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 5Melendy T. Sheline C. Ray D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1083-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After all of the minicircles have replicated, the remaining gaps are repaired, the network splits in two (a reaction likely mediated by a topoisomerase II), and daughter networks segregate into progeny cells. (For reviews of kDNA replication, see Refs. 6Liu B. Liu Y. Motyka S.A. Agbo E.E. Englund P.T. Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 363-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar and 7Shlomai J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 623-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar.) Although roughly 30 proteins have been identified that likely participate in kDNA replication or maintenance, we speculate based on the complexity of the process that more than 100 proteins might be involved (6Liu B. Liu Y. Motyka S.A. Agbo E.E. Englund P.T. Trends Parasitol. 2005; 21: 363-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To identify new proteins we developed a forward genetic approach using an RNA interference (RNAi)-based library. We created the library by ligating fragments of T. brucei genomic DNA into the tetracycline (tet)-inducible RNAi vector pZJM (8Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). We previously used the library to screen for trypanosomes with various phenotypes and then identified the relevant gene by PCR and sequencing of the pZJM insert (9Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Drew M.E. Morris J.C. Wang Z. Wells L. Sanchez M. Landfear S.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46596-46600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To identify genes involved in kDNA replication, we screened for kDNA loss, a phenotype commonly observed after RNAi knockdown of replication proteins (4Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Downey N. Hines J.C. Sinha K.M. Ray D.S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since kDNA loss is lethal, it was necessary to clone cells from the library prior to inducing RNAi. In one candidate clone, in which tet induction caused kDNA loss, we discovered that the RNAi vector had not properly integrated into the rDNA spacer region (13Motyka S.A. Zhao Z. Gull K. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This aberrant integration, into the gene targeted by the pZJM insert, caused the dual T7 promoters of the vector to be directed upstream and downstream from the integration site. Consequently, tet induction led to overexpression of 10 genes downstream of one of the T7 promoters. Antisense RNA was potentially transcribed from the other T7 promoter, but we did not detect silencing of upstream genes (13Motyka S.A. Zhao Z. Gull K. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, we presumed that overexpression of one of the downstream genes was responsible for kDNA loss. We now report the identification of this gene, cytochrome b5 reductase-like (CBRL), and characterize the mechanism by which its overexpression confers loss of kDNA. Trypanosome Growth and Transfection—All experiments were performed using the T. brucei procyclic 29-13 cell line (the generous gift of Drs. Elizabeth Wirtz and George Cross), which constitutively expresses both T7 RNA polymerase and the tet repressor (14Wirtz E. Clayton C. Science. 1995; 268: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in SDM-79 medium (17Brun R. Shonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the appropriate antibiotics (15 μg/ml G418, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and 10 μg/ml blasticidin) at 28 °C under 5% CO2. Fetal bovine serum at 15% was used in medium for cloning by limiting dilution. Cells were transfected by electroporation in Cytomix (18van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and growth was monitored with a Coulter counter (model Z1, Coulter Corp.). Overexpression and Localization—For overexpression, we cloned the open reading frame of the gene of interest downstream of a tet-regulated T7 promoter in the pLew111 vector (the generous gift of G. Cross, unpublished, see tryps.rockefeller.edu for description of pLew111) that we modified by inserting an unregulated T7 promoter sequence (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAG) immediately upstream of the drug resistance marker (ble) to make pLew111(2T7) (diagrammed in Fig. 1A). The additional T7 promoter eliminates the need to add tet to the culture medium during selection, a beneficial feature if the overexpressed protein is toxic. Overexpression was induced with 1 μg/ml tet, which was added every 2 days even if the cells were not diluted. For intracellular localization, we cloned the CBRL open reading frame (minus the stop codon) into a modified version of pLew111(2T7). The multicloning site was expanded to include MluI, XbaI, XhoI, and a sequence coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted downstream of the multicloning site, creating pLew111(2T7)GFPβ (diagrammed in Fig. 2A). Expression of the GFP fusion protein was induced with tet for 24–48 h, and live cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Images were captured with a Retiga Exi charge-coupled device camera (QImaging) and analyzed using IP Lab software (Scanalytics). For co-localization, live cells were stained with 40 nm MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 20 min and washed twice with PBS prior to mounting. RNAi and Knock-out of CBRL—For RNAi, a 500-bp fragment of the CBRL open reading frame (starting at 5′-TCCGGCTGC) was cloned into the pZJM vector. Inducible RNAi was performed as previously described (8Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). For knock-out via allelic replacement, 500 bp from the CBRL 5′ (amplified using primer pair KO5F 5′-TAGAAGCGGAGCTCGCTC and KO5R 5′-ATGGCCACCTTTCCGCCAC) and 3′ (amplified using primer pair KO3F 5′-CTCGTTTCTACGGAGGAAG and KO3R 5′-CGTTTGCGTTGGGTTGTTG) untranslated regions were cloned on opposite sides of a drug resistance cassette in the pKO vector (a generous gift of Dr. James Bangs) (19Lamb J.R. Fu V. Wirtz E. Bangs J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21512-21520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cassettes (containing either the blasticidin or puromycin resistance marker) were then sequentially transfected into 29-13 procyclic trypanosomes to allow for selection of stable lines prior to transfection with the second marker. For unknown reasons, selecting for puromycin resistance before blasticidin resistance was more efficient than the reverse order for generating double knock-out parasites. Northern Blotting, Southern Blotting, and Hybridization—For Northern blotting, RNA was isolated using the Purescript RNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems). RNA from 1.25 × 107 parasites was loaded per lane and fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing 7% formaldehyde. RNA was then transferred to a GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization and washing conditions were as described previously (8Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Total DNA for Southern blotting was isolated using a genomic DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems). For gene knock-out analysis, genomic DNA (1 μg) was digested with XhoI and HindIII (5 units/μgofDNA) for 20 h at 37 °C and fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel with the buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The DNA was partly depurinated by soaking the gel in 0.25 m HCl for 15 min, rinsing three times with water, and treating with 0.4 m NaOH/1.5 m NaCl for 15 min before transfer to GeneScreen Plus membrane and hybridization (20Church Gilbert W. G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7266) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with appropriate 32P-labeled probes made with a random primer DNA-labeling system (Invitrogen). Quantitation of total mini- and maxicircles and of free minicircles by phosphorimaging was as previously described (4Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Mid-log phase cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were centrifuged (2,500 × g, 3 min) and resuspended (2 × 106 cells/lane) in 10 μl of non-reducing sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, bromphenol blue) or reducing sample buffer (same as nonreducing except with 10% β-mercaptoethanol). After boiling for 5 min, samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for probing. Universal minicircle sequence-binding protein (UMSBP) was detected using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1,000) against the full-length Crithidia fasciculata UMSBP (a gift of Dr. Joseph Shlomai). RNA-editing proteins were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (a gift of Dr. Barbara Sollner-Webb) against Band II/TbMP81 (1:500), Band III/TbMP63 (1:2,000), or Band VI/TbMP52 (1:1,000) (21Rusche L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4069-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The BB2 epitope (EVHTNQDPLD) was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (1:100, a gift of Dr. Chris Tschudi) (22Shen S. Arhin G.K. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (diluted 1:10,000) or goat antimouse (diluted 1:20,000) secondary antibody (Pierce) was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of the Gene Responsible for kDNA Loss—As described in the introduction, aberrant integration of our RNAi vector led to overexpression of 10 genes downstream of the integration site and to loss of kDNA. To identify the gene responsible for kDNA loss, we cloned each of the 10 open reading frames separately into a tet-inducible overexpression vector (Fig. 1A). We found that overexpression of one of these genes, whose product is homologous to cytochrome b5 reductase, led to kDNA loss (to be described below). We designate this protein “CBRL,” for cytochrome b5 reductase-like (GenBank™ accession number 71755709). A Northern blot confirmed that tet induction caused a massive increase in CBRL mRNA (Fig. 1B, compare day 0 with days 1–3). Note that there is a modest overexpression at day 0 relative to the level in wild type, indicating that there is “leaky” overexpression in the absence of tet. We attempted to produce antibodies in rat against recombinant CBRL, but our best preparation was not satisfactory for probing a Western blot. Therefore, to assess CBRL overexpression we tagged it at its C terminus with the 10-amino acid BB2 epitope (22Shen S. Arhin G.K. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We overexpressed the fusion protein from pLew111(2T7), and a Western blot revealed a significant accumulation of epitope-tagged CBRL (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of either native (Fig. 1D) or epitope-tagged (not shown) CBRL caused a rapid slowing of the growth of the parasite. As mentioned above, CBRL resembles cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R), a eukaryotic redox protein that is anchored to mitochondrial or ER membranes via an N-terminal hydrophobic tail (24Colombo S. Longhi R. Alcaro S. Ortuso F. Sprocati T. Flora A. Borgese N. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The catalytic C-terminal domain of b5R (∼300 amino acids) contains a non-covalently bound FAD and has an NADH binding site. This domain is positioned in the cytosol, where it passes reducing equivalents from NADH to cytochrome b5 for use by enzymes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase (for review, see Ref. 25Borgese N. D'Arrigo A. De Silvestris M. Pietrini G. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 21: 313-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The domain structure of CBRL is similar to that of b5R except that CBRL has an additional N-terminal 66-amino acid extension that lacks homology to any other sequence in the GenBank™ non-redundant data base (except for apparent orthologs in the related parasites Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania major). The 302-residue C terminus of CBRL contains no recognizable domains except for poorly conserved FAD and NADH binding sites. Intracellular Localization of CBRL—We localized a CBRL-GFP fusion protein expressed from a tet-inducible overexpression vector (Fig. 2A). The fluorescence was concentrated in a tubular organelle with a staining pattern similar to that reported for other mitochondrial proteins (11Klingbeil M.M. Motyka S.A. Englund P.T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 26Tetaud E. Giroud C. Prescott A.R. Parkin D.W. Baltz D. Biteau N. Baltz T. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Klein K.G. Olson C.L. Engman D.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Co-localization of CBRL-GFP (Fig. 2B, left panels) with MitoTracker Red (Fig. 2B, right panels) confirmed that this CBRL is mitochondrial. Because the CBRL-GFP in this experiment was overexpressed, there was a shrinking and loss of kDNA comparable to that produced by overexpression of native CBRL (see below). CBRL Is Not Essential for Growth—We next tested whether CBRL itself is required for cell growth. In an inducible RNAi experiment using the pZJM vector, there was >90% reduction in CBRL mRNA after 2 days, but we observed no effect on cell growth in our standard culture medium (data not shown). To address this issue more rigorously, we replaced both alleles of the CBRL gene with drug resistance genes by homologous recombination. Although a Southern blot confirmed that the CBRL gene was deleted from the genome (Fig. 3A) and a Northern blot detected no mRNA (Fig. 3B), the cells grew normally (Fig. 3C). Also, there was no effect on kDNA detectable by fluorescence microscopy of DAPI-stained cells (data not shown). Therefore, although CBRL overexpression caused kDNA loss and growth inhibition, its absence appeared to have no deleterious effects at least under the culture conditions used. Loss of kDNA Networks following CBRL Overexpression—We induced CBRL overexpression and then followed the status of kDNA by visual analysis of DAPI-stained cells. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), shrinking and loss of kDNA networks proceeded slowly until day 9 when ∼31% of the cells had small kinetoplasts, and 63% had none at all. After day 9, cells with normal-size kDNA began to appear in larger numbers, and cells no longer overexpressed CBRL mRNA (data not shown; note also, in Fig. 1D, that recovery of cell growth began by about day 13). The shrinking and loss of kDNA suggested that CBRL overexpression affects kDNA replication or maintenance. We also monitored kDNA loss by Southern blot. We isolated total DNA at various times during the course of CBRL overexpression, digested it with HindIII and XbaI, fractionated the digests on an agarose gel, and transferred the fragments to a membrane. The total maxicircle level, determined with a probe for the 1.4-kb XbaI fragment (Fig. 5A, upper panel), rapidly decreased for 4 days following CBRL overexpression to ∼20% of the day 0 level (Fig. 5B). After day 4 the maxicircle level remained relatively constant. Probing the same gel for the heterogenous minicircle population revealed different kinetics. Focused on singly and multiply cleaved fragments between 0.5 and 1.0 kb (4Wang Z. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4674-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A, middle panel), we found only a slight decrease in total minicircles (Fig. 5B). This finding suggested that most of the minicircles had persisted despite the shrinking and loss of the kinetoplast structure. This finding raised the possibility that the kDNA network may have fragmented or decatenated as a result of CBRL overexpression. Effect of CBRL Overexpression on the Free Minicircle Population— Minicircles are released from the network as individual covalently closed circles, and these free minicircles then replicate unidirectionally as theta structures. Replication results in production of two daughter circles, containing one or multiple gaps, which are ultimately reattached to the network. To determine if CBRL overexpression perturbed this pathway, we evaluated the free minicircle population by Southern blot (Fig. 6A). Because kDNA networks underwent shrinking and loss (Fig. 4), whereas a majority of minicircles persisted (Fig. 5), we anticipated an increase in free minicircles or network fragments as a function of time of CBRL overexpression. In fact there was a continuous rise in the level of covalently closed free minicircles (Fig. 6B), and after day 2 there was also appearance of catenated minicircle oligomers (species migrating above the level indicated by the two asterisks) as well as covalently closed dimers. The latter species co-migrates with gapped/nicked minicircle monomers on the one-dimensional gel (Fig. 6A) but was resolved in a second dimension run in 30 mm NaOH (data not shown). A possible explanation of the results in Figs. 5 and 6 is that covalently closed minicircles are released from the network during CBRL overexpression but are inhibited in their ability to initiate replication. Overexpression of CBRL Causes Oligomerization of UMSBP— How can CBRL overexpression cause these effects on kDNA? If CBRL is a redox protein (as suggested by its candidate NADH and FAD binding sites), it may act through UMSBP, a molecule that binds the minicircle replication origin and presumably triggers replication initiation. There is recent evidence that C. fasciculata UMSBP may be regulated by redox (28Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). UMSBP has five CCHC-type zinc knuckles, and it can be oligomerized by oxidation of cysteines in the zinc knuckles to form inactive disulfide-linked multimers. Reduction of the multimer cleaves the disulfide bridge, allows regeneration of the zinc knuckles, and converts UMSBP into an active monomeric protein that binds the replication origin (28Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Whereas C. fasciculata probably has only a single species of UMSBP, T. brucei has two isoforms, one with 5 zinc knuckles (15 kDa) and one with 7 (21 kDa). The T. brucei isoforms share 60% identity over their five shared zinc knuckles, and each is ∼38% identical to the C. fasciculata ortholog. It is not known why T. brucei apparently has two UMSBPs. To test whether CBRL overexpression affects the oxidation state of UMSBP, we used a Western blot to analyze the oligomerization status of UMSBP in uninduced cells and cells overexpressing CBRL. We fractionated the proteins by non-reducing or reducing SDS-PAGE and detected the T. brucei UMSBP species with an antibody against C. fasciculata UMSBP. Under non-reducing conditions, we detected the two UMSBP isoforms in both wild-type and uninduced cells (Fig. 7, left panel, marked by single and double asterisks). However, upon CBRL overexpression for 3 days, there was a decrease of both isoforms of monomeric UMSBP and the appearance of species with higher molecular masses (see proteins at 60 and 80 kDa and the smear just below the slot), which likely represent oligomerized UMSBP (lane I in Fig. 7, left panel). The appearance of oligomerized UMSBP was reproducible and could be detected as early as 1 day after CBRL overexpression. Under reducing conditions, UMSBP is mostly monomeric in wild-type, uninduced, and induced cells indicating that oligomerization is mediated by disulfide bonds (Fig. 7, right panel). The proteins at ∼60 and ∼80 kDa in the reducing gel (also observed in a similar experiment in Fig. 8) could be either cross-reacting proteins or UMSBP species that are not subject to reduction. In control experiments, we found using Western blots that three other mitochondrial zinc finger-containing proteins (the RNA-editing proteins band II/TbMP81, band III/TbMP63, and band VI/TbMP52 (21Rusche L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4069-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar)) did not oligomerize when CBRL was overexpressed (data not shown). Below we address the question of how CBRL overexpression affects the redox state of UMSBP.FIGURE 8Effect of overexpression of mitochondrial tryparedoxin peroxidase on kDNA and UMSBP. A, cells were induced to overexpress tryparedoxin peroxidase for 3 days and stained with DAPI. kDNA size indicated as in Fig. 4A. B, Western blot of total protein in cells uninduced (day 0) or induced (days 1 and 3) to overexpress tryparedoxin peroxidase. Proteins were fractionated by non-reducing (left panel) or reducing (right panel) SDS-PAGE, and blotted for UMSBP as in Fig. 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Does Loss of Reduced Tryparedoxin Mediate UMSBP Oligomerization?—We next considered the possibility that the link between overexpression of CBRL and UMSBP oligomerization could be the redox protein tryparedoxin. In an in vitro reaction, reduced tryparedoxin can convert oligomeric and inactive UMSBP into an active monomeric form that binds the minicircle replication origin (28Onn I. Milman-Shtepel N. Shlomai J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CBRL might deplete reduced tryparedoxin, allowing the oxidation of UMSBP. Tryparedoxin is in the thioredoxin superfamily. It is maintained in its reduced state by trypanothione (N1, N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), the major low molecular weight reductant in trypanosomes. There is both a cytosolic form of tryparedoxin and a second form postulated to be mitochondrial (29Wilkinson S.R. Horn D. Prathalingam S.R. Kelly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31640-31646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Unlike cytosolic tryparedoxin, the putative mitochondrial tryparedoxin has a hydrophobic sequence (as determined by a hydropathy plot) that could anchor it to the mitochondrial membrane where it might interact with and be oxidized by CBRL.

The molecular basis for the hearing loss is unknown. We have engineered each γ-actin mutation into yeast actin to investigate the effects of these mutations on actin function in vivo and in vitro. Cells expressing each of the mutant actins as the sole actin in the cell were viable. Four of the six mutant strains exhibited significant growth deficiencies in complete medium and an inability to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon source, implying a mitochondrial defect(s). These four strains exhibited abnormal mitochondrial morphology, although the mtDNA was retained. All of the mutant cells exhibited an abnormally high percentage of fragmented/non-polarized actin cables or randomly distributed actin patches. Five of the six mutants displayed strain-specific vacuole morphological abnormalities. Two of the purified mutant actins exhibited decreased thermal stability and increased rates of nucleotide exchange, indicative of increased protein flexibility. V370A actin alone polymerized abnormally. It aggregated in low ionic strength buffer and polymerized faster than wild-type actin, probably in part because of enhanced nucleation. Mixtures of wild-type and V370A actins displayed kinetic properties in proportion to the mole fraction of each actin in the mixture. No dominant effect of the mutant actin was observed. Our results suggest that a major factor in the deafness caused by these mutations is an altered ability of the actin filaments to be properly regulated by actin-binding proteins rather than an inability to polymerize.

Our results suggest that a major factor in the deafness caused by these mutations is an altered ability of the actin filaments to be properly regulated by actin-binding proteins rather than an inability to polymerize. Hearing depends on sound-dependent distortion of specialized mechanosensory hair cells within the cochlea of the inner ear. In these cells, staircase arrangements of 20–300 hair-like receptors called stereocilia protrude from the apical surface. Mechanical deflection of these structures results in the opening of gated ion channels located on the surface of these protrusions. The result is the conversion of sound-dependent distortion into the propagation of neural signals that are relayed to the brain (1.Hudspeth A.J. Nature. 1989; 341: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Hair cell function is contingent upon proper functioning of the actin cytoskeleton. Each mature stereocilium contains a core of actin filaments closely packed into rigid hexagonal bundles cross-linked by several actin-binding proteins (2.Tilney L.G. Egelman E.H. DeRosier D.J. Saunder J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 822-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These filaments not only regulate the three-dimensional aspects of the stereocilia such as height and diameter, but also provide the rigidity necessary for proper functioning of the stereocilium. The stereocilia are embedded in a dense gel-like meshwork of actin filaments with random polarity called the cuticular plate (3.DeRosier D.J. Tilney L.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2853-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This structure provides a base in which the stereocilia are anchored and assists in maintaining their erect positions. Encircling each hair cell near its apical surface is the zonula adherens, a circumferential belt of actin filaments that runs parallel to the plasma membrane (4.Hirokawa N. Tilney L.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These rings form focal contacts with neighboring supporting cells and provide tension across the apical hair cell surface, stabilizing the cuticular plate. Structural integrity and proper function of the cytoskeletal complex depend on the interplay between actin filaments and a number of actin-binding proteins to stabilize the stereocilium, to control its length, and to help organize the cuticular plate. Examples of a few of these actin-binding proteins include spectrin, fimbrin, espin, tropomyosin, harmonin, and formin (5.Muller U. Littlewood-Evans A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 334-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Additionally, seven different myosins are involved with these structures (MYO1A, MYO3A, MYO6, MYO7A, MYO9, MYO14, and MYO15), and in humans, genetic mutations in all of these myosins cause deafness (6.Weil D.

These myosins have the potential to cross-link adjacent filaments, to carry protein cargoes up and down the stereocilium, to organize actin, and to generate tension within these structures. However, the functions of these myosins in the hair cell are only partially elucidated at this time. The actin isoform distribution in the hair cells is unusual. Both non-muscle β- and γ-actins are found, but unlike the case for most non-muscle cells, the γ-isoform is the predominant isoform by an ∼2:1 margin (17.Furness D.N. Katori Y. Mahendrasingam S. Hackney C.M. Hear. Res. 2005; 207: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18.Hofer D. Ness W. Drenckhahn D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 765-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary sequence of these two isoforms differs at only four amino acid positions. The most striking difference between these two actin isoforms is at the N terminus of the protein, where β-actin contains three aspartate residues, and γ-actin contains three glutamate residues (19.Vandekerckhove J. Weber K. Arch. Int. Physiol. Biochim. 1978; 86: 891-892PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of these isoforms is also nonrandom. γ-Actin is found throughout the hair cell (17.Furness D.N. Katori Y. Mahendrasingam S. Hackney C.M. Hear. Res. 2005; 207: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18.Hofer D. Ness W. Drenckhahn D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 765-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is a divergence of opinion concerning the localization of β-actin. Hofer et al. (18.Hofer D. Ness W. Drenckhahn D. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 765-770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) argued that β-actin is confined to the stereocilium, whereas Furness et al. (17.Furness D.N. Katori Y. Mahendrasingam S. Hackney C.M. Hear. Res. 2005; 207: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported that β-actin is found in both the cuticular plate (∼30%) and the stereocilium (∼15%). It was recently discovered that six point mutations in the non-muscle γ-actin gene cause hearing loss (20.Zhu M. Yang T. Wei S. DeWan A.T. Morell R.J. Elfenbein J.L. Fisher R.A. Leal S.M. Smith R.J.

These mutations are autosomal dominant; one normal and one mutant γ-actin gene are expressed inside the cell. These mutations are T89I, K118M, P264L, T278I, P332A, and V370A, and in each case, the chemical nature of the mutated residue is very different from that of the residue originally present. All are located in subdomains 1 and 3 of actin, as shown in Fig. 1. Two of these (P332A and P264L) fall near the adenine-binding site on the actin and might affect actin monomer dynamics. Four of these (K118M, T278I, P332A, and V370A) are located near the barbed end of the monomer. The actin filament is a polar structure with a “barbed” end and a “pointed” end, and the monomer barbed end, consisting of subdomains 1 and 3, would be located at the barbed end of the filament (23.Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). The filament barbed end is the preferred site for monomer addition during filament elongation. It participates in monomer-monomer contacts longitudinally along the actin helix, and it is the region at which a number of proteins that regulate actin polymerization in the cell exert their control. Patients with these mutations begin noticing hearing loss in their early teens to late twenties depending on the mutation. Hearing loss begins with high frequency sounds and progresses to loss of low frequency sounds, with overall hearing decreasing as the patient ages. Understanding the effects of these mutations at the molecular level in the context of the hair cell is hampered by the small size of the organ involved and the inability to obtain samples of the structures from the patients for biochemical studies. Even if one were to introduce the mutations into model animals and to establish cultured hair cell preparations, the amount of material available for biochemical analysis would be limited. Additionally, within the hair cell, based on the known isoactin content, the mutant actin would likely not account for more than about one-third of the total actin in the cell. This would make it even more difficult to directly assess the effects of the mutations on actin function. An attractive model system for studying these mutant actins is the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast actin is 91% identical to non-muscle γ-actin, and it is encoded by a single gene, ACT1 (24.Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). More important, all six of the residues at which the deafness mutations occur in γ-actin are identical in yeast actin. Many of the actin-binding proteins present in mammalian cells are also found in yeast (25.Drubin D.G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 15: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26.Bretscher A. Drees B. Harsay E. Schott D. Wang T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and yeast actin will interact with many of the mammalian isoforms of these actin-binding proteins (27.Chen W. Wen K.-K. Sens A.E. Rubenstein P.A. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1308-1318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 28.Wen K.-K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol.

Novick P. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4889-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The effects of these mutations on actin function within the yeast cell can be assessed by a number of cytological assays (30.McKane M. Wen K.-K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The actins can then be purified and analyzed biochemically to determine the effects each mutation has on actin function in vitro. Finally, one can try to correlate the effects observed in vitro with the altered actin function in vivo. We have used such a system repeatedly to study actin structure-function relationships to delineate the effects a mutation has on the ability of the actin to polymerize, to interact with actin-binding proteins, and to activate myosin, leading to the generation of contractile force (27.Chen W.

In this study, we cloned each of the deafness alleles into yeast actin and isolated cells expressing each of these mutant actins as the sole actin in the cell. We then assessed the effects of these deafness mutations on cell behavior and their effects on actin monomer stability and polymerizability in vitro using purified proteins. Materials—DNase I (grade D) was purchased from Worthington. DE52 DEAE-cellulose was obtained from Whatman. Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Tris columns and Affi-Gel 10-activated resin were purchased from Bio-Rad. ATP was from Sigma. 1,N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate (ϵ-ATP), rhodamine-phalloidin, FM 4-64, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Molecular Probes. The QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene, and oligodeoxynucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Yeast cakes for WT actin preparations were purchased from a local bakery. All other chemicals were reagent-grade quality. Construction of Mutant Yeast Strains and Determination of Growth Characteristics—Mutations were introduced into the centromeric plasmid pRS314 (36.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing the yeast actin coding sequence driven by the ACT1 promoter using the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids containing the desired mutations were introduced into a recipient yeast strain containing a deleted chromosomal ACT1 gene and a plasmid expressing WT actin (pCENWT) as described previously (37.Cook R.K. Sheff D.R. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid shuffling yielded viable haploid strains for each of the mutations. The plasmids containing the mutant constructs were re-isolated from these strains and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation. The ability to grow in complete liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) was determined by diluting an overnight culture of each mutant strain into fresh medium at an initial A600 of 0.1 and following growth at 30 °C with agitation. Growth was assessed until the cultures had reached stationary phase. Temperature-sensitive growth was assessed by plating four serial 10-fold dilutions of the cultures on YPD plates, followed by incubation at 24, 30, or 37 °C. Colony size was assessed as a function of time. The ability to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon source was assessed in a similar fashion, except that the cells were plated on YPG medium (YPD medium with the dextrose replaced with 2% glycerol), and the plates were then incubated at 30 °C. Cytology—For observance of cell structures, images were collected with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture objective lens and a Spot RT cooled CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Camera control and image enhancement were performed using MetaMorph Version 4.5 software (Universal Image Corp., Downingtown, PA). Presentation of cell images was done using Adobe Photoshop. All cellular statistical analysis was based on cell counts of >100 for each sample. Mitochondria in living cells were visualized using a fusion protein in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to the mitochondrial signal sequence of citrate synthase. The construct used for expression of this protein was kindly provided by Dr. Liza A. Pon (38.Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells expressing the plasmid were grown to an A600 of 0.3–0.5 in Ura– synthetic medium to force retention of the URA3-marked plasmid in the otherwise Ura3– cells. An aliquot of cells was resuspended in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and the cells were then observed by fluorescence microscopy as described above. For mitochondria, ∼40 z-sections were obtained at 0.15-μm intervals through the entire cell. Out-of-focus light was removed by deconvolution using MetaMorph software, and each series of deconvolved images was further rendered with NIH Image J. The actin cytoskeleton was visualized by fluorescence microscopy after staining fixed cells with rhodamine-phalloidin as described previously (30.McKane M. Wen K.-K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Vacuoles were observed following exposure of the cells to the dye FM 4-64 as described previously (39.Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Samples were visualized by fluorescence microscopy as described above. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs were visualized following staining of the cells with DAPI as described previously (30.McKane M. Wen K.-K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To measure cell size, mounted samples were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy. The long axis of the cell was measured using Image J. The average length for each strain was complied from measuring >100 cells for each sample. Actin Biochemistry—WT and mutant actins were purified from lysates of frozen cells using a combination of DNase I-agarose affinity chromatography, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and polymerization/depolymerization cycling as described previously (40.Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quality of the preparations was assessed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining of the gels. The concentration of G-actin was determined from the absorbance at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 ml·mg–1·cm–1. All actins were used within 4 days following completion of purification. Actin was polymerized by the addition of 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl to a G-actin sample in a total volume of 120 μl. Polymerization was monitored at 25 °C by following the increase in light scattering of the sample in a thermostatted microcuvette in a FluoroMax-3 fluorescence spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.). All polymerization experiments were performed at least three times with different actin preparations. Dynamic light scattering measurements of the G-actin samples of V370A and WT actins were performed at several different concentrations ranging from ∼0.25 to 10 μm at 25 °C using a DynaPro dynamic light scattering instrument containing a temperature-controlled microsampler (Protein Solutions, Inc.). Determination of the particle size for each sample was calculated using Dynamic Version 5.26.38 (included with the instrument), and the average particle size at each concentration was based upon measuring three independent samples. The apparent melting temperatures of WT and mutant actins were determined using circular dichroism by following the change in ellipticity of the G-actin sample at 222 nm as a function of temperature between 25 and 90 °C as described previously (35.Yao X. Nguyen V. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Measurements were made on an Aviv 62 DS spectropolarimeter. Data were fit to a two-state model, and the apparent Tm value was determined by fitting the data to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation to approximate the temperature at which 50% of the actin was denatured. The ability of G-actin to exchange its bound nucleotide was assessed by first loading the actin with ϵ-ATP and following its displacement from the actin in the presence of a large excess of ATP as described previously (35.Yao X. Nguyen V. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Exchange rates were determined by fitting the data to a single exponential expression using BioKine Version 3.1. To visualize actin filaments, samples of 2.4 μm F-actin were deposited onto carbon-coated Formvar grids, negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate, and observed with a JOEL 1230 transmission electron microscope (University of Iowa Central Electron Microscopy Facility). Lengths of individual filaments for WT and V370A actins were measured using Image J. Effect of Mutations on the Rate and Extent of Cell Growth—We first examined the cells for global effects of the mutations on cell behavior by assessing their ability to grow on YPD plates at different temperatures. All six strains were temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C (data not shown). We then examined more quantitatively their ability to grow in complete YPD medium at 30 °C. The results revealed that the mutations group themselves into two different growth categories (Fig. 2). Cells carrying the T89I and P264L mutations grew slower than WT cells and to a final density of ∼70% that achieved by WT cells. The second group, consisting of K118M, T278I, P332A, and V370A, exhibited significantly slower rates of logarithmic growth and leveled off at a density of ∼30% that of WT cells. One possible reason for decreased growth of this magnitude is a disruption of proper mitochondrial function caused by the mutation. Yeast requires actin for mitochondrial inheritance, maintenance of mitochondrial morphology (38.Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Gay A.C. Huckaba T.M. Pon L.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1996-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41.Boldogh I.R. Fehrenbacher K.L. Yang H.C. Pon L.A.

Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 333-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and stabilization of mtDNA. A single actin mutation (H372R) we recently studied disrupts all three of these processes (30.McKane M. Wen K.-K. Boldogh I.R. Ramcharan S. Pon L.A. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36494-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial function may be easily assessed by examining the ability of the cells to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon source. A mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is required for conversion of glycerol 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which can then be further metabolized by glycolysis. Mitochondrial defects often result in elimination of this activity. Fig. 3 shows that, although cells carrying the T89I and P264L mutations grew on glycerol, those carrying the four remaining mutations (K118M, T278I, P332A, and V370A), which exhibited the most severe growth retardation in complete medium, could not. Effect of the Mutations on Actin Cytoskeletal Patterns and Mitochondrial Morphology—Mitochondrial inheritance requires the movement of these organelles from the mother cell to the bud along polarized actin cables running between these cells. The current theory for mitochondrial movement is that anterograde movement is Arp2/3 complex-mediated, whereas the myosin Myo2p is necessary for retention of the organelle in the bud (42.Simon V.R. Karmon S.L. Pon L.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 44.Simon V.R. Swayne T.C. Pon L.A. J.

A properly polarized actin cytoskeleton is also necessary for control of the fission/fusion events that regulate mitochondrial morphology (42.Simon V.R. Karmon S.L. Pon L.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Besides actin cables, actin patches (a second form of polymerized actin) are also observed. These are sites of endocytosis (47.Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 287-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and their distribution is cell cycle-dependent. At early stages following initial enlargement of the bud, the patches are confined almost entirely to the growing bud, whereas at later times, the patches are evenly distributed between the bud and mother cell (48.Amberg D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3259-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by actin mutations may lead to depolarized isotropic growth of the cell, resulting in larger and rounder cells. Decreased cell size is often observed in mitochondrion-deficient strains, reflecting their inability to generate enough energy to support optimal growth."

We show here that TGFβ treatment increased transcriptional activation of SM22α, a smooth muscle-specific promoter, in airway smooth muscle cells, and we demonstrate that this effect stems in part from TGFβ-induced enhancement of serum response factor (SRF) DNA binding and transcription promoting activity. Overexpression of Smad7 inhibited TGFβ-induced stimulation of SRF-dependent promoter function, and chromatin immunoprecipitation as well as co-immunoprecipitation assays established that endogenous or recombinant SRF interacts with Smad7 within the nucleus. The SRF binding domain of Smad7 mapped to the C-terminal half of the Smad7 molecule. TGFβ treatment weakened Smad7 association with SRF, and conversely the Smad7-SRF interaction was increased by inhibition of the TGFβ pathway through overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of TGFβ receptor I or of Smad3 phosphorylation-deficient mutant. Our findings thus reveal that SRF-Smad7 interactions in part mediate TGFβ regulation of gene transcription in airway smooth muscle. This offers potential targets for interventions in treating lung inflammation and asthma.

Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) that includes gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation (2.Moustakas A. Pardali K. Gaal A. Heldin C.-H. Immunology Lett. 2002; 82: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), apoptosis (3.Schuster N. Krieglstein K. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and migration (4.Holgate S. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2000; 30: 37-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (5.Bartram U. Speer C.P. Chest. 2004; 125: 754-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To accomplish these diverse effects, TGFβ binds to two unique cell surface receptors, designated TGFβ type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII), which are present in almost every cell type and are directly involved in signal transduction through their serine/threonine kinase activities (6.Franzen P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Binding of TGFβ to TβRII induces phosphorylation and activation of TβRI, which in turn phosphorylates Smad proteins, the major transducers of TGFβ signals (7.Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated at their C terminus (the MH2 domain), these receptor-activated Smads or “R-Smads” (Smad2 and Smad3) associate with the common mediator Smad4 (“Co-Smad”); R-Smad-Co-Smad complexes then translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to regulatory regions of target genes (at the Smad-binding element (SBE)) and interact with other transcription factors, co-activators, and co-repressors to regulate expression of TGFβ-responsive genes. In several cell types, the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7 (“I-Smad”), negatively regulate TGFβ signaling (8.Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.-H. Heldin N.-E. ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). After TGFβ stimulation, Smad7 translocates to the plasma membrane where it binds to TβRI and inhibits further signaling. Two mechanisms of suppression of TGFβ signaling involving Smad7 are presently known, and both occur outside the nucleus. (i) Smad7 is able to interfere with the association between the R-Smads and activated receptors (9.Hanyu A. Ishidou Y. Ebisawa T. Shimanuki T. Imamura T. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 10.Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). (ii) A complex containing Smad7 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 or Smurf2 translocates to the plasma membrane and induces ubiquitination and consequent degradation of TGFβ receptors (10.Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1365-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Several genes with expression restricted to the smooth muscle (SM) lineages have been identified (11.Solway J. Forsythe S.M. Halayko A.J. Vieira J.E. Hershenson M.B. Camoretti-Mercado B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: S100-S108Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and many of them are responsive to TGFβ (12.Parmacek M. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2001; 51: 69-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, TGFβ induces expression of α-sm-actin, an abundant SM protein whose transcriptional regulation is under at least partial control of a TGFβ control element (TCE) located within the promoter region (13.Hautmann M.B. Madsen C.S. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10948-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A similar TCE, to which Kruppel-like transcription factors bind (14.Adam P.J. Christopher R. Hautmann M.B. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37798-37806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), is required for in vivo expression of SM22α, one of the earliest and most widely expressed smooth muscle cell markers identified (11.Solway J. Forsythe S.M. Halayko A.J. Vieira J.E. Hershenson M.B. Camoretti-Mercado B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: S100-S108Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, TGFβ was reported to up-regulate SM22α expression in fibroblasts through binding of Smad3 to two Smad-binding motifs located within the first exon (15.Qiu P. Feng X.-H. Li L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16.Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, signaling through Smad2 and Smad3 plays an important role in the development of SM cells from totipotent embryonic stem cells (17.Sinha S. Hoofnagle M.H. Kingston P.A. McCanna M.E. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: C1560-C1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Analysis of the regulatory regions of SM-specific genes reveals that the vast majority of them (including SM22α) contain CArG sequences, the binding site for the MADS-box transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) (18.Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Besides its essential role driving SM- and non-SM muscle-specific gene expression, SRF is also critical for regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation (19.Camoretti-Mercado B. Dulin N. Solway J. Respir. Physiol. Neurobiol. 2003; 137: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The transcription promoting activity of SRF is modulated by its subcellular localization (20.Camoretti-Mercado B. Liu H.-W. Halayko A.J. Forsythe S.M. Kyle J.W. Li B. Fu Y. McConville J. Kogut P. Vieira J.E. Patel N.M. Hershenson M.B. Fuchs E. Sinha S. Miano J.M. Parmacek M.S. Burkhardt J.K. Solway J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30387-30393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21.Liu H.W. Halayko A.J. Fernandes D.J. Harmon G.S. McCauley J.A. Kocieniewski P. McConville J. Fu Y. Forsythe S.M. Kogut P. Bellam S. Dowell M. Churchill J. Lesso H. Kassiri K. Mitchell R.W. Hershenson M.B. Camoretti-Mercado B. Solway J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22.Ding W. Gao S. Scott R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1011-1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and through its association with a variety of other transcription factors, activators, and co-repressors (mostly via its MADS domain). Indeed, the competition for binding of various cofactors (e.g. myocardin versus Elk-1) to a common docking site on SRF may underlie the molecular mechanism of SM plasticity, its ability to switch between differentiated and proliferative phenotypes in response to extracellular cues (23.Wang, Z., Wang, D.-Z., Hockemeyer, D., McAnally, J., Nordheim, A., and Olson, E. N. (2004) 428, 185–189Google Scholar). Beyond its influence at the TCE, TGFβ can also promote smooth muscle-specific gene transcription through effects on SRF. First, immunoprecipitation studies show that Smad3 can form complexes with SRF within the nucleus, and such complexes formed on the SM22α promoter (where Smad3 also binds to an SBE in the first exon) appear to enhance SM22α transcription (15.Qiu P. Feng X.-H. Li L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Second, artificial overexpression of inhibitory Smads 6 and 7 partially blocks SRF-VP16-mediated activation of the SM22α promoter (15.Qiu P. Feng X.-H. Li L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), through an undetermined mechanism. Third, TGFβ can stimulate the accumulation of the SRF protein (24.Hautmann M.B. Adam P.J. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2049-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Together, these findings point to SRF as an important mediator of TGFβ effects on smooth muscle-specific gene transcription. Given the importance of TGFβ in asthmatic airway remodeling, and in airway smooth muscle hypertrophy in particular (25.Halayko A.J. Kartha S. Stelmack G.L. McConville J. Tam J. Camoretti-Mercado B. Forsythe S.M. Hershenson M.B. Solway J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we have further explored how TGFβ modulates SRF-dependent gene transcription, by testing the hypothesis that inhibitory Smad7 associates with SRF, thereby reducing its transcription-promoting activity. Our experiments demonstrate for the first time that this association does indeed occur in both myogenic and nonmyogenic cells and that TGFβ stimulation reduces this interaction, thereby restoring the transcription-promoting potential of SRF. Cell Culture—Canine tracheal smooth muscle cells (CTSMC) were grown in 24-well uncoated plastic dishes. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 (1:1) plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All reagents were from Invitrogen. COS and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Plasmids—We used several SRF-dependent reporter plasmids in our studies. In pSM22luc, luciferase expression is driven by bp -445 to +41 of the mouse SM22α gene (26.Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). SME plasmids containing CArG sequence mutations that prevent SRF binding to the 5′-CArG box, the 3′-CArG box, or both sites were described previously (27.Kim S. Ip H. Lu M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The artificial p5xCArGluc (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) contains five identical sites (CCTAATATGG) separated by 4 bases and a minimal TATA box. pSRE.Lluc (gift from Dr. N. Dulin, University of Chicago) contains two identical CArG sites (CCATATTAGG) separated by 23 bases. pSM-MHCluc contains 3.3 kb of 5′-flanking DNA upstream of the human SM-myosin heavy chain gene (28.Forsythe S.M.

Genomics. 1998; 49: 452-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). pSBEx2tkluc, which contains the thymidine kinase promoter plus two copies of the GTCT sequence (Smad/ski-binding site) which confer responsiveness to activated Smad pathway, was provided by Dr. E. Medrano, Baylor College of Medicine. pGREluc is an artificial promoter that harbors a glucocorticoid-responsive element and TATA box (Clontech). In pMSVβgal, the murine sarcoma virus promoter drives β-galactosidase. pCMV5 and the expression plasmids pCMVSmad7-HA and pSmad3(3A)FLAG, which contain serine to alanine mutations in the Smad3 phosphorylation sites, were gifts from Dr. L. Attisano (University of Toronto). Plasmids encoding FLAG tag fused to amino acid residues 2-259 of human Smad7 (FN-FLAG-Smad7) or 206-426 (FC-Smad7-FLAG) were provided by Dr. C-H. Heldin (Uppsala University, Sweden). FLAG-TβRI-DN plasmid, which expresses a kinase domain mutant of TβRI, was a gift from Dr. P. ten Dijke (The Netherlands Cancer Institute). EGFP-SRF fusion proteins were generated by cloning cDNAs encoding full-length or corresponding mutants SRF into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) that encodes enhanced green fluorescent protein. In plasmid EGFP-mNLS-EGFP, amino acids 95 and 96 within the nuclear localization signal 95RRGLKR100 were mutated to EE. In plasmid pEGFP-mDM-SRF amino acid residues 183VLLLV187 within the dimerization domain were replaced with AAAAA. Transfection—To measure the activity of SRE.L, 5xCArG, GRE, and SBE promoters, passage 2 CTSMC of 70-80% confluence in 24-well plates was transiently transfected the day after plating with 0.1 μg of promoter luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.1 μg of pMSVβgal, and 25 ng of expression plasmid DNA mixed with 1.5 μl of Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Liposomes were formed by adding 2 μg of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 4 h of transfection, the liposome suspension was removed, and cells were fed with DMEM/F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum for 5 h. After that, cells were serum-deprived overnight in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) plus antibiotics. The following day, cells were treated with or without TGFβ1 (150 pm, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 8 h in serum-free medium and then harvested. In some cases, canine airway myocytes were long term serum-deprived (4-7 days) and, where indicated, transfected as described previously (20.Camoretti-Mercado B. Liu H.-W. Halayko A.J. Forsythe S.M.

For transfection using SM22α and SME promoter constructs, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and co-transfected the following day with 1.8 μg of indicated luciferase reporter, 600 ng of MSVβgal plasmid, and 100 ng of empty or Smad7 expression vector with 12 μg of Lipofectamine. After 6 h, the medium was changed to DMEM/F-12 plus insulin, transferring selenium mixture as described previously (20.Camoretti-Mercado B. Liu H.-W. Halayko A.J. Forsythe S.M. Kyle J.W. Li B. Fu Y.

In all cases, cells were lysed with M-PER detergent (Pierce) and frozen once, and luciferase activity was measured using a commercially available kit (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase assays were performed as internal control to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. Promoter function was determined as normalized luciferase activity over β-galactosidase activity; TGFβ effect was expressed as a ratio of normalized luciferase activity in TGFβ-treated cells relative to control untreated cells. Results are expressed as average ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate wells, and were analyzed by analysis of variance and Student's t test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA analyses were performed as described (20.Camoretti-Mercado B. Liu H.-W. Halayko A.J.

Probes were end-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to either the 5′-CArG of SM22α promoter (CTGCCCATAAAAGGTTTTTC, SRF-binding site underlined), the SM22α-TCE (TGGAGTGAGTGGGGCGGCCCGG, TGFβ-responsive site underlined), or a PAI-1 probe (TCGAGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAAGGAGCCAGACAC, TGFβ-responsive sites underlined). Between 5 and 20 μg of nuclear protein was used per reaction, in a total volume of 15 μl. For supershift studies, 1 μl (1-2 μg) of antibody was added after the 15-min incubation period, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Eight million HEK293 cells were treated with and without TGFβ for 24 h and cross-linked with formaldehyde. Total lysates were prepared, sonicated, and divided into five tubes for ChIP experiments, using a commercially available kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). One percent lysate was saved to isolate control input DNA. The manufacturer's protocol was followed with two modifications. To reduce nonspecific background, after sonicated lysates were precleaned with salmon sperm DNA/protein G-agarose and incubated with antibody, protein A bound-agarose beads that were previously blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin were added. In addition, immunoprecipitated chromatin was washed twice (with half of the recommended volume each time) with high salt buffer. One μg of total antibody was used per ChIP reaction. Anti-SRF (G-20) and anti-Smad7 (N-19 and H-79 used in equal amounts) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-RNA polymerase II antibody and normal IgG were from the ChIP kit (Upstate). Two percent of purified DNA (1 μl), including saved input control DNA, was used as template for 32 cycles in PCR. Primers pairs employed to amplify the human SM22α promoter that harbors the CArG and TCE were as follows: forward, TCCATCTCCAAAGCATGCAG, and reverse, CCCTCCCTGCTAGAGGAAGC, which map to bp -224 and +18, respectively. For ChIP-positive control reaction, primers that amplify the human GAPDH promoter provided by the Upstate kit were used. Knockdown of Smad7 by siRNA Interference—HEK293 cells were seeded in 24-well plates with antibiotic-free media the day before transfection and used at 80-90% confluence the next day. Four wells were transiently transfected with a mixture that contains 100 ng of pSM22luc, 100 ng of pMSVbgal, 1.5 μl of Plus Reagent, and 1 μl of Lipofectamine in Opti-MEM medium along with siRNA duplex targeting either Smad7 (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Foxm1 (as control, a gift from Dr. V. Kalinichenko, University of Chicago). siRNAs were mixed with RNAiFect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in a 1:6 ratio. In two experiments, a nonsilencing RNA duplex from Qiagen was used as an additional control. After 6 h, cells were fed with complete medium and harvested 54 h later. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in three replicate wells, and total RNA was isolated from the fourth replicate well. The average of normalized luciferase activity in siRNA Samd7-transfected cells was expressed relative to that obtained in control siRNA-transfected cells. Smad7 expression was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR using cDNA prepared from 1 μg of total RNA and a set of commercially available Smad7 primers from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A 521-bp amplicon was seen following the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of Smad7 protein in the same lysates used for luciferase and β-galactosidase measures was analyzed by Western blot using the anti-Smad7 antibody N-19 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and was visualized by ECL from Pierce. siRNA experiments were performed four times with similar results. Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) Assays—Unless indicated otherwise, CTSMC, COS, or HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with Smad7-HA and Myc-SRF expression vectors or their respective empty vector controls along with other members of the TGFβ signaling pathway as indicated, in the presence of Lipofectamine as described above. In studies on regulation of SRF-Smad7 association, cells were treated with TGFβ (4 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/ml), or IL-13 (50 ng/ml) after transfection, as indicated. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors 24 h later using a Pierce kit. Equal amounts of protein from each sample (40-200 μgin 100-μl final volume) were preincubated first with normal IgG-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min on ice with occasional gentle mixing. Supernatants were recovered after centrifugation (30 s at 500 × g) and incubated, unless indicated otherwise, with anti-Myc antibody-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4°C in an orbital platform. Beads were precipitated as above, washed twice, and boiled in SDS loading buffer. Interacting proteins bound to the beads were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal anti-HA antibody unless indicated otherwise. Signal was detected by ECL (Pierce). For experiments using Smad7 mutants, membranes were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). When SRF mutants were employed, extracts were incubated with anti-green fluorescent protein antibody-conjugated beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). TGFβ1 Stimulates Transcriptional Activation of Smooth Muscle-specific Genes in Myocytes from the Airway through an SRF-dependent Pathway—We first tested whether TGFβ affects promoter function of SM-specific genes in myocytes from the airway. Fig. 1A shows that TGFβ treatment enhanced transcription from the SM22α promoter after transient transfection into long term serum-deprived myocytes by 3-9-fold in a dose-dependent manner. Comparable stimulation was observed for the human smooth muscle myosin heavy chain promoter, but not with the viral murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter under the same conditions (data not shown). This indicates that TGFβ action on SM-specific promoters was selective. Transcriptional activation of SM22α promoter was also inducible by TGFβ in subconfluent serum-fed cells, although to a lesser extent, and all three TGFβ isoforms (but not TGFα) increased SM22α promoter activity to a similar degree (Fig. 1B). To delineate the sequence(s) responsible for TGFβ responsiveness, we investigated the potential role of the CArG elements present in the SM22α promoter by inactivating them through site-directed mutagenesis. Point mutations that abolished SRF binding at either the 5′-CArG site at -275 bp or the 3′ CArG site at -150 bp reduced basal SM22α promoter activity (Fig. 1C, left bars) and also decreased the TGFβ-dependent enhancing effect (Fig. 1C, right bars). Moreover, mutation of both SRF-binding sites inhibited even further the TGFβ-induced augmentation of SM22α promoter function. Interestingly, the TGFβ effect was not completely abolished, supporting the notion that an SRF-independent mechanism also operate in airway myocytes. TGFβ Increases SRF-DNA Binding Activity—The mutagenesis studies described above prompted us to investigate whether TGFβ influenced SRF DNA binding activity. To test this, we performed EMSA using nuclear extracts prepared from subconfluent airway smooth muscle cell cultures and a probe containing the SM22α-5′-CArG site (Fig. 2A). Compared with untreated controls, TGFβ exposure increased the intensity of the DNA-protein complex in a time-dependent manner, up to 3 h of treatment. By competition and supershift analyses with anti-SRF antibody (not shown here but see Fig. 5D), we confirmed the presence of SRF within this complex.FIGURE 5Smad7 interacts with SRF. A, COS cells were transiently transfected with either Myc (lanes 1-4) or Myc-SRF (lanes 5-8) expression vectors, and each with Smad7-HA (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) or CMV empty vector (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). NEs were prepared after 24 h, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with beads conjugated with anti-Myc antibody. Proteins bound to beads were resolved on SDS-PAGE, probed with anti-HA antibody. Arrow shows the expected position for Smad7. I, input; P, pulldown. B, NE and CE were prepared from HEK293 or COS cells. Endogenous Smad7 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Smad7 antibody and IgG/IgA-conjugated beads. Bound endogenous SRF was detected by anti-SRF Western blot. Interaction of Smad7 to SRF occurs in the nuclei of both cells (lanes 1 and 5) but not in the cytosol (lanes 3 and 7). In this experiment, SRF expression in COS cells is mostly nuclear. I, input; P, pulldown. C, NE and CE were prepared from HEK293 cells co-transfected with expression vectors encoding Myc-SRF plus either FN-Smad7-FLAG or FC-Smad7-FLAG, as indicated. IPs were performed with anti-Myc antibody beads. Blot was probe with anti-FLAG antibody. SRF was able to pull down FC-Smad7 (lower horizontal arrow) but not FN-Smad7 (upper oblique arrow), indicating that the Smad7 C terminus is involved in binding to SRF. Association of SRF with FC-Smad7 was observed only in the nuclear fraction. Asterisk indicates nonspecific bands. D, EMSA was performed with NE prepared from cells treated with TGFβ1(lanes 2-5) or left untreated (lane 1) and SM22α 5′-CArG probe. Arrows indicate bands that contain SRF, as demonstrated by supershift of these bands with an anti-SRF antibody (lane 2). Anti-Smad7 antibody raised against the C terminus (lane 4) but not the N terminus (lane 3) of Smad7 interferes with SRF-DNA binding. E, SRF association with Smad7 in the nucleus requires the NLS and dimerization domain (DM) of SRF. NE were prepared from HEK293 cells that overexpress 6xmyc-Smad7 plus the indicated EGFP-SRF mutants (see text). SRF fusion proteins were pulled down with anti-GFP green fluorescent protein antibody-conjugated beads. Interacting Smad7 was detected by Western blot using anti-Myc antibody. Mutations within NLS or the dimerization domain (DM) interfere with SRF-Smad7 association. I, input; P, pulldown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We performed ChIP experiments to examine whether there is elevation of binding of endogenous SRF to the CArG sites within the SM22α promoter upon TGFβ stimulation in vivo. Fig. 2B shows that anti-SRF antibody was able to immunoprecipitate cross-linked chromatin that contains DNA sequences harboring the CArG site from the SM22α promoter (lane 1). A stronger binding was observed from cells stimulated with TGFβ (Fig. 2B, lane 2). These results indicate that SRF occupies the CArG site within the chromatin, and SRF binding to DNA is increased upon TGFβ stimulation. Furthermore, Fig. 2B also demonstrates that anti-Smad7 antibody was capable of retrieving chromatin harboring SM22α promoter sequences that possess SRF-binding sites (lane 7). I"
https://openalex.org/W2143750191,"Methyl-directed mismatch repair is a coordinated process that ensures replication fidelity and genome integrity by resolving base pair mismatches and insertion/deletion loops. This post-replicative event involves the activities of several proteins, many of which appear to be regulated by MutL. MutL interacts with and modulates the activities of MutS, MutH, UvrD, and perhaps other proteins. The purified protein catalyzes a slow ATP hydrolysis reaction that is essential for its role in mismatch repair. However, the role of the ATP hydrolysis reaction is not understood. We have begun to address this issue using two point mutants: MutL-E29A, which binds nucleotide but does not catalyze ATP hydrolysis, and MutL-D58A, which does not bind nucleotide. As expected, both mutants failed to complement the loss of MutL in genetic assays. Purified MutL-E29A protein interacted with MutS and stimulated the MutH-catalyzed nicking reaction in a mismatch-dependent manner. Importantly, MutL-E29A stimulated the loading of UvrD on model substrates. In fact, stimulation of UvrD-catalyzed unwinding was more robust with MutL-E29A than the wild-type protein. MutL-D58A, on the other hand, did not interact with MutS, stimulate MutH-catalyzed nicking, or stimulate the loading of UvrD. We conclude that ATP-bound MutL is required for the incision steps associated with mismatch repair and that ATP hydrolysis by MutL is required for a step in the mismatch repair pathway subsequent to the loading of UvrD and may serve to regulate helicase loading."
https://openalex.org/W2052607803,"O-Acetylation is a common decoration on endotoxins derived from many Gram-negative bacterial species, and it has been shown to be instrumental (e.g. in Salmonella typhimurium) in determining the final tertiary structure of the endotoxin and the immunogenicity of the molecule. Structural heterogeneity of endotoxins produced by mucosal pathogens such as Neisseria meningitidis is determined by decorations on the heptose inner core, including O-acetylation of the terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) attached to HepII. In this report, we show that O-acetylation of the meningococcal lipooligosaccharide (LOS) inner core has an important role in determining inner core assembly and immunotype expression. The gene encoding the LOS O-acetyltransferase, lot3, was identified by homology to NodX from Rhizobium leguminosarum. Inactivation of lot3 in strain NMB resulted in the loss of the O-acetyl group located at the C-3 position of the terminal GlcNAc of the LOS inner core. Inactivation of either lot3 or lgtG, which encodes the HepII glucosyltransferase, did not result in the appearance of the O-3-linked phosphoethanolamine (PEA) groups on the LOS inner core. Construction of a double mutant in which both lot3 and lgtG were inactivated resulted in the appearance of O-3-linked PEA groups on the LOS inner core. In conclusion, O-acetylation status of the terminal GlcNAc of the γ-chain of the meningococcal LOS inner core is an important determinant for the appearance or exclusion of the O-3-linked PEA group on the LOS inner core and contributes to LOS structural diversity. O-Acetylation also likely influences resistance to complement-mediated lysis and may be important in LOS conjugate vaccine design.

Examination of carriage and invasive disease isolates by serology indicates that meningococci commonly co-express patterns of LOS immunotypes, with L[1,8], L[3,7,9], and L[2,4] being the most prevalent (3.Jones D.M. Borrow R. Fox A.J. Gray S. Cartwright K.A. Poolman J.T. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 13: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 4.Scholten R.J. Kuipers B. Valkenburg H.A. Dankert J. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. J. Med. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Each LOS immunotype structure has a conserved heptose inner core to which α-, β-, and γ-chains are added (see Fig. 1). The length and composition of the α-chain is based upon the phase-variable expression of lgtA, lgtD, and lgtC (for reviews see Refs. 14.Kahler C.M. Stephens D.S. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 24: 281-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and 15.Jennings M.P. Srikhanta Y.N. Moxon E.R. Kramer M. Poolman J.T. Kuipers B. van der Ley P.

The length and composition of the α- and β-chain extensions from HepI as well as the presence or absence of a γ-chain extension and phosphoethanolamine (PEA) residues on HepII appear to determine immunotype. The presence of the γ-chain extension of α1–3 glucose on HepII, characteristic of L2 and L5 immunotype LOS (Fig. 1), is determined by the phase-variable expression of lgtG (16.Banerjee A. Wang R.

In comparison, the presence or absence of the various PEA groups on the inner core is in part determined by whether or not the isolate carries an intact lpt3 or lpt6 gene (17.Mackinnon F.G. Cox A.D. Plested J.S. Tang C.M. Makepeace K. Coull P.A. Wright J.C. Chalmers R. Hood D.W. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 18.Kahler C.M.

In some meningococcal strains, O-3-linked PEA is attached to HepII by Lpt3 in the absence of LgtG activity, thus producing the L3 immunotype (17.Mackinnon F.G. Cox A.D. Plested J.S. Tang C.M.

However, an O-3-linked PEA was not detected in strain NMB, which expresses L[2,4] immunotype LOS and contains an intact lpt3 (18.Kahler C.M. Datta A. Tzeng Y.L. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S.

Mechanisms that mask these PEA inner core-associated epitopes, such as the co-expression of a long α-chain, or prevention of the expression of PEA groups on the cell surface, such as competition by the glucosyltransferase, LgtG (17.Mackinnon F.G.

Recently, it has become clear that at least some strains of meningococci have the capacity to express all immunotype LOS structures and that complex regulatory networks and structural constraints dictate what pattern of immunotypes are expressed during growth (18.Kahler C.M. Datta A. Tzeng Y.L. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Comparison of the meningococcal LOS inner core structures of different immunotypes reveals that structures without O-3-linked PEA groups are invariably O-acetylated (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that O-acetylation of the terminal LOS inner core N-acetylglucosamine in the presence of a lactoneotetraose α-chain could prevent the enzymatic addition of O-3-linked PEA by Lpt-3 to this substrate. To test this hypothesis, the lipooligosaccharide O-acetyltransferase (lot3) was identified in N. meningitidis strain Z2491 by amino acid homology with a known O-acetyltransferase, from Rhizobium leguminosarum (20.D'Haeze W. Holsters M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 79R-105RCrossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Insertional inactivation of lot3 in N. meningitidis strain NMB confirmed that this locus encoded the lipooligosaccharide O-acetyltransferase. In addition, inactivation of both lot3 and lgtG resulted in the appearance of O-3-linked PEA on the LOS inner core of this strain. Therefore, O-acetylation of the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue of the LOS inner core when expressed in combination with a lactoneotetraose α chain physically prevents the addition of O-3-linked PEA groups to this site by a functional Lpt-3.

Amino acid sequences were aligned either by ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/#) (25.Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4041) Google Scholar) or Blast 2 sequences (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi) (26.Tatusova T.A. Madden T.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 247-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of the Lipooligosaccharide O-Acetyltransferase (lot3) in Strain NMB—The lot3 gene in N. meningitidis strain NMB was inactivated by the incorporation of a lot3::tetM mutagenic cassette. To construct the lot3::tetM cassette, an internal fragment of lot3 (formerly designated NMA2202 in N. meningitidis strain Z2491) was amplified using the primer pair DAP379 (5′-GTCTCGGTCGCCGTAAAGATAGC-3′) and DAP377 (5′-GCAGTAGAGGAACAGTATTACCTCC-3′) (Fig. 2). The resulting 1.5-kb PCR product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated into pHSG576 (27.Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) digested with SmaI to create pJKD2709. The tetM cassette was released from pJKD2401 by EcoRV digestion and ligated to SmaI-digested pJKD2709. Those transformants that were tetracycline- and chloramphenicol-resistant were assessed by colony PCR for the correct insertion of the tetM cassette into pJKD2709 and were designated pJKD2710. To create NMBlot3, pJKD2710 was transformed in N. meningitidis strain NMB using the protocol of Janik et al. (28.Janik A. Juni E. Heym G.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1976; 4: 71-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transformants were identified by resistance to tetracycline. To ensure these transformants contained the lot3::tetM cassette in the correct chromosomal location, the lot3 locus was PCR-amplified with DAP371 (5′-CGATTTGTCGCGGAAAGAAACCG-3′) and DAP372 (5′-GAAGCCAAAGCCAAATTGCTTGAGC-3′), located outside the lot3 open reading frame, and the correct mutants were designated NMBlot3 (JKD5172). To create a meningococcal double mutant containing inactivated lot3 and lgtG, the lgtG::kan cassette was introduced into NMBlot3 by transformation with pCK49 (29.Tzeng Y.L. Datta A. Ambrose K. Lo M. Davies J.K. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Kahler C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35053-35062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), to create the strain designated NMBlot3/lgtG (JKD5173). Isolation of Oligosaccharides—The LOS preparations, prepared as previously described (30.Kahler C.M. Carlson R.W. Rahman M.M. Martin L.E. Stephens D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6677-6684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were washed three times with 9:1 ethanol/water (v/v) mixture to remove contaminating phospholipids. The washed LOS preparations were suspended in water and lyophilized. Samples were then subjected to mild acid hydrolysis in 1% aqueous HOAc (v/v) for 2.5 h at 100 °C with constant stirring. The lipid A precipitate that formed during hydrolysis was collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants containing the released oligosaccharides (OSs) were decanted and lyophilized. The lyophilized OSs were further purified by gel-filtration chromatography using a Bio-Gel P-4 column (120 × 1 cm, Bio-Rad) and water as eluant. Glycosyl Composition and Linkage Analysis of the Oligosaccharides—Glycosyl compositional analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of trimethylsilyl methylglycosides with myoinositol used as an internal standard (31.York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The samples were methanolized with methanolic 1 m HCl at 80 °C for 18 h. The released monosaccharides were dried under a stream of dry air and acetylated with 3:1:1 methanol/pyridine/acetic anhydride (v/v) at 100 °C for 1 h. After cooling, samples were dried-down and trimethylsilylated with Tri-sil reagent (Pierce) for 30 min at 80 °C. The resulting trimethylsilyl derivatives were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on a Hewlett-Packard HP5890/HP5970 MSD gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer equipped with a Supelco DB-1 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter) with helium as the carrier gas. Linkage analyses were carried out by the slurry NaOH method modified from that of Ciucanu and Kerek (32.Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). Samples were dissolved in 0.5 ml of Me2SO by stirring overnight at room temperature under an N2 atmosphere. After dissolution, a freshly prepared slurry of NaOH in Me2SO was added (0.5 ml), and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Methylation was performed by the sequential addition of iodomethane (250 ml followed by 100 ml) at 30-min intervals. The permethylated monosaccharide was extracted into the organic phase (dichloromethane) after partitioning the reaction mixture between water and dichloromethane. The organic phase was then removed by evaporation under a stream of N2. The permethylated OS was further purified using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge to remove any remaining Me2SO. The permethylated OS was hydrolyzed with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (100 °C, 6 h), reduced with NaBH4, and acetylated, and the resulting partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using an SPB capillary column (25 m × 0.25 mm, from Supelco) and DB-1 capillary column. Mass Spectrometry—Oligosaccharides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer instrument (Applied Biosystems) in reflectron mode. The OS samples were dissolved in water (1 mg/ml) and mixed in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio with 0.5 m 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in methanol matrix solution. Spectra were acquired in both the positive and negative acquisition modes. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were collected on Varian Inova500 and 600 spectrometers using standard software supplied by Varian. The samples were exchanged several times with D2O (99.8% Aldrich), and final measurements were made in 0.5-ml D2O solutions (100% D, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) at 25 °C. Proton NMR spectra were measured at 600 MHz using spectral width of 8 kHz, and the data were processed with HOD signal referenced at 4.78 ppm on proton scale. The correlated spectroscopy (gCOSY) spectra were measured over a spectral width of 2.25 kHz using a dataset of (t1× t2)of256 × 2048 points with 16 scans. The total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) spectra were collected using the same sized data set with 32 scans with a mixing time of 80 ms. For the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment, the spectral widths in the proton and carbon dimensions were 2.2 and 13.9 kHz, respectively, and 96 scans were acquired. One-dimensional 31P NMR spectra were done at pH 7.0 using a Varian Inova500 instrument with a broadband probe adjusted to 202.38 MHz. Proton-decoupled 31P spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 10 kHz calibrated with phosphoric acid (85%) as the external standard (δp = 0.0 ppm). The two-dimensional proton-detected 1H-31P heteronuclear multiple bond quantum coherence (HMQC) and HMQC-TOCSY experiments were performed using the standard pulse sequence supplied by Varian. The HMQC spectrum was collected using a data set of 128 × 2048 (t1 × t2) points with a total of 32 scans. The measurements of HMQC and HMQC-TOCSY spectra were done using a JH,P coupling value of 12.0 Hz. The mixing time used for HMQC-TOCSY spectrum was 60 ms, and a total of 64 scans was collected. The spectral widths in 31P-1H HMQC and HMQC-TOCSY experiments were set to 5 kHz in the phosphorus dimension and 2.25 kHz in the proton dimension, respectively. Identification of the Lipooligosaccharide C-3 O-Acetyl Transferase Gene (lot3) in N. meningitidis Strain NMB—Meningococcal LOS immunotypes L2 and L4 are O-acetylated at the C-3 position of the non-reducing terminal α-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) (11.Kogan G. Uhrin D. Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 298: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). R. leguminosarum biovar viciae expresses lipooligosaccharide nodulation factors containing oligomers of four to five β1–4-linked GlcNAc residues with the reducing-end GlcNAc O-acetylated by NodX at the C-6 position (33.Firmin J.L. Wilson K.E. Carlson R.W. Davies A.E. Downie J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A BlastP search of the complete peptide databases of N. meningitidis strain MC58 and strain Z2491 using the amino acid sequence of NodX from R. leguminosarum biovar viviae strain TOM (34.Davis E.O. Evans I.J. Johnston A.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 212: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) revealed two potential candidate LOS O-acetyltransferases (Fig. 2). NMA0619 encodes a 622-amino acid peptide with 30% identity over the first 191 amino acids of NodX. However, the corresponding open reading frame in N. meningitidis strain MC58, NMB1836, is intact, and has recently been shown to encode an acyltransferase (PglI) required for the biosynthesis of the basal 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose residue of the pilin-linked glycan (35.Warren M.J. Roddam L.F. Power P.M. Terry T.D. Jennings M.P. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 41: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The second candidate, NMA2202, was present as an intact open reading frame in strain Z2491, which expresses an L9 LOS (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/N_meningitidis/seroA/strain.shtml) and had 30% amino acid identity over the first 154 amino acids of NodX. In strain MC58, the open reading frame corresponding to NMA2202, NMB2032, contains a 6-bp poly-G tract, which causes a translational frameshift. To further determine whether there was a relationship between an intact NMA2202 open reading frame and O-acetylation of LOS, we examined the locus in strain NMB, which expresses an L2 LOS (36.Rahman M.M. Stephens D.S. Kahler C.M. Glushka J. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like strain Z2491, strain NMB contained an intact NMA2202 open reading frame containing a 5-bp poly-G tract (data not shown). NMA2202 Encodes the Lipooligosaccharide O-Acetyltransferase (Lot3)—A mutant in which NMA2202 of strain NMB was insertionally inactivated by a tetM antibiotic resistance cassette was constructed and designated NMBlot3 (see “Methods and Materials”). LOS was extracted and the OSs were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” Purification of the OSs by gel-filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel P2 resulted in one major and two minor OS peaks from NMBlot3. Glycosyl composition and linkage analysis of the major OS from NMBlot3 showed the glycosyl residues and linkages expected from the published NMB LOS structure (36.Rahman M.M. Stephens D.S. Kahler C.M. Glushka J. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); namely, terminally linked glucose (Glc), terminally linked galactose (Gal), terminally linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), 4-linked Glc, 3-linked Gal, 4-linked GlcNAc, and 3,4-linked heptosyl (Hep) I. The HepII residue was not observed, because phosphorylated residues are not detected in the method used and HepII is the location of the phosphoethanolamine (PEA) groups. The minor OSs from NMBlot3 were also analyzed by glycosyl composition analysis and mass spectrometry. The results showed that the minor OSs consisted of glycinylated versions of the major OS structure (i.e. the ion masses were 57 mass units greater than those of the major OS), as well as the presence of detectable amounts of sialic acid monosaccharide that was presumably released from the α-chain during mild acid hydrolysis. The major OSs from the LOSs of NMB, and NMBlot3 were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and the resulting spectra are shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), respectively. The molecular ions observed for the OS from NMBlot3 (m/z 1804, 1822, 1826, 1844, and 1866 (Fig. 3B)) are all consistent with sodiated and anhydro-sodiated forms of a single oligosaccharide structure. These masses are 42 mass units less than the corresponding ion masses for the OS from NMB (Fig. 3A). This result is consistent with the NMBlot3 LOS having a structure that is the same as reported for NMB LOS (36.Rahman M.M. Stephens D.S. Kahler C.M. Glushka J. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with the notable exception that the NMBlot3 OS lacks an acetyl group. Previous work on the NMB LOS had reported that the OS was acetylated at O-6 of the GlcNAc residue terminally linked to O-2 of HepII (36.Rahman M.M. Stephens D.S. Kahler C.M. Glushka J. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on comparison of one-dimensional TOCSY NMR spectra of the NMB OS taken before and after hydrogen fluoride treatment, which removes PEA as well as the O-acetyl group from the OS. This work on the NMBlot3 LOS required that we re-examine the location of this O-acetyl group in the NMB LOS, as well as confirm its absence in the NMBlot3 LOS. This was accomplished by examining the OS from NMB and from NMBlot3 by gradient correlation spectroscopy (gCOSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and gradient heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (gHSQC). From these experiments, it was possible to make assignments for the majority of the protons for both the NMB OS (Table 1) and the NMBlot3 OS (Table 2). Comparison of the assignments for these OSs showed that the α-GlcNAc proton resonances for the NMB OS were quite different from those for the NMBlot3 OS. In particular, the H3 of this α-GlcNAc residue in NMB OS resonates at d 5.17, which is considerably downfield from the H3 resonance of this residue in NMBlot3 OS, which resonates at d 3.85. This downfield shift is consistent with O-acetylation at this position in NMB OS and a lack of this acetylation in the NMBlot3 OS. A TOCSY spectrum of the NMB OS showing the coupling of the H1 (d 5.28), H2 (d 4.19), H3 (d 5.17), and H4 (d 3.68) protons of the α-GlcNAc residue is given in Fig. 4.TABLE 1Proton chemical shift values for the OS from NMB LOS (partial assignment)ResidueH1H2H3H4H5H6a,bH7a,bα-dl-HepII (A)5.774.254.234.173.764.573.83, 3.90α-d-Glc (B)5.433.63.723.48NDaND, not detected.NDNDα-d-GlcNAc (C)5.284.195.17bIndicates the position of the O-acetyl group.3.68NDNDNDα-dl-HepI (D)5.094.184.164.08NDNDNDβ-d-GlcNAc (E)4.723.813.743.59NDNDNDβ-d-Glc (F)4.563.443.643.56NDNDNDβ-d-Gal (G)4.483.553.673.93NDNDNDβ-d-Gal (H)4.433.593.754.16NDNDNDa ND, not detected.b Indicates the position of the O-acetyl group.

https://openalex.org/W2081217640,"The synthesis of nitric oxide by inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) plays an important role in the innate immune response by promoting microbial killing and cell damage. In response to inflammatory cytokines and bacterial products, the human iNOS (hiNOS) gene undergoes rapid transcriptional activation via binding of stimulatory transcription factors (<i>e.g.</i> AP-1 and NF-κB) to its 5 ′-flanking region. However, maximal hiNOS promoter induction was suppressed via an unknown phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism. We hypothesized that inhibition of the transcription factor FKHRL1 by the PI3K/protein kinase B pathway attenuates hiNOS promoter induction by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma (LPS/IFN-γ). Human lung epithelial adenocarcinoma (A549) cells were transiently transfected with an 8.3-kb hiNOS promoter luciferase reporter construct. Co-expression of dominant-negative protein kinase B potentiated LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated hiNOS promoter activity. In response to LPS/IFN-γ, FKHRL1 was phosphorylated in a PI3K- and time-dependent fashion. Co-expression of constitutively active FKHRL1 increased hiNOS promoter activity and mRNA levels. Dominant-negative siRNA expression showed that FKHRL1 was necessary for the inhibitory effects of PI3K on hiNOS induction. The same effect was observed upon mutation of a consensus FKHRL1-binding site in the hiNOS promoter. By gel-shift analysis, the corresponding oligonucleotide probe bound endogenous FKHRL1 in an LPS/IFN-γ- and PI3K-sensitive fashion. Regulation of the hiNOS promoter by FKHRL1 represents a potentially important molecular mechanism by which the PI3K pathway might suppress pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic responses to cytokines and bacterial products."

Efforts to further develop specific inhibitors of microbial SAICAR synthetases would benefit from a basic understanding of structure-function relations; however, for SAICAR synthetase such information is lacking. To this end, we report the structures of the ADP and ADP·CAIR complexes of E. coli SAICAR synthetase (hereafter, eSS). The latter complex is the first structure of a CAIR-bound SAICAR synthetase and reveals a previously unsuspected requirement for Mg2+ in the recognition of CAIR by the synthetase. The CAIR·ADP complex is consistent with a chemical mechanism composed of two partial reactions, a phosphoryl transfer from ATP and a nucleophilic attack by l-aspartate, but the relative order of the two reactions is unclear. Moreover, the conformation of eSS differs significantly from that of ligand-free SAICAR synthetase from T. maritima in the region of the CAIR binding site, suggesting the possibility of substrate-induced conformational changes in microbial synthetases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—ATP, l-aspartate, NADH, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma. CAIR was synthesized as described previously (4Nelson S.W. Binkowski D.J. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). E. coli strain BL21(DE3) came from Invitrogen.Enzyme Preparation—Selenomethionine substitution in eSS employed the inhibition of methionine biosynthesis coupled with selenomethionine supplementation (16Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with a pET 28b vector containing the eSS insert with an N-terminal His6 tag (4Nelson S.W. Binkowski D.J. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All bacterial cultures contained 30 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate (Invitrogen). An overnight culture was prepared in LB media (Sigma), and the cells were isolated by centrifugation (1500 × g for 10 min). The pellet was re-suspended in 24 ml of M9 media, supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm FeSO4, and 0.5 μm thiamin. Four ml of inoculant culture was added to each flask containing 650 ml of supplemented M9 media. The flasks were shaken at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8. The temperature was adjusted to 16 °C, and 35 mg each of l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-valine, and 65 mg each of l-phenylalanine, l-lysine, and l-threonine were added as solids to each flask. After shaking for 20 min, 2 ml of a 20 mg/ml solution of l-selenomethionine was added to each flask. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm after an additional 15 min of agitation. Cells were isolated after 18 h by centrifugation (1500 × g, 10 min), re-suspended in 10 mm KPi (pH 7.0), centrifuged again, and finally re-suspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm KPi, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Cells were disrupted by sonication in the presence of 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme, 50 μg/ml DNase I, 1 ml of 100 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride in isopropyl alcohol, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysate was centrifuged (33,000 × g, 1 h) and the supernatant fluid loaded onto 25 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Novagen), pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer. The column was washed sequentially with 2 column volumes each of lysis buffer, lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. eSS was subsequently eluted from the column with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Immediately upon elution, dithiothreitol and EDTA were added to the fractions to final concentrations of 5 and 10 mm, respectively. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight in buffer containing 15 mm Tris·HCl, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Native protein was prepared using an identical protocol, except cell growth and expression was done in LB media without amino acid supplements.Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213177) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar). Mass determinations of purified protein were done by the Iowa State University core facility using an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 6075 matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The specific activity of eSS was determined using previously described assay conditions (4Nelson S.W. Binkowski D.J. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The dependence of velocity on the concentration of Mg2+ was investigated using saturating substrate concentrations (300 μm ATP, 65 μm CAIR, and 7.5 mm l-aspartate), with concentrations of free Mg2+ ranging from 90 to 7000 μm.Crystallization—Crystals were grown by the method of hanging-drop vapor diffusion in VDX plates (Hampton Research). Two μl of protein solution (15 mg/ml protein, 15 mm Tris·HCl, 25 mm KCl, 55 mm MgCl2, 50 mm ADP, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) were mixed with 2 μl of well solution (3.4–3.8 m sodium formate and 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.5) and allowed to equilibrate against 0.5 ml of well solution. Crystallization experiments for the ADP complex and CAIR·ADP complex employed selenomethionine-substituted and native proteins, respectively.Data Collection—For the ADP complex, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 4 m sodium formate, 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.5), 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mm ADP, and 10% (w/v) sucrose. This buffer was supplemented with 1 mm CAIR and 10 mm l-aspartate for the CAIR·ADP complex. After ∼30 s of equilibration, crystals were plunged into liquid nitrogen.For the ADP complex, MAD data were collected on Beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkley Laboratory. Complete anomalous sets were taken at wavelengths of peak absorbance, the inflection point, and remote from the absorption edge of selenium. Data were indexed, integrated, scaled, and merged using d*trek (19Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Intensities were converted to structure factors using the CCP4 (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19698) Google Scholar) program TRUNCATE.Data from the CAIR·ADP complex were collected at Iowa State University from a single crystal (temperature, 115 K) on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ rotating anode/image plate system using CuKα radiation from an Osmic confocal optics system. Data were processed and reduced using the program package CrystalClear provided with the instrument. Intensities were converted to structure factors using the CCP4 program TRUNCATE.Structure Determination and Refinement—Structure determination for the selenomethionine-replaced protein was accomplished using the SOLVE/RESOLVE software package (21Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 50: 760-763Google Scholar, 22Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Electron density was modeled as polyalanine by RESOLVE, followed by manual fitting using XTALVIEW (23McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement was performed against the structure factors from the remote wavelength using CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic restraints were not used during refinement. Refinement began with a cycle of simulated annealing (starting temperature of 3500 K) with slow cooling in increments of 25 K to a final temperature of 300 K, followed by 100 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. Subsequent cycles had lower initial starting temperatures (as low as 500 K). Individual thermal parameters were refined after each cycle of simulated annealing and subject to the following restraints: bonded main chain atoms, 1.5 Å2; angle main chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; bonded side chain atoms, 2.0 Å2; and angle side chain atoms, 2.5 Å2. Water molecules were automatically added using CNS if a peak greater than 3.0 σ was present in Fourier maps with coefficients (Fobs – Fcalc)eiαcalc. Refined water sites were eliminated if they were further than 3.2 Å from a hydrogen-bonding partner or if their thermal parameters exceeded 50 Å2. The contribution of the bulk solvent to structure factors was determined using the default parameters of CNS. Constants of force and geometry for the protein came from Engh and Huber (25Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2537) Google Scholar) and those for ADP from CNS resource files with appropriate modification of dihedral angles of the ribosyl moiety to maintain a 2′-endo ring conformation.For the native CAIR·ADP complex, molecular replacement was performed using AMORE with the ADP complex as the starting model. Refinement was performed as for the ADP complex. Routines in the CCP4 suite of programs were used in the calculation of surface areas and in the superposition of structures.RESULTSProtein Preparation, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Selenium-modified and native eSS were pure on the basis of SDS-PAGE. The specific activity of the selenomethionine-substituted protein was 15 ± 1 units/mg, comparable with that of the native protein (4Nelson S.W. Binkowski D.J. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of native and selenomethionine-substituted proteins indicated 8.5 (relative to a maximum of 10) selenium atoms per monomer. SOLVE initially located 17 selenium sites, generating a phase set with a figure-of-merit of 0.37. Iterations of density modification by RESOLVE increased the figure-of-merit to 0.67.

Open table in a new tab Overview of eSS Structure (Protein Data Bank Identifiers 2GQR and 2GQS)—An eSS homodimer occupies the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The subunits of the dimer are virtually identical with a superposition of all Cα atoms yielding a root mean square deviation of 0.34 Å for both nucleotide complexes. No electron density is present for the polyhistidyl tag. Observable electron density begins with Met1 and continues to the C terminus (Asp237). Electron density is weak only for residues 35–39 of the ADP complex but strong for the same segment in the ADP·CAIR complex.Domain 1 of the eSS fold (Fig. 1) consists of a β-sheet (strands β1-β3, β6, and β7) with its inter-strand connections (helix α1 and an anti-parallel loop β4–β5). Domain 2 consists of a β-sheet (strands β8–β13) and associated helices α2–α6. The β-sheet of domain 1 curls (like the fingers of a right hand relative to its palm) over domain 2, creating a cleft, half of which is filled by ADP-Mg2+ and the other half by CAIR. The subunits come together with 2-fold symmetry forming a dimer that buries ∼2400 Å2 of surface at the interface.The major structural difference between the ADP and ADP·CAIR complexes is the aforementioned levels of electron density associated with residues 35–39. Superposition of all Cα carbons of subunit A from the ADP and ADP·CAIR complexes gives a root mean square difference of 0.18 Å and a maximum displacement of 0.67 Å. The former value is comparable with the coordinate uncertainty of 0.25 Å determined by the CCP4 program SFCHECK. The high level of agreement occurs despite the difference in ligation, and infers selenomethionine substitution in the ADP complex causes little perturbation to the structure. The largest Cα displacements (0.7 Å) are in the loop (residues 124–130) that coordinates metal ions associated with CAIR and for residues in the vicinity of the 5′-phosphoryl group of CAIR. The conformation of the adenine nucleotide and its interactions with the protein are identical (within coordinate uncertainty) in the ADP and ADP·CAIR complexes.Comparison of eSS to tSS—eSS (237 residues) and tSS (PDB identifier 1KUT, 230 residues) share 39% sequence identity. tSS, like eSS, is a dimer (Fig. 1). Cα atoms of the eSS and tSS subunits superimpose with a root mean square deviation of ∼1.2 Å, using the sequence alignment of Fig. 2; however, the polypeptide fold associated with segment 204–221 of eSS, which includes strand β13 and helix α5, differs strikingly from that of tSS (Figs. 1 and 3). The alternative fold of tSS exposes six hydrophobic residues and increases the solvent-accessible surface area of each subunit by ∼1000 Å2 (from 1220 Å2 in eSS to 2200 Å2 in tSS).FIGURE 2Sequence alignment based on structure. Superpositions of SAICAR synthetase from yeast (ySS), T. maritima (tSS), and E. coli (eSS) determine corresponding residues. The relationship between elements of sequence and secondary structure (α-helices as cylinders and β-strands as arrows) of eSS appear immediately below its sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Variation in the folds of eSS and tSS. The superposition of subunits A and B of tSS onto eSS using the β-sheet of domain 2 reveals significant variations between subunit A (white) and subunit B (gray) of tSS, as well as an even larger conformational difference between each of the tSS subunits and subunit A of eSS (black). Subunit B of eSS (not shown) is virtually identical in conformation to subunit A. Parts of this figure were drawn with MOLSCRIPT (42Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Unlike the alternative fold of tSS, the eSS fold has an extensive network of hydrogen bonds. Interacting residues fall in two clusters: Asp202, Arg231, and Thr205 and Arg39, Asp175, Arg199, Asp210, Lys211, Asp212, Arg213, and Arg215. The latter more extensive cluster apparently anchors helix α5 with respect to domains 1 and 2, while positioning hydrophilic side chains in the active site cleft of eSS. In contrast, helix α5 in tSS is displaced relative to that of eSS (Fig. 3), taking residues corresponding to Arg199, Lys211, and Arg215 away from the active site. Most of the residues in segment 204–221 of eSS are conserved among microbial SAICAR synthetases; for instance, Asp175, Arg199, Asp210, Lys211, Asp212, and Arg215 are conserved and present in tSS.Comparison of eSS to ySS—SAICAR synthetase from S. cerevisae (ySS) has 69 more amino acids than eSS, appearing primarily as insertions before residues 1, 77, 105, and 221 of the E. coli synthetase (Figs. 1 and 2). Neglecting insertions, eSS and ySS are 27% identical in sequence, and superimpose with a root mean square deviation of 3.3 Å. The first and second sequence insertions come together in ySS (PDB identifiers 1OBD, 1OBG, and 1A48), where they define a putative binding site for AMP. (AMP appears in good electron density only at a lattice contact in 1OBG. Hence, the functional significance of the first two insertions in the ySS sequence remains unclear.) The third insertion occurs at the subunit interface of the eSS dimer and probably blocks the dimerization of ySS subunits. The fourth insertion extends the helix corresponding to α5 of eSS and the connecting segments at the N- and C-terminal ends of that helix. The fourth segment replaces residues 204–221 in eSS but, nonetheless, retains a functional active site.Adenine Nucleotide Interactions—ADP-Mg2+ binds to eSS in an anti-conformation (Fig. 4). Val15, Leu24, Leu26, and Val81 are in contact with one side of the adenine base, whereas Met86 packs against the other. Atom N-1 of ADP binds to the backbone amide group of Leu84, and atom N-6 binds to the backbone carbonyl group of Lys82 and the side chain of Gln69 (Table 3). No side chain interaction between atom N-6 and the protein was reported for ySS (PDB identifiers 1OBG and 1OBD); however, His72 of the ySS structurally corresponds to Gln69 of eSS and is in a position to interact with the adenine nucleotide. This position is conserved as glutamine or histidine in microbial systems.FIGURE 4Enzyme-bound ADP. Left and center, stereoview of ADP in which the dotted lines represent donor-acceptor interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2061134802,"We analyzed cGMP signaling by the human phosphodiesterase 5 (hPDE5) tandem GAF domain based on a functional activation assay. The C-terminal catalytic domain of the cyanobacterial adenylyl cyclase (AC) cyaB1 was used as a reporter enzyme. We demonstrate functional coupling between the hPDE5 GAF ensemble and the AC resulting in a chimera stimulated 10-fold by cGMP. The hPDE5 GAF domain has an inhibitory effect on AC activity, which is released upon cGMP activation. Removal of 109 amino acids from the N terminus resulted in partial disengagement of the GAF domain and AC, i.e. in a 10-fold increase in basal activity, and affected cGMP affinity. The Ser-102 phosphorylation site of hPDE5 increased cGMP affinity, as shown by a 5-fold lower KD for cGMP in a S102D mutant, which mimicked complete modification. The function of the NKFDE motif, which is a signature of all GAF domains with known cyclic nucleotide binding capacity, was elucidated by targeted mutations. Data with either single and double mutants in either GAF A or GAF B or a quadruple mutant affecting both subdomains simultaneously indicated that it is impossible to functionally assign cGMP binding and intramolecular signaling to either GAF A or B of hPDE5. Both subdomains are structurally and functionally interdependent and act in concert in regulating cycaB1 AC and, most likely, also hPDE5.

In essentially all eukaryotic cells, cAMP and cGMP act as second messengers. Therefore the concentration of these nucleotides is meticulously regulated by the rates of biosynthesis and breakdown (1.Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Based on biochemical properties and sequence alignments, mammalian PDEs have been grouped into 11 families (PDE1–PDE11). All catalytic domains are similar (20–45% identity (3.Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and peculiar regulatory features are mediated by differing N-terminal domains.

The studies have been hampered by the fact that cGMP concurrently serves as a substrate and as an allosteric regulator creating an unsolvable kinetic conundrum. Because the tandem GAF domains of mammalian PDEs are closely related to those of cyanobacterial ACs (6.Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13.Bruder S. Linder J.U. Martinez S.E. Zheng N. Beavo J.A. Schultz J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The chimera is regulated by cGMP acting via the GAF B domain and uses ATP as a substrate (6.Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Here, we successfully replaced the tandem GAF domain of the cyaB1 AC with that of the hPDE5, again and surprisingly generating a cGMP-regulated AC. This separation of substrate ATP and allosteric regulator cGMP allowed us to characterize the hPDE5 tandem GAF domain biochemically using the AC as a reporter enzyme. The allosteric regulation of the PDE5 catalytic domain is reported to occur predominantly via its GAF A domain (11.Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A.

Yet, considerable discrepancies have been reported in cGMP binding studies, and the role of Ser-102 phosphorylation (hPDE5 numbering) in cGMP binding to the GAF domain is contentious (15.Sopory S.

We characterized the contributions of the GAF A and B domains as well as the potential phosphorylation site at Ser-102 to the allosteric cGMP regulation of the cyanobacterial cyaB1 AC by the hPDE5 tandem GAF domain. Recombinant DNAs—The gene of hPDE5 1A_2 (GenBank™ accession number NM001083.3) was a gift of Dr. Friebe (University of Bochum) and the cyaB1 AC gene (gi 15553050) of Dr. Ohmori (University of Tokyo). Throughout this report, the numbering of amino acid residues refers to these genes. The hPDE5 tandem GAF domain (amino acids 1–513) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the BglII and SalI sites of pBlue-script II SK(–) upstream of the cyaB1 AC (amino acid 386–859). By transfer to pQE30 the construct was fitted with an N-terminal MRGSH6GS affinity tag. The hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 chimera in pQE30 served as a template to generate the mutants hPDE5 D299A, hPDE5 D488A, hPDE5 D299A/D488A, hPDE5 K287A, hPDE5 K473A, hPDE5 K287A/K473A, hPDE5 K287A/D299A, hPDE5 D299A/K473A, hPDE5 K287A/D299A/K473A/D488A, hPDE5 S102D, and hPDE5 S102A and the N-terminally shortened constructs starting at Val-30, Ile-72, Pro-87, Ala-89, Asn-91, Gly-95, Ile-101, Pro-109, Thr-121, and Gln-148 of hPDE5. Single amino acid mutations were introduced by fusion PCR with Pfu polymerase and the respective sense and antisense primers using nearby restriction sites (for mutations in GAF A, BglII, XbaI, SalI, or MfeI sites were used; for mutations in GAF B, XbaI and MfeI sites were employed). For generation of S102D and S102A mutants a wobble primer was used, and clones were identified by digestion with ClaI (the S102D mutation created a ClaI site within the chimera). Double and quadruple mutants were constructed either by digesting the single mutants with BsrGI and MfeI and religation of the respective fragments (D299A/D488A, K287A/K473A, and K287A/D299A/K473A/D488A) or by using the single mutants as PCR templates for fusion PCRs (K287A/D299A and K473A/D488A). N-terminally shortened constructs were obtained with the corresponding BglII sense primers and XbaI or MfeI (for Gln-148) antisense primers. All PCR products were cloned into pBluescript II SK(–). For expression we equipped the pET16b vector with the multiple cloning site of pQE30 (bp 267–431 of pET16b were replaced by bp 199–90 of pQE30). PCR constructs were fused with cyaB1 AC and transferred to the modified pET16b expression vector via BglII and SacI sites, or only corresponding parts of the expression vectors were exchanged via NcoI and MfeI or SacI sites. The N-terminal MRGSH6GS affinity tag was retained. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by double-stranded sequencing. Primer sequences are available on request. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (pRep4) cells. Cultures were grown in Luria Bertani broth at 30 °C containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 50 mg/liter kanamycin. Expression was induced at an A600 of 0.5 with 25 (hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC in pQE30) or 75 μm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (for constructs in pET16b) for 7–20 h at 16 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 4 °C, and stored at –80 °C. For purification, cells were lysed at 1000 p.s.i. by using a French Press in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 7.5 mm imidazole, and, optionally, Complete® EDTA-free protease inhibitors from Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C. After removal of debris (45 min, 48,000 × g, 4 °C) 150 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid slurry (Qiagen) were added (2.5 h at 0 °C). Afterward the resin was poured into a column and washed (2 ml/wash) with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol), buffer B (buffer A + 15 mm imidazole), and buffer E (buffer A + 25 mm imidazole, 10 mm NaCl). Proteins were eluted with 0.3 ml of buffer E containing 300 mm imidazole. Eluates were dialyzed for 2 h against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 35% glycerol and stored at –20 °C. The purity and integrity of recombinant proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Adenylyl Cyclase Assay—Activity was tested for 10 min at 37 °C in 100 μl (25.Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) containing 22% glycerol, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2,10 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 75 μm [α-32P]ATP (25 kBq). 2 mm [2,8-3H]cAMP (150 Bq) was added when stopping the reaction to monitor yield during product isolation. Substrate conversion was limited to <10%. For kon measurements, 0.3 μg of hPDE5 cyaB1 AC was prein-cubated with 100 μm cGMP for 1–15 min (8 data points) at 0 °C in assay buffer. After samples were warmed for 30 s to 37 °C, reactions were started by adding substrate. For koff determinations, samples were incubated with 100 μm cGMP for 10 min at 0 °C, diluted 840-fold to 119 nm cGMP, and assayed after 5–250 min at 0 °C. Activities were compared with controls with 119 nm cGMP added directly. All values are given as means ± S.E. Two-tailed Student's t tests were used for statistical evaluation. Western Blot Analysis—Protein was mixed with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed sequentially with an anti-RGS-H4-antibody (Qiagen) and with a 1:5000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Dianova). Peroxidase detection was carried out with the ECL Plus kit (GE Healthcare). Mostly Western blots are shown because of the need to exclude the presence of degradation products that might adversely affect assay results. Preparation of Phospho-hPDE5-Proteins—hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC and the hPDE5 S102D and hPDE5 S102A mutants were phosphorylated using the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA from New England Biolabs) as described (24.Zoraghi R. Bessay E.P. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12051-12063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Each protein (0.5 μm) was incubated with 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm [γ32P]ATP (7.4 MBq/μmol ATP), 25 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 5000 units of the PKA subunit in 100 μl at 30 °C for 2 h. To separate unused [γ32P]ATP, the solutions were applied to Quick-Spin columns (Sephadex G-50 from Roche Diagnostics) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1100 × g.[γ32P]ATP remained on the column, and phosphorylated protein was eluted. Immediately after elution, AC activity and activation by cGMP and cAMP were assayed. A sample without PKA catalytic subunit served as a reference for protein stability. To check for protein phosphorylation by autoradiography, aliquots were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the gel was exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak Biomax MR) for 1 and 28 days, respectively. Biochemical Characterization of hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC—Formerly we had replaced the cyanobacterial tandem GAF domain in cyaB1 with those of rPDE2a and hPDEs 10 and 11 (6.Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26.Gross-Langenhoff M. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This enabled us to use the cyaB1 AC as a reporter enzyme to characterize the GAF domains from mammalian PDEs 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11. In mPDE5 cGMP-mediated stimulation predominantly involves the first of the two GAF domains, i.e. GAF A (10.McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A.

Chem. 2005; 280: 12051-12063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas in cyaB1 AC, GAF B mediates cAMP signaling (6.Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were surprised that swapping the tandem GAF domain of cyaB1 with that of hPDE5 was successful. The chimera was activated by cGMP, whereas cAMP was ineffective (Fig. 1). Maximal activation by 3 mm cGMP was 10.2-fold from a basal activity of 40.2 ± 1.4 nmol cAMP·mg–1·min–1. The EC50 for cGMP was 9.6 ± 1.8 μm (n = 5; Fig. 1). AC activity of the chimera was linear with protein concentration up to 15 min, and the pH optimum was between 7 and 9 (±100 μm cGMP; data not shown). The temperature optima were 54 °C (–cGMP) and 50 °C (+100 μm cGMP). The activation energies derived from Arrhenius plots were 70 and 100 kJ/(mol·K) (±100 μm cGMP; tested range 0–66 °C). The Km for ATP with 10 mm Mg2+ as a cofactor was 13 μm (±100 μm cGMP), i.e. similar to that of the cyaB1 holoenzyme and other PDE-cyaB1 chimeras (6.Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27.Ho Y.S. Burden L.M. Hurley J.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Vmax values obtained from linearized Michaelis-Menten plots were 51 (–cGMP) and 435 nmol cAMP·mg–1·min–1 (+100 μm cGMP), i.e. cGMP increased Vmax. The hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC chimera was stable at –20 °C for up to 8 months. Longer storage increased basal activity and decreased cGMP activation and maximal activity. This was reminiscent of the poor stability of mPDE5, which could not be activated after 2 weeks of storage (11.Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC chimera by cGMP was direct and immediate. Preincubation with cGMP was not required because the reactions were linear up to 15 min, independently of preincubations up to 15 min with 100 μm cGMP prior to substrate addition (data not shown). Similarly, termination of activation was as quick as could be determined experimentally, i.e. within 5 min after removal of cGMP by an 840-fold dilution, because activities were identical when assayed at 5 or 250 min after dilution (8 data points assayed). Those fast kon and koff values for hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC are at variance with results for cGMP binding to PDE5, where on and off kinetics were about 15 min for the on-reaction (11.Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and up to 7 h for the off-reaction (10.McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol.

Similarly, binding assays with the isolated PDE5 GAF domains have demonstrated that cGMP binding and release are slow (15.Sopory S. Balaji S. Srinivasan N. Visweswariah S.S.

We examined cGMP binding to hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC chimera following standard protocols (10.McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L. Colbran J.L. Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Turko I.V. Beavo J.A. Francis S.H.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In our hands cAMP or cGMP binding never exceeded 3%. In view of the rapid on and off rates of hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC activation, we assumed that bound cyclic nucleotides were washed off during the washing step. The differences may be rationalized by different interactions between the GAF domain and the PDE5 or cyaB1 AC catalytic domains and/or the use of native protein isolated from lung (28.Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or recombinant proteins expressed in COS-7 cells (10.McAllister-Lucas L.M. Haik T.L.

Effect of the N Terminus on PDE 5 GAF-cyaB1 AC Activation—Using various PDE5 GAF domain constructs, cGMP binding constants between 0.027 and 1.9 μm have been reported in the past (15.Sopory S. Balaji S. Srinivasan N. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17.Francis S.H. Bessay E.P. Kotera J. Grimes K.A. Liu L. Thompson W.J. Corbin J.D.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5288-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Possibly different N- and C-terminal truncations have contributed. Recently, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of the tandem GAF of PDE114A is critical for cGMP stimulation, because activation was observed only with the complete N terminus (26.Gross-Langenhoff M. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of the N terminus of hPDE5 of 147 amino acids that contains a potentially important phosphorylation site (Ser-102). Initially, we tested a construct starting at Gln-148, i.e. devoid of the N terminus (hPDE5 Gln-148-cyaB1 AC). Basal AC activity was 9.8-fold higher (243.1 ± 15.8 versus 24.8 ± 7.5 nmol cAMP·mg–1·min–1; n = 5), and the EC50 value for cGMP was reduced to 0.2 ± 0.07 μm (n = 6; Fig. 2). However, because of high basal activity, cGMP activation (391 ± 25.3 nmol cAMP·mg–1·min–1; n = 9) was only 1.6-fold. Maximal stimulated AC activity was not significantly affected. To exclude the possibility that the results reflected structural changes in the catalytic domain, Km values were determined (11.4 and 14.3 μm ATP ± 1 mm cGMP, respectively), i.e. they were unchanged from the full-length chimera (13 μm ATP). Thus, we can conclude that removal of the N terminus did not affect substrate kinetics. The altered activation of the chimera may then indicate a different interaction between the truncated tandem GAF and the catalytic domain. In fact, AC activity appeared relieved from inhibition by removal of the GAF N terminus. To narrow the region responsible for this effect, we generated a series of shortened hPDE5 GAF-cyaB1 AC constructs. Structural predictions for the N terminus were used for construct design (DNA Star Protean). Flexible regions are predicted for amino acids 1–30, 70–100, and 135–147. They are interrupted by predicted α-helices and β-strands. Accordingly, chimeras started with Val-30, Ile-72, Pro-87, Ala-89, Asn-91, Gly-95, Ile-101, Pro-109, and Thr-121 (Table 1). With ongoing shortening of the N terminus we initially observed a minor increase in basal AC activity and a decrease in the EC50 values for cGMP (Table 1). A major leap in basal activity occurred between constructs starting at Gly-95, Ile-101, and Pro-109 (19.2, 217, and 815 nmol cAMP·mg–1·min–1, respectively; Fig. 2). Removal of amino acids 101–108 had a dual effect; it released the AC from an apparently inhibited state and increased the cGMP affinity of the GAF domain 4–5-fold (Table 1 and Fig. 2). All constructs with deletions beyond Pro-109 exhibited no further increases in basal AC activity, no additional reductions of the EC50 for cGMP or of maximal cGMP activation (Table 1, Fig. 2). For the shortened constructs the Km values for ATP were found to be unchanged, and the degree of purification for all constructs was similar, making the data comparable (Fig. 2B). Further, AC activation of all constructs was instantaneous and required no preincubation with cGMP (data not shown).TABLE 1EC50 values for cGMP and maximal cGMP stimulation for all N-terminally shortened constructs of the hPDE5 tandem GAF domainConstructEC50 for cGMP-Fold activation by cGMPμmhPDE5 GAF cyaB1 AC9.6 ± 1.8 (n = 5)10.2 ± 0.2 (n = 5)hPDE5 Val-30-cyaB1 AC5.4 ± 0.9 (n = 3)9.4 ± 1.6 (n = 3)hPDE5 Ile-72-cyaB1 AC14.7 ± 2.1 (n = 3)17.7 ± 1.0 (n = 3)hPDE5 Pro-87-cyaB1 AC3.0 ± 0.7 (n = 2)27.4 ± 6.8 (n = 2)hPDE5 Ala-89-cyaB1 AC13.5 ± 0.2 (n = 2)18.7 (n = 2)hPDE5 Asn-91-cyaB1 AC20 ± 0.1 (n = 2)5 (n = 2)hPDE5 Gly-95-cyaB1 AC15.6 ± 3 (n = 2)11 (n = 2)hPDE5 Ile-101-cyaB1 AC0.9 ± 0.1 (n = 3)6.3 ± 0.8 (n = 3)hPDE5 Pro-109-cyaB1 AC0.2 ± 0.04 (n = 2)1.7 ± 0.2 (n = 2)hPDE5 Thr-121-cyaB1 AC0.3 ± 0.2 (n = 2)1.9 ± 0.1 (n = 3)hPDE5 Gln-148-cyaB1 AC0.2 ± 0.07 (n = 6)1.6 ± 0.04 (n = 30) Open table in a new tab Influence of Phosphorylation at Ser-102—The hPDE5 N terminus has a phosphorylation site at Ser-102 which is subject to modification by cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA, PKG).

https://openalex.org/W2084940959,"Dlx3 (Distal-less 3) is a homeobox-containing transcription factor required for normal placental development in mice. Here we demonstrate that Dlx3 interacts with Smad6, a member of a larger family of transcriptional regulators generally thought to regulate transforming growth factor β/bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Immunocytochemical and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate overlapping nuclear localization and physical interaction between Dlx3 and Smad6 in human choriocarcinoma cells and in differentiated trophoblasts from human placenta. In vitro protein interaction studies mapped the Smad6 interaction domain within Dlx3 to residues 80-163, a region of Dlx3 that includes a portion of the homeodomain. Dlx3 and Dlx4 share homology within this region, and Dlx4 was also found to bind Smad6. Using the Esx1 gene promoter as a model for a Dlx3-responsive gene, studies demonstrate two near consensus Dlx3 binding sites within the proximal 2.3 kb of the transcription start site. Interestingly, binding of Dlx3 to one of these two sites was inhibited by interaction with Smad6. Consistent with this result, expression of an Esx1 promoter luciferase reporter was increased by overexpression of Dlx3; this effect was reversed with co-expression of Smad6. Further, small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous Smad6 increased Dlx3-dependent expression of the Esx1 gene promoter. Thus, Smad6 appears to functionally interact with Dlx3, altering the ability of Dlx3 to bind target gene promoters. Smad6 appears to play a modulatory role in the regulation of Dlx3-dependent gene transcription within placental trophoblasts.

Thus, Smad6 appears to functionally interact with Dlx3, altering the ability of Dlx3 to bind target gene promoters. Smad6 appears to play a modulatory role in the regulation of Dlx3-dependent gene transcription within placental trophoblasts. The Distal-less family of transcriptional regulators includes six members in mammals, arrayed in pairs and aligned with the hox gene clusters along different chromosomes (1.Bendall A.J. Abate-Shen C. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 247: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2.Beanan M.J. Sargent T.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Dlx3 is tandemly arrayed with Dlx4 on human chromosome 17 and is involved in developmental determination of multiple tissues, including the first and second branchial arches, teeth, bone, and multiple epithelia, including the skin, mammary gland primordia, and the placenta (3.Morasso M.I. Mahon K.A. Sargent T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3968-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The relationship between convergently transcribed pairs of Dlx family members and specific hox gene clusters has suggested that, although independent of hox gene expression patterns, these homeodomain-containing transcription factors are clearly involved in important aspects of developmental morphogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 2.Beanan M.J. Sargent T.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The importance of Dlx3 during development and in the adult arises from several different observations of disease states. Mutations in Dlx3 are believed to be causally related to tricho-dento osseous syndrome, a genetic disorder manifested by taurodontism, hair abnormalities, and increased bone density in the cranium (4.Price J.A. Bowden D.W. Wright J.T. Pettenati M.J. Hart T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 5.Price J.A. Wright J.T. Kula K. Bowden D.W. Hart T.C. J. Med.

Bone. 2004; 35: 988-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The defect in Dlx3 leading to tricho-dento osseous syndrome appears to be associated with a four-nucleotide deletion just downstream of the homeodomain, resulting in a premature truncation of the protein. Amelogenesis imperfecta with taurodontism has similar characteristics as tricho-dento osseous syndrome and has also been associated with mutations with Dlx3 in some families investigated, albeit distinct from the fournucleotide deletion/mutation described above (7.Dong J. Amor D. Aldred M.J. Gu T. Escamilla M. MacDougall M. Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2005; 133: 138-141Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Amelogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant trait leading to dental enamel defects and enlarged pulp chambers and has been associated with a two-nucleotide deletion within the homeodomain of Dlx3. This deletion again results in a frameshift and premature truncation of Dlx3 in the carboxyl terminus, primarily downstream of the homeobox. In addition to tricho-dento osseous syndrome and amelogenesis imperfecta, Dlx3/Dlx4 have been identified in the gene interval thought to be involved in some forms of craniofacial abnormalities, including cleft palate (8.Juriloff D.M. Harris M.J. Brown C.J. Mamm. Genome. 2001; 12: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The putative involvement of Dlx3 in the occurrence of cleft palate is also supported by the murine model deficient in endothelin-A receptor (the endothelin-A receptor), which results in cleft palate and hypoplasia of the mandible (9.Clouthier D.E. Williams S.C. Yanagisawa H. Wieduwilt M. Richardson J.A. Yanagisawa M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 10-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10.Clouthier D.E. Williams S.C. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Yanagisawa M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 261: 506-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11.Clouthier D.E. Schilling T.F. Birth Defects Res. C Embryol. Today. 2004; 72: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this model, Dlx3 expression is thought to be dependent upon endothelin-1 through a Gαq/Gα11-dependent mechanism. In the Gαq/Gα11-deficient mouse, Dlx3, among other factors, is specifically down-regulated, supporting the speculation of the importance of Dlx3 in cranio-facial morphogenesis (12.Ivey K. Tyson B. Ukidwe P. McFadden D.G. Levi G. Olson E.N. Srivastava D. Wilkie T.M. Dev. Biol. 2003; 255: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the role and importance of Dlx3 in morphogenic aspects of development and in epithelial differentiated function is rather far reaching. The Dlx3 null mouse dies in utero by embryonic day 10 due to putative placental failure (13.Morasso M.I. Grinberg A. Robinson G. Sargent T.D. Mahon K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This was associated with a failure in the development/morphogenesis of the placental labyrinth compartment of the murine placenta. Further, genetic loss of Dlx3 was correlated with reduced expression of an additional homeobox factor, Esx1, suggesting that Dlx3 may be an important transcriptional regulator of Esx1 promoter activity. Studies from our laboratory identified Dlx3 as a cell type-specific transcriptional activator in placental trophoblasts. Dlx3 binds to and transactivates the promoter for the glycoprotein hormone α subunit gene via a cis-acting element required for full basal activity of this gene (14.Roberson M.S. Meermann S. Morasso M.I. Mulvaney-Musa J.M. Zhang T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10016-10024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The glycoprotein hormone α subunit is a subunit of the heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone, chorionic gonadotropin (CG). 3The abbreviations used are: CG, chorionic gonadotropin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KPBS, potassium phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interference RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TKDP, trophoblast Kunitz domain protein; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; JRE, junctional regulatory element; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; X-α-gal, X-α-galactosidase. Trophoblast-derived CG has been identified in primates and equine and appears to play a critical role in the maintenance of early pregnancy in women, providing early gonadotropic support to the corpus luteum and maintenance of progesterone production (15.France J.T.

Gynaecol. 2004; 111: 1218-1228Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Both for the case of the α subunit promoter and regulation of Esx1 in the Dlx3 null mouse, Dlx3 appears to function as a putative transcriptional activator. However, it has also been proposed that Dlx3 can serve as a negative regulator of gene transcription in amphibian models (2.Beanan M.J. Sargent T.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This apparent activation/repression capability may be due to variable heterodimeric partners of Dlx3 (as proposed in Ref. 2.Beanan M.J. Sargent T.D. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), dependent upon cell context and physiological state. This observation was the impetus for us to examine potential binding partners of Dlx3 in the context of the human placenta. The present studies identify Smad6 as a binding partner for Dlx3 using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human term placental cDNA library. Dlx3 and Smad6 are co-localized in the nucleus of cells of trophoblast origin, including cytotrophoblasts and syncytial trophoblasts from fully differentiated human term placenta. Interaction between Dlx3 and Smad6 alters the DNA binding properties of Dlx3 such that Smad6 serves as a negative regulator of Dlx3-dependent gene transcription of the Esx1 promoter. Plasmids and cDNAs—All plasmids used in these studies were prepared by two cycles through cesium chloride using standard protocols. Expression vector for human Dlx3 was generously provided by Dr. Maria Morasso (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A series of deletion mutants of the Dlx3 cDNA were constructed by PCR. To facilitate cloning into the pKH3 vector (generously provided by Dr. Jun-Lin Guan, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites were added to the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The forward primers used in these reactions were as follows: forward 1, 5′-TCAGGAATTCAAATGAGCGGCTCCTTCGATCGC-3′, forward 40, 5′-TCAGGAATTCAACTGGGCTATTACAGCGCTCCTCAG-3′, forward 80, 5′-TCAGGAATTCAATACTCGCCCAAGTCGGAATATACC-3′, forward 121, 5′-TCAGGAATTCAAATGGTGAACGGCAAGCCCAAAAAG-3′, and forward 195, 5′-TCAGGAATTCAACTGGAACACAGCCCCAACAACAGT-3′. The reverse primers used in these reactions were as follows: reverse 128, 5′-GTACATCGATCACGGCTTTCGGACCTTCTTGGGCTTCCC-3′; reverse 163, 5′-GTACATCGATCAAGCTAGCTCGGCGCGCTCAGGCAA-3′, reverse 202, 5′-GTACATCGATCAACTGTATTGGGACTGTGCTCCAG-3′, and reverse 287, 5′-GTACATCGATTCAGTACACAGCCCCAGGGTT-3′. PCR products were cloned initially into the pGEM T Easy vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Once verified by nucleotide sequence analysis, fragments were subcloned into the pKH3 vector for use in studies. Smad6 expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Ali H. Brivanlou (The Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Smad4 expression vector was a gift from Dr. Colin Clay (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO). The human Dlx4 cDNA was obtained by PCR from RNA isolated from JEG3 cells using the following primers: 5′-TCAGGAATTCAAATGACCTCTTTACCCTGTCCC-3′ and 5′-GTACATCGATCACATCATCTGAGGCAGTGC-3′. The resulting Dlx4 cDNA was cloned into pKH3 and verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. The Esx1-2.3kb promoter was obtained by PCR using mouse genomic DNA and the following primers: 5′ primer (5′-GGTACCAGCACCGAGCTATCACAACCATCA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-GCTAGCTACCAGCTGCTTCTCCCGTA-3′). To facilitate cloning, KpnI and NheI restriction enzyme sites were engineered at the end of the 5′ primer and 3′ primer, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-Easy vector. After KpnI and NheI digestion, the promoter fragment was subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector. The fidelity of the construct was confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to disrupt the distal Dlx3 binding site within the Esx1 luciferase reporter. This mutation substituted a Not-1 restriction site for the near consensus Dlx3 binding site. The mutation was confirmed using nucleotide sequence analysis. The human α subunit gene promoter luciferase reporter has been reported previously (14.Roberson M.S. Meermann S. Morasso M.I. Mulvaney-Musa J.M. Zhang T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10016-10024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To investigate novel protein-protein interactions, full-length Dlx3 served as the bait protein with a human term placental cDNA library serving as the target. The bait, human Dlx3 cDNA, was cloned into the vector pGBKT7 and transformed in the yeast strain AH109. A pretransformed human term placental Matchmaker cDNA library was in yeast strain Y187 (BD Biosciences/Clontech, Palo Alto CA). The bait and library plasmids were expressed as GAL4 fusion proteins. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole was titrated (5-35 mm) using the bait strain to control background yeast growth. A concentration of 12 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was used in the library screen. The bait and library strains were mated with an efficiency of ∼4%. The bait strain required Leu− synthetic dropout (SD) minimal medium, and the library strain required Trp− SD minimal medium. Mating was carried out in YPDA media containing 0.003% adenine hemisulfate. Following mating of the bait strain with the human placental library, yeasts were initially plated on intermediate stringency SD media (His−/Leu−/Trp−) plates. When colonies were of sufficient size, colonies were replica-plated on high stringency SD medium (Ade−/His−/Leu−/Trp−/X-α-gal) plates to verify that they maintained the correct phenotype. A colony filter lift assay was performed to access β-galactosidase activity to identify and rank the strength of potential interactions. Once identified, yeast plasmids were isolated using disruption with glass beads, and plasmids were rescued/purified using the Qiagen Miniprep reagents and a spin column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Identity of the rescued plasmids was verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. The interaction between Dlx3 and target genes was examined using a reconstitution assay, where both plasmids were co-transformed into the AH109 yeast strain and plated on high stringency SD medium. Preparation of JEG3 Cell Nuclear Extracts—Subconfluent JEG3 cells were used for the preparation of nuclear extracts. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen). Cells were collected by scraping in ice-cold PBS supplemented with a 1:1000 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture (referred to as protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma), 5 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a hypotonic buffer consisting of 120 mm potassium chloride, 30 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 0.3 m sucrose, protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and allowed to swell for 15 min on ice. Cells were lysed by Dounce homogenizing, and nuclei were isolated by layering the broken cell lysate over a sucrose cushion (0.9 m sucrose) followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Additional sodium chloride was added to a final concentration of 450 mm, and nuclear proteins were extracted with constant rocking at 4 °C for 30 min. Nuclear extracts were clarified by centrifugation (85,000 × g for 60 min), and the nuclear extract was stored in aliquots at -80 °C until later use. Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined by Bradford assay. Immunoprecipitation from JEG3 Nuclear Extracts and Western Blotting Analysis—JEG3 cell nuclear extracts (200 μg) were suspended in 1 ml of 0.1% Triton X buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% Triton X, protease inhibitor mixture, 5 mm benzamidine, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). To preclear the nuclear extracts, protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to each suspension and allowed to mix for 1 h at 4°C with gentle rocking. Following centrifugation (1200 × g for 1 min) to remove protein A/G-agarose, antibodies were added at the following dilutions: normal rabbit serum at 1:1000; Dlx3 antibody at 1:1000; Smad6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:100. Following 2 h of gentle rocking at 4 °C, protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and allowed to mix for an additional 2 h. Complexes were then washed four times with 0.1% Triton X buffer. Samples were then suspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 200 mm dithiothreitol). Protein samples were boiled for 3 min and chilled for 5 min on ice. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes by electro-blotting. Membranes were blocked with nonfat dried milk (5%) in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm sodium chloride) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). For Western blots, the Dlx3 antibody was used at 1:5000 in TBST, 5% nonfat dried milk. The reciprocal Western blot from immunoprecipitations (IPs) using the Smad6 antibody was not possible, since the IP heavy chain IgG blocked visualization of Smad6 on Western blot due to similar molecular size. In other Western blot studies, the Smad6 antibody was used at 1:500, and the actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Proteins bands were visualized by chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunocytochemistry—JEG3 cells were cultured on glass slides or coverslips for 24 h, rinsed one time with potassium phosphate-buffered saline (KPBS), and then fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides or coverslips were then stored in 70% ethanol until used. Prior to use, slides were rinsed in KPBS seven times over 1 h. JEG3 cells were incubated with primary antibody (Smad6 at 1:100; Dlx3 at 1:500) overnight at 4 °C. Slides were again rinsed with KPBS, followed by incubation with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa 594, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene OR; and Cy2, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Westgrove, PA) in KPBS-Triton X at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were rinsed in KPBS, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and cleared with xylene, and coverslips were attached with Krystalon (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ). Samples of human term placenta (derived from elective caesarian section) were obtained from Cayuga Medical Center (Ithaca, NY) under the guidelines and approval of the Cornell University and the Cayuga Medical Center Committees on the Use of Human Subjects in Research. Samples were collected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, and transferred to 70% ethanol until processing. Tissues were paraffin-embedded, and 5-μm sections were obtained. Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described (14.Roberson M.S. Meermann S. Morasso M.I. Mulvaney-Musa J.M. Zhang T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10016-10024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies were used as described above. Recombinant Proteins and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Recombinant Smad6, Smad4, Dlx4, Dlx3, and deletions of Dlx3 were prepared using a coupled transcription and translation Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) following the prescribed protocol. Proteins were radioactively labeled using [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences). A portion (10%) of each recombinant protein was saved for input analysis. Protein combinations were added at a 1:1 (by volume) mixture to a 0.1% Triton X buffer along with appropriate antibody at specified concentrations (Dlx3 at 1:1000; Smad6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:100; and Smad4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:500). Following 2 h of gentle rocking at 4 °C, protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and allowed to mix for an additional 2 h. Complexes were then washed four times with 0.1% Triton X buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was fixed in 25% methanol and 15% glacial acetic acid for 1 h with gentle rocking at room temperature. The gel was then washed three times in 40% isopropyl alcohol solution and dried, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out as described previously (14.Roberson M.S. Meermann S. Morasso M.I. Mulvaney-Musa J.M. Zhang T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10016-10024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18.Holland M.P. Bliss S.P. Berghorn K.A. Roberson M.S. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using the indicated antibodies. Reactions (without probe) were maintained at room temperature for 30 min followed by the addition of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide Dlx3 binding site probes (the junctional regulatory element (JRE) from the glycoprotein hormoneα subunit promoter (14.Roberson M.S. Meermann S. Morasso M.I. Mulvaney-Musa J.M. Zhang T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10016-10024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and two putative Dlx3 binding sites identified within the Esx1 promoter). The binding reactions were maintained an additional 30 min and then resolved on native polyacrylamide gels. To determine whether Smad6 could displace prebound Dlx3 in EMSA, binding reactions containing Dlx3 alone were allowed to incubate with probe for 30 min to reach equilibrium. Smad6 protein was then added, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min. These reactions were compared with binding reactions where both Dlx3 and Smad6 were added together and incubated for the full 60 min. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. All DNA binding studies were conducted at least three times with similar results. The nucleotide sequences for probes were as follows (only one strand indicated): JRE, 5′-ACGTCATGGTAATTACACCAAG-3′; distal binding site, 5′-ACAAGGAGCTAATTTACTTCCT-3′; proximal binding site, 5′-TTAGGGCTCTAATTCAGACTCT-3′. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Studies—JEG3 cells were cultured in monolayer using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%). Before transfection studies, cells were split to 35-mm dishes, and subconfluent cultures were used. JEG3 cells were transiently co-transfected with an Esx1 promoter luciferase reporter construct, Dlx3 expression vector at a constant dose (2.0μg), and increasing doses of Smad6 expression vector using lipofection (FuGENE 6 transfection reagent; Roche Applied Science). All transfections were carried out with a constant amount of DNA by supplementing reactions with the parent vector pKH3. Luciferase activity was determined after 24 h of transfection using reagents from the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega Corp.), and luciferase activity was standardized by total cell protein amount (luciferase/1.0 μg) as determined by a Bradford assay. All transfection studies were conducted in triplicate on at least three separate occasions with similar results. Data are shown as means (n = 3) ± S.E. of a representative experiment. Preparation of Stable Cell Lines Expressing Small Interference RNAs (siRNAs)—The mammalian expression vector, pSUPER-retro-neo (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was used for preparation of retrovirus containing specific siRNAs and expression of siR-NAs in JEG3 cells following viral infection. Each gene-specific insert targeted a 19-nucleotide sequence within the human Smad6 mRNA. The siRNA sequences were as follows: Smad6-#1, 5′-CACATTGTCTTACACTGAA; Smad6-#2, 5′-TCAAGGTGTTCGACTTCGA; Smad6-#3, 5′-GCCACTGGATCTGTCCGAT. The plasmids were referred to as Smad6 siRNA#1, siRNA#2, and siRNA#3. A control siRNA vector (also prepared in pSUPER-retro-neo) was constructed using a 19-nucleotide sequence (5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) putatively without significant similarity to any mammalian gene sequence and therefore served as an appropriate negative control (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA). The forward and reverse strands of oligonucleotides containing the siRNAs and nonsense sequence also contained BglII and HindIII sites at the 5′-end of the forward and reverse oligonucleotides, respectively. The oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into the pSUPER-retro-neo vector after digestion of the vector with BglII and HindIII. These siRNAs were a self-contained hairpin loop for the double-stranded siRNA. All siRNA sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Retroviral Infection of siRNAs—HEK293 Phoenix Ampho packaging cells (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected with the pSUPER-retro-neo siRNA plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Forty-eight hours following transfection, the culture media containing the retrovirus for individual siRNAs and control siRNA were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the viral supernatant was used for infection of JEG3 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. JEG3 cells were exposed to the retrovirus overnight, and cells were then washed with fresh medium and allowed to recover for 24 h. Following infection, stable cell lines were selected using neomycin at 500 μg/ml for 7 days (time until untransfected cells all died), and then cultures were maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml neomycin. Transient transfections of the siRNA cell lines were carried out as described above. Statistical Analysis—Luciferase data were subjected to analysis of variance, and differences between treatments were determined using Tukey's Studentized Range Test. Probability of less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. Dlx3 and Smad6 Functionally Interact in a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Full-length human Dlx3 was used as a bait protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human term placental library. The screen included coverage of ∼3.4 × 106 independent clones. Once colonies were identified from the original screen and library plasmids were rescued, plasmids were retransformed in a reconstitution assay with the bait vector into the AH109 yeast strain. The library plasmid resulting in the most robust interaction (as measured by β-galactosidase activity) with Dlx3 was a cDNA containing the entire coding region of Smad6. Transformation of the Smad6 library vector alone did not support yeast growth on high stringency SD medium (Ade−/His−/Leu−/Trp−/X-α-gal) plates in the presence of 12 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Transformation of Dlx3 bait vector minimally supported yeast growth under the same conditions. Co-transformation of Dlx3 bait and Smad6 library plasmid resulted in rescue of yeast growth (Fig. 1A). Dlx3 and Smad6 Are Co-localized in the Nucleus in Choriocarcinoma Cells and in Human Placental Trophoblasts—Initially, studies focused on examining localization of Dlx3 and Smad6 proteins in cells of trophoblast origin. Dlx3 and Smad6 were expressed and localized primarily in the nuclear compartment in JEG3 cells (Fig. 1B), a choriocarcinoma cell line of trophoblast origin. Consistent with this observation, Dlx3 and Smad6 were nuclear localized to both cytotrophoblast and syncytial trophoblast within microvilli of fully differentiated term human placenta. Localization of Dlx3 in term placenta provided additional insight into the expression pattern of Dlx3 during gestation in primates. We have previously shown Dlx3 in placental trophoblasts in human placenta obtained at 8 weeks gestation during peak production of human CG (14.Roberson M.S."

The unique short gene product US2 is a 199-amino acid type I endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein that modulates surface expression of class I MHC products by targeting class I heavy chains for dislocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, where they undergo proteasomal degradation. Although the mechanism by which this viral protein targets class I heavy chains for destruction remains unclear, the putative US2 cytoplasmic tail comprised of only 14 residues is known to play a functional role. To determine the specific residues critical for mediating class I degradation, a mutagenesis analysis of the cytoplasmic tail of US2 was performed. Using truncation mutants, the removal of only 4 residues (mutant US2195) from the US2 carboxyl terminus completely abolishes class I destruction. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the US2 cytoplasmic tail revealed that the most critical residues for class I-induced destruction, cysteine 187, serine 190, tryptophan 193, and phenylalanine 196, occurs every third residue. This experimental data supports a model that the US2 cytoplasmic tail is in a310 helical configuration. Such a secondary structure would predict that one side of the 310 helical cytoplasmic tail would interact with the extraction apparatus to facilitate the dislocation and subsequent destruction of class I heavy chains.

Such a secondary structure would predict that one side of the 310 helical cytoplasmic tail would interact with the extraction apparatus to facilitate the dislocation and subsequent destruction of class I heavy chains. The mammalian immune system has evolved several mechanisms to survey for the presence of intracellular invaders such as viruses. One of the primary means to detect a virally infected cell is through the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 3The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility; aa, amino acid(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; Ig, immunoglobulin; US, unique short; HA, hemagglutinin. (1Townsend A. Bodmer H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 601-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Class I MHC molecules are assembled within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consist of a glycosylated heavy chain complexed with a light chain β2-microglobulin and an antigenic peptide of 8-10 residues to form a stable trimeric molecule (2Pamer E. Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The heterotrimer is competent to egress from the ER to the cell surface for recognition by CD8+ T lymphocytes. The class I MHC molecules alert the immune system to the presence of intracellular pathogens through the presentation of virally derived antigenic peptides. Recognition of the virus-infected cell by specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes induces the destruction of the infected cell allowing the host to clear the virus. Given the important role that antigen presentation plays in the detection and clearance of infected cells, many viruses have devised strategies to interfere with the surface expression of class I MHC molecules (3Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 4Hewitt E.W. Immunology. 2003; 110: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). One member of the β-herpes virus family, the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), employs numerous evasive strategies to hinder this arm of adaptive immunity and thereby avoid lysis of infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. HCMV expresses at least four gene products, all within the unique short (US) region of its genome (US3, US6, US2, and US11), that directly modulate class I MHC antigen presentation (5Vossen M.T. Westerhout E.M. Soderberg-Naucler C. Wiertz E.J. Immunogenetics. 2002; 54: 527-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The US3 glycoprotein transiently binds and retains peptide-loaded class I molecules within the ER, hindering their trafficking to the cell surface (6Ahn K. Angulo A. Ghazal P. Peterson P.A. Yang Y.

US6 complexes with the transporter associated with the antigen presentation complex, inhibiting binding of ATP and peptide translocation (8Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J.

The single-pass type I transmembrane glycoproteins US2 (aa 199) and US11 (aa 215) target class I heavy chains for destruction by the proteasome (10Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J.

Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). These tactics attenuate the surface expression of pathogen-derived peptides to allow HCMV to remain hidden from the immune system for at least a limited period of time. Expression of US2 or US11 viral gene products alone prevents the surface expression of class I molecules, a result that mimics an HCMV-infected cell (10Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). US2 and US11 catalyze the extraction of class I heavy chains from the ER to the cytosol by a process referred to as dislocation or retrotranslocation. Upon exposure of class I to the cytosolic face of the ER membrane, the cytosolic enzyme N-glycanase removes its N-linked glycan (12Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1039-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and class I is then degraded by the proteasome. US2- and US11-mediated destruction of class I heavy chains occurs in a similar manner to how misfolded ER proteins are destroyed by the ER quality control machinery (14Sayeed A. Ng D.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Proteins targeted for degradation in this manner include genetic mutants of α1-antitrypsin (16Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (17Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Also included in this pool of ER molecules targeted for proteasomal degradation are proteins involved in the physiological regulation of sterol and fatty acid metabolism (18Rape M. Jentsch S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1695: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, US2- and US11-mediated degradation of class I MHC can be used to delineate the mechanistic processes of ER quality control. In fact, proteasome degradation of an ER protein was initially characterized in US11- and US2-expressing cells (10Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The US2/US11 model cell system demonstrated that ER proteins slated for destruction are dislocated through the ER membrane, deglycosylated by N-glycanase, extracted from the ER membrane probably by the AAA-ATPase cdc48 complex (19Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), and degraded by the proteasome. Despite the fact that US2 and US11 catalyze the degradation of class I heavy chains with similar kinetics, they carry out their analogous function quite differently. These two viral HCMV molecules have markedly different structural and co-factor requirements to successfully accomplish the down-regulation of surface class I MHC molecules. For example, 1) US2 may prefer to degrade properly folded class I molecules, whereas US11 is indifferent to the tertiary structure of class I molecules (20Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); 2) US2 and US11 induce the accumulation of markedly unique ubiquitinylated class I MHC intermediates. Properly folded class I molecules are modified with 3-5 ubiquitins in a US2-dependent manner, whereas US11 catalyzes the polyubiquitinylation of class I molecules (21Furman M.H. Loureiro J. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34804-34811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 3) The ER resident protein derlin-1 is essential for US11-mediated class I degradation but not US2-induced class I destruction (23Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 24Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar), and 4) a crucial glutamine residue at position 192 in the US11 transmembrane domain is important for class I destruction, while the US2 cytoplasmic tail, aa 186-199, is responsible for the induction of class I degradation (23Lilley B.N. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 25Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Chevalier M.S. Daniels G.M. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8265-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These striking differences between US2- and US11-mediated class I destruction support a paradigm that the viral gene products utilize diverse sets of proteins to destroy class I heavy chains. We sought to further identify the relevant regions of the US2 cytoplasmic tail that are important for class I destruction. A mutagenesis study generating truncation and site-directed mutants uncovered that the most vital residues within the US2 cytoplasmic tail occur every third residue within the 14-amino acid cytoplamsic tail. The spatial pattern of these critical residues suggests that they are positioned along one side of a helical conformation. The secondary structure consistent with the experimental data implies that the tail is in a 310 helical conformation. Therefore, our data supports a model in which the US2 cytoplamsic tail may conform to a 310-helix and interact with ER and/or cytosolic factors to induce the extraction and degradation of class I molecules. Cells and Antibodies—Human U373-MG astrocytoma cells and U373 transfectants that stably express US2 mutant constructs (see below) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO2). GP2-293 cells (BD Biosciences) were utilized to generate retroviruses (see below) and were cultured in media similar to U373 cells. Anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-US2 antibody and anti-class I heavy chain antibody was raised against the bacterially expressed lumenal domain of US2 (aa 15-140) and class I heavy chain (HLA-A2 allele, aa 25-366), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies W6/32 (27Parham P. Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar) were purified from hybridoma-cultured supernatant. cDNA Constructs—The US2 site-directed cDNA constructs (US2D186A, US2C187A, US2N188A, US2L189A, US2S190A, US2M191A, US2M192A, US2W193A, US2M194A, US2R195A, US2F196A, US2F197A, US2V198A, US2C199A, US2F196D, US2F197D, and US2V198D) were generated from the ligation of two PCR fragments in which one fragment contained the mutated codon. The US2 carboxyl-terminal truncation cDNA constructs (US2198, US2197, US2196, US2195, US2194, US2192, US2190, US2188, and US2186) were amplified with a primer corresponding to the 5′ end of the US2 cDNA and a 3′ primer containing the respective US2 nucleotide sequence followed by the stop codon TAG. The chimeric US2186HA construct was generated from the ligation of a PCR product using a 5′ primer corresponding to the US2 cDNA and a 3′ primer containing the appropriate US2 sequence followed by the influenza hemagglutinin epitope tag sequence. All of the constructs were equipped with restriction sites that allowed for insertion into pcDNA3.1(+) and then were subsequently subcloned into the retrovirus vector pLgPW. pLgPW was derived from pLNCX (Clontech) in which the neomycin resistance selection marker was replaced by enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA (P. Stern and H. Ploegh, Harvard Medical School). Retrovirus Transduction—Retrovirus vectors containing the respective US2 cDNA constructs and the vesicular stomatitis virus-G envelope were transiently transfected simultaneously into GP2-293 cells (BD Biosciences) by a lipid-based protocol to produce a pseudo-typed Moloney murine leukemia virus amphotropic retrovirus. In brief, 2.5 μg of pLgPW:US2 constructs and 2.5 μg of a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (BD Biosciences) were mixed with 8 μlof Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The DNA-Lipofectamine complex was added dropwise to GP2-293 cells (0.5 × 106) containing 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 8% fetal calf serum and lacking antibiotics. The media was changed every 24 h for 2 days. Seventy-two hours post-transfection media containing retrovirus particles was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and added to U373 cells with a final concentration of 8 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma). Enhanced green fluorescent protein expressing cells were sorted using a MoFlo high-speed cell sorter (Cytomation) (Mount Sinai Flow Cytometry Facility) 3-5 days post-infection. Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—U373 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis mixture (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, supplemented with 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by the removal of nuclei and insoluble material using centrifugation (10 min, 14,500 × g at 4 °C). The lysates were incubated with the respective antibody followed by the addition of Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) for 1.5 h on a nutator at 4 °C. The Pansorbin cells were pelleted and washed 3 times with NET buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). The polypeptides were released from the Pansorbin cells with 1× SDS-sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 50 mm dithiothreitol), resolved using SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Metabolic Labeling of Cells and Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells were detached by trypsin treatment, followed by starvation in methionine-/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were metabolically labeled with 500 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (1,200 Ci/mm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences)/ml at 37 °C for the indicated times. For pulse-chase analysis, the cells were chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing an excess of 25 mm cold methionine for the indicated times. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in 1% SDS (100 μl/1 × 106 cells) with at least three rounds of incubation at 95 °C for 5 min and vigorous perturbation followed by the addition of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to dilute SDS to <0.1%. The Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer was supplemented with 3 μl of normal mouse serum/ml, 3 μlof normal rabbit serum/ml, 1.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were initially subjected to a precleared step that involved the addition of 50 μl of Pansorbin cells/ml of lysate and incubation on a nutator for 1 h at 4°C. The Pansorbin cells were centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 2 min and the respective polypeptides were recovered by immunoprecipitation as described above. The radioactive signal within the polyacrylamide gel was intensified using Autofluor (National Diagnostics). The dried polyacrylamide gel was exposed to autoradiography film for 2 days at -80 °C. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Quantitative flow cytometry analysis of surface expressed MHC class I molecules was assessed using W6/32 (1.5 μg of immunoglobulin/1 × 106 cells) followed by incubation with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) or Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). The fluorescence signal was measured from 10,000 cells using a Cytomics FC 500 Flow Cytometer (Beckman). The data were analyzed using Flow Jo software (Tree Star, Inc.). The levels of surface class I molecules are represented by plots of normalized cell number versus fluorescence signal. Normalized cell number was calculated by setting the maximum cell number at the respective peak fluorescence value to 100. The percentage of surface class I molecules was calculated using the mean surface class I signal from US2 cells versus control cells (U373 cells transduced with empty vector) multiplied by 100. Sequence Specificity of the HCMV US2 Cytoplasmic Tail Is Essential for Class I Degradation—HCMV US2 is a type I membrane glycoprotein comprised of 199 amino acids (28) that mediates the proteasomal destruction of class I MHC heavy chains (11Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 29Jones T.R. Sun L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2970-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). US2 consists of an ER lumenal class I domain (aa 1-160), a transmembrane domain (aa 161-185), and a putative cytoplasmic tail of 14 residues (aa 186-199) (Fig. 1A) (30Gewurz B.E. Wang E.W. Tortorella D. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5197-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A US2 molecule that lacks its cytoplasmic tail (US2186) does not induce class I destruction but continues to tightly complex with class I molecules (25Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26Chevalier M.S. Daniels G.M. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8265-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Hence, the US2 cytoplasmic tail is an important domain required for class I heavy chain destruction. To address if the specific peptide sequence of the US2 cytoplasmic tail is important for class I destruction, we generated a U373 cell line (“Experimental Procedures”) that expresses a chimeric US2 molecule in which the cytoplasmic tail of US2 was replaced with the influenza hemagglutinin epitope tag (US2186HA) (Fig. 1A). We examined the fate of newly synthesized class I heavy chains in US2186HA cells by pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 1B). The class I heavy chains (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-6) and US2 molecules (Fig. 1B, lanes 7-12) were recovered using their respective antisera. Similar levels of class I heavy chains were recovered throughout the chase periods from the control U373 and US2186HA cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-2 and 5-6) implying that US2186HA does not target class I for destruction. Results indicative of class I destruction were demonstrated by a decrease in class I heavy chains recovered from US2199 cells at the 0-min chase period and the lack of class I recovered from the 30-min chase period (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). Due to the kinetics of class I degradation and the pulse time (15 min), the class I synthesized during the pulse period is partially degraded prior to the start of the chase, hence less heavy chains are recovered at the 0-min chase period in US2199 cells compared with control cells. US2 wild type amended with the HA tag (US2199HA) continues to down-regulate class I molecules excluding the possibility that the HA tag can inhibit class I degradation. 4K. Oresic, V. Noriega, and D. Tortorella, unpublished observations. To verify that the lack of class I destruction in US2186HA cells was not due to expression levels of the US2 polypeptides, equivalent levels of US2199 and US2186HA were recovered from the respective cell lysates (Fig. 1B, lanes 9-12). Our results demonstrate that US2186HA does not induce the destruction of newly synthesized class I molecules. Does US2186HA down-regulate surface class I MHC molecules? To address this question, we examined the cell surface class I molecules in US2186HA cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 1C) (“Experimental Procedures”). Control (U373) and wild type US2199 cells were used as negative and positive controls for class I MHC down-regulation. An immunoglobulin isotype control (solid line) was utilized to examine the background fluorescence signal (Fig. 1C, upper panel). A similar isotype control signal was observed in all subsequent flow cytometry experiments. As expected, a decrease of surface class I molecules was observed from US2199 cells (dashed line) when compared with control U373 cells (shaded) (Fig. 1C, upper panel). On the other hand, similar levels of surface class I molecules were exhibited on both US2186HA (solid line) and U373 cells (shaded) (Fig. 1C, lower panel) providing further evidence that US2186HA does not induce class I destruction. These data indicate that flow cytometry is a reliable assay to measure US2-mediated class I degradation. To exclude the possibility that the inability of US2186HA to induce class I destruction is due to folding defects within US2186HA, we performed an US2/class I association experiment. Properly folded class I molecules and US2 polypeptides were recovered from U373, US2199, and US2186HA cells using W6/32 (Fig. 1D, lanes 1-3) and rabbit anti-US2 polyclonal serum (Fig. 1D, lanes 4-6), respectively. The precipitates were subjected to an immunoblot using rabbit anti-class I heavy chain and anti-US2 sera. We obtained equivalent amounts of class I heavy chains from U373 and US2186HA cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 3), whereas less class I was recovered from US2199 cells (Fig. 1D, lane 2). US2186HA was observed to co-precipitate with class I MHC molecules indicating that US2186HA associates with class I (Fig. 1D, lane 3). We did not observe US2199 co-precipitation with class I molecules (Fig. 1D, lane 2). This is most likely due to the relatively small amount of class I recovered in the W6/32 precipitates. US2199 and US2186HA polypeptides were precipitated from the respective cell lines (Fig. 1D, lanes 4-6). Collectively, the data demonstrate that US2186HA does not target class I for degradation because it lacks the necessary residues within its cytoplasmic tail. Identification of the HCMV US2 Cytoplasmic Tail Region Important for Class I Degradation—Specific regions of the putative US2 cytoplasmic tail are likely responsible for mediating class I destruction (Fig. 1). To identify the cytoplasmic tail region necessary to induce class I destruction, we constructed US2 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants US2186, US2188, US2190, US2192, US2194, US2196, and US2198 (Fig. 2A). The levels of class I MHC and US2 were examined from equivalent numbers of U373, wild type US2199, US2198, US2196, US2194, US2192, US2190, US2188, and US2186 cells using an anti-class I heavy chain (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-9), and an anti-US2 immunoblot (Fig. 2B, lanes 10-18). An anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase immunoblot was used as a loading control (Fig. 2B, lanes 19-27). The N-linked glycan acquired by class I MHC molecules is subjected to post-translation modifications in the secretory compartments yielding class I molecules that migrate as two populations on a highly cross-linked SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15%) (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-9). The data reveals that US2198 targets class I for destruction with similar effectiveness as US2199. Interestingly, US2196 also targets class I for destruction, albeit less efficiently than wild type US2. In contrast, US2188, US2190, US2192, and US2194 cells have equivalent levels of class I as control (U373) cells. The data suggests that the removal of only three residues from the carboxyl terminus can alter the ability of US2 to induce class I destruction. The expression of US2 polypeptides in the respective cell lines was validated by an anti-US2 immunoblot (Fig. 2B, lanes 10-18). As expected, US2 polypeptides were not observed in U373 cells (Fig. 2B, lane 10). The US2 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants migrated slightly faster in a stepwise fashion when compared with wild type US2199 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2-9) confirming their expression. We observed almost equivalent levels of US2 polypeptides with the exception of US2198. These results suggest that only a small amount of US2 polypeptide is required to target class I for destruction. Overexpression of a mutant such as US2194 cannot compensate for its inability to induce class I destruction. To verify the ability of the US2 truncation mutants to down-regulate class I molecules, we subjected U373, US2186, US2188, US2190, US2192, US2194, US2196, US2198, and wild type US2199 cells to flow cytometry (Fig. 3A). A significant reduction of surface class I was observed in cells that express US2199 and US2198 (∼90%), whereas the surface class I in US2196 cells was modestly reduced (∼70%). The intermediate result observed in US2196 cells suggests that class I is probably degraded at a slower rate. In contrast, the levels of class I molecules observed from US2194, US2192, US2190, US2188, and US2186 cells were similar to that of U373 cells (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate that the four amino acids (aa 196-199) carboxyl-terminal are involved in class I degradation. To confirm that the class I binding domain of the US2 carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants was not altered, we performed an US2/class I association experiment. Class I MHC molecules were recovered from U373, wild type US2199, US2198, US2196, US2194, US2192, US2190, US2188, and US2186 cells using W6/32. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by an immunoblot using anti-US2 and anti-class I heavy chain sera (Fig. 3B). As expected, class I heavy chains were recovered from the W6/32 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-9). Because class I is degraded in US2199, US2198, and US2196 cells, class I molecules were recovered from an increased number of cells to visualize equivalent amounts of class I heavy chains in all samples. All of the respective US2 polypeptides co-precipitated with class I molecules (Fig. 3B, lanes 2-9). Thus, we conclude that the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants that did not induce class I degradation was not due to a defective class I binding domain. To further delineate the US2 cytoplasmic tail length requirement for class I MHC destruction, we generated U373 cells that stably express the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants US2195 and US2197 (Fig. 4A). An immunoblot using anti-US2 serum confirmed that these molecules were expressed in the respective cell line (supplemental Fig. 1). As with the other carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants, US2197 and US2195 continued to associat"
