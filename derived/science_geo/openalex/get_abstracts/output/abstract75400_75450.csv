https://openalex.org/W1923689855,Ubiquinol-6 (reduced coenzyme Q6) was more effective than ubiquinone-6 and almost as effective as α-tocopherol in reducing the stable free radical diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl. The antioxidant activity of ubiquinol-6 was measured at low oxygen concentrations with an oxygen electrode. Ubiquinol-6 was found to be as efficient as α-tocopherol as an inhibitor of the heme-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid emulsions. Ubiquinol-6 was oxidized to ubiquinone-6 by free radical products of the heme-catalyzed decomposition of cumene hydroperoxide. α-Tocopherol did not inhibit this reaction. Light was used to catalyze the peroxidation of mitochondrial lipids at low concentrations of oxygen. This peroxidation was inhibited by the addition of ubiquinol-6 or α-tocopherol to the mitochondria. Light-induced mitochondrial peroxidation was inhibited by ubiquinol-6 produced from exogenous ubiquinone-6 by the electron transport-linked oxidation of β-hydroxybutyrate. Ubiquinols may function as antioxidants in the mitochondrion. This could explain why ubiquinones and related compounds have been found effective in the relief of certain vitamin E deficiency syndromes in some species.
https://openalex.org/W1573624681,"The spinach leaf adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase has been purified about 260-fold. The enzyme was activated by 3-phosphoglycerate and other glycolytic intermediates, and was inhibited by inorganic phosphate and ADP. Phosphate inhibition could be overcome by increasing 3-phosphoglycerate concentrations. ADP inhibition could be only partially overcome by increasing 3-phosphoglycerate concentrations. The 3-phosphoglycerate saturation curve is hyperbolic at neutral pH. At alkaline pH, however, the curve is sigmoidal. Kinetic studies suggest that the activators fructose diphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate bind to the same sites as 3-phosphoglycerate. These results suggest a mechanism for the regulation of starch synthesis in spinach leaf chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W1665143716,Abstract Administration of allylisopropylacetamide to rats causes a marked increase in the hepatic ribonucleic acid-dependent synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase as evidenced by the fact that this increase is markedly inhibited by administration of actinomycin D or 5-fluorouracil. The half-life of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase following puromycin administration is 67 to 72 min and is independent of the level of the enzyme. The administration of actinomycin D or 5-fluorouracil to rats previously treated with allylisopropylacetamide results in a rapid decline of the hepatic levels of induced δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase. This suggests that the turnover of the messenger RNA for hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase is considerably more rapid than the bulk of rat liver messenger RNA. Glucose markedly inhibits induction of hepatic δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase and also the increase of δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase produced by allylisopropylacetamide administration.
https://openalex.org/W1559523671,"Abstract Kinetic data are presented which are consistent with the concept that the mechanism of tyrosine hydroxylase involves the following sequential steps: (a) reduction of an oxidized form of the enzyme by 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6,7-dimethyltetrahydropteridine (DMPH4) followed by dissociation of the oxidized pteridine, and (b) aerobic oxidation of tyrosine, producing 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) and the oxidized form of the enzyme. This concept is supported by studies of the effects of the substrates on initial velocities as well as by the use of dopa and analogues of substrates and products as inhibitors. Tyrosine and its analogues bind to a reduced form of the enzyme, while dopa and its analogues bind to an oxidized form of the enzyme. Deviations from this pattern occur at concentrations several times the Michaelis constant. At such concentrations tyrosine and its analogues can be bound to an oxidized form of the enzyme, while dopa and its analogues and DMPH4 can be bound to a reduced form of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1501497173,"Abstract Leucine transaminase was purified extensively from pig heart muscle. It appeared to be nearly homogeneous by the criteria of both starch gel and free boundary electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The molecular weight was found to be 75,000. Purified leucine transaminase is yellow, and our best preparations contained 1 mole of bound pyridoxal phosphate per 75,000 g of protein. The spectrum of the enzyme has absorption maxima at 414 mµ and 326 mµ in addition to the characteristic 280-mµ peak. Addition of an amino acid substrate shifted the 414-mµ peak to 326 mµ, whereupon addition of the corresponding α-keto acid partially reversed this shift. Incubation of the enzyme with an amino acid substrate plus a high concentration of phosphate yielded an inactive apoenzyme which could be reconstituted with pyridoxal phosphate. Loss of activity was correlated with a loss of absorption in the visible region. The enzyme activity was inhibited by carbonyl reagents. Reduction with sodium borohydride completely shifted the 414-mµ peak to 320 mµ and destroyed the transaminase activity. Acid hydrolysis of the reduced enzyme yielded a fluorescent compound which was tentatively identified as e-pyridoxal lysine. Leucine transaminase displayed a bell-shaped pH-activity curve with an apparent optimum at pH 8.3 to 8.5; however, it was most stable at pH 6 to 7. At pH 8.5 and in the presence of 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, this single enzyme catalyzed transamination between l-glutamate, l-leucine, l-valine, or l-isoleucine and their α-keto forms. Under arbitrary conditions, the relative rates of transamination were of the same order of magnitude with a maximum difference of 5-fold."

https://openalex.org/W1514958522,"Throughout the late 1960s, the primary concern of Anfinsen's laboratory was to understand the relationship between structure
 and function in staphylococcal nuclease. Anfinsen chose to study this enzyme because it was relatively small, with only 149
 amino acids, and because it appeared to be entirely dependent on noncovalent binding for the maintenance of an ordered catalytically
 active structure. In this series of three articles, authored by Anfinsen and Taniuchi, but based primarily on research conducted
 by the latter, the two scientists presented the first analysis of the primary sequence of the enzyme."

A third stimulus was then selected so as to mask the second when the second and the third were presented in the absence of the first. When all three stimuli were presented in serial order, the first and third were reliably detected but the second was not. Apparently, by masking the second flash, the third ""disinhibited"" the first."
https://openalex.org/W2032027092,"Ciliary reversal occurs in response to electrical and chemical stimuli in specimens of Paramecium caudatum in which ciliary beat has been completely inhibited by external application of nickel ions. The mechanism underlying ciliary reversal appears, therefore, to differ from that of ciliary beat. The cessation of ciliary beat has no effect on the intracellular potential of Paramecium. However, depolarizing action potentials are associated with ciliary reversals in paramecia, treated with nickel, without ciliary beat. Thus, membrane depolarization in this species seems specifically concerned with the ciliary reversal, and not with ciliary beat."

https://openalex.org/W3487810,"Abstract A simple colorimetric assay for measuring leucine-α-ketoglutarate transamination is described. It is reproducible, sensitive, and specific for α-ketoisocaproate. α-Ketoglutarate interferes only in that high concentrations decrease the color yield. This assay is suitable for detailed kinetic studies, even with crude tissue extracts, provided one corrects for this effect of α-ketoglutarate. A separate method was also described whereby transamination between isoleucine (or valine) and α-ketoglutarate can be measured, although this assay is not specific for the leucine transaminase in crude tissue extracts. The α-ketoisocaproate assay was used to examine subcellular fractions of pig heart muscle. Most of the activity was found in the soluble fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1591215983,"Abstract An enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of l-cystathionine from the succinyl ester of l-homoserine and l-cysteine was isolated from a Salmonella mutant blocked in another step of methionine synthesis, and derepressed for cystathionine γ-synthetase formation. The approximate molecular weight of the enzyme was 155,000 and it was unchanged after removal of tightly bound pyridoxal phosphate. In the absence of cysteine the same enzyme catalyzed the formation of α-ketobutyrate from O-succinyl-l-homoserine. This γ elimination reaction was relatively slow, although the Km for succinylhomoserine was much lower than in the presence of cysteine. β-Mercaptopropionate inhibited elimination, as did other mercaptans with α-, β-, or γ-carboxyl group, without changing the Km for succinylhomoserine; none of the mercaptans tested could replace l-cysteine as substrate. Only O-acetylhomoserine was found able to replace succinylhomoserine. N-Ethylmaleimide had been shown to trap an intermediary precursor of α-ketobutyrate during decomposition of succinylhomoserine catalyzed by another enzyme. This trapping reaction was shown to occur to a much smaller extent when the same reaction was catalyzed by cystathionine γ-synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1581017914,"Abstract The hydroxynitrile lyases of etiolated sorghum seedlings and ground almonds have been purified to homogeneity as seen in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The sorghum enzyme preferentially catalyzed the dissociation of p-hydroxymandelonitrile, whereas the almond enzyme exhibited its maximum rate on mandelonitrile; p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and benzaldehyde, respectively, together with HCN, were the products of the reaction. The almond enzyme was found to contain a flavin prosthetic group and the sorghum enzyme did not. Physical and kinetic characteristics of the two hydroxynitrile lyases were compared and were found to be quite different."
https://openalex.org/W1527980799,"Abstract Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria isolated from a cytochrome c-deficient mutant of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, may be efficiently reconstituted by addition of purified yeast or horse heart cytochrome c. Added cytochrome c is tightly bound and is retained during reisolation of mitochondria. Reconstituted mutant mitochondria carry out oxidative phosphorylation with substrates linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, flavoprotein, and cytochrome c as efficiently as mitochondria isolated from wild type yeast under the same conditions. Titration of mutant mitochondria with yeast cytochrome c leads to progressive increases in P:O ratios as well as to increases in rates of phosphate and oxygen uptake. The end points of such titrations indicate that reconstitution is stoichiometric at a ratio of 0.2 mµmole of cytochrome c per mg of mitochondrial protein, approximately the amount of cytochrome c in normal wild type mitochondria. Respiration in mutant mitochondria can be restored equally well by two types of yeast cytochrome c (iso-1- and iso-2-cytochrome c) and by horse heart cytochrome c. The two types of yeast cytochrome c are virtually equivalent in restoring phosphorylation coupled to succinate oxidation, whereas the horse heart enzyme is less effective. Mutant mitochondria reconstituted with iso-1-cytochrome c catalyze phosphorylating oxidation of succinate, α-ketoglutarate, glutathione plus tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, pyruvate plus malate, and d-lactate plus malate with efficiency comparable to that of normal yeast mitochondria. Ethanol oxidation was partially restored. Oxidative phosphorylation with l-lactate, even in the presence of added malate to provide citric acid cycle intermediates, was poorly restored by either of the isocytochromes c."
https://openalex.org/W1525453277,"Abstract Iodination of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A at 0° and pH 8.5 leads to the formation of 3 iodinated tyrosyl residues and 1 iodinated histidyl residue. The yield of iodinated amino acids is not significantly different at 24°. Carboxymethylation of histidine-119 reduces the total organic iodine from ∼8 to ∼6 g atoms per mole. This decrease is almost entirely accounted for by a lack of iodohistidine formation and suggests that it is this histidyl residue that is iodinated in the native protein. Subtilisin treatment of iodinated RNase A produces iodinated S-protein and uniodinated S-peptide, suggesting that histidine-12 is not iodinated. Phosphate, pyrophosphate, and cytidine monophosphate reduce total iodine incorporation largely by decreasing iodohistidine formation. Enzymatic activity against 2',3'-cyclic CMP is essentially unaffected by the incorporation of 2 g atoms of iodine per mole, but decreases as a function of iodine content with increasing iodination. Preliminary evidence suggests that the initial loss of activity is due primarily to tyrosine iodination."
https://openalex.org/W1668826632,"A monoamine oxidase has been identified in rabbit serum and purified approximately 450-fold by a procedure involving fractionation with ammonium sulfate and adsorption on calcium phosphate. The purified enzyme has an absorption maximum at 470 mµ, which is decreased in the presence of substrate. It oxidizes primary amines with the stoichiometric formation of the corresponding aldehydes, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia. Substrates most actively oxidized by the enzyme are substituted phenylethylamines (e.g. dopamine, tyramine, mescaline) and C-arylmethylamines. Less actively oxidized substrates include tryptamine, serotonin, histamine, and simple aliphatic amines. The effect of pH upon apparent Michaelis constants and maximal velocities of benzylamine oxidation has been studied. The results indicate that the protonated species of the amine interacts with the free enzyme and that this interaction is affected by an ionization (pKa 6.2) of the enzyme. An ionization (pKa 6.4 to 6.5) of the enzyme-substrate complex is a determinant of maximal velocities."

The molecular properties of reduced carboxymethylated thyroglobulin have been investigated in aqueous solution by sedimentation velocity, viscosity, difference spectra, optical rotation, polarization of fluorescence, electrophoresis, spectrophotometric titration, and Ouchterlony gel diffusion. These methods indicate that the reduced form of thyroglobulin is a two-chain molecule which is comparable in rigidity to the native form, although differing significantly in being highly permeated by solvent. It is suggested that the form of the molecule may be envisioned as similar to that of a sponge."

Micrococcal nuclease from the strain Foggi has been purified from a commercially available source (Worthington). The enzyme was crystallized from an ammonium sulfate solution.

Octylguanidine, but not oligomycin or aurovertin, markedly inhibited the histone-induced increment in respiration. On the other hand the histone stimulated oligomycin- or aurovertin-inhibited respiration, but had no effect on respiration inhibited by octylguanidine. The stimulation of oxygen consumption by f2a was accompanied by an energy-dependent K+ efflux."

Peptides were isolated from a chymotryptic digest of the protein and the sequences were determined. By comparison with other mammalian cytochromes, the complete sequence could be assigned. Whale cytochrome c most closely resembles those from bovine, porcine, and ovine heart tissue, differing from these in only 2 residues. This finding is consistent with the view that the Cetacea were derived from mammals closely related to the Artiodactyla."

https://openalex.org/W1584545289,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion of horse heart cytochrome c has been compared with that of model heme octapeptide systems. When one of the coordination positions about the heme iron of the peptide systems is occupied by the imidazole side chain of the single histidine residue, dispersion curves are obtained which, in a number of respects, are similar to those of the intact protein. There are also, however, major differences. The most striking of these occur in the Soret region, where the patterns recorded for the peptide complexes resemble more nearly those for myoglobin and hemoglobin than those for horse heart cytochrome c. Only with the heme peptide in aggregated form were curves obtained which approach the pattern for the parent ferricytochrome molecule in the Soret region. Complexes of the oxidized heme peptide with extrinsic imidazole and with methionine derivatives yield curves which exhibit, in addition to the Cotton effects in the Soret region, a broad positive extremum in the range 500 to 600 mµ, and multiple Cotton effects in the ultraviolet. Reduction of these complexes results in shifts of the curves to longer wave lengths in the Soret region, the appearance of well defined Cotton effects associated with the hemochrome bands near 520 and 550 mµ, and extensive modification of the complicated pattern in the ultraviolet region. The curves obtained differ for the two oxidation states throughout the wave length range studied (220 to 620 mµ). Rotations recorded at wave lengths near 230 mµ are greater than those calculated for 8 residues in random coil form on the basis of relationships for simple polypeptides. This excess rotation is not diminished by the addition of 8 m urea, but is reduced greatly upon protonation or photooxidation of the histidine residue of the peptide. Such treatment leads also to loss of the large Cotton effect in the Soret region."

https://openalex.org/W33077377,"Purified histone fractions were found to interact with the mitochondrial membrane system, causing a reduction in optical density as a result of swelling and aggregation. The arginine-rich f2a was the most active fraction; threshold concentration was approximately 1 µg per mg of mitochondrial protein. Adenosine 5‘-triphosphate slowed and guanosine 5‘-triphosphate prevented the histone-induced swelling, while all other nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphates were without effect. Oligomycin, aurovertin, or strontium enhanced the protective action of ATP. Amytal, azide, antimycin, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone did not significantly affect the histone-induced changes. Octylguanidine and chlorpromazine markedly retarded the swelling process. The most active polyanionic protective compounds were gangliosides, phosphoproteins, and phosphatidylserine."
https://openalex.org/W1494016612,"Abstract Highly purified leucine transaminase from pig heart was observed to undergo activation in the presence of several thiol compounds. β-Mercaptoethanol was the most effective thiol compound tested. It yielded a 3- to 4-fold increase in activity when added either directly to the standard assay system or first incubated with excess enzyme alone and diluted out just prior to assay. Leucine transaminase was inhibited markedly by low concentrations of heavy metal ions and mercaptide-forming reagents. One of our most active preparations contained eight p-chloromercuribenzoate titratable sulfhydryl groups per 75,000 g of protein; however, about 90% of the residual activity (i.e. minus β-mercaptoethanol) was lost when only four had reacted with p-chloromercuribenzoate. β-Mercaptoethanol partially reversed inhibition by excess p-chloromercuribenzoate, restoring 75% of the initial activity. Enzyme centrifuged at an initial protein concentration of 7 to 8 mg per ml gave an s20,w value near 5.0 when examined either directly in phosphate buffer or first activated and then centrifuged in phosphate-0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol. If, however, the enzyme was first activated and the β-mercaptoethanol was removed by dialysis, heavier material with an s20,w of 6.8 appeared in the schlieren pattern along with the original peak. Aggregation was correlated with a loss of the increased activity generated by prior treatment with β-mercaptoethanol."
