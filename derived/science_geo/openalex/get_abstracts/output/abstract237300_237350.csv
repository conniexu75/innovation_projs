https://openalex.org/W2024653871,"High density lipoprotein (HDL) isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions and the blood of patients with established coronary artery disease contains elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and 3-chlorotyrosine. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the only known source of 3-chlorotyrosine in humans, indicating that MPO oxidizes HDL <i>in vivo</i>. In the current studies, we used tandem mass spectrometry to identify the major sites of tyrosine oxidation when lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein of HDL, was exposed to MPO or peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>-</sup>). Tyrosine 192 was the predominant site of both nitration and chlorination by MPO and was also the major site of nitration by ONOO<sup>-</sup>. Electron paramagnetic spin resonance studies of spin-labeled apoA-I revealed that residue 192 was located in an unusually hydrophilic environment. Moreover, the environment of residue 192 became much more hydrophobic when apoA-I was incorporated into discoidal HDL, and Tyr<sup>192</sup> of HDL-associated apoA-I was a poor substrate for nitration by both myeloperoxidase and ONOO<sup>-</sup>, suggesting that solvent accessibility accounted in part for the reactivity of Tyr<sup>192</sup>. The ability of lipid-free apoA-I to facilitate ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 cholesterol transport was greatly reduced after chlorination by MPO. Loss of activity occurred in concert with chlorination of Tyr<sup>192</sup>. Both ONOO<sup>-</sup> and MPO nitrated Tyr<sup>192</sup> in high yield, but unlike chlorination, nitration minimally affected the ability of apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux from cells. Our results indicate that Tyr<sup>192</sup> is the predominant site of nitration and chlorination when MPO or ONOO<sup>-</sup> oxidizes lipid-free apoA-I but that only chlorination markedly reduces the cholesterol efflux activity of apoA-I. This impaired biological activity of chlorinated apoA-I suggests that MPO-mediated oxidation of HDL might contribute to the link between inflammation and cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1973400979,"SHP2 was recently found to down-regulate PI3K activation by dephosphorylating Gab1 but the mechanisms explaining the positive role of the Gab1/SHP2 pathway in EGF-induced Ras activation remain ill defined. Substrate trapping experiments now suggest that SHP2 dephosphorylates other Gab1 phosphotyrosines located within a central region displaying four YXXP motifs. Because these sites are potential docking motifs for Ras-GAP, we tested whether SHP2 dephosphorylates them to facilitate Ras activation. We observed that a Gab1 construct preventing SHP2 recruitment promoted membrane relocation of RasGAP. Moreover, a RasGAP-inactive mutant restored the activation of Ras in cells transfected with SHP2-inactivating Gab1 mutant or in SHP2-deficient fibroblasts, supporting the hypothesis that RasGAP is a downstream target of SHP2. To determine whether Gab1 is a RasGAP-binding partner, a Gab1 mutant deleted of four YXXP motifs was produced. The deletion suppressed RasGAP redistribution and restored the defective Ras activation caused by SHP2-inactivating mutations. Moreover, Gab1 was found to interact with RasGAP SH2 domains, only under conditions where SHP2 is not activated. To identify Ras-GAP-binding sites, Tyr to Phe mutants of Gab1 YXXP motifs were produced. Gab1 constructs mutated on Tyr317 were severely affected in RasGAP binding and were the most active in compensating for Ras-defective activation and blocking RasGAP redistribution induced by SHP2 inactivation. We have thus localized on Gab1 a Ras-negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site involved in RasGAP binding and showed that an important SHP2 function is to down-regulate its phosphorylation to disengage RasGAP and sustain Ras activation.

The GTPase Ras is a crucial signaling relay of receptor tyrosine kinases, and the mechanisms controlling its activation by growth factors appear well understood. For example, the activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; Gab1-ΔPQ, Gab1 deleted between Pro161 and Gln318; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GAP3S, SH2-SH3-SH2 domains of RasGAP; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope tag; IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RBD, Ras-GTP binding domain; SH, Src homology; SHP2-C/S, SHP2 catalytically inactive mutant; WT, wild-type; Erk1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; C/S, C459S mutant; 2RQ, R789Q/R903Q double mutant. receptor (EGFR) autophosphorylates on tyrosine residues, which creates docking sites for phosphotyrosine-binding domains (e.g. SH2) of adaptor proteins, including Grb2 and Shc. Because Grb2 is constitutively associated with Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor of Ras, the binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated EGFR results in the recruitment of Sos to the plasma membrane and has been proposed as a model for activation of membrane-bound Ras. Once activated, Ras can stimulate several effectors, notably the protein Ser/Thr kinase Raf1 and the downstream activated mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1/2, major regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). Although this pathway has reached a canonical status, the docking protein Gab1 and one of its binding partners, SHP2, were recently found to participate in Ras/Erk activation in response to EGF and other growth factors (2Shi Z.Q.

SHP2 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains and phosphorylation sites with affinity for Grb2 SH2 domains. Its catalytic activity is stimulated by engagement of its SH2 domains with specific phosphorylated motifs that, in the case of EGF signaling, are provided by Gab1. Gab1 contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, multiple Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphorylation sites, and two Grb2 SH3-binding motifs. In response to EGF, Gab1 is recruited through Grb2 in the vicinity of the activated EGFR and becomes phosphorylated. As a result, Gab1 attracts and activates two partners that are essential for EGFR-mediated biological responses: SHP2 (6Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and the p85/p110 subtype of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the lipid products of which are also involved in Gab1 recruitment (5Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N.K. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). It is now well accepted that SHP2 is functionally an atypical phosphatase that plays a positive role in the biological responses to growth factors, and the Ras/Erk pathway represents the major signaling module positively regulated by this phosphatase (2Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Schaeper U. Gehring N.H. Fuchs K.P. Sachs M. Kempkes B. Birchmeier W. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Yet, the mechanisms underlying this regulation have remained elusive. SHP2 has been first proposed to act as an adaptor in the case of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling, because it can bind to the PDGF receptor then become phosphorylated on its Grb2-binding sites (8Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHP2 could hence participate in Ras activation by contributing to the recruitment of Grb2/Sos in the vicinity of the PDGF receptor. However, this model has been recently challenged by several reports. First, the phosphorylation of SHP2, required to bind Grb2, seems marginal, if not undetectable, under EGF stimulation (2Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N.K. Roche S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41677-41684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, the catalytic activity of SHP2 is important for Ras/Erk activation induced by EGF, insulin, or hepatocyte growth factor, which implies that SHP2 does not simply function as an adaptor protein in response to these growth factors (5Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N.K. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). This may be also true for PDGF signaling, because a recent study has identified SHP2 mutants with normal Grb2-binding ability but defective in mediating PDGF-induced Erk activation (9Araki T. Nawa H. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41677-41684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, the elucidation of SHP2 function in Ras activation seems to require the identification of novel substrate(s) for which phosphorylation is detrimental to Ras activation. Recently, SHP2 was found to dephosphorylate Cbp/PAG and paxillin, two docking proteins that, when phosphorylated, can restrain Src activation by promoting its interaction with its regulatory kinase Csk (12Ren Y. Meng S. Mei L. Zhao Z.J. Jove R. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8497-8505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13Zhang S.Q. Yang W. Kontaridis M.I. Bivona T.G. Wen G.

Nevertheless, downstream of Src, how Ras can benefit from this activation remains poorly documented. In addition, SHP2 was reported to promote Erk activation in response to fibroblast growth factor by dephosphorylating Sprouty2, a protein that, when phosphorylated, can act as a trap for Grb2 SH2 domain (14Hanafusa H. Torii S. Yasunaga T. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22992-22995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that this mechanism could also occur under EGF stimulation, because SHP2 is not known to maintain the interaction between the activated EGFR and Grb2 (2Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 5Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N.K. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Evidences that Gab1 itself is a SHP2 substrate have been reported, suggesting that this interaction might participate in Ras activation. First, in Drosophila, genetic analysis have led to the identification of Dos, a Gab1 homolog, as a substrate of Csw, the SHP2 homolog (15Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Allard J.D. Schilling J. Raabe T. Simon M.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 899-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Herbst R. Zhang X. Qin J. Simon M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6950-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recently, a “substrate-trapping” approach in mammalian cells has shown that Gab1 can form stable complexes with SHP2 catalytically inactive mutants, which is a strong indication that Gab1 can be also a SHP2 substrate (17Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13952-13958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In agreement, SHP2 was found to control PI3K activation in response to EGF by dephosphorylating the PI3K-binding sites of Gab1 (18Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4062-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the multiplicity of Gab1 phosphorylation sites (19Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) suggests that the phosphatase could dephosphorylate Gab1 phosphotyrosine residues, which could be unfavorable for Ras activation. For example, these sites could provide docking signals for Ras negative regulatory proteins, and then SHP2 function would be to control their recruitment in EGFR signaling complexes by dephosphorylating Gab1. A good candidate for such a Ras negative regulator controlled through dephosphorylation of its docking site(s) is p120-Ras-GAP, the GTPase-activating protein that inactivates Ras by turning on its intrinsic enzymatic activity. RasGAP contains two SH2 domains that have binding affinity for the phosphorylated YXXP motif. The major binding partners of RasGAP are DOK proteins, a family of adaptors preferentially expressed in lymphoid tissues. Their prototype, DOK1, contains six YXXP motifs (20Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Strikingly, Gab1 also contains six of these motifs. Yet, it is not known whether Gab1 can associate with RasGAP. Various candidates can potentially recognize Gab1 YXXP motifs, including the adaptors Nck and Crk, and the phospholipase Cγ. However, thus far, these proteins have been identified as Gab1 binding partners only in response to hepatocyte growth factor stimulation (21Sakkab D. Lewitzky M. Posern G. Schaeper U. Sachs M. Birchmeier W. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10772-10778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Gual P. Giordano S. Williams T.A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Under EGF stimulation, these sites have not been allocated to any particular effector, even though some of them appear to be phosphorylated in vitro by the EGFR (22Gual P. Giordano S. Williams T.A. Rocchi S. Van Obberghen E. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1509-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Lehr S. Kotzka J. Herkner A. Klein E. Siethoff C. Knebel B. Noelle V. Bruning J. Klein H. Meyer H. Krone W. Muller-Wieland D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this report, we have addressed the question of whether Gab1 YXXP motifs provide docking sites for RasGAP and constitute target sites for dephosphorylation by SHP2. Using substrate trapping and site-directed mutagenesis, we have obtained evidence that Gab1 YXXP motifs can recruit RasGAP and that an essential function of SHP2 is to down-regulate this interaction, thus allowing an efficient activation of Ras in response to EGF.

To produce the RasGAP inactive mutant, we changed Arg789 to Gln, alone or in combination with Arg903, using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Novel Gab1 constructs used in this study (YF3/Y627F, ΔPQ±Y627F, Y242F/Y259F±Y627F, Y307F/Y317F±Y627F, Y242F±Y627F, and Y317F± Y627F) were created using the regular QuikChange kit that was more reliable (sequences of mutagenic primers available on request). All mutants were verified by sequencing, expression, and EGF-induced phosphorylation and membrane relocation. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Stimulations—This study was performed both in Vero cells (a non-transformed monkey kidney cell line, ATCC CCL 81) and in two immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines expressing either the endogenous SHP2 (WT) or a truncated, non-recruitable form of the phosphatase (ΔSHP2) (26Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For transient transfection of Vero cells, subconfluent 60-mm plates were incubated 3 h with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 μg of total DNA and 6 μl of each Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). In MEF, two 100-mm plates per assay were used, each containing 4 ml of medium, 4 μg of total of DNA, and 20 μl of each Lipofectamine and Plus reagent. Before stimulation, cells were blocked overnight by serum starvation. Cells were stimulated for 5 min with 10 (Vero) or 30 (MEF) ng/ml EGF. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Cells were scrapped off in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg of each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm orthovanadate. After shaking for 15 min at 4 °C followed by a 13,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min, soluble material was incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complexes were incubated with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h, then collected by brief centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, 0.1 mm orthovanadate. Proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a standard procedure. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates, cells were directly scrapped off in electrophoresis sample buffer, then boiled and processed for immunoblotting. GTP-Ras Affinity Precipitation Assay in Transfected Vero and MEF Cells—The assay was performed essentially as described using the recombinant Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf1 as an affinity probe for GTP-Ras (5Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N.K. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The RBD was expressed as GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli and extracted using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). To measure Ras activation in Vero cells, they were cotransfected with 0.2 and 1.8 μg of plasmid encoding HA-tagged RasWT and the indicated effector, respectively. In MEF cells, we have used 0.4 μg of HA-Ras vector and 3.6 μg of plasmid encoding Gab1 or RasGAP constructs. Following stimulation, cells were scrapped off in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Cleared lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 μg of GST-RBD bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and then boiled in standard electrophoresis sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. GST-RasGAP Binding Assay—The GST fusion proteins containing the SH2-SH3-SH2 domains of RasGAP or only the C-terminal SH2 domain have been already described (28Duchesne M. Schweighoffer F. Parker F. Clerc F. Frobert Y. Thang M.N. Tocque B. Science. 1993; 259: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. J. Nunés, Marseille, France). The fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and extracted using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The pull-down was conducted like the GTP-Ras assay, except that 3 μg of fusion protein were used and incubated during 1 h with cleared lysates. Membrane Fractions—Fractions containing membrane-associated proteins were prepared essentially as described (29August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cells were scrapped off in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm orthovanadate and were Dounce-homogenized. The lysate was spun at 13,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. The sample was then centrifuged again, and the pellet was washed once then dissolved in lysis buffer supplemented with 1.2% Triton X-100. The insoluble material was spun out, and the supernatant was taken as the solubilized membrane fraction. Statistics—The results shown are representative of at least two independent experiments performed in duplicates, unless otherwise indicated. Evidence That Gab1 PI3K-binding Sites Are Not SHP2 Targets in Ras Activation and That SHP2 Dephosphorylates Other Gab1 Sites—SHP2 was recently shown to down-regulate the EGF-induced PI3K/Akt pathway by dephosphorylating Gab1 YXXM p85-binding motifs (18Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4062-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we observed an increase of both PI3K association with Gab1 and Akt activation in Vero cells transfected with a Gab1 mutant (Y627F) unable to recruit SHP2 (5Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N.K. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and in SHP2-deficient fibroblasts (data not shown). Although unlikely, it was necessary to exclude that this dephosphorylation could be somehow positive for Ras activation. We thus changed the Tyr of the three YXXM motifs to Phe in the Gab1-Y627F construct to produce the so-called YF3/Y627F mutant. The Y627F mutation has a strong dominant negative effect on EGF-induced Ras/Erk activation (4Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Munoz-Antonia T. Mei L. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13842-13848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Yart A. Laffargue M. Mayeux P. Chretien S. Peres C. Tonks N.K. Roche S. Payrastre B. Chap H. Raynal P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8856-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We therefore assumed that if Gab1 YXXM motifs were SHP2 targets in Ras activation, their mutation should suppress or reduce the dominant negative effect of the Y627F mutation. However, Gab1-YF3/Y627F inhibits Ras activation even stronger than Gab1-Y627F (Fig. 1A), which excludes that dephosphorylation of Gab1 YXXM motifs by SHP2 could produce a positive effect on Ras activation. We next hypothesized that SHP2 could dephosphorylate Gab1 not only on PI3K-binding sites. To test this hypothesis, we have performed substrate trapping experiments using the SHP2 catalytically inactive mutant C459S (C/S) that can form stable complexes with potential SHP2 substrates (17Agazie Y.M. Hayman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13952-13958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The experiment was performed by cotransfecting SHP2-C/S with Gab1 mutants lacking different Tyr residues, and the existence of an interaction between these proteins was determined by coimmunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting analysis. Of course, all Gab1 mutants tested in substrate trapping experiments were prepared from the Gab1-Y627F template to eliminate the binding of SHP2-C/S through its SH2 domains. Fig. 1B shows that SHP2-C/S, but not SHP2-WT, coimmunoprecipitates with Gab1-Y627F when cells were stimulated with EGF, as expected, because it was already demonstrated that SHP2 dephosphorylates Gab1 PI3K-binding motifs (18Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4062-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). More interestingly, disruption of all PI3K-binding sites in the Gab1-YF3/Y627F mutant reduces the interaction between Gab1-Y627F and SHP2-C/S, but only to a limited extent. This suggests that SHP2-C/S traps Gab1 residues separately from PI3K-binding sites, implying that SHP2-Gab1 interaction is not limited to PI3K regulation. SHP2 Dephosphorylates Gab1 on Residue(s) Located between Pro161 and Gln318—We attempted to identify these novel sites recognized by SHP2-C/S, assuming that one of them could be involved in recruiting a negative regulator of Ras activation. In addition to PI3K- or SHP2-binding sites, Gab1 sequence contains 15 Tyr residues, which virtually excludes a systematic mutagenesis approach. However, a central region located between Pro161 and Gln318 displays four out of the six potential RasGAP-binding YXXP motifs (Fig. 2A). Because this region does not include any known domain required for Gab1 recruitment, we deleted it as a first approach to determine whether it contained Tyr residues trapped by SHP2-C/S. This deletion was introduced in Gab1-WT and in the Gab1-Y627F background to perform substrate trapping experiments. To verify first the ability of these so-called ΔPQ mutants to be recruited, we have examined both their membrane translocation and phosphorylation in response to EGF. Fig. 2B shows that these mutants behave similarly to other Gab1 constructs in terms of EGF-induced relocation to membrane fractions, which confirmed that the deleted region is not required for Gab1 recruitment. In contrast, the phosphorylation of ΔPQ mutants is strongly reduced in comparison with that of Gab1-WT or Y627F, suggesting that the deleted region contains significant phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2C). Following this characterization, the Gab1-Y627F/ΔPQ construct was cotransfected with SHP2-C/S to perform a substrate trapping experiment, in comparison with Gab1-Y627F. As shown in Fig. 2D, the deletion severely reduces the interaction between SHP2-C/S and Gab1, strongly suggesting that SHP2 dephosphorylates Tyr residue(s) located between Pro161 and Gln318. A RasGAP Dominant Negative Mutant Bypasses the Gab1/SHP2 Pathway—Because the Gab1 Pro161-Gln318 region displays potential RasGAP-binding motifs, the previous data suggest that SHP2 facilitates Ras activation by down-regulating a putative association between Gab1 and RasGAP, implying that RasGAP should be a downstream target of Gab1 and SHP2. To test this hypothesis, we have first studied the association of RasGAP with membrane fractions as readout of RasGAP mobilization. As shown in Fig. 3A, when cells are transfected with Gab1-WT, EGF induces at best a minor redistribution of RasGAP. The membrane redistribution of Gab1 itself was used to control the quality of cell stimulation and membrane extraction. In contrast to Gab1-WT, transfection of Gab1-Y627F resulted in an important membrane relocation of RasGAP in response to EGF, which strongly suggests that the Gab1/SHP2 pathway down-regulates RasGAP recruitment under normal conditions. To test this hypothesis further, we have produced a RasGAP-inactive mutant to determine whether its overexpression could attenuate the requirement for the Gab1/SHP2 pathway in Ras activation. The RasGAP mutant was designed to produce a protein unable to interac"
https://openalex.org/W2072705385,"Metastatic malignant melanoma is an extremely aggressive cancer, with no currently viable therapy. 4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol (eugenol) was tested for its ability to inhibit proliferation of melanoma cells. Eugenol but not its isomer, isoeugenol (2-methoxy-4-propenylphenol), was found to be a potent inhibitor of melanoma cell proliferation. In a B16 xenograft study, eugenol treatment produced a significant tumor growth delay (p = 0.0057), an almost 40% decrease in tumor size, and a 19% increase in the median time to end point. More significantly, 50% of the animals in the control group died from metastatic growth, whereas none in the treatment group showed any signs of invasion or metastasis. Eugenol was well tolerated as determined by measurement of bodyweights. Examination of the mechanism of the antiproliferative action of eugenol in the human malignant melanoma cell line, WM1205Lu, showed that it arrests cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Flow cytometry coupled with biochemical analyses demonstrated that eugenol induced apoptosis. cDNA array analysis showed that eugenol caused deregulation of the E2F family of transcription factors. Transient transfection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that eugenol inhibits the transcriptional activity of E2F1. Overexpression of E2F1 restored about 75% of proliferation ability in cultures. These results indicate that deregulation of E2F1 may be a key factor in eugenol-mediated melanoma growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Since the E2F transcription factors provide growth impetus for the continuous proliferation of melanoma cells, these results suggest that eugenol could be developed as an E2F-targeted agent for melanoma treatment.

Since the E2F transcription factors provide growth impetus for the continuous proliferation of melanoma cells, these results suggest that eugenol could be developed as an E2F-targeted agent for melanoma treatment. Melanoma is one of the fastest growing cancers in the developing world with the incidence having tripled in the last three decades (1Dennis L.K. Arch. Dermatol. 1999; 135: 275-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and vaccines have all produced limited benefits especially since the responses are typically short-lived, with no significant effect on overall survival. As a first step toward developing new compounds for effective melanoma management, we screened a panel of naturally occurring compounds for antiproliferative activity toward melanoma cells. From this screen, we have identified 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol (eugenol) 1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: eugenol, 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol; isoeugenol, 2-methoxy-4-propenylphenol; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; RT, reverse transcription; pRb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein.1The abbreviations and trivial names used are: eugenol, 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol; isoeugenol, 2-methoxy-4-propenylphenol; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; RT, reverse transcription; pRb, retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. as a potent inhibitor of both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells representing the different stages of melanoma progression. The structures of eugenol and the isomeric isoeugenol are shown in Fig. 1. Eugenol is found in reasonable quantities in the essential oils of different spices such as Syzgium aromaticum (clove), Pimenta racemosa (bay leaves), and Cinnamomum verum (cinnamon leaf). Eugenol has been used as an antiseptic, antibacterial, analgesic agent in traditional medical practices in Asia as well as in dentistry in cavity-filling procedures. Eugenol has been demonstrated to inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis (2Rasheed A. Laekeman G. Totte J. Vietinch A. Herman A.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 310: 50-51PubMed Google Scholar) and to block COX-2 activity with an IC50 value of 129 μmol (3Huss U. Ringbom T. Perera P. Bohlin L. Vasange M.J. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 2002; 65: 1517-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In long term carcinogenicity experiments by various groups in CD-1 mice and F344 rats, eugenol was not associated with tumor formation (4Miller J.A. Swanson A.B. Miller E.C. Miller E.C. Naturally Occurring Carcinogens: Mutagens and Modulators of Carcinogenesis. Tokyo Japan Science Society Press/Baltimore University Park Press, Tokyo/Baltimore, MD1979: 111-125Google Scholar). Based on numerous long term carcinogenicity studies, the National Toxicology Program concluded that eugenol was not carcinogenic to rats and that there was no evidence that unequivocally proved the carcinogenic nature of eugenol in mice (National Toxicology Program). More recently, in a skin carcinogenesis study using the initiating agent 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene followed by three times weekly cutaneous applications of eugenol for 63 weeks in a group of female ICR/HA Swiss mice, no carcinomas were found (5Van Duuren B.L. Sivak A. Segal A. Orris L. Langseth L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1966; 37: 519-526PubMed Google Scholar). In a skin painting study by Van Duuren and Goldschmidt (6Van Duuren B.L. Goldschmidt B.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1976; 56: 1237-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), eugenol was reported as being partially effective in inhibiting benzo(a)pyrene-induced skin carcinomas. Eugenol was shown to inhibit DMBA-croton oil-induced papillomas by about 84% (7Sukumaran K. Unnikrishnan M.C. Kuttan R. Indian J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 38: 306-308PubMed Google Scholar). Eugenol is not mutagenic, although the incidence of sister chromatid exchange was found to increase in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Stich H.F. Stich W. Lam P.P. Mutat. Res. 1981; 90: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Eugenol has neither been previously reported to be effective against melanoma nor been systematically tested in other common cancers. The E2F proteins are a family of transcription factors with an important role in regulating cell cycle progression (9Cam H. Dynlacht B.D. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). It has been shown that deregulated transcriptional activity of the E2F family in autonomously growing melanoma cells provides the impetus for continuous proliferation of melanoma cells. Specifically, E2F2 and E2F4 are predominant in actively proliferating melanocytes, melanoma cells, and freshly isolated melanoma tumors. The up-regulated E2F activity in melanoma cells is dependent on persistent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and inactivation of the pocket proteins (10Halaban R. Cheng E. Smicum Y. Germino J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the members of the E2F family known to cause growth arrest and apoptosis are either absent or expressed at low levels in melanoma cells, therefore providing a growth advantage to melanoma cells (10Halaban R. Cheng E. Smicum Y. Germino J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A clinical agent that can target the continuous cycling of melanoma cells would be an attractive tool for effective inhibition of melanoma cell growth. Our results show that eugenol is a potent inhibitor of both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells in culture, causes significant tumor growth delay (p = 0.0057), decreases size of tumors, and inhibits melanoma invasion and metastasis in B16 xenograft animals. Eugenol also arrests cells in the S phase of cell cycle, induces apoptosis, and inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activity. The growth inhibitory effect of eugenol is partially abrogated by overexpression of E2F1. These results suggest a potential role for E2F1 in eugenol-mediated melanoma management. Materials—Eugenol was purchased from Sigma; all the polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). CellTiter96 Aqueous One solution, DeadEnd colorimetric apoptosis detection system, and Dual-Luciferase assay system were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). All other reagents were molecular biology grade from Sigma. The E2F1 plasmids were a gift from Dr. David G. Johnson at University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX. Cell Lines—The human melanoma cells that represent disease progression (Sbcl2-primary melanoma; WM3211-radial growth phase; primary RGP, WM98-1-radial and vertical growth phase; primary RGP and VGP, WM1205Lu-metastatic melanoma) were a gift from Dr. Meenhard Herlyn at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.5% insulin. All melanoma cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Animal Study—Female B6D2F1 mice bearing established B16 melanomas (∼50 mm3) were randomized into a control and a treatment group of eight animals each at Piedmont Research Center in Morrisville, NC. The control group received corn oil (vehicle), and the treatment group received 125 mg of eugenol/kg of body weight twice a week intraperitoneally for the duration of the study. The dose was administered in a volume of 0.2 ml/20 g of bodyweight and was adjusted for the body weight of the animal. The choice of 125 mg/kg of bodyweight of eugenol was based on an earlier maximum tolerated dose study using three different doses. Animals were euthanized when their tumors reached the end point volume of 2,000 mm3, and the time to end point was calculated for each mouse. The percentage of tumor growth delay was used as treatment outcome (defined as the percentage of increase in median time to end point of treated versus control mice). Significance of efficacy was calculated using log rank analysis. All animal procedures were conducted in strict adherence to recommendations of the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Proliferation Assay—Actively growing human melanoma cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 4 × 103 cells/well in triplicates. After 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2, cells were treated with different concentrations of eugenol (0.5-2.5 μm), isoeugenol (0.5-5.0 μm), or the solvent (ethanol). Cell proliferation following treatment was carried out with the CellTiter96 Aqueous One solution assay (Promega Corp.) as described elsewhere (11Ghosh R. Ott A.M. Seetharam D. Slaga T.J. Kumar A.P. Melanoma Res. 2003; 13: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, plated cells were incubated with the dye solution containing tetrazolium at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was terminated with a stop solution that solubilizes the formazan product formed. Absorbance at 570 nm was recorded using a SpectraMaxPlus plate reader (Molecular Devices). Proliferation assays were performed five times in triplicate wells. The trypan blue exclusion assay was initially used to measure cell viability. Colony Formation Assay—A colony-forming assay as described by Kumar et al. (12Kumar A.P. Garcia G.E. Ghosh R. Rajnarayanan R.V. Alworth W.L. Slaga T.J. Neoplasia. 2003; 5: 255-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Logarithmically growing melanoma cells were trypsinized and plated at a density of 8,000 cells/ml in 0.5% agarose plates in duplicate. After incubating for 14 days, colonies were stained with 0.02% p-iodonitrotetrazolium. After 6 h, colonies containing more than 50 cells and stained dark pink were counted in eight different fields. The experiment was repeated twice in duplicate. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Actively growing cells were plated at a density of 106 cells in 100-mm dishes. Cells at ∼70% confluency were treated with either 0.5 μm eugenol in ethanol or solvent (ethanol) for 20 and 36 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of Krishan stain containing 1.1 mg/ml sodium citrate, 46 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml RNase (13Krishan A. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). These cells were subject to flow cytometric analysis on a Beckman Coulter XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) at the University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center Flow Cytometry core facility. Data analysis was carried out with the Modfit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Three independent flow cytometry analyses were carried out. Apoptosis Detection—Melanoma cells treated with ethanol or 0.5, 1, and 2.5 μm eugenol in ethanol for 18 h and observed by phase contrast microscopy. From this initial experiment, we chose to demonstrate the induction of apoptosis at the biochemical level using the malignant melanoma cell line WM1205Lu. The DeadEnd colorimetric apoptosis detection system (Promega Corp.) was used to detect apoptosis as described previously (11Ghosh R. Ott A.M. Seetharam D. Slaga T.J. Kumar A.P. Melanoma Res. 2003; 13: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This assay uses a modified terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method to detect apoptotic cells in situ. Cells were grown and treated as described above. Cells were washed and fixed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides in 2% formaldehyde solution. After permeabilizing cells with Triton X-100, double-stranded breaks were labeled with the biotinylated nucleotide mix and the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme. After the reactions were terminated, apoptosis was detected as the dark brown color of the horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin bound to the biotinylated nucleotides. Two independent TUNEL assays were carried out with the DNase I-treated cells as positive control and a negative control without the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme. We also performed DNA fragmentation analysis to assess apoptosis induction by eugenol. Whole Cell Extracts and Western Blotting—Cells were either treated with 0.5 μm eugenol or left untreated for 18 h. Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Lysed cells were passed through a 25-gauge needle, and the released material was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. Protein content in the supernatant was determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208724) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out as described elsewhere (11Ghosh R. Ott A.M. Seetharam D. Slaga T.J. Kumar A.P. Melanoma Res. 2003; 13: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of whole cell extracts were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies used were as follows: polyclonal anti-E2F1, -E2F2, -E2F3, -E2F4, -E2F5, and -E2F6. We used the Western Lightning chemiluminescence reagent Plus for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All the blots were probed with β-actin to normalize for loading differences. Western blotting was repeated twice with different batches of extracts. Transfection and Transient Expression Assay—Transient transfection assays were performed in WM1205Lu cells using a Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as published previously (15Ghosh R. Tummala R. Mitchell D.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Wild type or mutant E2F1-luciferase reporter plasmids (1 μg/well) and pRL-TK plasmid (50 ng/well) were incubated with Lipofectamine for 30 min and then added to the cells. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with 1 μm eugenol in ethanol for 4 h. Following treatment, luciferase reporter assay was performed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system from Promega Corp. As per the manufacturer's recommendation, cells were harvested and then lysed in passive lysis buffer. Cell lysate was cleared from debris by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Luciferase activity was assessed in duplicate samples containing equal amounts of protein. The assay contained 20 μl of cell lysate and 50 μl of firefly luciferase buffer (luciferase assay reagent II). Firefly luciferase was measured on the Victor plate reader. 50 μl of Renilla luciferase (stop and glow) buffer was added, and Renilla luciferase activity was measured. Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Results are expressed as the ratio of firefly luciferase/Renilla luciferase at equal amounts of protein. For overexpression of E2F1, WM1205Lu cells in triplicates were transfected with 5 and 10 μg of pCDNA3E2F1-overexpressing plasmid or pCDNA3 (control) plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the cells were treated with eugenol for 4 h. The number of live cells was counted in duplicates using the trypan blue exclusion assay. All transfection experiments were carried out twice each with two different plasmid preparations. Gene Expression Analysis—WM1205Lu cells at 80% confluency were treated with 0.5 μm eugenol in ethanol for 18 h. Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to vendor instructions. To determine changes in gene expression following eugenol treatment, we used the cell cycle pathway-specific gene expression profiling system from SuperArray Bioscience Corp. (Frederick, MD). We made biotinylated cDNA from total RNA by RT-PCR according to instructions provided by SuperArray Bioscience Corp. The denatured probe was hybridized to the membranes containing 96 cDNA fragments involved in cell cycle regulation. Data were extracted from the raw image and analyzed with the GEArray analyzer software (Super Array Bioscience Corp. (Frederick, MD)). All raw signal intensities were corrected for background by subtracting the signal intensity of pUC18 (negative control) and normalized to Homo sapiens peptidylprolyl isomerase A; PPIA (housekeeping gene). The corrected and normalized signal was used to estimate the relative abundance of transcripts. The array results were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described elsewhere (16Ghosh R. Peng C.-H. Mitchell D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6918-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Eugenol-treated (0.5 μm) and control cells were harvested and homogenized in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin. Nuclei were separated from cell debris and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitors. Nuclear protein was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 45 min. Protein content in the supernatant was determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208724) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Immunohistochemistry—Untreated or 1 μm eugenol-treated cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde on poly-l-lysine-coated slides. For immunocytochemical detection of E2F1, we used 1:200 dilution of the primary antibody and followed the manufacturer's recommendations for the Histostain Plus kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). For immunohistochemical detection of E2F1 in melanoma tumor tissues, we deparaffinized tissue sections with xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. After the appropriate washes in phosphate-buffered saline, immunochemical detection was carried out in the same way as cytochemical detection of E2F1. We used an E2F1 blocking antibody as a negative control for immunocytochemical as well as immunohistochemical detection of E2F1. The immunocytochemical assay was performed twice with cells from different passages. A Coolpix digital camera attached to a Nikon T1-SM or Zeiss microscope was used to obtain photographs of the cells and tissues. Eugenol Inhibits Anchorage-dependent and -independent Growth of Melanoma Cells in Culture—The CellTiter96 proliferation assay was used to measure proliferation of the cells for up to 72 h following the addition of increasing concentrations of eugenol. As shown in Fig. 2, A-D, eugenol addition inhibited the growth of all the human melanoma cell lines tested. The Sbcl2 and WM3211 cells showed 50% growth inhibition in 0.5 μm eugenol after 24 h, whereas the WM98-1 and WM1205Lu cells needed twice as much time for 50% growth inhibition at this concentration of eugenol. At 72 h, however, there was no difference in response between the different cell lines using 0.5 μm eugenol. Fig. 2E shows that isoeugenol, an isomer of eugenol, did not inhibit the growth of any of the human melanoma cell lines at concentrations up to 5 μm. Since anchorage-independent growth is a hallmark of cancer cells, we tested to see whether eugenol could inhibit colony formation on soft agar. Data presented in Fig. 2F show that eugenol inhibited colony formation in all the human melanoma cells. The metastatic melanoma cell line WM1205Lu showed the lowest inhibition in colony formation as compared with the other melanoma cells at 0.5 μm eugenol. Taken together, these results show that eugenol inhibits both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells. Eugenol Causes Significant Tumor Growth Delay, Decreases Tumor Size, and Prevents Tumor Metastasis in B16F10 Xenograft Mice—We tested the effect of eugenol in vivo in the B16 melanoma xenograft model system as shown in Table I. As shown in Table II tumors in the vehicle group grew rapidly to the end point volume, and four mice died due to metastasis between days 8 and 14. The median time for the tumor to grow to end point for the control group was 12.6 days. There was a highly significant 19% tumor growth delay (p = 0.0057) in the group treated with eugenol. The size of tumors in the treatment group was about 62% of that of the tumors of control animals on day 15. Very significantly, 50% of the animals in the control group developed non-treatment-related metastases, whereas none of the animals in the treatment group showed any signs of invasion or metastasis. Daily examination and body weight measurements of the animals showed no difference in body weight between control and treatment group animals, indicating that eugenol was well tolerated.Table ITreatment protocolGroupTreatment RegimenScheduleNumberAgentWeightRoutenmg/kg18Corn oil0Intraperitoneal2×/week28Eugenol125Intraperitoneal2×/week Open table in a new tab Table IISummary of eugenol treatment responseGroupMedianTTET - C%TGDLog rank sigMean tumor sizeNumber of NTRmn112.600None3417.3 ± 107.1 mg42152.419%**, p value = 0.0057a, p value = 0.00572135.8 ± 435.9 mg0a ** , p value = 0.0057 Open table in a new tab Tumor tissue (Fig. 3) from control group animals stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 3A) demonstrates numerous confluent collections of atypical cells with large pleomorphic nuclei, clumped chromatin, and atypical mitotic figures. Interspersed between the melanoma cells are numerous melanin-containing melanophages. Following treatment with eugenol (panel ii), diffuse areas of tumor necrosis intermixed with occasional small aggregates of damaged melanocytes that demonstrate nuclear pyknosis and condensation of the cytoplasm are seen. Diffuse areas of tumor necrosis with no viable-appearing melanoma cells are also seen. We used the modified TUNEL assay to determine whether the tumors in the treatment group were undergoing apoptosis. In the modified TUNEL assay, streptavidin-labeled dUTP is incorporated into the 3′-OH ends of apoptotic DNA by the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase to produce brown staining in cells undergoing apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3B (panel i), tumor sections of the control animals showed negligible brown staining. On the other hand, in Fig. 3B, panel ii, intense brown staining is visible, indicating that eugenol treatment induces apoptosis in melanoma tumors. Eugenol Blocks Cell Cycle Progression and Induces Apoptosis—Logarithmically growing WM1205Lu cells were treated with eugenol and subjected to flow cytometry analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results in Fig. 4A show that there was a 40% increase in cells in the S phase accompanied by a decrease in the G1 phase cells with no significant change in the G2/M phase cells following eugenol treatment. Further these data also show that the cells remain blocked in the S phase up to 36 h. Other human melanoma cells (Sbcl2, WM3211, and WM98-1) also showed a similar pattern of S phase block upon eugenol treatment (data not shown). Further we found the consistent appearance of a sub-G1 peak during flow cytometry analysis that is indicative of apoptotic cells (data not shown). We treated melanoma cells with 0.5, 1, and 2.5 μm eugenol for 18 h and then observed the cells under a phase contrast microscope. Fig. 4B shows the morphological changes that occur in a representative cell line WM1205Lu following eugenol treatment. As shown in Fig. 4B, panels ii-iv, all the cells treated with eugenol showed blebbing of membranes, shrinkage of cytoplasm, and condensation of nuclear material, as well as gradually lifting off the dishes. These characteristic features of apoptosis occurred in a dose-dependent manner and was absent in untreated cells (Fig. 4B, panel i). To confirm the induction of apoptosis, we performed the modified TUNEL assay to detect apoptotic cells in situ using the metastatic melanoma cell line, WM1205Lu. As shown in Fig. 4C, panels ii-iv, increasing the concentration of eugenol from 0.5 to 2.5 μm produced an increase in the number of brown stained cells, indicating that these cells were undergoing apoptosis. In Fig. 4C, panel i, the untreated control showed no staining. Cells treated with DNase I were used as a positive control (data not shown). A characteristic feature of apoptotic cells is the activation of endonucleases that attack internucleosomal DNA resulting in DNA fragments that are 180-200 bp. We found that DNA isolated from eugenol-treated cells, but not from control cells, showed the laddering effect (data not shown). Taken together, the data presented in Fig. 4 clearly show that eugenol blocks cells in the S phase of the cell cycle and induces apoptosis in the human melanoma cells, WM1205Lu. It is not known, however, whether the S phase block is essential for induction of apoptosis. Eugenol Modulates Expression of E2F Family Members— Since we found that eugenol blocks cells in the replication phase of the cell cycle, we examined the cell cycle regulatory genes involved in the eugenol response using the pathway-specific gene expression system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The raw data shown in Fig. 5A were corrected for background by subtracting the signal intensity of pUC18 (negative control) and normalizing to peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA; housekeeping gene), and the relative abundance of transcripts between control and eugenol-treated samples was determined (Fig. 5B). To determine genes that are experimentally and biologically relevant, we filtered the data for those genes whose expression level increased or decreased at least 2-fold. Based on this analysis, we determined that members of the E2F family of transcription factors are modulated by eugenol treatment. Quantitative-RT-PCR with glycer-aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal control was used to validate the array results. Results presented in Fig. 5C show the amplification products of the E2F family (E2F1-E2F6) along with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (bottom band). Transcript abundance was calculated as the ratio of the target transcript to that of its internal control. A graphical representation of the relative abundance of transcripts in eugenol-treated and untreated cells is shown in Fig. 5D. We found that E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 were all down-regulated 2-fold or more following treatment wi"

However, the serine site(s) phosphorylated by GSK-3 within IRS-1 had not been yet identified. Using an N-terminal deleted IRS-1 mutant and two IRS-1 fragments, PTB-11–320 and PTB-21–350, we localized GSK-3 phosphorylation site(s) within amino acid sequence 320–350. Mutations of serine 332 or 336, which lie in the GSK-3 consensus motif (SXXXS) within PTB-2 or IRS-1, to alanine abolished their phosphorylation by GSK-3. This suggested that Ser332 is a GSK-3 phosphorylation site and that Ser336 serves as the “priming” site typically required for GSK-3 action. Indeed, dephosphorylation of IRS-1 prevented GSK-3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the phosphorylated peptide derived from the IRS-1 sequence was readily phosphorylated by GSK-3, in contrast to the nonphosphorylated peptide, which was not phosphorylated by the enzyme. When IRS-1 mutants S332AIRS-1, S336AIRS-1, or S332A/336AIRS-1 were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing insulin receptors, their insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation levels increased compared with that of wild-type (WT) IRS-1. This effect was stronger in the double mutant S332A/336AIRS-1 and led to enhanced insulin-mediated activation of protein kinase B. Finally, immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibody directed against IRS-1 phosphorylated at Ser332 confirmed IRS-1 phosphorylation in cultured cells. Moreover, treatment with the GSK-3 inhibitor lithium reduced Ser332 phosphorylation, whereas overexpression of GSK-3 enhanced this phosphorylation. In summary, our studies identify Ser332 as the GSK-3 phosphorylation target in IRS-1, indicating its physiological relevance and demonstrating its novel inhibitory role in insulin signaling.

Insulin resistance, commonly defined as the inability of peripheral tissues to respond normally to physiological concentrations of insulin, is considered one of the earliest changes associated with the onset of type 2 diabetes (1Kahn B.B.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in multiple receptor-mediated intracellular processes (for review, see Refs. 36Woodgett J.R. Curr.

We hypothesized that hyperactive GSK-3 may enhance serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, decreasing its ability to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated (by the insulin receptor, IR) (14Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, the specific IRS-1 serine sites phosphorylated by GSK-3 were not identified. In this work, we used deletion and mutation techniques, together with specific phosphoantibody to identify serine site(s) within IRS-1 phosphorylated by GSK-3. Here, we show that GSK-3 phosphorylates Ser332 of IRS-1 and that mutation at this site enhances insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. We bring evidence that Ser336 is the priming site usually required for GSK-3 substrates (45Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Mutations at serines 332, 336, 340, 343, and 345 were introduced into IRS-1 or PTB-2 constructs, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutations and fragments were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations. The sequence of mutagenic oligonucleotides is available from the authors upon request.

Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing the IR (CHO-IR cells), kindly provided by Yehiel Zick (Weizmann Institute of Science), were transiently transfected with IRS-1 constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of IRS-1 mutant proteins was verified by Western blot analysis, using IRS-1-specific antibody raised against either the C terminus (14Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

C2C12 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. Myotubes were used 4–6 days later.

Cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatants were collected, and equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were boiled with SDS sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis (7.5–12% polyacrylamide gel), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies, anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY99 (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-PKB antibody (Ser473 or Thr308), and PKB antibody (Cell Signaling), according to the manufacturers' protocols. In a different set of experiments, IRS-1 or PTB proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with specific antibodies against IRS-1 (described above). GSK-3 kinase assays were performed in the immunoprecipitate complex. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, [γ-32P[ATP (100 μm, 0.5 μCi/assay), 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 nm microcysteine and was incubated with 0.5 μg of purified recombinant GSK-3 (48Eldar-Finkelman H.

After extensive washes with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 10 nm LR microcysteine (Calbiochem), purified recombinant GSK-3 was added to the immunoprecipitate together with [γ-32P]ATP in conditions similar to those described above. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and then boiled and subjected to gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Treatment with λ Phosphatase—IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cells overexpressing IRS-1 as described in the previous section. The immunoprecipitate was treated with λ phosphatase (Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer's protocols, for 30 min at 30 °C. The immunoprecipitates were boiled with SDS sample buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 Peptide by GSK-3—Two synthetic peptides were generated (Genemed Synthesis Inc., San Francisco) based on IRS-1 sequence: phosphorylated peptide RREGGMS332RPAS3336(p)VDG and its nonphosphorylated version RREGGMS332RPAS336VDG. Arginine was added to the N terminus of the peptide to enable binding to p81 paper, and threonine 330 was replaced with glycine. Purified GSK-3 was incubated in a reaction mixture of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 10 mm magnesium acetate, [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm, 0.5 μCi/assay), and 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, together with 200 μm peptides for 5, 10, or 15 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped, spotted on P-81 paper, (Whatman), washed with phosphoric acid, and counted for radioactivity, as described previously (14Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Antibody—Polyclonal antibody directed against phosphorylated IRS-1 (at Ser332) was generated by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX). In brief, two rabbits were immunized with synthetic phospho-Ser332 based on the amino acid sequence around Ser332 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Sera were pooled and stripped of antibodies that reacted with nonphosphorylated versions of the peptide using a nonphosphopeptide affinity column. The reactive material was eluted from a phosphopeptide affinity column at low pH. The affinity-purified antibody was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by immunoblot analysis (dilution 1:1,000), as described under “Results.” Statistics and graphics analyses were performed by Origin 6.0 Professional software. Identification of the Major GSK-3 Phosphorylation Site in the IRS-1 Fragment PTB-2 and Full-length IRS-1—Direct identification of IRS-1 phosphorylation sites is difficult (see “Discussion”). Therefore, we used a molecular biology approach. The N-terminal domain of IRS-1 was shown to be important for its interaction with the IR (49Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7386-7397Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), so we first used a deleted mutant of IRS-1 lacking residues 140–541 (ΔN-IRS-1 (21Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar)) (see Fig. 1A). Wild-type (WT) IRS-1 or ΔN-IRS-1 constructs were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and their protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Equal amounts of expressed IRS-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with specific antibody and subjected to a “hot” GSK-3 phosphorylation assay. As shown in Fig. 1B (upper panel), WT-IRS-1 was phosphorylated readily by GSK-3, whereas the ΔN-IRS-1 mutant was weakly phosphorylated by the enzyme. This led us to conclude that GSK-3 phosphorylation site(s) are located within residues 140–541. The amino acid sequence of 140–541 was analyzed to identify potential sites of phosphorylation by GSK-3. A putative GSK-3 consensus sequence (SXXXS) was located at a serine cluster harboring residues 332, 336, and 340 (see Fig. 2A). Accordingly, two IRS-1 fragments were generated: PTB-1, coding for amino acids 1–320 (which lacked this serine cluster); and PTB-2, coding for residues 1–350 (which included this serine cluster), as illustrated in Fig. 1A. PTB-1 and PTB-2 were expressed transiently in HEK-293 cells and detected by Western blot analysis as proteins with an apparent molecular mass of 36 and 39 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Equal amounts of PTB-1 and PTB-2 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with specific IRS-1 antibody and were subjected to GSK-3 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1C (upper panel), GSK-3 phosphorylated PTB-2, but not PTB-1. These results indicated that GSK-3 phosphorylation site(s) reside within amino acids 320–350 and support our speculation that serines 332, 336, and 340 are the sites involved in GSK-3 phosphorylation.Fig. 2Phosphorylation of PTB-2 mutants by GSK-3. A, amino acid sequences with the putative GSK-3 consensus sequence are shown. B, PTB-2 mutants S332APTB-2, S336APTB-2, and S340APTB-2 were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells. Expression of mutants was verified with Western blot (IB) analysis using specific IRS-1 antibody as described under “Materials and Methods” (lower panel). Equal amounts of protein PTB-1 and PTB-2 were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using specific IRS-1 antibodies and subjected to in vitro phosphorylation with GSK-3 using [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated PTB-2 proteins are indicated (upper panel). C, the same as A except that PTB-2 mutants S343APTB-2 and S345APTB-2 were used.

Two additional sites, serines 343 and 345, were also mutated to alanine to examine their possible role as “priming sites” (as explained earlier). The PTB-2 mutants were expressed in HEK-293 cells, and experiments similar to those described above were performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, mutation at serines 332 and 336 prevented the phosphorylation by GSK-3. On the other hand, the mutants S340PTB-2, S343APTB-2, and S345APTB-2 were phosphorylated by GSK-3 (Fig. 2, B and C). Taken together, it appears that serines 332 and 336 are the sites involved in GSK-3 phosphorylation. Notably, this consensus site is highly conserved among human rat and mouse (Fig. 2D). Because GSK-3 has a unique requirement for phosphorylation at the +4 position of its site (i.e. recognition motif: S1XXXS(p), 2The numbering of IRS-1 refers to the rat sequence. where S1 is the phosphorylation site and S2 is the prephosphorylated priming site (45Plyte S.E.

Acta. 1984; 788: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)), we assume that Ser336 is the priming site phosphorylated by a different kinase. This was investigated further and will be discussed later. After establishing serines 332 and 336 as the consensus sites required for GSK-3 phosphorylation in the PTB-2 fragment, we examined whether this also applies to full-length IRS-1. WT and IRS-1 mutants (S332AIRS-1, S336AIRS-1, and a double mutant S332A/S336AIRS-1) were expressed transiently in HEK-293 cells. Expression levels of WT IRS-1 and mutants were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, lower panel). Equal amounts of IRS-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with specific antibody and subjected to GSK-3 phosphorylation. Indeed, none of the three mutants was phosphorylated by GSK-3 (Fig. 3, upper panel). As observed for PTB-2, S340AIRS-1 was phosphorylated by GSK-3, ruling out the involvement of Ser340 in GSK-3 phosphorylation (data not shown). Serine 336 Is a Priming Site—The following experiments examined whether Ser336 serves as a priming site for GSK-3. Treatment of IRS-1 with the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A significantly reduced the ability of GSK-3 to phosphorylate IRS-1, indicating that GSK-3 requires prephosphorylation of IRS-1 (Fig. 4A). Next, we generated two synthetic peptides based on IRS-1 sequence: a phosphorylated peptide RREGGMS332RPAS336(p)VDG and its nonphosphorylated version. The peptides were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by GSK-3 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As can be evaluated from Fig. 4B, only the phosphorylated peptide served as a substrate for GSK-3. GSK-3 was completely inert to the nonphosphorylated peptide. Thus, GSK-3 requires prephosphorylation at Ser336. Role of Serines 332 and 336 in Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IRS-1—We next investigated the functional roles of serines 332 and 336. IRS-1 mutants (S332AIRS-1, S336AIRS-1, and a double mutant S332A/336AIRS-1) were transiently expressed in CHO-IR cells, which had been stimulated with 100 nm insulin. Expression levels of IRS-1 mutants were evaluated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5A, bottom panel), and lysates with equal amounts of IRS-1 proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As can be seen from Fig. 5A, insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylations of IRS-1 were enhanced in S332AIRS-1 and S336AIRS-1 compared with WT-IRS-1. Notably, this effect was much stronger in the double mutant S332A/336AIRS-1, even in resting conditions, where tyrosine levels were much above than that of WT-IRS-1. We next examined the insulin-mediated activation of the IRS-1-downstream target PKB in cells expressing S332A/336AIRS-1. PKB phosphorylation on serine 473 and 308 (both of which sites are important for PKB activation (52Alessi D.R. Andjelkov M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice M. Cohen P. Hammings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar)) was enhanced significantly (Fig. 5B), indicating that blockage of serine 332 and 336 phosphorylation enhances insulin signaling. Serine 332 Is Phosphorylated in Cultured Cells and Is Sensitive to GSK-3—A polyclonal antibody directed against the sequence surrounding phosphorylated Ser332 in IRS-1 was generated and is termed here αpSer332-IRS-1. The specificity of the antibody was tested in immunoblot analysis of WT-IRS-1, which was phosphorylated by GSK-3 in vitro. In this experiment, the protein was immunoprecipitated from cell extract of HEK-293 cells that transiently expressed WT-IRS-1. The immunoprecipitate was then subjected to in vitro phosphorylation by GSK-3 in “cold” conditions. Reactions were separated on gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with αpSer332-IRS-1. As can be evaluated from Fig. 6A, αpSer332-IRS-1 antibody reacted strongly with the GSK-3-treated IRS-1 compared with the nontreated samples. Furthermore, αpIRS-1332 weakly detected IRS-1 that was first treated with λ phosphatase (Fig. 6B). The αpSer332-IRS-1 antibody was also tested in immunoblot analyses of IRS-1 and PTB-2 mutants. The antibody reacted strongly with the wild-type proteins. However, S332A was not detected by the antibody (Fig. 6, C and D). Finally, we examined whether GSK-3 is involved in cellular Ser332 phosphorylation. WT-IRS-1 was expressed transiently in HEK-293 cells, and cells were treated with lithium, a known GSK-3 inhibitor (53Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses with αpSer332-IRS-1 indicated that phosphorylation of Ser332 was reduced upon treatment with lithium (Fig. 6E). In contrast, expression of GSK-3 together with WT-IRS-1 enhanced Ser332 phosphorylation (Fig. 6F). In another set of experiments we examined the effect of lithium on the phosphorylation of endogenous IRS-1 in C2C12 myotubes. As shown in Fig. 6G lithium reduced Ser332 phosphorylation, and this was associated with a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Thus, reduction in Ser332 phosphorylation by inhibition of GSK-3 correlates with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the IR. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that GSK-3 is a physiological regulator of Ser332 phosphorylation of IRS-1. Finally, we examined the effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of Ser332. Treatment of CHO-IR cells expressing IRS-1 with insulin did not alter the phosphorylation of Ser332 (Fig. 6H). Thus, it appears that inhibition of GSK-3 by insulin does not affect IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been increasingly recognized as a negative feedback regulator mechanism for insulin signaling. The protein kinase GSK-3 was shown to phosphorylate IRS-1 (14Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, GSK-3 participates in insulin signaling as a downstream target inhibited by insulin (54Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 55Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Vandenheede J.R. McDowell H.E. Hundal H.S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and contributes to insulin resistance (14Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 39Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Mudaliar S. Mohideen P. Carter L. Henry R.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Thus, GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1 may be an important mechanism in insulin resistance. However, the sites phosphorylated by GSK-3 had not been identified previously. It is difficult to identify GSK-3 phosphorylation sites within IRS-1 because the protein is heavily phosphorylated on serine residues (10Sun X.J. Rothenberg P. Kahn C.R. Backer J.M. Araki E. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. Goldstein B.J. White M.F. Nature. 1991; 352: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 14Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Moreover, GSK-3 has a special requirement of prephosphorylation for its target recognition (45Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 46Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14042-14048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus, further complicating the direct identification of the target site(s). Therefore, we employed a molecular biology approach to identify these sites. By using an N-terminal deleted IRS-1 mutant and two fragments of the protein (PTB-1 and PTB-2), we were able to locate GSK-3-phosphorylation site(s) within the region 320–350 amino acids. This segment contained serines 332, 336, and 340, which lie within the GSK-3 consensus motif (SXXXS(p) where S(p) is usually prephosphorylated) and which are highly conserved in human, rat, and mouse (Fig. 2D). Point mutation analyses indicated that mutation at serines 332 and 336 prevented GSK-3 phosphorylation of IRS-1. The requirement that GSK-3 substrates are prephosphorylated at the +4 position (45Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 46Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14042-14048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Woodgett J.R. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 788: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) implicated Ser336 as the priming site. This was confirmed by the following experiments. First, dephosphorylation of IRS-1 prevented GSK-3 phosphorylation. Second, phosphopeptide derived from the relevant IRS-1 sequence (where Ser336 is phosphorylated) was readily phosphorylated by GSK-3 compared with the nonphosphorylated peptide (Fig. 4B). Finally, we present a new specific anti-phospho-Ser332 IRS-1 antibody and demonstrate the physiological relevance of the phosphorylation of this site. The important result in our studies is that mutations at both serines 332 and 336 dramatically enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in both resting and insulin-stimulated conditions. This effect was demonstrated when each serine was mutated separately, albeit to a lower extent. The latter observation probably means that phosphorylation of both serines 332 and 336 is important for an “effective” disruptive activity of IRS-1 signaling, namely, decreased ability to be tyrosyl-phosphorylated by the IR. This may present an example for hierarchical regulation: as long as Ser336 is not phosphorylated, GSK-3-inhibitory function remains limited. Interestingly, recent work has reported similar observations where the disruptive effect of JNK on the IR/IRS-1 was dependent on the phosphorylation of both serines 307 and 302 (20Werner E.D. Lee J.H. Hansen L. Yuan M. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35298-35305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Taken together these results further strengthen the role of GSK-3 in attenuating insulin signaling via serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and explain, at least in part, that the insulin mimetic effect provoked by selective GSK-3 inhibitors (40Nikoulina S.E.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 937-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) is probably because of reduced Ser332 phosphorylation of IRS-1. The mechanisms by which phosphorylation of serines 332 and 336 inhibits IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation is not fully clear. Given that those sites are found in close proximity to the PTB domain, which is important in facilitating IR-IRS-1 interaction, their phosphorylation may disrupt this interactions and thus inhibit subsequent IRS-mediated signaling (28Moeschel K. Beck A. Weigert C. Lammers R. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Haring H.U. Lehmann R. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3071-3075Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphorylation of those sites might recruit signaling molecules, which sterically inhibit interactions between the PTB domain of IRS-1 and the NPEY motif of the IR, preventing tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the IR kinase (58Backer J.M. Wjasow C. Zhang Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 59Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The additional strength of our studies is the establishment of a new specific phospho-IRS-1 antibody, αpSer332-IRS-1. Immunoblots with the antibody confirmed the physiological significance of this type of phosphorylation in cultured cells. Furthermore, based on the observation that treatment with GSK-3 inhibitor lithium specifically decreased the phosphorylation of Ser332, whereas overexpression of GSK-3 enhanced the phosphorylation of Ser332 (Fig. 6, E and F) we concluded that GSK-3 is involved in cellular phosphorylation of serine 332. Interestingly, in contrast to lithium, insulin did not reduce Ser332 phosphorylation (Fig. 6H). This may be explained by the fact that lithium induced prolonged inhibition of GSK-3 while insulin had a transient and rapid effect on GSK-3 activity (54Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and this is probably not sufficient to decrease Ser332 phosphorylation. On the other hand, abnormal elevated GSK-3 activity may cause up-regulation in Ser332 phosphorylation (as demonstrated in Fig. 6F), thus contributing to insulin resistance. In summary, we identified Ser332 as a GSK-3 phosphorylation site in IRS-1. These results provide insight into the role of GSK-3 as a negative feedback regulator of insulin signaling, permitting a more detailed analysis of this pathway under normal and pathophysiological conditions."

Here we show that the natural compounds acetyl-β-boswellic acid and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKβBA) inhibit proliferation and elicit cell death in chemoresistant androgen-independent PC-3 prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Induction of apoptosis was demonstrated in cultured PC-3 cells by several parameters including mitochondrial cytochrome c release and DNA fragmentation. At the molecular level these compounds inhibit constitutively activated NF-κB signaling by intercepting the IκB kinase (IKK) activity; signaling through the interferon-stimulated response element remained unaffected, suggesting specificity for IKK inhibition. The impaired phosphorylation of p65 and the reduced nuclear translocation of NF-κB proteins were associated with down-regulation of the constitutively overexpressed and NF-κB-dependent antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. In addition, expression of cyclin D1, a crucial cell cycle regulator, was reduced as well. Down-regulation of IKK by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides confirmed the essential role of IKK inhibition for the proliferation of the PC-3 cells. Both compounds tested were active in vivo, yet AKβBA proved to be far superior. Indeed, topical application of water-soluble AKβBA-γ-cyclodextrin on PC-3 tumors xenografted onto chick chorioallantoic membranes induced concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation as well as apoptosis. Similarly, in nude mice carrying PC-3 tumors, systemic application of AKβBA-γ-cyclodextrin inhibited tumor growth and triggered apoptosis in the absence of detectable systemic toxicity.

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in males in the United States and most other industrialized Western countries (1Rosenbaum E. Carducci M.A. Expert Opin. Pharmacother. 2003; 4: 875-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It proceeds from a localized, androgen-dependent disease to an advanced, invasive, and metastatic disease associated with the loss of androgen dependence. A variety of antitumor agents has been tested in patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer, yet without any significant prognostic benefit (1Rosenbaum E. Carducci M.A. Expert Opin.

Once the androgen-independent phase develops, prostate cancer is always lethal. Therefore, unconventional strategies targeting novel molecular mechanisms are urgently required. The development of incurable androgen-independent prostate cancer is apparently mainly due to a lack of an apoptotic response allowing survival of the cells within primary or metastatic tumors (3Gurumurthy S.

In chemoresistant androgen-independent prostate cancer cells, NF-κB is constitutively activated due to an enhanced turnover of the inhibitor proteins of NF-κB, termed IκBs (3Gurumurthy S. Vasudevan K.M. Rangnekar V.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2001; 20: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, intercepting NF-κB signaling might be an attractive antitumor approach (4Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 5Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 6Wang C.Y. Cusack Jr., J.C. Liu R.

Secondary metabolites from plants are a rich source of antitumor compounds, and a variety of plant-derived drugs including taxanes, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, and camptothecin analogues have been approved as antitumor drugs (7Lee K.H. J. Biomed. Sci. 1999; 6: 236-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently identified the acetyl-boswellic acids (ABAs), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (AβBA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKβBA), as cytotoxic compounds (8Heldt M.R. Syrovets T. Winking M.

Syrovets T. Simmet T. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2003; 41: 115-122Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These gum resins are known as frankincense, and extracts thereof have been used in traditional medicine and recently in small clinical trials for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (11Belsner K.

Previous studies from our laboratory and others have suggested that AKβBA possesses anti-tumor activity in several malignant glioma (8Heldt M.R. Syrovets T. Winking M. Sailer E.R. Safayhi H.

Sarikaya S. Rahmanian A. Jodicke A. Boker D.K. J. Neuro-Oncol. 2000; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which could at least be partially due to the inhibition of human topoisomerases (17Syrovets T. Bu ̈chele B. Gedig E. Slupsky J.R. Simmet T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we show that AβBA and AKβBA induce apoptosis in the chemoresistant androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a water-soluble AKβBA-γ-cyclodextrin complex inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis of pre-established PC-3 xenografts in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and in nude mice. Finally, we delineate inhibition of IκB kinase (IKK) activity by AβBA and AKβBA as the molecular mechanism by which these compounds block the constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling in PC-3 cells leading to subsequent inhibition of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and also cyclin D1, a crucial regulator of cell proliferation. These mechanisms finally promote apoptosis of the androgen-independent prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Acetyl-boswellic Acids— AβBA and AKβBA were isolated from African frankincense and purified to chemical homogeneity (>99.9% purity) by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (11Belsner K. Bu ̈chele B. Werz U. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2003; 41: 115-122Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Bu ̈chele B. Zugmaier W. Simmet T. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 791: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The compounds were further characterized by mass spectrometry and one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (11Belsner K. Bu ̈chele B. Werz U. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2003; 41: 115-122Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For the application of AβBA or AKβBA in the xenograft models we developed hydrophilic derivatives by generating γ-cyclodextrin (CD) complexes that allow administration of the lipophilic compounds in aqueous solutions in vivo. Analysis of the compounds in plasma samples was performed after serial extractions on diatomaceous earth and graphitized carbon black followed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and photodiode array detection as described (12Bu ̈chele B. Zugmaier W. Simmet T. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 791: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Bu ̈chele B. Simmet T. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 795: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Xenografts—PC-3 cells and human normal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5 cells) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in Ham's F-12-K and in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum under standard conditions, respectively. For xenotransplantation of PC-3 cells onto the CAM, fertilized chicken eggs were incubated at 37 °C at constant humidity (19Kunzi-Rapp K. Genze F. Kufer R. Reich E. Hautmann R.E. Gschwend J.E. J. Urol. 2001; 166: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On day 6, 0.5 × 106 PC-3 cells in the log growth phase were seeded in 20 μl of medium/Matrigel (1:1, v/v) in a 6-mm silicone ring placed on the CAM. Starting from day 2 after seeding, cells were topically treated once daily either with AβBA-CD, AKβBA-CD, or the CD vehicle. On day 12 the xenografts were histologically analyzed. For the determination of AβBA and AKβBA plasma kinetics, blood anticoagulated with 5 mm EDTA was collected from chorioallantoic veins. For xenotransplantation male NMRI/nu-nu mice (28–33 g) (Taconic M&B, Ry, Denmark) were inoculated subcutaneously at both dorsal sides in the subscapular region with 1 × 106 PC-3 cells in 0.2 ml of media/injection. After 1 week, treatment commenced by single daily intraperitoneal injections of AKβBA-CD at 100 μmol/kg or equivalent amounts of CD vehicle for additional 3 weeks. The tumor size was measured weekly with a caliper; the tumor volume was calculated according to the formula 0.5 × L × W × T (L = length, W = width, T = thickness). At the end of the experiments the tumor and other tissues were recovered for further histological and pathological analysis. Invasiveness of PC-3 tumors in mice was rated after macropathological inspection of the tumors as non-invasive, slightly invasive when tumors were in close contact with neighboring tissues, or invasive when the tumors had infiltrated neighboring tissues such as the intercostal muscles or the skin. Blood anticoagulated with 5 mm EDTA was drawn from NMRI mice (30–34 g) by cardiac puncture; plasma was used for the analysis of AKβBA plasma kinetics (18Bu ̈chele B. Simmet T. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 795: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the institutional guidelines and relevant laws for animal care and protection of Germany; the research protocols were approved by the relevant authorities. Immunostaining and Histomorphometric Analysis—The tumor tissues from the CAM experiments were fixed, embedded, and serially sectioned (5 μm). Every 100 μm the slides were processed for staining and immunohistochemistry for human cytokeratin and Ki-67 proliferation antigen as described (19Kunzi-Rapp K. Genze F. Kufer R. Reich E. Hautmann R.E. Gschwend J.E. J. Urol. 2001; 166: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (both antibodies were from Dako Corp.). The images were digitally recorded at a magnification of ×50 with an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss) and a Sony MC-3249 CCD camera using Visupac version 22.1 software (Carl Zeiss). Areas from the digitalized color photomicrographs were analyzed with SimplePCI 5a (Compix) digital imaging software as the number of pixels corresponding to cells expressing Ki-67 antigen compared with all tumor cells. We statistically analyzed 5-μm sections throughout the tumor at a distance 100 μm apart from each other. For confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Leica DM IRBE, Leica Microsystems) of p65 cells were treated with 10 μm AβBA or AKβBA for 6 h. As a marker for the cytosol, α-tubulin was immunostained (Sigma-Aldrich), whereas nuclei were stained with Hoe 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich); for p65 immunofluorescence purified rabbit antibodies were used (Santa Cruz). Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of mitochondria, cytosol, whole cell lysates, nuclear extracts, or immunoprecipitated IKKs containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, probed with specific antibodies, and detected as described previously (20Burysek L. Syrovets T. Simmet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33509-33517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Wenk J. Schuller J. Hinrichs C. Syrovets T. Azoitei N. Podda M.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies were used for actin (Chemicon), p65 phosphorylated at Ser-536 (Cell Signaling Technology), and Bcl-2 (Biomedicals, Switzerland), whereas rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used for IκBα (Santa Cruz), Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1 (both from Dianova, Germany). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA (1.5 μg) extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-PCR with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Primers for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and cyclin D1 were as described (22Hosokawa Y. Joh T. Maeda Y. Arnold A. Seto M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 616-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Weinmann P. Gaehtgens P. Walzog B. Blood. 1999; 93: 3106-3115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conditions were such that the PCR reactions did not reach the saturation phase. Control experiments showed no DNA contaminations. Normalization was carried out using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the internal standard (24Colognato R. Slupsky J.R. Jendrach M. Burysek L. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Blood. 2003; 102: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The PCR products had the appropriate size, and their identity was confirmed by direct sequencing (Abi Prism 310, Applied Biosystems). Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Parameters—Cytotoxicity was quantified by the release of lactate dehydrogenase from apoptotic cells after the indicated times using a kit (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of lactate dehydrogenase in appropriately treated cell lysates served as a positive control. Additionally, cell proliferation was analyzed by monitoring the mitochondrial reduction of XTT (Roche Diagnostics). Phosphatidylserine expression (25Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar) on the outer membrane leaflet was detected by confocal microcopy of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (Roche Diagnostics) bound to the membrane of Hoe 33342-counterstained PC-3 cells pretreated with 10 μm AβBA or AKβBA for 6 h. There was no nuclear staining with propidium iodide, indicating at this time point no increase in membrane permeability. Alternatively, PC-3 cells and human normal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) were treated with 10 μm AKβBA for 24 h. Reduced cellular DNA contents were determined by flow cytometric analysis of the sub-G0/G1 formation in propidium iodide-stained PC-3 cells (26Telford W.G. King L.E. Fraker P.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) after treatment with AβBA, AKβBA or the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (Calbiochem) for 48 h; in addition, DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA from 3 × 106 cells treated with 10 μm AβBA or AKβBA for the indicated times. Isolation of mitochondria and cytosol by density gradient centrifugation as well as analysis of the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c by Western blot using mouse monoclonal antibodies (BD Pharmingen) were performed as described (27Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39474-39481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For the in situ detection of apoptotic cells in paraffin-embedded tissue sections, the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was used (Roche Diagnostics). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Nuclear Translocation of Transcription Factors—Nuclear extracts (5 μg/sample) from PC-3 cells with or without pretreatment with AβBA or AKβBA for 6 h were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described previously (20Burysek L. Syrovets T. Simmet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33509-33517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 28Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu ̈le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled specific NF-κB or AP-2 oligonucleotides. Nuclear translocation of transcription factors was quantified in nuclear extracts (5 μg) from cells treated either with solvent or ABAs for 6 h using the NF-κB TransAM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Active Motif) as described (21Wenk J. Schuller J. Hinrichs C. Syrovets T. Azoitei N. Podda M. Wlaschek M. Brenneisen P. Schneider L.A. Sabiwalsky A. Peters T. Sulyok S. Dissemond J. Schauen M. Krieg T. Wirth T. Simmet T. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45634-45642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as a fold decrease of the three different Rel proteins in nuclear extracts from the treated samples compared with the control samples and were calculated according to nuclear content in treated cells/nuclear content in control cells. Luciferase Gene Reporter Assay—HEK293 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum were transiently transfected with the vector pNFκB-Luc containing four tandem copies of the κB enhancer element upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (Clontech) using Superfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24 h the cells were pretreated with AβBA or AKβBA for 1 h before stimulation with 100 ng/ml TNF-α (R&D) for 4 h. Luciferase activities normalized to protein contents were determined in the cell lysates using a PlateLumino (Stratec, Germany). Negative controls transfected with the pTal-Luc vector (Clontech) did not show any luciferase activity after TNF-α stimulation. Alternatively, the cells were transfected with an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) luciferase reporter gene (Stratagene) alone or together with constitutively active form of IRF-3 (IRF-3 5D) (29Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B. Sen G.C. Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5532-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours post-transfection the medium was replaced, and cells were treated with ABAs or solvent for 6 h. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding of p50/c-Rel and p50/p65 heterodimers to NF-κB was measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Double-stranded biotinylated DNA containing the NF-κB binding site (AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C) (Thermo Hybaid) was immobilized on a CMD20 B2 SPR sensor chip (Xantec Analytical Systems) (17Syrovets T. Bu ̈chele B. Gedig E. Slupsky J.R. Simmet T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30Syrovets T. Schu ̈le A. Jendrach M. Bu ̈chele B. Simmet T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Mixtures of human recombinant p50 and c-Rel (both from Promega) or p50 and p65 (Active Motif) (200 nm each) in 60 μl of NF-κB binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and 3 μg of poly[dI-dC]) were preincubated for 30 min at 20 °C with 100 μm concentrations of either AβBA or AKβBA or equivalent amounts of Me2SO. The mixture was applied on the sensor chip, and binding to DNA carrying the NF-κB binding site was analyzed with a dual channel IBIS II sensor device (Xantec Analytical Systems). The binding of the recombinant proteins to DNA containing the AP-1 consensus binding sequence (CGC TTG ATG AGT CAG CCG GAA) (Thermo Hybaid) served as a control. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—Assays were basically performed as described previously (28Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu ̈le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). IKKs were immunoprecipitated from lysates of 107 PC-3 cells using 4 μg of antibodies specific for IKKα (Santa Cruz) or IKKβ (BD Pharmingen). The lysis under stringent conditions allowed disruption of the IKK complex and precipitation of the individual kinases (28Syrovets T. Jendrach M. Rohwedder A. Schu ̈le A. Simmet T. Blood. 2001; 97: 3941-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recombinant p65 and a GST-tagged fusion protein corresponding to full-length IκBα (Santa Cruz) served as substrates. The IKKs were preincubated with the respective ABAs for 15 min before the addition of substrate and [γ-32P]ATP. As a loading control, the blots were immunostained for the appropriate IKKs. Alternatively, 30 nm concentrations of active human recombinant GST-IKKα or His-IKKβ fusion proteins (Upstate) were treated with 0.1–10 μm concentrations of either AβBA or AKβBA or solvent and analyzed as indicated above. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of human monocytes stimulated with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5, Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) kinase assays were performed in analogy to the IKK assays using the immunoprecipitated ERK2 and recombinant GST-Elk-1 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology) as substrate. Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide Experiments—For in vitro knockdown of IKKα or IKKβ, phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) (Thermo Hybaid) were used. The ODN were selected on the basis of the major predicted secondary structures, i.e. loops (31Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10317) Google Scholar). The antisense ODN used against IKKα and IKKβ were 5′-CAATTATTTTATGTATT-3′ and 5′-GTCGACGGTCACTGTGT-3′, respectively; the sense ODNs were used as controls. Based on a Blast search, the selected sequences did not show any similarity to any other mRNA sequence. PC-3 cells were transfected with 0.1 μm IKK-specific sense or antisense phosphorothioate ODNs using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 5 h (32Bey E.A. Cathcart M.K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). After transfection, media were replaced by Ham's F-12-K supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were allowed to recover for 20 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in Ham's F-12-K supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, and cell proliferation was determined by XTT assay after 4 h. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Significance was analyzed using the Newman-Keuls test for multigroup comparison or the Wilcoxon rank sum test when appropriate. AβBA and AKβBA Are Cytotoxic for PC-3 Cells in Vitro—To determine the cytotoxic activity of AβBA and AKβBA in the PC-3 cells, we measured release of lactate dehydrogenase from cells damaged by exposure to the ABAs for 12–48 h (Fig. 1, A–C). Viability in terms of lactate dehydrogenase release decreased in AβBA- and AKβBA-treated cells with increasing exposure time. These data show that AβBA and AKβBA exert a concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity on androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. Analysis of the PC-3 cell proliferation in the presence and absence of AβBA and AKβBA by the XTT test yielded basically the same results, although the inhibition of proliferation preceded the cytotoxic effects (data not shown). AβBA and AKβBA Induce Apoptosis in PC-3 Cells in Vitro—To define the cytotoxicity of AβBA and AKβBA as proapoptotic activity, we analyzed several apoptosis parameters. During apoptosis phosphatidylserine physiologically located at the inner membrane leaflet is flipped to the cell surface, where it serves as an “engulfing” signal for neighboring cells (25Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). Treatment of PC-3 cells with 10 μm AβBA or AKβBA for 6 h triggered expression of phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane leaflet, as determined by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V binding (Fig. 2A). At the concentration used, AKβBA was more potent than AβBA. Apoptotic cells have reduced or hypoploid DNA contents (26Telford W.G. King L.E. Fraker P.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that we monitored as a sub-G0/G1 peak of propidium iodide-stained PC-3 cells previously exposed to 10 μm AβBA or AKβBA for 48 h. Again, AKβBA was more potent than AβBA, but it was also more potent than the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (10 μm) that served as positive control (Fig. 2B). Both pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins are localized on the outer mitochondrial membrane, where they compete to regulate the release of cytochrome c. Functional predominance of proapoptotic molecules triggers cytosolic release of cytochrome c, which associates with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 to form the apoptosome (5Reed J.C. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 33Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-65"

To date, there have been no reported structure-function studies to substantiate the function of any putative domains of perforin, which have been postulated totally on primary sequence similarities with domains in other proteins. In this report, we have used recently developed modalities for expressing full-length perforin and robust functional assays to investigate one of the hallmarks of perforin function: its absolute dependence on calcium for lipid binding and cell lysis. We provide, for the first time, experimental evidence that the predicted C-terminal C2 motif constitutes a functional domain that is responsible for membrane binding of perforin. Whereas conserved aspartate residues at positions 429, 435, 483, and 485 were essential for calcium-dependent plasma membrane binding and cell lysis, the contribution of Asp-491 was limited. Finally, after experimentally verifying an optimized three-dimensional model, we have made predictions on the impact of two inherited perforin mutations of the C2 domain on calcium-dependent lipid binding and cell lysis.

In response to the formation of an immunological synapse, perforin and pro-apoptotic serine proteases, granzymes, are released from the secretory granules and diffuse a short distance to the target cell (7Trambas C.M. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Functional perforin is essential for granzyme-mediated death of virus-infected and transformed cells, through the induction of apoptosis. Mice deficient in perforin are susceptible to many viruses and to intracellular bacterial infections (8Kagi D. Ledermann B. Burki K. Seiler P. Odermatt B. Olsen K.J. Podack E.R. Zinkernagel R.M.

Infants that inherit inactivating (frequently missense) mutations of both PFN1 alleles are unable to clear antigen-presenting cells recruited in response to viral antigens, typically in the first year of life (10Feldmann J.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 111-192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These recognized motifs include an N-terminal region that possesses some intrinsic lytic capacity when it is synthesized as an oligopeptide (14Natarajan K. Cowan J.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 147-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15Persechini P.M. Ojcius D.M. Adeodato S.C. Notaroberto P.C. Daniel C.B. Young J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5017-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); an amphipathic α-helical domain, presumed to be important for membrane insertion of perforin; an epidermal growth factor-like domain of unknown function, and a carboxyl C2 domain predicted to bind calcium ions (16Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The central portion of perforin (comprising around one quarter of the molecule) shares some similarity with components of the complement membrane attack complex, particularly C9 (3Young J.D. Cohn Z.A. Podack E.R. Science. 1986; 233: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Shinkai Y. Takio K. Okumura K. Nature. 1988; 334: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), however, the complement proteins do not possess a C2 domain.Despite the paramount importance of perforin in maintaining immune homeostasis, it has not been possible to substantiate the functions of putative perforin domains beyond identifying homologies with other characterized proteins. Such a large gap in our knowledge primarily exists due to the lack of appropriate methodologies for expressing, purifying, and testing recombinant perforin. Despite these drawbacks, many in vitro studies have been united in demonstrating the absolute dependence of perforin on calcium ions for its membrane binding and lytic function (18Blumenthal R. Millard P.J. Henkart M.P. Reynolds C.W. Henkart P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5551-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Young J.D. Damiano A. DiNome M.A. Leong L.G.

Nature. 1989; 337: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the molecular basis for this requirement is still unclear, two decades after the initial isolation of the protein. More recently, structure prediction analysis has suggested that the C terminus of perforin may form a calcium-dependent membrane-binding C2 domain (16Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 22Uellner R.

C2 domains have been found in a number of unrelated proteins, such as synaptotagmin, protein kinase C-β (PKC-β), and phospholipase C-δ (PLC-δ) (21Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J.

Calcium-binding C2 domains coordinate calcium ions, usually through exposed carboxylic groups protruding from loops formed by the β-sheet scaffold of the motif. Calcium coordination in turn facilitates the binding of the C2 domain to phospholipid membranes. However, following the initial claims of perforin containing a C2 domain, there has been no experimental data verifying that this motif acts as a functional domain that can regulate the membrane binding perforin and subsequent cell lysis. The current study represents the first comprehensive structure-function analysis aimed at understanding the structural basis of calcium-dependent membrane binding of perforin. Through a detailed mutational analysis and using our recently developed methodologies (29Voskoboinik I. Thia M.-C. De Bono A. Browne K. Cretney E. Jackson J.T. Darcy P.K. Jane S.M. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we now experimentally demonstrate the essential role of the C2 domain for cell membrane binding and cytotoxic function of perforin. Based on the solved structures of other C2 domains, we have also built and experimentally validated three-dimensional models of the C2 domain and suggest plausible molecular explanations for two FHL-associated mutations mapping to the C2 domain.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Adherent RBL-2H3 (RBL; rat basophil leukemia, American Type Culture Collection, National Institutes of Health) and non-adherent Jurkat human T lymphoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine at 37 °C. RBL cells were harvested by brief incubation in trypsin-EDTA solution (CSL Ltd., Australia) at 37 °C and were thoroughly washed prior to use in cytotoxicity assays.Transient Transfection of RBL Cells and Cytotoxicity Assays—Mouse perforin cDNA in pKS(+) Bluescript was mutated using the Transformer or QuikChange kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) (oligonucleotide primer sequences will be provided on request). The wild-type (wt) or mutated perforins G428E, G428D, G428A, G428K, D429A, T434M, T434D, T434K, D435A, D483A, D485A, D489A, D490A, D491A, and D497A (referred to as such in the text) were cloned into the pIRES2-epidermal growth factorP expression plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech). This vector contains an internal ribosome entry site, which allows the selection of perforin-expressing cells based on green fluorescent protein expression (29Voskoboinik I. Thia M.-C. De Bono A. Browne K. Cretney E. Jackson J.T. Darcy P.K. Jane S.M. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Each perforin cDNA was sequenced in full on both strands to check the fidelity of site-directed mutagenesis. The resultant expression plasmids were purified using Qiagen Maxi-kit. Fcϵ-expressing RBL cells were transiently transfected with 20 μg of pIRES2-epidermal growth factorP containing perforin cDNA or the vector alone (green fluorescent protein control) as described previously (29Voskoboinik I. Thia M.-C. De Bono A. Browne K. Cretney E. Jackson J.T. Darcy P.K. Jane S.M. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein-expressing cells were collected 18-20 h later using flow cytometry (FACStar, BD Biosciences). The cytotoxic capacity of RBL cells was analyzed using Jurkat T cells as targets in a 4-h 51Cr release assay as described previously (Voskoboinik et al. (29Voskoboinik I. Thia M.-C. De Bono A. Browne K. Cretney E. Jackson J.T. Darcy P.K. Jane S.M. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Shiver et al. (40Shiver J.W. Henkart P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1175-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)).Expression of Recombinant Perforin, Membrane Binding, and Cytotoxicity Assays—wt, D429A, D435A, D483A, D485A, and D491A perforin cDNAs were cloned into the pFastBac vector and overexpressed in Sf21 cells using the Back-to-Back kit. Perforin was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (all additional reagents were supplied by Invitrogen). In the membrane binding assay, 2 × 107 sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm Hepes (pH7.2), unless otherwise stated. An aliquot of purified perforin was added to the cell suspension for 5 min on ice. The cells were pelleted at 12,000 × g for 10 s in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was promptly removed, and the cells were washed in ice-cold buffer, lysed in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and analyzed by Western immunoblotting. The SRBC lysis assay was performed in the same buffer at 37 °C for 20 min in U-shaped 96-well plates, unless otherwise stated. Following centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min, the release of hemoglobin into the supernatant was estimated by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Cell lysis was expressed as a percentage of maximum hemoglobin release compared with lysis in water.Immunoperoxidase Staining—Approximately 100,000 RBL cells were seeded in each well of an eight-well chamber slide 1 day prior to staining. Cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 3.7% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 5 min, then washed as before. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.3% H2O2 for 15 min. Blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin or skim milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline) was added for 30 min prior to rat anti-perforin monoclonal antibody P1-8. Bound immunoglobulin was detected with biotinylated donkey anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and by application of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Dako) for 10 min and the chromogen diaminobenzidine (Dako). Finally, the cells were counterstained with eosin and analyzed using Axioscop 2 (Zeiss), Spot RT Slider (1315 × 1035 pixels/8.98 × 7.04 mm) camera, and Spot version 4.0.2 software (both Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.).SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblotting—Cell lysates from transiently transfected RBL cells or recombinant purified perforin were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE (Tris-glycine) gels, which were then analyzed for perforin expression by immunoblotting with P1-8 and horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat Ig. The signal was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).Three-dimensional Modeling of the Putative Calcium-binding Domain of Perforin—To rationalize the effects of various mutations, homology models of the perforin C2 domain were constructed using four known C2 domain-containing structures: protein kinase C-β (Protein Data Bank ID 1A25 (26Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)), phospholipase C-δ (1DJG (28Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)), phospholipase A2 (1RLW (30Perisic O. Fong S. Lynch D.E. Bycroft M. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1596-1604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)), and synaptotagmin-III C (1DQV (27Sutton R.B. Ernst J.A. Brunger A.T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar)). Each of the selected templates is a high resolution structure determined by x-ray crystallography and containing multiple bound divalent cations. Using the convention of Essen et al. (28Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2753-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Sutton and Sprang (26Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), the four calcium binding sites observed in C2 domains were numbered I-IV. Data presented in Table I highlight the calcium binding sites occupied in each of the template structures. Target-template alignments were carried out manually and were based on both sequence and secondary structure, but without access to the results of biological experiments herein. Perforin secondary structure was predicted using JPRED (31Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Modeling was carried out using standard protocols in MODELLER (32Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10390) Google Scholar) and structures analyzed in VMD (33Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (28, 33-38): 27Crossref Scopus (36896) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations in the model structures were predicted by replacing the wt residue with the mutant residue in commonly occurring rotamers.Table ICoordination of calcium-binding sites in various C2 domainsCa2+-ICa2+-IICa2+-IIICa2+-IVProtein kinase C-β−+++Phospholipase C-δ+++−Phospholipase A2++−−Synaptotagmin-IIIC2A−+++PerforinaProposed from mutagenesis and functional data in the present study.+/−+++/−a Proposed from mutagenesis and functional data in the present study. Open table in a new tab RESULTSRecombinant Purified Perforin Has Potent Lytic Activity—To perform a detailed structure-function analysis of perforin, we needed to design an experimental system that would allow the expression and purification of recombinant perforin for use in cell free assays. There was also a need to validate the function of the recombinant product. Recently we reported such a system, which is based on the expression of perforin in baculovirus-infected insect cells (29Voskoboinik I. Thia M.-C. De Bono A. Browne K. Cretney E. Jackson J.T. Darcy P.K. Jane S.M. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the yield of purified perforin was relatively low (40-120 μg/liter culture), the product contained minimal contaminants or degradation products (data not shown) and was strongly antigenic with anti-perforin antisera (Fig. 1 and see below). The lytic activity associated with each elution fraction was also closely correlated with perforin concentration (data not shown). We assessed the potency of recombinant wt perforin and found that ∼35 fmol (corresponding to a perforin concentration of 175 pm) was sufficient to induce the release of half the total hemoglobin contained in 2.5 × 107 SRBC (Fig. 1A). This level of activity corresponds to ∼750 perforin molecules per cell, assuming that all become membrane-bound. Lytic activity was maximal within 2-4 min, upon perforin addition. These results confirmed the potency of the recombinant perforin and were consistent with earlier studies (18Blumenthal R. Millard P.J. Henkart M.P. Reynolds C.W. Henkart P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5551-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In agreement with earlier reports using semi-purified native perforin (18Blumenthal R. Millard P.J. Henkart M.P. Reynolds C.W. Henkart P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5551-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Young J.D. Damiano A. DiNome M.A. Leong L.G. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Tschopp J. Schafer S. Masson D. Peitsch M.C. Heusser C. Nature. 1989; 337: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), erythrocyte lysis was Ca2+-dependent, with maximal hemoglobin release observed at >200 μm, and 50% lysis at around 70 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). Importantly, these data were consistent with calcium-dependent membrane binding of perforin to SRBC, in that maximal binding occurred at ∼200 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). Also consistent with earlier findings using purified native perforin (18Blumenthal R. Millard P.J. Henkart M.P. Reynolds C.W. Henkart P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5551-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the binding of perforin was completely reversed when Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA, resulting in abrogation of further cell lysis.Positively charged calcium ions are commonly coordinated in proteins by amino acids with an acidic moiety. Protonation of acidic side chains due to reduction in the pH would therefore be expected to reduce Ca2+ binding to perforin, leading to reduced capacity to bind lipid membranes and induce cell lysis. Indeed, as the pH was progressively reduced, the lytic activity of perforin also became reduced, with complete loss of function below pH 6.2 (Fig. 1C (19Young J.D. Damiano A. DiNome M.A. Leong L.G. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). Although the mean pKa for aspartates is typically around 3.4, it is not uncommon for active site or ligand binding site carboxyl groups to have pKa values >5.5 (34Forsyth W.R. Antosiewicz J.M. Robertson A.D. Proteins. 2002; 48: 388-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). As discussed further below, we note that the pH of CTL granules is ∼5.5, a level at which our data showed perforin would be inactive. Sublytic concentrations of recombinant perforin also efficiently delivered granzymes to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (35Kelly J.M. Waterhouse N.J. Cretney E. Browne K.A. Ellis S. Trapani J.A. Smyth M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22236-22242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Taken together, the characterized recombinant perforin was essentially indistinguishable, in terms of its fundamental lytic properties, from the native perforin described in earlier studies.The Putative C2 Domain of Perforin Is Functionally Active—The amino acid sequence alignment of perforin with a number of calcium-binding C2 domains, including perforin homologues across various species, has previously revealed highly conserved aspartate residues at positions 429, 435, 483, 485, 489, 490, 491, and 497 (16Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 22Uellner R. Zvelebil M.J. Hopkins J. Jones J. MacDougall L.K. Morgan B.P. Podack E. Waterfield M.D. Griffiths G.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7287-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Due to low overall similarity between C2 domains, we could not rule out any of these residues as potential calcium-binding ligands. The relative contribution of each aspartate residue to perforin function was investigated by substituting single aspartate residues with alanine and using transfection to express each perforin variant independently in RBL cells. We then assessed the capacity of each RBL cell population to kill 51Cr-labeled Jurkat target cells to which they were conjugated. The mutations, D429A, D435A, D483A, and D485A, each caused the total loss of cytotoxic activity of perforin (Fig. 2A). By comparison, the replacement of aspartate residues at positions 465, which is conserved only in mammalian perforins, and at 489, 490, 491, and 497 had no effect on the cytolytic function of perforin-expressing RBL cells (Fig. 2A). Loss of perforin activity could not be put down to low expression levels or defective intracellular trafficking, as evident from Western blotting of RBL cell lysates and immunocytochemistry analysis (Fig. 2B). Rather, we hypothesized that the loss of lytic function was related to the lack of calcium-dependent cell membrane binding.Fig. 2The effect of mutations of conserved aspartate residues on the lytic function of perforin expressed in RBL cells. A, cytotoxicity assay using RBL cells expressing mutated or wt perforin and 51Cr-labeled Jurkat target cells. The effector-to-target ratios used were 30:1 and 10:1; the Western blot at the top shows expression levels of perforin mutants in RBL cells used in the cytotoxicity assay. The Western blots in the right panel show the binding of recombinant perforin expressed and purified from Sf-9 cells to SRBC in the absence or presence of 1 mm CaCl2 (tot indicates the total amount of perforin added to the assay).

The data are presented as mean ± S.D. and are representative of 3-5 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To directly study cell membrane binding, we also expressed and purified each inactive, mutated perforin protein from baculovirus-infected insect cells (29Voskoboinik I. Thia M.-C. De Bono A. Browne K. Cretney E. Jackson J.T. Darcy P.K. Jane S.M. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results of the RBL cytotoxicity assay, the mutations D429A, D435A, D483A, and D485A led to a complete loss of cytolytic activity of recombinant perforins (data not shown). Subsequent analysis revealed that the lack of cytolytic activity was caused by the inability of these variants to fulfill the first crucial step in perforin-induced cytolysis, namely calcium-dependent membrane binding (Fig. 2A). Whereas essentially all of the added wt perforin was bound to SRBC membranes in a calcium-dependent manner, substitution at residues 429, 435, 483, or 485 resulted in virtually complete loss of lipid binding (Fig. 2A). This finding strongly suggested that residues Asp-429, Asp-435, Asp-483, and Asp-485 were likely be direct ligands for Ca2+ in the C2 domain.On the basis of the results of the experiments described above, amino acid sequence alignment and predicted secondary structure, we next built new three-dimensional models of the perforin C2 domain, using four templates, PLA2, PKC-β, PLC-δ, and synaptotagmin IIIC (see “Materials and Methods”). A priori, we suspected that a model based on PLA2 would be less informative because, unlike the other three models, it suggested no role for the essential Asp-429 residue, and it appeared to coordinate two rather than three Ca2+ ions (Tables I and II). Consistent with our experimental data, the other three models, protein kinase C-β (26Sutton R.B. Sprang S.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1395-1405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), phospholipase C-δ (28Essen L.O. Perisic O. Lynch D.E. Katan M. Williams R.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), predicted a critical role for aspartate residues Asp-429, Asp-435, Asp-483, and Asp-485 (Table II). In agreement with our data for the non-essential aspartate residues (Fig. 2A), all of the C2 domain models predict that Asp-465 and Asp-497 are both remote from the Ca2+ binding site and that the Asp-489 and Asp-490 side chains are oriented away from the binding site (Fig. 3).Table IIPredicted participation of aspartate residues in calcium coordination at sites I-IV of the perforin"
https://openalex.org/W2040109981,"The Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP) family has been implicated in the stacking of Golgi cisternae and the regulation of Golgi disassembly/reassembly during mitosis in mammalian cells. GRASP65 is a dimer that can directly link adjacent surfaces through trans-oligomerization in a mitotically regulated manner. Here we show that the N-terminal GRASP domain (amino acids 1–201) is both necessary and sufficient for dimerization and trans-oligomerization but is not mitotically regulated. The C-terminal serine/proline-rich domain (amino acids 202–446) cannot dimerize nor can it link adjacent surfaces. It does, however, confer mitotic regulation on the GRASP domain through multiple sites phosphorylated by the mitotic kinases, cdc2/B1, and the polo-like kinase. Transient expression corroborated these results by showing that the GRASP domain alone inhibited mitotic fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus.

Transient expression corroborated these results by showing that the GRASP domain alone inhibited mitotic fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. The central and unique feature of the Golgi apparatus in most eukaryotic cells is the stack of flattened cisternal membranes with dilated rims (1Rambourg A. Clermont Y. Berger E.G. Roth J. The Golgi Apparatus. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 37-61Google Scholar). The major functions of the Golgi apparatus are thought to be modification and sorting of newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins and lipids. The ordered structure of this organelle is thought to reflect the requirement for the enzymes and sorting machinery to be compartmentalized to allow a specific series of modifications and sorting reactions to be carried out (2Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 2-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The mechanism that organizes Golgi cisternae into stacks is, therefore, of central importance to understanding Golgi functioning. Proteins involved in stacking Golgi cisternae were first identified using cell-free assays that mimicked the cell cycle-dependent disassembly and reassembly of the Golgi apparatus (3Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Termed Golgi reassembly stacking proteins (GRASPs), 1The abbreviations used are: GRASP(s), Golgi reassembly stacking protein(s); plk, polo-like kinase; SPR, serine/proline-rich; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IC, interphase cytosols; MBP, Maltose-binding protein; MC, mitotic cytosols; MW, molecular weight. they include GRASP65 (4Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and GRASP55 (5Shorter J. Watson R. Giannakou M.E. Clarke M. Warren G. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the number referring to their apparent molecular mass (in kDa) on SDS-PAGE. Antibodies to GRASPs inhibited the restacking of newly formed cisternae, as did soluble forms of these proteins, but did not affect the reformation of the cisternae themselves. GRASP65 was also implicated in cisternal stacking in vivo. Mitotic cells injected with GRASP65 antibodies, or a soluble fragment of the protein, failed to form proper Golgi stacks in the two daughter cells after mitosis (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), showing that GRASP65 is involved in Golgi stacking at the end of mitosis. In apoptotic cells, cleavage of GRASP65 by caspase-3 correlates with Golgi fragmentation, and this is inhibited, at least partially, by the expression of a caspase-resistant form of GRASP65 (7Lane J.D. Lucocq J. Pryde J. Barr F.A. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. Lowe M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both GRASPs are myristoylated at the N terminus. This, together with other binding partners (4Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 8Barr F.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6427-6439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ensures targeting to Golgi membranes. GRASP65 is located in cis-Golgi membranes, whereas GRASP55 is located more toward the middle of the Golgi stack (5Shorter J. Watson R. Giannakou M.E. Clarke M. Warren G. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These locations argue that the GRASP family of proteins helps to determine the stacking of different cisternal layers (11Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 873-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GRASP65 is the major phosphorylated protein on the Golgi during mitosis (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), when the Golgi apparatus is disassembled. It is dephosphorylated at the end of mitosis, as the Golgi is assembled in the daughter cells (4Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). GRASP65 forms homodimers, and these can associate into higher order oligomers that can be broken down by treatment with mitotic cytosol or with two mitotic kinases, cdc2 and polo-like kinase (plk). Furthermore, beads coated with GRASP65 form large aggregates, showing that GRASP65 can link adjacent surfaces by forming trans-oligomers. These aggregates can be broken down using mitotic cytosol or the two mitotic kinases and then re-aggregated by treatment with phosphatases present in interphase cytosol (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Because these conditions mimic the unstacking and restacking of Golgi cisternae during mitosis, they offer the best evidence to date that the GRASP family have the structural properties that are needed to stack cisternae in vivo. What remains unclear is the relationship between trans-oligomerization and mitotic phosphorylation. GRASP65 has a clear domain structure (see Fig. 1A). The N-terminal part of the protein (amino acids 1–201) is the GRASP domain, which is highly conserved between GRASP65 and GRASP55 (5Shorter J. Watson R. Giannakou M.E. Clarke M. Warren G. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), as well as between different species (8Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A short middle region contains the GM130 binding site (amino acids 197–211). GM130 is a golgin that has been implicated in vesicle tethering and restacking at the end of mitosis (12Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The C-terminal part of the protein (amino acids 202–446) is a serine/proline-rich (SPR) domain. The latter is a candidate for mitotic phosphorylation, but it is not clear whether it plays a direct or indirect role in trans-oligomerization. Because an answer to this question will help us understand the Golgi stacking mechanism, we undertook an extensive series of mapping experiments to dissect the roles of the different domains. Reagents—All reagents were from Sigma, Roche, or Calbiochem, unless otherwise stated. The following antibodies were used: polyclonal antibodies against GST (Amersham Biosciences) and MBP (New England Biolabs); monoclonal antibodies against GM130 (Transduction Laboratories), GRASP65 (F. Barr), and RGS-His (Qiagen). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were from Molecular Probes. Antibodies against GST-GRASP65 (amino acids 202–446) and His-GRASP65 (amino acids 1–320) were raised in rabbits and purified using His-GRASP65. Construction of GRASP65 Fusion Proteins—GRASP65 cDNAs were cloned into pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs), pQE9 (Qiagen), pGEX (Amersham Biosciences), or pET30a (Novagen) by PCR or direct restriction digestion and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)Gold bacteria or XL-1 blue as appropriate. The proteins were purified on amylose (New England Biolabs), nickel (Qiagen), or glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) beads. GRASP65 point mutations were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Kinases, Cytosols, and Golgi Membranes—Golgi membranes were purified from rat liver (13Hui N. Nakamura N. Slusarewicz P. Warren G. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 46-55Google Scholar). Interphase (IC) and mitotic (MC) cytosols were prepared from HeLa S3 cells (3Rabouille C. Misteli T. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 605-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cdc2 kinase (cdc2/cyclin B1) and plk were expressed and purified as described, and kinase activity was measured (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Band Shift Assay for GRASP65 Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation of GRASP65 was analyzed by a band shift assay (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Purified rat liver Golgi membranes (50 μg) or purified GRASP65 (50 ng) was treated with 500 μg of mitotic HeLa cytosol or the equivalent kinase activity for 60 min at 37 °C. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The migration distance was measured, and the size of the protein was calculated by reference to the logarithmic plot of the molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad). The extent of phosphorylation was estimated from the increase in molecular weight after treatment with kinases or mitotic cytosol. Assays for GRASP65 Dimerization and Oligomerization—BL21-(DE3)Gold bacteria were co-transformed with GRASP65 (full-length, His-tagged) cDNA in pET30a and other GRASP65 constructs in either pMAL-c2X or pGEX. The expressed proteins were purified using sequential columns in different orders as described (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of expressed protein from each purification step were analyzed by immunoblotting, and blots were quantified by directly measuring the ECL signal using Kodak Image Station 440CF. The signal intensity was compared with at least three standard samples on the same immunoblot. To test the oligomerization of GRASP65, separately expressed and purified GRASP65 (full-length, His-tagged) and MBP or GST-tagged GRASP65 (full-length or fragments) were mixed and treated with IC or MC in the presence of 2 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system. The protein complex was isolated using nickel beads and analyzed by immunoblotting (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For sedimentation analysis, a purified GRASP65 full-length protein or a fragment was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in gradient buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH7.4, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP regenerating system) with or without cdc2/B1. Glycerol gradients (10–35% w/v) were centrifuged (2 h, 65,000 rpm, VTI65.1 rotor), and fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In some experiments, fractions were pooled, dialyzed against gradient buffer, concentrated using centricon (Millipore), incubated as above, and reloaded onto the same type of gradient. Aggregation Assay Using GRASP65-coated Beads—Purified recombinant GRASP65 (full-length protein or fragments) was clarified by centrifugation and cross-linked to Dynal beads M500. The beads were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with IC or MC in the presence of 2 mm MgATP and observed under a microscope (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In some experiments bead aggregates were washed with buffer and further incubated with the alternative cytosol. The quantitation of beads in aggregates was carried out as described previously (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Expression of the GRASP Domain in HeLa Cells—HeLa S3 cells were transfected with the GRASP domain (1–201, tagged with GFP at the C terminus) (5Shorter J. Watson R. Giannakou M.E. Clarke M. Warren G. Barr F.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), its G2A mutant (glycine 2 mutated to alanine), or GFP alone using the FuGENE 6 transfection kit (Roche Applied Science). Cells were cultured in the presence of G418 for three passages to select transfected cells. Cells between passages 5 and 10 after transfection were used in these experiments. The mitotic synchronization of cells was performed using a 2 mm thymidine block for 24 h (14Klevecz R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 10: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and cells were released for 9–11 h. Cells cultured on coverslips coated with polylysine were fixed and permeabilized in methanol. The cells were labeled with a monoclonal antibody against GM130. In some experiments, DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342, and GFP was stained with polyclonal antibodies. Confocal fluorescence images were captured as described (15Axelsson M.A. Warren G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). For EM, mitotic cells were collected by a shake off of cells released from a thymidine block (14Klevecz R.R. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 10: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and untreated cells were fixed on the dish. After fixation using 2.5% glutaraldehyde, the cells were processed for Epon embedding. Golgi stacks and Golgi clusters were identified using morphological criteria and quantitated using standard stereological techniques (16Souter E. Pypaert M. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The average number of Golgi/cell profile was quantitated. For interphase cells, the profiles had to contain a nuclear profile with an intact nuclear envelope. For mitotic cells, the profile had to contain one or more profiles of condensed chromosomes lacking a nuclear envelope. Results were from three independent experiments. Mitotic Phosphorylation Sites on GRASP65 Are in the C-terminal Half of the Protein—Phosphorylation sites predicted by the computer program (Prosite combined with the S/T-P criteria) are enriched in the C-terminal half (SPR domain) of GRASP65, although there are a few potential sites in the N-terminal region (Fig. 1A, top, vertical lines). To identify those that were targets of mitotic kinases, cDNAs encoding different segments of GRASP65 were constructed, expressed in bacteria, and purified via the attached tags. They were then incubated with MC or the mitotic kinases, cdc2/B1 and plk. A previous study showed that phosphorylation of GRASP65 causes an increase in apparent molecular weight (MW) on SDS-PAGE and so can be used to assess the extent of phosphorylation (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, constructs containing all or part of the C-terminal domain increased in MW upon kinase treatment. The longer the C-terminal fragment, the larger the molecular shift observed. Protein constructs containing only the N-terminal GRASP domain showed no shift in MW at all. Maximal phosphorylation was obtained using mitotic cytosol, and this was only matched using a combination of both cdc2/B1 and plk. The extent of mobility shift was not affected by the nature of the tag used to purify the construct. Together these results show that the phosphorylation sites causing the band-shift of GRASP65 are restricted to the C-terminal SPR domain. The GRASP Domain Is Both Necessary and Sufficient for Dimerization—To identify the domain mediating dimerization of GRASP65, the full-length protein was co-expressed with constructs covering different regions. These constructs were tagged differently to allow sequential purification using each tag in turn. As shown in Fig. 2A, when the two full-length proteins GRASP65(MBP) and GRASP65(His) were co-expressed, they co-purified through a two-step purification using amylose and nickel columns. The final ratio of the two proteins in the co-purified complex was ∼1:1 (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained by Coomassie Blue staining, taking into account the different molecular weights of the proteins. This ratio was unaffected by the order in which the columns were used for purification, suggesting that the mixed complex is a dimer. If it had been a higher order oligomer then the final ratio would reflect the relative expression levels of the two constructs. In fact the ∼1:1 ratio was obtained over a 5-fold range of expression of His-GRASP65 to MBP-GRASP65 (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). When the GRASP domain (tagged with GST), or the ΔN15-GRASP domain (a truncated form of the GRASP domain lacking the N-terminal myristoylation signal), was co-expressed with full-length GRASP65(His), the two proteins yielded a ∼1:1 ratio irrespective of the order of the columns, again consistent with a dimer (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, when the SPR domain was co-expressed with the full-length protein, these two proteins did not co-purify (Fig. 2D). Other C-terminal fragments were also co-expressed with the full-length protein, but none of them co-purified (not shown). These data show that the N-terminal GRASP domain is involved in dimerization of the protein. The GRASP Domain Is Necessary and Sufficient for Trans-oligomerization but Is Not Mitotically Regulated—To link adjacent surfaces, GRASP65 dimers need to form oligomers, and these must be arranged in trans. To identify the domains required for oligomerization, the full-length protein GRASP65-(His) was mixed with purified GRASP65 fragments. After incubation under interphase or mitotic conditions, the full-length protein was isolated using nickel beads, and co-isolation of the fragments was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3A, the efficiency of GRASP65(His) pull down is high, because almost all of the GRASP65(His) was found in the bead fraction (Fig. 3A). MBP-tagged, full-length GRASP65 co-isolated with GRASP65(His) under interphase but not mitotic conditions when both proteins were phosphorylated as indicated by the increase in MW. The GRASP domain (tagged with GST) also co-isolated with GRASP65(His), under both interphase and mitotic conditions, suggesting that binding is not mitotically regulated, consistent with the lack of mitotic phosphorylation sites in this region (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the SPR domain (tagged with GST) did not interact with the full-length protein at all under either condition (Fig. 3A). Two other C-terminal fragments, 202–320 and 320–446, also did not interact with the full-length protein (data not shown). These results show that the GRASP domain alone is sufficient to interact with the full-length protein to form oligomers and suggest that this interaction is not mitotically regulated. As an alternative approach to study oligomerization, the full-length protein, the GRASP domain, or the SPR domain was treated with or without cdc2/B1 and loaded onto a 10–35% glycerol gradient to separate oligomers from dimers. As shown in Fig. 3B, a large fraction of GRASP65 sedimented toward the bottom of the gradient, consistent with the formation of oligomers. This did not happen after treatment with cdc2/B1, with most of the GRASP65 peaking in fractions 3 and 4, the same as dimeric bovine serum albumin (not shown), which has a similar MW. This shows that oligomerization of GRASP65 is mitotically regulated. In contrast, almost all of the GRASP domain sedimented rapidly, irrespective of the treatment, suggesting that it formed oligomers that were not disrupted under mitotic conditions (Fig. 3B). The SPR domain did not form oligomers at all, under either condition (Fig. 3B). These results were confirmed and extended using a number of other GRASP65 constructs (supplemental Fig. 1). Together these data show that the GRASP domain is both necessary and sufficient for oligomerization but is not mitotically regulated. Interestingly, and in marked contrast to full-length GRASP65, almost all of the GRASP domain construct sedimented as oligomers, with little or no protein present in the dimer fraction (Fig. 3B). This was independent of the tag used (supplemental Fig. 1) and suggested that the GRASP domain forms more stable oligomers than GRASP65. To test this possibility, fractions were pooled and rerun on the same type of gradient. As shown in Fig. 3C, the pooled GRASP65 dimers ran as dimers and oligomers, as did the GRASP65 oligomers, suggesting that the dimers and oligomers are in equilibrium with approximately equal amounts in each fraction. The pooled GRASP domain oligomers only ran as oligomers suggesting that they are much more stable than the GRASP65 oligomers. This in turn suggests that the presence of the SPR domain destabilizes the interaction between the GRASP domain dimers. The bead assay was then used to show that the oligomers formed were arranged in trans (6Wang Y. Seemann J. Pypaert M. Shorter J. Warren G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Dynal beads were coated with different GRASP65 fragments by cross-linking and incubated in the presence of interphase or mitotic cytosols. Representative images for some of the constructs are shown in Fig. 4A and quantitation for all of the constructs is shown in Fig. 4B. Beads coated with fragments containing the GRASP domain all formed large aggregates under interphase conditions (Fig. 4, A and B). Aggregation was not affected by removal of all or part of the SPR domain suggesting that this domain plays no role in trans-oligomerization. However, the removal of the SPR domain abolished the ability of mitotic cytosol to disaggregate the beads. The presence of about half the SPR domain-(201–320) was needed for this ability. Beads coated with the SPR domain alone, or any other C-terminal fragments of SPR, did not form large aggregates and these were only modestly influenced by MC (Fig. 4, A and B). The converse experiment was also carried out, using fragments of GRASP65 to inhibit the aggregation of beads coated with full-length GRASP65. Representative images are shown in Fig. 4C, and the quantitation is shown in Fig. 4D. Only fragments containing the GRASP domain inhibited aggregation of the beads. The SPR domain alone had no effect. Together these experiments strongly suggest that the GRASP domain is responsible for trans-oligomerization, and this is mitotically regulated by the SPR domain, and in particular by residues 202–320. Mapping the Regulatory Phosphorylation Sites in the SPR Domain—The minimal consensus sequence for cdc2, plk, and other mitotic kinases is (S/T)-P (17Davis F.M. Tsao T.Y. Fowler S.K. Rao P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2926-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and there are seven such sites in the SPR domain. The ones within the critical region-(202–320) or near to it, together with the adjacent serines and threonines, were mutated alone and in combination in the full-length protein, then expressed in bacteria, and purified via the His-tag (Fig. 5A, mutA–D). These purified proteins were then treated with mitotic cytosol or kinases, and their phosphorylation was assessed using the band-shift assay. There was an inverse correlation between the shift in MW and the number of sites mutated. Mutation of all these sites did not completely abolish the band shift (Fig. 5A, mutD), because there are potential phosphorylation sites at the C terminus which were not mutated, and there are more serines and threonines in this region which do not fit the (S/T)-P criteria but could possibly be phosphorylated. The effects of these point mutations on oligomerization were tested first using glycerol gradients. Purified proteins were incubated with or without purified cdc2 kinase and after centrifugation and fractionation, GRASP65 was detected by immunoblotting. Under interphase conditions, the pattern of sedimentation was the same for both the wild-type and the mutant proteins. A fraction of the protein sedimented rapidly in each case showing that mutation of the sites per se had no effect on the ability of GRASP65 to oligomerize (Fig. 5B, WT versus mutA–D). Under mitotic conditions, very little of the wild type GRASP65 formed oligomers and mutation of one or two potential phosphorylation sites had very little effect (Fig. 5B, mutB and mutC). However, mutation of more sites, such as those near the beginning of the SPR domain (mutA), had a greater effect. Under mitotic conditions, a significant fraction sedimented rapidly toward the bottom of the gradient. When all these sites were mutated, more GRASP65 sedimented rapidly, and a peak at fraction 10 could be detected (Fig. 5B, mutD). These results show that multiple phosphorylation sites are responsible for the regulation of oligomerization. These mutants were also tested for their effect on trans-oligomerization using the bead assay. Under interphase conditions, beads coated with each of the mutant proteins aggregated to exactly the same extent as the wild type protein. Under mitotic conditions, with one exception (mutD), aggregation also did not occur. Transfer from MC to IC led to aggregation, whereas treatment with IC followed by MC led to aggregates undergoing dispersal. The exception was mutD in which seven phosphorylation sites were mutated. These formed aggregates even under mitotic conditions and aggregates formed in IC could not be disaggregated using MC (Fig. 5C). These data show that trans-oligomerization is regulated by multiple phosphorylation sites. Mitotic Regulation of Oligomerization in Vivo—If the GRASP domain mediates trans-oligomerization but cannot be mitotically regulated then it might be expected to inhibit the unstacking of the Golgi at the onset of mitosis. To test this, the GRASP domain was tagged at the C terminus with GFP so that it could be visualized, and a stable HeLa cell line was generated. As a control, the N-terminal myristoylation signal was removed so that GRASP should no longer be able to bind to Golgi membranes. GFP alone was used as another control (Fig. 6A). Immunoblot analysis showed each of the constructs was stably expressed at equivalent levels in each of the stable cell lines (data not shown). Fluorescence analysis showed that the GRASP domain localized to the Golgi in interphase cells as shown by co-staining for GM130 (Fig. 6A, a). GRASP lacking the N-terminal myristoylation signal was present throughout the cytoplasm, as was GFP (Fig. 6A, c and e). In mitotic cells, the wild type GRASP domain co-localized with GM130 on the mitotic clusters (Fig. 6A, b), whereas the G2A mutant (Fig. 6A, d) or GFP alone (Fig. 6A, f) was found to be cytosolic. Notably, mitotic cells expressing the wild type GRASP65 domain showed an increased number of mitotic clusters, as indicated by GM130, compared with those expressing the G2A mutant or GFP alone (Fig. 6A, b versus d and f). Examination of cells at the EM level showed no qualitative (Fig. 6E and data not shown) or quantitative (Fig. 6F) difference in the appearance of the interphase Golgi for each of the stable cell lines. However, in agreement with the fluorescence data, mitotic cells expressing the GRASP domain had more and bigger Golgi clusters than those expressing the myristoylation mutant or GFP alone (Fig. 6, compare B with C and D). Quantitation showed there were at least three times as many clusters for each cell profile, whereas in interphase cells there was no significant difference in the number of Golgi stacks/cell profile (Fig. 6G). These results corroborate the in vitro data (Figs. 3 and 4) suggesting that the lack of mitotic regulation of the GRASP domain helps prevent the breakdown and dispersal of Golgi fragments during mitosis. Through mapping experiments we have been able to dissect the GRASP65 protein into two functional domains. The N-terminal, or GRASP domain, is a dimer that is involved in trans-oligomerization. The C-terminal, or SPR domain, regulates this trans-oligomerization through phosphorylation by mitotic kinases. In the absence of the SPR domain, the GRASP domain forms trans-oligomers, but these are not mitotically regulated. Beads coated with the GRASP domain still aggregate but cannot be broken up by mitotic kinases. Cells stably expressing the GRASP domain have bigger mitotic Golgi clusters during mitosis, again, consistent with a lack of mitotic regulation. Perhaps the most intriguing and unexpected result is that GRASP65 dimers form higher order oligomers more efficiently when the regulatory SPR domain is removed (Fig. 3, B and C and supplemental Fig. 1). Hence, in glycerol gradients, the full-length GRASP65 comprises a mixture of different forms, from dimers to higher order oligomers. When pooled fractions of dimers or oligomers are rerun on the gradients, the original pattern is obtained, showing that the different forms are readily interconvertible. In marked contrast, however, the GRASP domain forms oligomers with little evidence of any dimers on the gradient. Furthermore, when pooled fractions of these oligomers were rerun on the gradient, only oligomers were found, attesting to their stability. These oligomers were also resistant to treatment with mitotic kinases. These data therefore suggest that the SPR domain normally prevents the GRASP domain from forming stable oligomers. A possible reason is the need to break down GRASP65 oligomers during mitosis, so that cisternal unstacking can occur. The nature of the interaction between GRASP domain dimers might preclude direct phosphorylation as a means of breaking down the oligomers. It has to be done indirectly, via phosphorylation of the SPR domain. But such an indirect method might not work unless the system is poised for breakdown. Hence the SPR domain would act to prevent tight association of GRASP domain dimers so that phosphorylation tips the balance toward breakdown. Of course, one possible explanation for these results is that the full-length GRASP65 is not properly folded, whereas the GRASP domain is. This seems, however, unlikely. The full-length GRASP65 forms dimers, and the higher order oligomers can be reversibly disaggregated under mitotic conditions either in solution (Fig. 3) or when attached to beads (Fig. 4). This suggestion is supported by the number of sites that need to be phosphorylated in order for oligomer breakdown to occur as well as their distribution. There is a cluster of sites near to the GRASP domain that has a particularly marked effect on oligomer breakdown. Mutation of other sites has little effect on the mitotic regulation of trans-oligomerization, as measured by bead aggregation. However, the additional mutation of this cluster of sites markedly prevented mitotic regulation (Fig. 5C). Perhaps this cluster helps to prize apart the end of the GRASP domain oligomer, leading to eventual disassembly. Such a model, in turn, would suggest that the oligomers comprise parallel arrays of dimers, which are themselves arranged in parallel. This would give maximum leverage to phosphorylation of the clusters. Further structural work will be needed to test this hypothesis. What remains unclear is the role played by the rest of the SPR domain. There are phosphorylation sites that contribute toward oligomer disassembly, but these are widely spaced apart. Perhaps the initial separation of the dimers is followed by interdigitation of the phosphorylated SPR domain to continue the disassembly process or to inhibit reassembly under mitotic conditions. Experiments are in progress to determine whether there is any binding of the phosphorylated SPR domain to the GRASP domain. One other possibility has to do with the known cleavage pattern of GRASP65 during apoptosis. Lowe and colleagues (7Lane J.D. Lucocq J. Pryde J. Barr F.A. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. Lowe M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) mapped the three cleavage sites of caspase-3 to the SPR domain. This leads to fragmentation of the Golgi, although our data would now suggest that this is an indirect effect. None of our experiments suggest a role for the SPR domain in linking adjacent surfaces. Not only does it not form dimers or oligomers (Figs. 2 and 3), it does not link beads together and also does not inhibit aggregation of beads coated with a full-length protein (Fig. 4). One possibility is that the cleaved fragments of the SPR domain act as signaling molecules for apoptosis. There is some precedent for this with the tethering factor p115, a fragment of which enters the nucleus and promotes apoptosis (18Chiu R. Novikov L. Mukherjee S. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One similar characteristic of all these apoptotic fragments from GRASP65 and p115 is a low isoelectronic point (≤4), which is possibly important for transport into the nucleus. In conclusion, our mapping experiments have separated the structural and functional domains of the GRASP65 stacking protein. Further structural experiments are now needed to work out the manner in which these domains operate together to regulate the stacking of Golgi cisternae in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2029065061,"We have identified a novel Ca2+-dependent interaction between neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) and the GTPase ARF1. Both of these proteins are localized to the Golgi complex, and both regulate phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI(4)Kβ). Spatial and temporal control of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate levels through activation of PI(4)Kβ is important for the recruitment of trafficking complexes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and vesicular traffic from this organelle. The NCS-1-ARF1 interaction and its specificity have been demonstrated through in vitro binding assays, in vitro enzyme assay, and through functional cellular assays. We show that NCS-1 can exert bidirectional effects to activate PI(4)Kβ on its own or inhibit the activation by ARF1. NCS-1 was shown to modulate the effects of expression of ARF mutants that disrupt Golgi morphology and to recruit GDP-loaded ARF to the Golgi complex in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We demonstrate antagonist effects of NCS-1 and ARF on constitutive and regulated exocytosis. The NCS-1-ARF1 interaction provides evidence for functional cross-talk between Ca2+-dependent and ARF-dependent pathways in TGN to plasma membrane traffic.

A model proposing distinct subcellular organelle identity based upon a unique compliment of lipid and protein components is an accepted paradigm. In recent years, however, evidence from numerous sources has hinted at a greater level of compartmentalization whereby specific cellular membranes are themselves mosaics of distinctive, highly specialized and tightly regulated sub- or micro-domains (1Munro S.

There is considerable interest in the idea that specific phosphoinositides may specify functional sub-domains within organelles such as the TGN (3Roth M.G. Physiol.

Traffic. 2004; 5: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms underlying this are unknown. The ubiquitous GTPase ARF1 has been directly implicated as an essential protein in multiple vesicular trafficking steps at both the Golgi apparatus and on endosomes (5Nie Z. Hirsch D.S. Randazzo P.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 15: 396-404Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ARF1 is a central component of both COPI and clathrin coat assemblies, which mediate vesicular budding in the Golgi and eventual vesicle transit from the TGN (5Nie Z. Hirsch D.S. Randazzo P.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 15: 396-404Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A related TGN-localized ARF1 activity is its ability to recruit and activate soluble phosphatidylinositol-4-OH kinase type III β (PI(4)Kβ) (6Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. DiTullio G.

ARF1 activation of PI(4)Kβ directly elevates levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (6Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. DiTullio G. Lurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. DeMatteis M.A. Nat.

In higher eukaryotes, the precise function of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis at the TGN is less well understood, although recent studies have begun to identify phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-selective binding proteins that might control distinct TGN trafficking events (10Godi A.

Originally thought to be neuronal-specific, NCS-1 was subsequently identified in various other cell types (13McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar).

ARF1 was identified as a selective partner for NCS-1, and we were able to ascribe functional consequences of this interaction for trafficking events between the TGN and the plasma membrane. Both ARF1 and NCS-1 were capable of individually stimulating in vitro PI(4)Kβ activity, but in combination an antagonistic relationship was revealed. This antagonism was seen in studies monitoring both constitutive and regulated secretory events in the PC12 cell line. These data show an inhibitory interaction between ARF1 and NCS-1 pathways that may function to prevent simultaneous activation of PI(4)Kβ by both effectors and thereby may assist in the generation of segregated trafficking domains at the TGN. In addition, the interaction of NCS-1 and ARF will allow local changes in Ca2+ concentration to exert a regulatory influence on ARF-dependent processes during traffic from the TGN to the plasma membrane. Pull Down and Identification of Binding Partners for NCS-1 from Bovine Brain Cytosol—Bovine brain cytosol was prepared from 1 kg of whole frozen brain tissue (FirstLink UK Ltd., Birmingham, UK) (21Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST, GST-NCS-1, and GST-L-CaBP1 were prepared as described previously (22Haynes L.P. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 547-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 10 mg of recombinant GST or GST fusion proteins were immobilized onto 3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) that had been pre-washed with cytosol buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm free Ca2+) by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Brain cytosol extract was dialyzed against cytosol buffer before application to GST affinity columns (5 ml of dialyzed extract/column), and binding was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 4 °C. Columns were washed extensively with cytosol buffer, and specific Ca2+-dependent binding proteins eluted using cytosol buffer without added Ca2+. An additional elution step with cytosol buffer containing 1 m NaCl was used to isolate Ca2+-independent binding interactions. Eluted protein fractions were concentrated by methanol precipitation and pellets extracted into SDS dissociation buffer (125 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA) by boiling for 5 min. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8–16% Novex™ Tris-glycine gradient gel, Invitrogen) followed by staining with Colloidal Blue reagent (Novex™, Invitrogen). Bands of interest were excised from the gel, digested with Trypsin, and processed for mass spectrometry peptide fingerprinting (23Ivings L. Pennington S.R. Jenkins R. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using Micromass MALDI-MS equipment (Waters Ltd., UK). Protein identifications based on mass fingerprints of digestion generated peptides were determined using Mascot search software (Matrix Science). Protein samples from these experiments were transferred by transverse electrophoresis to nitrocellulose membranes for detection via Western blotting. Filters were blotted with pan-specific anti-ARF antibody (1:1000, 1D9 clone, AbCam, Cambridge, UK), and immunoreactivity was visualized using ECL-Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Protein Binding Assays—1 μm GST or GST-NCS-1 were immobilized onto 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B in cytosol buffer containing either 0 or 1 μm free Ca2+ and supplemented with either 50 μm GDP or GTPγS by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. 1 μm recombinant C-terminally tagged ARF1-His6 protein (24Glenn D.E. Thomas G.M.H. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2023-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was added to incubations, and binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. Sepharose pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed in the appropriate ±Ca2+/guanine nucleotide-supplemented cytosol buffer. Final pellets were extracted into 50 μl of SDS dissociation buffer, and bound protein was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-ARF 1D9 antibody (1:1000). For analysis of the specificity of NCS-1 for ARF1 over ARF3 and binding of PI(4)Kβ to NCS-1 and ARF1, [35S]methionine-labeled ARF1-HA, ARF3-HA, and HA-PI(4)Kβ proteins were generated using a TnT® quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol and with pcDNA-ARF1-HA, pcDNA-ARF3-HA, or pcDNA-HA-PI(4)Kβ (6Godi A.

Plasmids for the expression of recombinant murine ARF were prepared by PCR from authentic cDNA samples, obtained as a gift from Dr. K. Nakayama, University of Tsukuba, Japan, with PCR products cloned into pcDNA3 plasmid between the HindIII and XbaI sites with the addition of a His6 tag at the C terminus (24Glenn D.E. Thomas G.M.H. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2023-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed as above, and bound ARF proteins or PI(4)Kβ were detected by autoradiography of SDS-PAGE gels. For analysis of the specificity of ARF1 for NCS-1, recombinant GST, GST-NCS-1, GST-hippocalcin, GST-neurocalcin-δ,or GST-L-CaBP1 (all at 1 μm) were immobilized onto beads in cytosol buffer containing either no added or 1 μm free Ca2+ and 50 μm GDP. Non-radioactive TnT® Quick in vitro translated ARF1 protein was then added to incubations at ∼1 μm final concentration, binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C, and bound protein was detected by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation—250 μl of bovine brain cytosol dialyzed against cytosol buffer was incubated with 5 μg of anti-ARF 1D9 antibody, rabbit anti-NCS-1 antibody, or pre-immune NCS-1 serum (13McFerran B.W.

Protein-G pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed in cytosol buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-NCS-1 (1:1000) or anti-ARF. PI(4)Kβ Assay—PI(4)Kβ assays were performed as described previously (26Yamakawa A. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17555-17560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 μm TnT®-translated HA-PI(4)Kβ, was incubated either alone or in the presence of TnT®-synthesized ARF1, GST-free recombinant NCS-1, or a combination of both proteins (both at 1 μm) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μm free Ca2+) containing 1 mm l-α-phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 40 volumes of synthetic phase (CHCl3: MeOH:HCl (200:100:1)), and the organic phase was extracted for liquid scintillation counting. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells (0.25 × 106 cells/well) were plated onto glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 1 μg of NCS-1-ECFP along with 1 μg of either pcDNA-ARF1-HA, pcDNA-ARF3-HA, or pcDNA-HA-PI(4)Kβ using FuGene6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's protocol. 24 h post transfection, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with PBT (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:100, Sigma) followed by incubation with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:75, Sigma) and mounting of coverslips onto glass slides with ProLong antifade reagent (Invitrogen). For expression of GTP and GDP locked ARF1 mutants in HeLa cells with NCS-1, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 0.25 μg of pcDNA-ARF1-Q71L-HA or pcDNA-ARF1-T31N-HA along with 1 μg of pcDNA3.1(-) control plasmid or 1 μg of NCS-1-ECFP and immunostained with anti-HA 24–48 h post transfection. All images were captured using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Growth Hormone Release Assays—Analysis of regulated exocytosis from transfected PC 12 cells used expression of human growth hormone (hGH) in a reporter assay (27Graham M.E. Fisher R.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PC12 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/well) were plated onto collagen-coated 24-well tissue culture trays, allowed to adhere for 24 h, and transiently co-transfected with 0.75 μg of pXGH5 (encoding human growth hormone, Nichols Institute Diagnostics) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). For NCS-1 alone or ARF1 alone transfection conditions, with 1 μg of pcDNA-NCS-1 and 0.25 μgof pcDNA3.1(-) or 0.25 μg of pcDNA-ARF1-HA and 1 μg of pcDNA3.1(-). For NCS-1-ARF dual transfections 0.75 μg of pXGH5, 1 μg of pcDNA-NCS-1, and 0.25 μg of pcDNA-ARF1-HA were used per well. For pcDNA control transfections 0.75 μg of pXGH5 and 1.25 μg of pcDNA3.1(-) were used per well. 48 h post transfection, cells were washed twice in Krebs buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4) followed by treatment with or without 300 μm ATP in Krebs for 15 min at room temperature. Samples of secreted growth hormone and cells (total growth hormone) were assayed using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). VSV-G Trafficking Assays—PC12 cells (0.25 × 106 cells/well) were plated onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and allowed to adhere for 24 h prior to transfection. Each well was transfected with 0.75 μg of tsO45-VSV-G plasmid (28Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J.M. Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 for 4 h to permit transfection, and transfection media was removed and replaced with regular PC12 culture media (84% (v/v) RPMI 1640 plus l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin), and cells were transferred to a 40 °C incubator overnight. Cells were subsequently incubated at 20 °C for 2 h, and Golgi to plasma membrane transit was initiated by temperature elevation to 32 °C. Cells were fixed at various time points following the 32 °C shift in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for 30 min at 32 °C, washed, and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—For confocal laser scanning microscopy, fixed transfected cells were analyzed using a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a 22-μm pin hole and a ×63 water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. For optimal imaging of ECFP, cells were excited at 430 nm and light was collected at 450–500 nm. Fluorescein was imaged using excitation at 488 nm and light collection at 500–560 nm. For optimal imaging of enhanced green fluorescent protein, cells were excited at 488 nm, and light was collected at 500–550 nm. For optimal imaging of Texas Red, cells were excited at 543 nm, and light was collected at 600–650 nm. Images were exported as TIFF files and compiled in CorelDraw. ARF1 Is a Specific Ca2+-dependent Binding Partner for NCS-1—To identify novel NCS-1-interacting proteins, a GST-NCS-1 affinity purification column was prepared. NCS-1-specific binding proteins were subsequently identified by mass spectroscopic peptide fingerprinting of digested gel samples and searching of known peptide mass databases. One Ca2+-dependent NCS-1-binding protein was initially identified as either ARF1 or ARF3 (Fig. 1A) based on matching of nine peptides with 74% coverage of the protein. To confirm this data, samples from binding experiments were used in Western blotting with a pan-specific anti-ARF monoclonal antibody (29Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K.I. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Consistent with our initial identification, an ARF-reactive protein of the correct molecular mass was bound only to GST-NCS-1 and only in the presence of 1 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). No ARF-reactive species was purified by a GST control affinity column (Fig. 1B, GST) or by a second column containing the NCS-1-related Ca2+-binding protein L-CaBP1 (22Haynes L.P. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 547-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). To determine the identity of the ARF protein that was bound to NCS-1, a series of in vitro binding assays were used to analyze the selectivity of NCS-1 for ARF1 compared with ARF3. In binding assays with equimolar amounts of the two recombinant proteins myristoylated ARF1-His6 was bound to GST-NCS-1, and the interaction displayed a dependence upon free Ca2+. Binding occurred in the presence of both GDP or GTPγS and was thus insensitive to the nucleotide state of ARF1, although there was more binding in the presence of GDP (Fig. 1C). The loading control lane (Input ARF1) shows the total amount of ARF1 added to the incubation and run at the same dilution. The interaction was specific for NCS-1, because no binding of ARF1 was observable to GST (Fig. 1C). With the knowledge that NCS-1 could directly associate with ARF1 in vitro, we examined the possibility of an interaction with ARF3. To ensure that correctly post-translationally modified forms of both proteins were available, radiolabeled, C-terminal HA-tagged ARF1 and ARF3 proteins were synthesized using a coupled transcription/translation system, which is able to generate myristoylated protein products (30Deichaite I. Casson L.P. Ling H.-P. Resh M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4295-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Similar levels of radiolabeled ARF1 and ARF3 were produced (input, Fig. 1D) and incubated with GST control protein or GST-NCS-1. A significant proportion of the input ARF1 was bound to GST-NCS-1 in the presence of free Ca2+ (Fig. 1D). This interaction was specific, because no binding of ARF1 was observed to GST controls. No binding of ARF3 to GST-NCS-1 was detected. These data suggest that there is a highly selective binding of ARF1 to NCS-1. NCS-1 belongs to the NCS family of closely related EF hand-containing proteins (12Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 31Burgoyne R.D. O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Haynes L.P. Tepikin A.V. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 203-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We examined whether NCS-1 was a unique ARF1-interacting NCS protein by analyzing the binding of in vitro translated ARF1 to a series of NCS proteins fused to GST (Fig. 1E). ARF1 was only efficiently bound by GST-NCS-1 in the presence of free Ca2+ (Fig. 1E, lane 4), and no binding was detectable to any of the other Ca2+-binding proteins examined. Due to the apparent exclusivity in association exhibited between ARF1 and NCS-1 in vitro we next examined whether the interaction was observable in vivo. Using a specific anti-NCS-1 antibody (13McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or a pan specific anti-ARF antibody, we tested if endogenous myristoylated ARF1 and NCS-1 could be co-immunoprecipitated from bovine brain cytosolic extracts (Fig. 2B). Anti-ARF antibody precipitated ARF protein along with NCS-1, and in the reciprocal experiment, anti-NCS-1 antibody precipitated NCS-1 along with ARF. An NCS-1 pre-immune serum included as a negative control failed to immunoprecipitate detectable NCS-1 or ARF protein. These data suggest that NCS-1-ARF1 can also form a complex under in vivo conditions. We compared the cellular localization of NCS-1-ECFP with HA-tagged ARF1 when the proteins were co-expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). Both proteins have a dual cytosolic and membrane-associated localization. NCS-1-ECFP localized in part to a perinuclear region, which has previously been identified as the TGN (Fig. 2C, top three panels) (14Bourne Y. Dannenberg J. Pollmann V. Marchot P. Pongs O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11949-11955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4833-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ARF1 protein showed co-localization with NCS-1-ECFP (Fig. 2C, top panel, overlay). We also examined the co-localization of NCS-1 with PI(4)Kβ (Fig. 2C, bottom three panels). Although a large proportion of PI(4)Kβ showed a diffuse cytosolic staining, there was a clear concentration of the protein in a peri-nuclear region that co-localized with NCS-1-ECFP. Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo studies of ARF1 and NCS-1 binding are consistent with a direct, Ca2+-dependent interaction that is selective for ARF1 over related ARF proteins and selective for NCS-1 with respect to similar NCS proteins. Our localization studies support the binding data and indicate a potential in vivo site of interaction at the level of the TGN where NCS-1, ARF1, and PI(4)Kβ have previously been found individually to be localized. Binding of ARF1 and NCS-1 to PI(4)Kβ and Stimulation of Enzymic Activity—We next examined whether both NCS-1 and ARF1 could directly bind to PI(4)Kβ. PI(4)Kβ was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation to enable production of enzymically active protein. In direct binding assays, [35S]methionine-labeled PI(4)Kβ was found to specifically interact with GST-NCS-1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 3A, lane 4 versus lane 3), and no binding of PI(4)Kβ was detectable with control GST protein (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). ARF1 protein was also made using in vitro transcription and translation, and its interaction with PI(4)Kβ was determined following immunoprecipitation with anti-ARF. ARF1 was found to associate directly with PI(4)Kβ in a nucleotide-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the binding of PI(4)Kβ alone to NCS-1-GST or ARF1, we were unable to observe simultaneous binding of PI(4)Kβ to ARF1 and NCS-1 under conditions where the NCS-1-ARF1 interaction was detected (Fig. 3C), a result suggestive of the NCS-1-ARF1 complex having impaired PI(4)Kβ binding. To ascertain the functional significance of the NCS-1-ARF1 interaction we examined the effects of both proteins on in vitro PI(4)Kβ enzymic activity (Fig. 3D). When PI(4)Kβ was incubated alone, a basal level of enzymic activity was measured, and this was increased by ∼70% above control by the addition of NCS-1 alone in the presence but not absence of 1 μm Ca2+ and by ∼125% by the addition of ARF1 alone (Fig. 3D), indicating that both of these proteins are effective positive regulators of in vitro PI(4)Kβ activity consistent with previous studies (6Godi A. Pertile P. Meyers R. Marra P. DiTullio G. Lurisci C. Luini A. Corda D. DeMatteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1:"
https://openalex.org/W2170823241,"The mammalian heart is not known to regenerate following injury. Therefore, there is great interest in developing viable tissue-based models for cardiac assist. Recent years have brought numerous advances in the development of scaffold-based models of cardiac tissue, but a self-organizing model has yet to be described. Here, we report the development of an in vitro cardiac tissue without scaffolding materials in the contractile region. Using an optimal concentration of the adhesion molecule laminin, a confluent layer of neonatal rat cardiomyogenic cells can be induced to self-organize into a cylindrical construct, resembling a papillary muscle, which we have termed a cardioid. Like endogenous heart tissue, cardioids contract spontaneously and can be electrically paced between 1 and 5 Hz indefinitely without fatigue. These engineered cardiac tissues also show an increased rate of spontaneous contraction (chronotropy), increased rate of relaxation (lusitropy), and increased force production (inotropy) in response to epinephrine. Cardioids have a developmental protein phenotype that expresses both alpha- and beta-tropomyosin, very low levels of SERCA2a, and very little of the mature isoform of cardiac troponin T."
https://openalex.org/W2170243414,"Granzyme B, a protease released from cytotoxic lymphocytes, has been proposed to induce target cell death by cleaving and activating the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid. It has also been proposed that granzyme B can induce target cell death by activating caspases directly, by cleaving caspase substrates, and/or by cleaving several non-caspase substrates. The relative importance of Bid in granzyme B-induced cell death has therefore remained unclear. Here we report that cells isolated from various tissues of Bid-deficient mice were resistant to granzyme B-induced cell death. Consistent with the proposed role of Bid in regulating mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c remained in the mitochondria of Bid-deficient cells treated with granzyme B. Unlike wild type cells, Bid-deficient cells survived and were then able to proliferate normally, demonstrating the critical role for Bid in mediating granzyme B-induced apoptosis.

Granzyme B is a serine protease contained within the granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CLs). 1The abbreviations used are: CL, cytotoxic lymphocyte; MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; Δψm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblasts; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethylester; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; SMAC, second mitochondrial activator of caspases; Diablo, direct IAP-binding protein with low pI. Upon conjugation with their targets, CLs release their granule contents into the synaptic cleft. Granzyme B then enters the target cell by endocytosis and induces apoptotic death via a perforin-dependent mechanism. The importance of CL-mediated killing in the immune response to various pathogens has made it imperative to understand the mechanism of action of granzyme B. Overexpression of the oncogene Bcl-2 renders cells resistant to granzyme B-induced apoptosis (1Pinkoski M.J. Waterhouse N.J. Heibein J.A. Wolf B.B. Kuwana T. Goldstein J.C. Newmeyer D.D.

Bcl-2 is one of a large family of proteins that regulate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) during apoptosis (4Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (such as Bid, Bax, and Bak) induce MOMP (5Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), whereas anti-apoptotic members (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) prevent MOMP (6Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Following MOMP, several pro-apoptotic proteins are released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In the cytosol, these proteins facilitate the activation of caspases, proteases that orchestrate the death of a cell by apoptosis. One of these proteins, cytochrome c, initiates a complex with dATP, apoptotic protease-activating factor (APAF-1), and pro-caspase-9. This results in the activation of caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 (7Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar). A second protein SMAC/Diablo that is also released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space displaces inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) from caspases, allowing them to become activated by autoprocessing (8Du C.

Wowk M.E. Cancilla M. Trapani J.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). SMAC/Diablo, released following MOMP, then displaces the IAPs from the p20 form of caspase-3, allowing auto-processing and full activation. Regardless of the exact mechanism of caspase activation (SMAC/Diablo or cytochrome c), these models rely explicitly on granzyme B-induced MOMP. In contrast, a recent study has suggested that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from Bid-deficient (bid–/–) mice were as sensitive to granzyme B as control cells expressing wild type Bid (bid+/+) (16Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In a separate study, Metkar et al. (17Metkar S.S.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the granzyme B-induced loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm, used as a surrogate indicator of MOMP) does not occur in MCF7 cells that lack caspase-3. On this basis, it was predicted that caspase-3 is required for mitochondrial damage during granzyme B-induced apoptosis, placing caspase activation upstream of Bid cleavage and MOMP. These studies cumulatively suggested that neither Bid nor MOMP is required for granzyme B-mediated cell death and proposed that MOMP acts as an amplification loop that may be dispensable during granzyme B-induced apoptosis. Although these studies propose to provide insight into the molecular mechanism of granzyme B-induced cell death, they are inconsistent with a number of studies showing that cells overexpressing Bcl-2 are protected against granzyme B-induced apoptosis (1Pinkoski M.J.

To directly investigate the role of Bid in granzyme B-induced cell death, we isolated various primary and transformed cells from bid–/– and bid+/+ mice and compared their sensitivity to granzyme B. We found without exception that cells isolated from bid–/– mice were resistant to granzyme B-induced apoptosis. Mitochondria from Bid-deficient cells maintained an intact outer membrane and their transmembrane potential following treatment with granzyme B/perforin. Importantly, bid–/– cells treated with granzyme B/perforin maintained similar proliferative potential as untreated cells, whereas the proliferative potential of bid+/+ cells treated with granzyme B/perforin was markedly reduced. These data demonstrate a critical role for Bid-mediated MOMP in granzyme B-induced cell death and are consistent with the ability of Bcl-2 to completely rescue cells from granzyme B-induced apoptosis. 51Cr (as sodium dichromate) was from Amersham Biosciences. Annexin V-FLUOS was from Roche Applied Science. Tetramethylrhodamine ethylester (TMRE) was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody (Clone 6HB12) was from Pharmingen, and phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse Ig was from Silenus, Australia. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Perforin was purified essentially according to Liu et al. (18Liu C.C. Persechini P.M. Young J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3292-3300PubMed Google Scholar).

All cells used in this study were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator in medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Splenocytes, tail fibroblasts, and bone marrow dendritic cells were freshly isolated from 7–12-week-old C57BL/6 mice expressing wild type bid+/+ or age-matched mice deficient in bid–/– that were backcrossed nine times onto the same genetic background (20Yin X.M.

Populations of dendritic cells (>95% CD11c+) were obtained by culturing fresh femoral bone marrow in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mm Hepes, 10 ng/ml granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 5 ng/ml interleukin-4 for 3 days. Tail fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. MEF were cultured in Iscove's medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. At passage 5, MEF were transformed with myc/ras (21Thompson T.C. Southgate J. Kitchener G. Land H. Cell. 1989; 56: 917-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To generate lymphomas deficient in bid expression, we crossed C57BL/6 Eμ-myc transgenic mice with bid–/– mice that were back-crossed 10 times onto a C57BL/6 background. Following intercrossing of Eμ-myc/bid+/– mice, Eμ-myc/bid–/– and littermate control Eμ-myc/bid+/+ lymphomas were harvested from lymph nodes, and a single cell suspension was prepared. Lymphoma cells were cultured in modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1 mm l-asparganine, 200 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were assayed for death by specific 51Cr release, annexin V binding, the loss of Δψm (TMRE staining), cytochrome c release, or growth assay. For Specific 51Cr Release—1 × 106 cells were incubated in 100 μl of medium with 51Cr (75 μCi) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm Hepes to remove the unincorporated 51Cr and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were incubated with granzyme B/perforin for 4 h at 37 °C, and the supernatant was harvested using a supernatant collection system (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). 51Cr released (cpm) into the supernatant was detected using a Wallac Wizard 1470 automatic γ counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In each case, the spontaneous release of radiolabel over the time of the assay was no higher than 10% of the total incorporated radioactivity. For Annexin V Binding—Following exposure to granzyme B and perforin, cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of annexin V buffer (10 mm Hepes NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2) containing 0.5 μl of annexin V-FLUOS. Annexin V FLUOS fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry in FL-1. For Δψm—Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in medium containing 50 nm TMRE. TMRE fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry. For Cytochrome c Release—Cells were incubated for 5 min on ice in 100 μl of digitonin buffer (80 mm KCl, 50 ng/ml digitonin, and 1 mm EDTA in PBS) (22Waterhouse N.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). An aliquot was assayed to ensure that at least 95% of cells were trypan blue-positive. The permeabilized cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% saponin in PBS). Cells were incubated at least overnight at 4 °C with anti-cytochrome c diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer, washed in PBS, and incubated at room temperature for at least 1 h in phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody. The cells were washed in PBS, and phycoerythrin fluorescence was detected by flow cytometry in FL-2. For Growth Assay—Cells treated with granzyme B and/or perforin were washed in medium supplemented with penicillin (200 μg/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), plated in flat bottom tissue culture plates, and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were counted on a Sysmex CDA500 cell counter (Bayer Diagnostics) or observed using an Arcturus Pix Cell II Laser capture microscope (MEF) or an Olympus IX-81 microscope (Eμ-myc lymphoma). Bid-deficient MEF Are Resistant to Granzyme B-induced Cell Death—Our previous experiments using transformed cell lines, together with studies performed in other labs, strongly suggested a critical role for Bid in regulating granzyme B-induced apoptosis (1Pinkoski M.J.

In contrast, one recent study that used very high concentrations of granzyme B to induce cell death reported that bid–/– MEF were as sensitive to granzyme B-induced cell death as wild type cells (16Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To directly determine the requirement for Bid during granzyme B-induced apoptosis, we treated bid+/+ and bid–/– fibroblasts isolated from mouse embryos with a broad range of concentrations of granzyme B (1–1000 nm) and sublytic concentrations of perforin (1 nm, producing <10% specific release of 51Cr). We found that 75 nm granzyme B was sufficient to induce death in 50–60% of bid+/+ MEF within 4 h as measured by the release of 51Cr that was preloaded into the cells (Fig. 1A). Indeed, a concentration of granzyme B as low as 8 nm was sufficient to induce significant death (20–30%) in bid+/+ MEF. In contrast, less than 10% (levels comparable with perforin alone) 51Cr release was observed when bid–/– MEF were treated with concentrations of granzyme B up to 75 nm. Bid–/– MEF were similarly resistant to native granzyme B purified from human NK cells (25 nm), whereas this concentration of granzyme B induced significant death in bid+/+ cells (not shown). The requirement for Bid in granzyme B-induced death was not absolute as high concentrations of granzyme B (250 nm) were able to induce some degree of cell death (∼20%) in bid–/– cells (Fig. 1A), and 1000 nm granzyme B was sufficient to induce death in a similar percentage of bid–/– and bid+/+ MEF within 4 h (Fig. 1A, inset). The level of death observed in bid–/– cells treated with 250 nm granzyme B (∼20%) was similar to that observed when bid+/+ MEF were treated with 8 nm granzyme B, demonstrating that bid+/+ cells are around 30 times more sensitive to granzyme B than bid–/– cells. Bid+/+ and bid–/– cells were equally sensitive to perforin-induced lysis (not shown) and to actinomycin D, a cytotoxic drug that does not require Bid for efficient apoptosis (not shown). It has been suggested that the true role of Bid in granzyme B-induced cell death is to amplify the death pathway and that in bid–/– cells, granzyme B can cleave alternate death substrates and kill cells via a delayed, alternate pathway that was not detected in a 51Cr assay. To address this possibility and observe cell death directly, we treated bid+/+ or bid–/– MEF with granzyme B (25 nm) and perforin (1 nm) and observed cell morphology after 24 h (Fig. 1B). We found that the majority of bid+/+ MEF that were treated with granzyme B/perforin had rounded appearance and a collapsed morphology and were detached from the culture flask. In contrast, the morphology of bid–/– cells treated with granzyme B/perforin was unchanged from cells treated with perforin alone (Fig. 1B). Primary Cells Deficient in Bid Are Resistant to Granzyme B-induced Cell Death—To determine whether Bid is universally required for granzyme B-induced apoptosis or whether the requirement for Bid was restricted to transformed MEF, we isolated a number of primary cell types from bid+/+ and bid–/– mice and compared their sensitivity with granzyme B-induced apoptosis. We found that splenic lymphocytes induced to proliferate with phytohemagglutinin (Fig. 2A), tail fibroblasts (Fig. 2B), or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (Fig. 2C) isolated from bid–/– mice were resistant to granzyme B (25 nm)/perforin, whereas the same concentration of granzyme B/perforin killed 20–40% of the equivalent cells isolated from bid+/+ mice. Similar to what we observed in MEF, we found that 8 nm granzyme B was sufficient to kill a significant number (25–30%) of bid+/+ bone marrow-derived dendritic cells; however, ∼30 times that concentration (250 nm) was required to kill a similar percentage of bid–/– cells. To exclude the possibility that the bid–/– cells had died by apoptosis but had failed to release 51Cr, we stained cells with annexin V to detect phosphatidylserine exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. We found that around 45% of granzyme B-treated bone marrow dendritic cells (Fig. 3) from bid+/+ mice stained strongly positive with annexin V; however, bid–/– cells remained annexin V-negative following granzyme B/perforin treatment (Fig. 3). Again, bid+/+ and bid–/– dendritic cells were equally sensitive to perforin-induced lysis and actinomycin D (not shown). These data clearly show that bid–/– primary cells isolated from diverse tissues are resistant to granzyme B-induced death. Bid Is Required for Granzyme B-induced MOMP and Loss of Δψm—Caspase-cleaved Bid is believed to promote apoptosis via MOMP. Having clearly established the importance of Bid in granzyme B-induced apoptosis, we wished to examine the effect of granzyme B on mitochondria of bid–/– cells. We therefore assayed mitochondrial depolarization (the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential as measured by TMRE staining) and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (cytochrome c release) in bid+/+ and bid–/– cells treated with 25 nm granzyme B and 1 nm perforin. As expected, and consistent with the data shown on Figs. 2C and 3, a distinct population (∼40%) of bid+/+ dendritic cells treated with granzyme B/perforin had depolarized mitochondria (Fig. 4A), and cytochrome c had been released into the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the majority of bid–/– cells treated with granzyme B (25 nm)/perforin maintained Δψm (∼85%) (Fig. 4A) and maintained cytochrome c in the mitochondria as well as cells treated with perforin alone (Fig. 4B). These data strongly support a critical role for granzyme B-mediated cleavage of Bid in inducing MOMP (1Pinkoski M.J. Waterhouse N.J. Heibein J.A. Wolf B.B. Kuwana T. Goldstein J.C. Newmeyer D.D.

Bid-deficient Cells Survive and Proliferate in Long Term Growth Assays Following Granzyme B Treatment—To determine the long term viability of bid–/– primary cells treated with granzyme B, we treated bone marrow dendritic cells with perforin or perforin/granzyme B (25 nm) and seeded 2 × 104 cells in individual wells of a 96-well plate. The number of viable cells in each well was counted after 3 days. We found that the number of bid–/– cells in each well had increased to ∼2.5 × 104 regardless of whether the cells were untreated, treated with perforin alone, or treated with granzyme B/perforin. The number of untreated bid+/+ cells or cells treated with perforin alone also increased to ∼2.5 × 104/well; however, only ∼1 × 104 cells were present in the wells seeded with bid+/+ cells treated with granzyme B/perforin (Fig. 5). Our data suggested that approximately half of the bid+/+ cells treated with granzyme B/perforin had died, whereas bid–/– cells treated with granzyme B/perforin survived for at least 3 days. As dendritic cells cultured under these conditions survived indefinitely, but proliferated only slowly, we wished to perform similar survival/proliferation assays with rapidly dividing cells. To address this issue, we crossed Eμ-myc transgenic mice with bid–/– mice to generate B-cell lymphomas that expressed myc but were devoid of bid expression. Eμ-myc/bid+/+ and Eμ-myc/bid–/– cells were equally sensitive to etoposide as syngenic Eμ-myc lymphomas expressing wild type bid (not shown). We found that 4 h following treatment with perforin/granzyme B (25 nm), ∼30% of Eμ-myc/bid+/+ cells had released 51Cr (Fig. 6A), and ∼50% Eμ-myc/bid+/+ cells stained positive with annexin V (Fig. 6B). Similar results were also obtained using native granzyme B. In addition, a significant population of perforin/granzyme B-treated cells showed morphological signs of cell death after 24 h and stained positive with propidium iodide (Fig. 6C). In contrast, Eμ-myc/bid–/– cells did not release 51Cr or become annexin V-positive within 4 h of treatment with perforin/granzyme B. Moreover, these cells maintained normal morphology 24 h after exposure to granzyme B/perforin and did not take up propidium iodide. To determine the proliferative potential of these cells, we seeded untreated cells, cells treated with perforin alone, or cells treated with perforin/granzyme B in individual wells of a 96-well plate, and viable cells were counted after 24 h (Fig. 7). Although untreated Eμ-myc/bid+/+ cells and Eμ-myc/bid–/– cells proliferated at similar rates and survived perforin exposure equally well, we consistently found that the number of Eμ-myc/bid+/+ lymphomas treated with perforin/granzyme B was around half the number of similarly treated Bid-deficient cells. These data demonstrate that Bid-deficient cells survive and proliferate following treatment with concentrations of perforin and granzyme B that are sufficient to kill a significant number of Eμ-myc/bid+/+ lymphoma cells.Fig. 7Bid-deficient Eμ-myc B-cell lymphoma cells survive and proliferate following treatment with perforin/granzyme B. Eμ-myc lymphomas treated with 25 nm granzyme B and/or 1 nm perforin for 1 h were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates. Cells were counted after 24 h. The data are presented as mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples and are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is well documented that granzyme B induces caspase-dependent apoptosis; however, the mechanism by which granzyme B activates caspases, and specifically, the role of mitochondria in this process, are contentious.

Although a recent study did agree that cells from Bid-deficient mice show no signs of MOMP, it was claimed that these cells were equally as sensitive to granzyme B-induced apoptosis as their wild type counterparts (16Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A further study using the MCF-7 tumor cell line argued that caspase-3 was apparently required for the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential during granzyme B-induced apoptosis (17Metkar S.S. Wang B. Ebbs M.L. Kim J.H. Lee Y.J. Raja S.M. Froelich C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). On this basis, it was proposed that mitochondria are more appropriately seen as an amplification loop in the pathway to granzyme B-mediated apoptosis. These data challenge the hypothesis that Bid is required for granzyme B-induced cell death (16Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heibein J.A. Wolf B.B. Kuwana T. Goldstein J.C. Newmeyer D.D. Bleackley R.C. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Sutton V.R. Smyth M.J. Trapani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we have presented data that demonstrate a critical role for Bid-mediated regulation of MOMP in granzyme B-induced cell death. We observed that both primary and transformed Bid-deficient cells from a variety of tissues were resistant to granzyme B-induced cell death. Of further consequence, we found that bid–/– cells treated with granzyme B maintained their proliferative potential, whereas there was a marked loss of proliferative potential in Bid-proficient cells treated with a similar concentration of granzyme B. These data are completely consistent with the ability of Bcl-2 to block granzyme B-induced cell death and allow the proliferation of granzyme B-treated cells. Our results contrast with those of Thomas et al. (16Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), who reported that bid–/– MEF are as sensitive to granzyme B-induced cell death as their wild type counterparts. Following careful titration of granzyme B, we found that low nanomolar concentrations of granzyme B were sufficient to induce death in bid+/+ cells; however, much higher concentrations of granzyme B (greater than 30-fold) could induce the death of bid–/– cells. Since the study by Thomas et al. (16Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) utilized very high concentrations of granzyme B (in the micromolar range), it is not surprising that they found that bid–/– cells appeared to be as sensitive to granzyme B as bid+/+ cells. It has been suggested by us and others that granzyme B may directly cleave caspases under certain conditions (13Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The data reported here support the hypothesis that if granzyme B can cleave caspases directly, they are not activated to a sufficient level to reach an apoptotic threshold (15Sutton V.R. Wowk M.E. Cancilla M. Trapani J.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and that Bid-dependent MOMP is required for effective caspase activation. It also remains possible that granzyme B cleaves other (non-caspase) cellular substrates; however, these require MOMP for full effect, contribute to death only after granzyme B-induced MOMP, or are not sufficient to induce apoptosis but may contribute to the immune function of cytolytic lymphocytes in other ways. Combining the results of various studies, we conclude that at low concentrations, granzyme B specifically targets Bid and only cleaves alternate substrates effectively at much higher concentrations of granzyme B. It is currently not possible to determine the effective concentration of granzyme B delivered to a target cell, and in any event, this may be influenced by a number of co-incident factors. Recently, it has been shown that induction of granzyme B expression in a population of activated CD8+ T-cells is stochastic; therefore, different T cells may be capable of secreting quite different amounts of granzyme B (25Kelso A. Costelloe E.O. Johnson B.J. Groves P. Buttigieg K. Fitzpatrick D.R. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Kienzle N. Baz A. Kelso A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is also known that CL can kill multiple targets in rapid succession, indicating that CLs do not secrete their entire granule contents onto one target. Even if it were possible to determine the concentration of granzyme B delivered to the synapse, the concentration of granzyme B taken up by a target cell is likely to differ from one type of cell to another. For example, cells expressing mannose-6-phosphate receptor or dynamin take up granzyme B more efficiently than cells deficient in these proteins (27Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Thia K.Y. Li Y.Q. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Sandrin M.S. Browne K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The concentration of granzyme B ultimately delivered to the target cell cytosol may also depend on its rate of endocytosis/exocytosis, the sensitivity of the cells to perforin, cell shape and size, and particularly, by the expression of direct granzyme B inhibitors by the target cell. Protease inhibitor 9, the adenovirus protein L100K, and the cow pox virus protein cytokine response modifier A (CrmA) have all been shown to block granzyme B activity to varying extents (28Quan L.T.

The development of tools that can accurately estimate the concentration of free active granzyme B that reaches the cell cytosol will ultimately prove extremely valuable for understanding the mechanism of granzyme B-induced apoptosis in an in vivo immune response. In conclusion, although it is not possible to determine whether Bid is the exclusive granzyme B substrate, our data support the hypothesis that Bid is the preferred and often the critical substrate for granzyme B during apoptosis induced by CL.

https://openalex.org/W2171706231,"In patients with congestive heart failure, high serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-18 were reported. A positive correlation was described between serum IL-18 levels and the disease severity. IL-18 has also been shown to induce atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene expression in adult cardiomyocytes. Because re-expression of the fetal gene ANF is mostly associated with hypertrophy, a hallmark of heart failure, we hypothesized that IL-18 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Treatment of the cardiomyocyte cell line HL-1 with IL-18 induced hypertrophy as characterized by increases in protein synthesis, phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase, and ribosomal S6 protein levels as well as cell surface area. Furthermore, IL-18 induced ANF gene transcription in a time-dependent manner as evidenced by increased ANF secretion and ANF promoter-driven reporter gene activity. Investigation into possible signal transduction pathways mediating IL-18 effects revealed that IL-18 activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), an effect that was blocked by wortmannin and LY-294002. IL-18 induced Akt phosphorylation and stimulated its activity, effects that were abolished by Akt inhibitor or knockdown. IL-18 stimulated GATA4 DNA binding activity and increased transcription of a reporter gene driven by multimerized GATA4-binding DNA elements. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown studies revealed that IL-18 induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and ANF gene transcription via PI3K, PDK1, Akt, and GATA4. Most importantly, IL-18 induced ANF gene transcription and hypertrophy of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes via PI3K-, Akt-, and GATA4-dependent signaling. Together these data provide the first evidence that IL-18 induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via PI3K-dependent signaling, defines a mechanism of IL-18-mediated ANF gene transcription, and further supports a role for IL-18 in inflammatory heart diseases including heart failure."

Malaria continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world with more than 1 million deaths per year primarily in children in sub-Saharan Africa (1Trigg P.I. Kondrachine A.V. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 11-22Google Scholar). In addition, travelers and soldiers are at significant risk for exposure to malaria. Drug resistance is increasing even to newer anti-malarials such as mefloquine. This has led to an urgent need for new anti-malarials both for chemotherapy and prophylaxis. Plasmodium falciparum lacks de novo purine synthesis, but its human hosts can synthesize purines by de novo pathways. Thus purine salvage pathways have been proposed as malaria-specific targets. Efforts to understand purine metabolism have been complicated by the presence of purine salvage enzymes in both the host and the parasite and limited understanding of purine salvage enzymes in the parasite. Early studies indicated that hypoxanthine was the major purine precursor in malaria, but more recently it has been assumed that Plasmodium species, like Toxoplasma gondii, another pathogenic apicomplexan, are able to salvage purines via redundant purine salvage pathways (2Donald R.G.

Polyamine biosynthesis pathways have also been explored as targets for treatment of parasitic infections including malaria (4Muller S. Coombs G.H. Walter R.D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The polyamine pathway is the target for difluoromethylornithine, a mechanism-based inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, in use for treatment of sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma (4Muller S. Coombs G.H. Walter R.D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The pathway forms two molecules of methylthioadenosine (MTA) 1The abbreviations used are: MTA, 5′-methylthioadenosine; PNP, purine nucleoside phosphorylase; PfPNP, P. falciparum PNP; MTI, 5′-methylthioinosine; ADA, adenosine deaminase; PfADA, P. falciparum ADA; ImmH, immucillin-H; MT-ImmH, 5′-methylthio-immucillin-H; MTAP, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase; APRT, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; AK, adenosine kinase; MTAN, methylthioadenosine nucleosidase; MTRK, methylthioribose kinase; AMS, accelerator mass spectrometry; RP-HPLC, reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography; MTR-1-P, 5-methylthioribose-1-PO4. for the synthesis of each spermine molecule. In most organisms, MTA is recycled into adenine and methionine pools. Because erythrocytes do not synthesize polyamines, synthesis of polyamines is likely essential for malaria parasites, and enzymes of the polyamine pathway are being investigated as anti-malarial targets (4Muller S. Coombs G.H. Walter R.D. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Most surprisingly, genes encoding the enzymes normally associated with purine salvage and recycling of MTA are not present in the recently completed genome sequences of P. falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii (5Gardner M.J.

To understand more fully the purine pathways of malaria, we have characterized the activities of adenosine deaminase (PfADA) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PfPNP) from P. falciparum. PfADA and PfPNP have catalytic specificities that allow them to use methylthiopurines and therefore to function in both purine salvage and methylthiopurine recycling. By using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), we show this pathway is active in P. falciparum cultured in human erythrocytes. MT-immucillinH (MT-ImmH), a specific inhibitor of PfPNP (7Shi W.

S-Adenosylmethionine was converted to MTA by incubating S-adenosylmethionine at pH 3–5 and at 70 °C for 3.5 h. All labeled compounds were purified by reverse phase-HPLC (RP-HPLC) with a 15-μm, 7.8 × 300-mm C18 Deltapak column (Waters Associates), eluting isocratically with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, and 25% methanol at 1 ml/min. Product elution was monitored at 260 nm. Cloning and Expression of P. falciparum ADA—PfADA was identified on chromosome 10 from the Malarial Parasite Genome Project (5Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E.

PfADA was amplified from strain 3D7 genomic DNA using the PCR primers 5′-AATTGTAAGAATATGGATACTTCATATGAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAATATTTACTTATAATTTTATTTTTTATATCTGG-3′ (antisense). The coding region was placed in a pTrcHis2-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and expressed in E. coli strain TOP 10. Recombinant PfADA was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 10 h and purified by Ni2+ chromatography. The expressed PfADA was >95% homogeneous by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Cloning and Expression of E. coli PNP—The coding sequence of E. coli PNP (PNPI; deoD gene) was amplified by PCR from E. coli (strain TOP 10) genomic DNA with the primers 5′-ATGGCTACCCCACACATTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCAATGATGATGATGATGATGCTCTTTATCGCCCAGCAGAA-3′ (antisense), which introduced a His6 tag (underlined) before the stop codon. The PCR product was cloned into the pTrcHis2-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into E. coli strain TOP 10. The recombinant PNP with a C-terminal His6 tag was expressed by induction of the bacterial culture with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 10 h and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. Enzymatic Assays and Inhibition Studies—Hypoxanthine produced by PNP was assayed by coupling to the xanthine oxidase reaction and measuring uric acid formation at 293 nm (9Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C.

ADA action on adenosine or MTA was measured by the absorbance change at 265 nm. Coupled ADA/PNP assays contained 106 μm MTA, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.5, 61 milliunits of ADA, 2 milliunits of PNP, and 60 milliunits of xanthine oxidase. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MTA. Inhibition studies measured both initial and slow onset rates to establish both the initial dissociation constant (Ki) and the steady-state dissociation constant (Ki*) as described previously (9Kicska G.A.

Product Identification—NMR and IR spectra were used to identify the MTI isolated in this way. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed on a Nicolet Magna-IR 760 Fourier transform spectrometer (ThermoNicolet, Madison, WI) using an MCT detector. IR revealed the C=O stretch (1672 cm-1) of the product to be identical to that of inosine. NMR experiments in D2O were performed at 25 °C on a Bruker DRX 300 MHz spectrometer. NMR was used to identify the 5′-methylthio group. Gene Search Strategy—Human and E. coli HGPRT, PNP, ADA, AK; human and yeast MTAP; Klebsiella MTRK; and E. coli MTAN were used as search queries to identify potential orthologues in malaria species using the tblastn function (using default settings) at the NCBI eukaryotic genomes data bases (searching against all Apicomplexa and kinetoplastids; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi?database=180454&organism=euk&blastprogram=blastn) and PlasmoDb (www.plasmodb.org) websites. Leishmania APRTase and AK and T. gondii AK were also used as search queries. P. falciparum hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, PNP, and ADA were readily identified, but no potential homologues for AK, APRT, MTAP, MTAN, or MTRK were identified in any malaria species. Alternative purine salvage enzymes, such as inosine-guanosine kinase (using bacterial enzymes as queries), were also not identified. It should be noted that PfPNP was originally annotated as uridine phosphorylase in Plasmodb (www.plasmodb.org), but its function and activity have been confirmed (9Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Kim K. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3219-3225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). T. gondii AK (3Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M.

The C. parvum AK was recently proven to be functional (13Striepen B. Pruijssers A.J. Huang J. Li C. Gubbels M.J. Umejiego N.N. Hedstrom L. Kissinger J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3154-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Earlier biochemical reports of AK and APRTase activity in extracts of Plasmodium isolated from human erythrocytes gave activities not significantly greater than in the erythrocytes (14Reyes P.

PlasmoDb annotations were searched with text queries of the blastx output and queries using EC numbers to identify AK, APRTase, MTAP, MTAN, or MTRK homologues. Gene ontology biological function, gene ontology biological process, gene ontology cellular component assignments, and metabolic pathway annotations were also reviewed. No additional candidate orthologues were found. These results have been independently confirmed by other groups (13Striepen B. Pruijssers A.J. Huang J. Li C. Gubbels M.J. Umejiego N.N. Hedstrom L.

In addition, no potential homologues were found for the Bacillus subtilis proteins expressed by the mtnK, mtnY, mtnW, mtnX, mtnZ, and mtnV genes that are proposed to constitute the methionine salvage pathway (16Sekowska A. Danchin A. BMC Microbiol. 2002; 2: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). P. falciparum Culture and Immucillin Kill Curves—Human erythrocytes were collected from local volunteers under protocol CCI 00-31 or CCI 99-240 of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Sorbitol-synchonized cultures of P. falciparum strain 3D7 were grown in RPMI supplemented with 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen). Culture media for studies with ImmH and MT-ImmH contained no hypoxanthine supplement. Drugs were dissolved in water and diluted with water or media prior to addition to cultures. Following incubation with ImmH or MT-ImmH for 18 h, the 200-μl cultures in 96-well plates were supplemented with 1 μCi of [3H]ethanolamine (Amersham Biosciences, 25 Ci/mmol). After 48 h, cell cultures were frozen and thawed to disrupt cells, and the mixtures were harvested on glass fiber filters and washed with 1.2 ml of H2O. Filters were dried and counted in a Winspectral 1414 scintillation counter. Experiments were done twice with six replicate wells for each experiment. Individual data points more than two standard deviations from the mean were discarded. For some experiments, parasitemias were counted on Giemsa-stained smears of cultures treated in parallel. Purine Metabolism in P. falciparum by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)—P. falciparum was cultured in human erythrocytes (1% hematocrit) to 1% parasitemia as indicated above. Cultures were synchronized at the ring stage by sorbitol lysis and allowed to recover for 48 h prior to use in experiments. After washing three times in hypoxanthine-free medium, cultures were incubated for 24 h in hypoxanthine-free media followed by the addition of 1 nm carrier-free [8-14C]hypoxanthine, [8-14C]inosine, [8-14C]uric acid, [8-14C]MTA, or [8-14C]MTI to 200-μl cultures (∼20 dpm/culture or 200 fmol). [8-14C]MTI was produced from [8-14C]MTA by using PfADA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 37 °C) and purified by RP-HPLC (peak was identified by retention time). All experiments were in quadruplicate. After labeling for 48 h, cells were washed three times with unlabeled fresh medium and precipitated, and pellets were rinsed three times with 6% trichloroacetic acid, extracted with acetone, and dried. Three mg of sucrose was added as carbon carrier, and samples were converted to graphite and analyzed for the 14C/12C ratio by AMS at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory AMS facility (17Ognibene T.J. Bench G. Vogel J.S. Peaslee G.F. Murov S. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 2192-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In a second AMS experiment, synchronized P. falciparum cultures were incubated in triplicate for 12 h in hypoxanthine-free media and labeled with 100 fmol of the [8-14C]purine for 12 h. Labeled cells were washed three times with cold PBS, and nucleic acids were precipitated and washed with 3% cold perchloric acid. Tributyrin was added as carbon carrier to decrease addition of background 14C. In the first experiment, parasites were mostly trophozoites when label was added, whereas in the second experiment, parasites were late rings/early trophozoites. The Plasmodium Genome Lacks Genes for Adenine Salvage and Recycling—Genome sequence data for P. falciparum, P. yoelii, and partial genome sequences of other Plasmodium species were searched for orthologues of purine salvage enzymes present in mammals and E. coli. The closest protozoan orthologues (usually from T. gondii), a bacterial orthologue, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue, and a mammalian orthologue were used as search queries (see “Materials and Methods”). P. falciparum and all other malaria genomes lack APRT, AK, MTAN, MTRK, and MTAP. We were also unable to find orthologues of other potential purine salvage enzymes that have been reported in other organisms but not in the Plasmodium species. Other groups have independently come to similar conclusions (13Striepen B. Pruijssers A.J. Huang J. Li C. Gubbels M.J. Umejiego N.N. Hedstrom L. Kissinger J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

PfADA Converts MTA to MTI—An unusual feature of P. falciparum is the expression of PfADA, PfPNP, and hypoxanthine-guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase at 4–700 times the specific activity found in human erythrocytes, far exceeding the rate of purine salvage in this purine auxotroph (14Reyes P. Rathod P.K. Sanchez D.J. Mrema J.E. Rieckmann K.H. Heidrich H.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 5: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). P. falciparum grows in ADA- or PNP-deficient erythrocytes, establishing the competence of parasite-expressed enzymes for purine salvage (18Daddona P.E. Wiesmann W.P. Lambros C. Kelley W.N.

We hypothesized that P. falciparum evolved dual substrate specificities in both PfPNP and PfADA to permit the conversion of MTA to hypoxanthine and 5-methylthioribose-1-PO4 (MTR-1-P) and thereby eliminate the need for expression of MTAP, MTAN, MTRK, AK, or APRT. The PfPNP sequence has greater similarity to E. coli than to human PNP (9Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Kim K. Schramm V.L. J. Biol.

PfPNP, however, has unique substrate specificity when compared with either E. coli or mammalian PNPs (9Kicska G.A. Tyler P.C. Evans G.B. Furneaux R.H. Kim K. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3219-3225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 21Bennett E.M. Li C. Allan P.W. Parker W.B. Ealick S.E. J. Biol.

PfPNP is specific for 6-oxopurine rings in its substrates, nucleosides with adenine rings (including MTA) being neither substrates nor inhibitors for the enzyme. The action of PfPNP on a 5′-methylthio-containing nucleoside would therefore require recognition of MTI. Formation of this substrate could hypothetically be accomplished by deamination of MTA to MTI, but a MTA deaminase activity has not been reported previously. PfADA was expressed in E. coli to determine its specificity and to define its role in purine cycling. Human, E. coli, and PfADAs share only 12.8% combined identity in the amino acid sequence (47 of 367 amino acids), but every amino acid interacting with the catalytic site Zn2+ ion and with transition state analogues in the crystal structure of mouse ADA (22Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) is conserved in E. coli and P. falciparum ADAs (Fig. 1). PfADA was able to catalyze the deamination of both adenosine and MTA (Table I). MTA and adenosine were equivalent substrates (kcat/Km) for purified recombinant PfADA enzyme. Calf spleen ADA had no activity with MTA. PfADA has an N-terminal extension not present in human ADA, but deletion of the first 27 amino acids of PfADA did not affect its ability to recognize MTA (data not shown). The 5′-hydroxyl group of ADA inhibitors is in contact with His-17 and Asp-19 of mouse ADA, residues that are conserved in PfADA (22Wilson D.K. Rudolph F.B. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).Table IKinetic properties of mammalian and P. falciparum ADA Reactions were performed as discussed under “Materials and Methods.” Kd values were obtained using adenosine as the substrate in the reaction.

HPLC confirmed a single UV-active species with a different retention time from MTA (Fig. 2A). The product was confirmed as MTI using NMR (not shown) and infrared spectrometry following RP-HPLC purification (Fig. 2B). PfADA Is Inhibited by Inhibitors of ADA—Coformycin, deoxycoformycin, and the l-ribosyl analogues of the coformycins are tight-binding inhibitors of both mammalian and P. falciparum ADAs (18Daddona P.E.

Science. 1991; 252: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Coformycin and deoxycoformycin have comparable activity against bovine ADA and PfADA (Table I). Experimentally equivalent Kd values were obtained for coformycin and deoxycoformycin inhibition using adenosine or MTA substrates, supporting a single catalytic site for both deaminations. Erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride is a potent inhibitor of mammalian ADA (Kd of 50 nm) but a weak inhibitor of PfADA (Kd of 180 μm), establishing significant catalytic site differences in these enzymes (Table I). ADA activity obtained from cell lysates of P. falciparum-infected ADA-deficient human erythrocytes has been reported to have properties similar to our cloned PfADA (18Daddona P.E. Wiesmann W.P. Lambros C. Kelley W.N. Webster H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1472-1475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Details of the binding site that accommodates both MTA and adenosine in PfADA await structural analysis. MTI Is Actively Metabolized in P. falciparum—We used AMS to measure incorporation of trace amounts of 8-14C-labeled purine precursors in P. falciparum cultured in human erythrocytes. AMS sensitivity is ∼1 amol of 14C/mg of carbon (with 1 dpm equivalent to 10,000 amol of 14C (23Turteltaub K.W. Vogel J.S. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 991-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)). ATP, the primary purine source in erythrocytes, is 20,000 nm in malaria cultures maintained at 1% hematocrit, and the amounts of tracer added (≤1 nm) would not be expected to perturb the physiological balance of purines (ATP ↔ ADP ↔ AMP ↔ adenosine ↔ inosine ↔ hypoxanthine; Fig. 3). P. falciparum was cultured in erythrocytes for 24 h without hypoxanthine and then incubated for another 48 h with 1 nm of [8-14C]MTI (200 fmol; Table II and Fig. 3). Control cultures contained 1 nm [8-14C]hypoxanthine, [8-14C]inosine, [8-14C]uric acid, [8-14C]adenine, or [8-14C]MTA. After 48 h, 14C incorporation into acid-insoluble nucleic acids was 16.7, 9.1, and 10.8 fmol of 14C from hypoxanthine, inosine, and MTI, respectively. Labeled MTA and adenine were incorporated less efficiently, reflecting dilution into the erythrocyte purine pools and lack of a malarial APRT (Fig. 3). The control of uric acid showed <0.06 fmol incorporation. A second labeling experiment in which malaria cultures were labeled for 12 h gave similar results (Table II). MTI is equivalent to inosine as a nucleic acid precursor supporting their incorporation via a similar pathway.Table IIDetection of 14C-labeled nucleic acids by AMS P. falciparum cells were cultured in 96-well plates as discussed under “Materials and Methods.” 48 hours after sorbitol synchronization, cultures were equilibrated in hypoxanthine-free media (24 h for experiment 1 and 12 h for experiment 2). Labeling was initiated by addition of 200 fmol (experiment 1) or 100 fmol (experiment 2) of 8-14C-carrier-free purine to each culture. 14C-Labeled nucleic acids were quantitated by AMS in quadruplicate (experiment 1) or triplicate (experiment 2) after the indicated labeling period.

https://openalex.org/W2039273105,"CIB1 (CIB) is an EF-hand-containing protein that binds multiple effector proteins, including the platelet αIIbβ3 integrin and several serine/threonine kinases and potentially modulates their function. The crystal structure for Ca2+-bound CIB1 has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution and reveals a compact α-helical protein containing four EF-hands, the last two of which bind calcium ions in the standard fashion seen in many other EF-hand proteins. CIB1 shares high structural similarity with calcineurin B and the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of EF-hand-containing proteins. Most importantly, like calcineurin B and NCS proteins, which possess a large hydrophobic pocket necessary for ligand binding, CIB1 contains a hydrophobic pocket that has been implicated in ligand binding by previous mutational analysis. However, unlike several NCS proteins, Ca2+-bound CIB1 is largely monomeric whether bound to a relevant peptide ligand or ligand-free. Differences in structure, oligomeric state, and phylogeny define a new family of CIB1-related proteins that extends from arthropods to humans.

One important mechanism by which cells respond to changes in Ca2+ levels involves the activation of EF-hand proteins, such as calmodulin. Upon Ca2+ binding, these proteins undergo structural changes that allow them to bind and activate target proteins. At least two specific structural changes can occur in EF-hand-containing proteins due to Ca2+ binding that facilitate signal transduction. The first type of change occurs when a hydrophobic binding pocket becomes accessible, thus facilitating ligand binding. The second type of change, termed a myristoyl switch, involves the extrusion of an N-terminal myristoyl group from a hydrophobic cavity in the protein, thereby leading to membrane localization, as described in recoverin (1Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) and related proteins. Recoverin and related proteins are termed neuronal calcium sensors (NCS) 1The abbreviations used are: NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; BTP, bis-Tris propane (1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane); MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; AUC, analytical ultracentrifugation; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. due to their neuronal expression pattern and high degree of homology (2Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). These proteins have a variety of functions; recoverin directly inhibits rhodopsin kinase (3Senin I.I. Koch K.W. Akhtar M. Philippov P.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 514: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), while a subgroup of NCS proteins that includes frequenin modulates synaptic activity, neurotransmitter release, and vesicle secretion (2Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). NCS proteins bind Ca2+ at levels just above basal Ca2+ concentrations and reach half maximal binding below 1 μm free Ca2+, which is a 10-fold higher affinity than that of calmodulin (4Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Therefore, these proteins are fully active at intracellular Ca2+ concentrations that activate only a small fraction of calmodulin. CIB1 (CIB, calmyrin, and KIP) is an EF-hand-containing protein that possesses many features of NCS proteins. CIB1 contains four EF-hand domains (denoted EF1-4), two of which bind Ca2+ (EF3 and EF4) with affinities of 1.9 and 0.54 μm, respectively (5Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These values are comparable to the Ca2+ affinities seen in NCS proteins. In addition, CIB1 is N-terminally myristoylated (6Stabler S.M. Ostrowski L.L. Janicki S.M. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1277-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), although it is unknown whether it functions as a Ca2+-myristoyl switch, despite sequence similarity in its myristoyl-binding pocket to the Ca2+-myristoyl switch protein recoverin (7Barry W.T. Boudignon-Proudhon C. Shock D.D. McFadden A. Weiss J.M. Sondek J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28877-28883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Tanaka T. Ames J.B. Harvey T.S. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1995; 376: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The myristoyl group of CIB1 may target it to membranes, since CIB1 fractionates exclusively with membrane fractions in both nucleated (6Stabler S.M. Ostrowski L.L. Janicki S.M. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1277-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and non-nucleated (9Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) cells. Moreover, disruption of myristoylation by addition of an N-terminal myc tag causes CIB1 staining to shift from membranes to a diffuse cytosolic and nuclear pattern (6Stabler S.M. Ostrowski L.L. Janicki S.M. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1277-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, myristoylation does not appear to be required for CIB1 binding to its ligands (9Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Haataja L. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8321-8328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Unlike NCS proteins, CIB1 is not exclusively neuronal, but is widely expressed (9Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, CIB1 is less homologous in sequence to several NCS proteins, such as KChIP1 (46%), neurocalcin (46%), and frequenin (43%) than they are to one another (2Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In fact, CIB1 is more homologous to the EF-hand proteins calcineurin B (57% similarity) and calmodulin (54%). CIB1 was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a binding partner for the cytoplasmic tail of the platelet integrin αIIb (11Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Subsequently, additional CIB1-binding proteins were identified, including DNA-dependent protein kinase (12Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mutat. Res. 1997; 385: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the polo-like kinases Fnk and Snk (13Kauselmann G. Weiler M. Wulff P. Jessberger S. Konietzko U. Scafidi J. Staubli U.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1277-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and CIB1 has been shown to modify the function of some of these proteins (14Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Lagutina I. Grosveld G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Ma S. Liu M.A. Yuan Y.L. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 376-384PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors containing an α and β subunit that can exist in a resting conformation on unactivated cells and convert to an active conformation upon cell stimulation, resulting in a conformational change that allows the integrin to bind its adhesive protein ligands with higher affinity. The αIIbβ3 integrin is expressed only on platelets and their precursors, megakaryocytes, and is the most abundant integrin on these cells. CIB1 binding to αIIb appears to modulate the activation state of the integrin (16Yuan W. McFadden A. Wang Z. Larsen M.K. Boudignon-Proudhon C. Parise L.V. Blood. 2003; 102 (Abstr. 555): 160AGoogle Scholar, 17Tsuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), platelet spreading (18Naik U.P.

The CIB1 binding region of αIIb has been delineated, and corresponds to a membrane-proximal portion of the cytoplasmic tail, including several amino acids within the putative transmembrane domain (7Barry W.T. Boudignon-Proudhon C. Shock D.D. McFadden A. Weiss J.M. Sondek J. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28877-28883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These binding residues of αIIb are likely to form an amphipathic α-helix (20Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Adair B.D. Yeager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14059-14064Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which agrees with data showing that the hydrophobic crevices of EF-hand-containing proteins bind α-helical regions, such as the binding of calcineurin B to calcineurin A (22Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and the binding of KChIP1 to the Kv4.2 channel (23Zhou W. Qian Y. Kunjilwar K. Pfaffinger P.J. Choe S. Neuron. 2004; 41: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The sequences of three CIB1 homologs (CIB2, -3, and -4) are also found in the human genome. CIB1 and some of its homologs have been identified in other vertebrates, and highly homologous sequences are present in the genome of more simple organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster. Sequence analysis indicates CIB1 and its homologs form a protein family distinct from those of the calcineurin B and the NCS families. To help determine the molecular mechanism for CIB1 binding to its various targets, we describe the x-ray crystal structure of Ca2+-bound CIB1 to 2.0 Å. Protein Purification—Human wild type CIB1 and CIB1 Δ1-8 (residues 9-191), each fused to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, were expressed from pProEX HTc (Invitrogen) in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The final DNA sequence includes a hexahistidine Ni-affinity tag followed by a tobacco etch virus cleavage site at the N terminus; the tag was later removed from the protein as described below. CIB1 Δ1-8 was used for crystallization experiments. Wild-type CIB1 was used for gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. Expression of CIB1 was initiated by inoculating 1 liter of LB broth with 100 ml of overnight culture and incubating at 37 °C. CIB1 expression was induced after 4 h by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in Buffer A, composed of 20 mm Tris, 10 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 μm CaCl2 (pH 7.5) with 1 tablet of “Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture” (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by one pass through an EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin) homogenizer, and lysed cells were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 40 min. Clarified cell lysate was loaded onto two 5-ml Hi-Trap chelating HP columns in series (Amersham Biosciences) that had been preloaded with 100 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with buffer. The column was washed with 5 and 30% of Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1 m imidazole) and CIB1 was eluted at 40% of this buffer. Fractions containing CIB1 were pooled and dialyzed 1 h in 20 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 100 μm CaCl2 (pH 7.5) to dilute the imidazole and remove residual Ni2+. Dialysis and removal of the His tag was performed by overnight incubation with 4 ml of tobacco etch virus (purified as stated previously (24Parks T.D. Howard E.D. Wolpert T.J. Arp D.J. Dougherty W.G. Virology. 1995; 210: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)) in dialysis buffer that also contains 5 mm dithiothreitol. Analysis of the extent of cleavage was performed by analyzing samples by SDS-PAGE. If additional cleavage was required, further incubation with additional tobacco etch virus was performed. CIB1 was further purified by an S-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the purest fractions were concentrated using a Vivaspin 10 MWCO concentrator (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany), and the buffer was exchanged to 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol (pH 6.5) by several rounds of dilution and concentration. Protein was frozen in 50-μl aliquots at 30 mg/ml. Quantities of 40-50 mg of protein were obtained per liter of broth. Crystallization—Crystals of purified CIB1 Δ1-8 were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C for 3-5 days by equilibrating against 20 mm Bis-Tris propane, 300 mm calcium acetate, and 18% polyethylene glycol 3350 (pH 6.8) and reached full size after 10 days. Crystals were cryoprotected by slowly equilibrating the crystal drop to glycerol in increments of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 15%, and 20% (v/v) glycerol in the mother liquor solution, followed by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Gel Filtration—The Low Molecular Weight Gel Filtration Calibration Kit (Amersham Biosciences) was used to calibrate a Superdex S-75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 200 μl each of ovalbumin (43 kDa) and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) at 5 mg/ml or albumin (67 kDa) and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) were loaded onto a column pre-equilibrated with S-75 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm calcium acetate) at 0.8 ml/min. The void volume (Vo) was determined by the elution volume of blue dextran (2000 kDa). Purified full-length CIB1 (250 μl of 4 mg/ml) was loaded onto the column that had been pre-equilibrated with 2 mm calcium acetate or 2 mm EGTA. The cytoplasmic αIIb peptide (Ac-LVLAMWKVGFFKRNRPPLEEDDEEGQ-COOH) was added to CIB1 in a molar ratio of 2:1, with 200 μl of CIB1 (65 μm) and 100 μl of αIIb (146 μm) loaded. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Purified full-length CIB1 was equilibrated to AUC buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and either 2 mm (CH3COO)2Ca or 2 mm EGTA) using a Vivaspin 10 MWCO concentrator (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). The final concentrations of CIB1 were ∼230, ∼180, and ∼80 μm, with A280 values of ∼0.6, 0.4, and 0.2. For experiments with the cytoplasmic αIIb peptide (Ac-LVLAMWKVGFFKRNRPPLEEDDEEGQ-COOH), a 1:1 molar ratio of αIIb to CIB1 was used. Equivalent concentrations of αIIb peptide were used in the sample and reference cells. Prior to centrifugation, impurities of the αIIb peptide were eliminated by performing a buffer exchange in a stirred cell (Amicon) with a 1,000 NMWL Ultrafiltration Membrane (Millipore) of regenerated cellulose. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed using a Beckman Optima XL-I Ultracentrifuge, a Ti-60 rotor and a 6-sector cell (1.2-cm path length). For CIB1 protein alone, samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 26 h at 20 °C. Offset was determined by meniscus depletion by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 6 h. For CIB1 plus αIIb samples, centrifugation was performed at 16,000 rpm for 32 h at 20 °C, and offset was determined by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 8 h. Equilibrium was determined to have been reached when data collected every 2 h did not change from the previous reading. Data were fit using XL-A/XL-1 Data Analysis Software Version 4.0 (Beckman Instruments, Inc., 1997) using values of 0.736 for the partial specific volume and 1.0 for solvent density. Data Collection—The data used for phasing by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction were collected from a single crystal of CIB1 on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray generator fitted with a chromium anode and Osmic VariMax-Cr optics, which together generate CrKα radiation (λ = 2.29 Å) and a Rigaku R-AXIS IV imaging plate area detector. Chromium Kα radiation is more suitable than CuKα (λ = 1.54 Å) for detecting the dispersion signal from intrinsic elements such as calcium and sulfur of CIB1 protein, because the signal is doubled (Δfl″ = 2.51 e- and Δfl″ = 1.14 e-, respectively) compared with that of CuKα (Δfl″ = 1.29 e- and Δfl″ = 0.56 e-, respectively). The VariMax-Cr was equipped with a slit that allowed the divergence to be tuned for the sample. This slit setting was optimized by maximizing I/σ(I) on equivalent screening images. The crystal was mounted in an arbitrary orientation, and data were collected at cryogenic temperatures in a single continuous scan. Both incident and diffracted beam helium beam paths were used to minimize air absorption and scattering.

Open table in a new tab For phasing, we collected 510° of data to ensure high redundancy for the calcium and sulfur anomalous signal, although with the chromium wavelength x-rays, this much redundancy is probably not necessary (25Yang C.

Data were processed with HKL2000 (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), which has an absorption correction that is needed for the longer wavelength chromium x-rays (25Yang C. Pflugrath J.W. Courville D.A. Stence C.N. Ferrara J.D. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1943-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Due to the longer wavelength and the necessity to use the R-AXIS IV detector with a 300-mm image plate width, the crystal-to-detector distance was 122 mm, and the maximum resolution for this data set was 2.7 Å. The structure was refined against data collected from another crystal collected at the SER-CAT beamline at the Advanced Proton Source at 1.0 Å wavelength; this crystal diffracted to 2.0 Å. Structure Determination and Refinement—Calculation of the Matthews coefficient indicated two CIB1 molecules per asymmetric unit in the P21 cell. The program SOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to locate the positions of anomalous scatterers from the chromium data. We used the “single-wavelength anomalous diffraction” script (to 3.0 Å) provided on the SOLVE website to search for the eight highest peaks, reasoning that these might correspond to individual calcium ions (with a higher Δf ′ at 2.2909 Å compared with sulfur) bound to each of the EF-hands in the asymmetric unit. SOLVE easily found eight sites with occupancies ranging from 0.147 to 0.522. The overall Z score from SOLVE was 30.9, and the figure of merit was 0.39. Only two C-terminal EF-hands per CIB1 monomer are occupied by individual calcium ions. There are, however, two more calcium ions per CIB1 monomer that bind at surface positions and are most likely due to the high Ca2+ concentration (300 mm) in the crystallization medium. That gives a total of eight calcium ions in the asymmetric unit. The top eight sites found by SOLVE were not all calcium ions; three were sulfur atoms. The program RESOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) was used to find non-crystallographic symmetry and carry out “statistical” solvent flattening. Three pairs of the eight sites were related by NCS, and the “overlap of NCS-related density” was 0.76 in RESOLVE. The solvent-flattened electron density map from RESOLVE was used to trace the chain of one of the two monomers of CIB1 in the asymmetric unit. The process was guided by the structure of calcineurin B (PDB code 1TCO), which is 57% homologous to CIB1. The sequence in the helices surrounding the EF-hands was matched easily to density; however, the density in the EF-hand loops was not as continuous and clear. An anomalous difference Fourier map using the phases from the eight SOLVE sites produced a new set of sites, which turned out to be sulfur and lower occupancy calcium atoms. The chain tracing was verified using the sulfur sites from cysteine and methionine residues. Once a preliminary model of the first molecule in the asymmetric unit was built, molecular replacement using the CCP4 program AMoRe (28Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) was used to position the second molecule. The independently determined positions of calcium and sulfur atoms determined by SOLVE verified this solution. The density for the second molecule is significantly weaker, especially in the second half of the molecule that contains the two EF-hand calcium ions. The temperature factors for this molecule in initial rounds of conjugate gradient or simulated annealing refinement using CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) were quite high (average temperature factors for all atoms in molecules 1 and 2 were typically ∼40 and ∼70 Å2, respectively). Rfree values were just below 30% for these refinements, using either the 2.0 Å data set collected at the synchrotron, or the chromium data set to 2.8 Å. If the packing is inspected, the second molecule (“B”) has fewer intermolecular contacts in the crystal, apparently giving it a more flexible position and thereby more average disorder as indicated by high temperature factors. A TLS refinement using the CCP4 program Ref-mac5 (43Pannu N.J. Murshidov G.N. Dodson E.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) to 2.0 Å using each subunit and its associated calcium ions as a TLS “group,” and using tight geometrical restraints (matrix diagonal weighting term = 0.05), gave a model with Rwork = 21.2% and Rfree = 25.7%. The r.m.s. bond and angle deviations were 0.01 Å and 1.10°, respectively. From the Ramachandran plot, 2 (0.6%) and 1 residues (0.3%) were found in generously allowed and forbidden regions, respectively; however, these residues were either at the N terminus (residues 13 and 14 in molecule A) or neighboring a disordered loop (residue 146 in molecule B) where the density is poor. Sequence Alignment—Sequences represented in Fig. 3B were aligned using ClustalX (30Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar), and the output guide tree file was imported and displayed as a dendrogram using the program TreeView 1.6.6 (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/rod.html). Overall Structure of CIB1 and Geometry of Ca2+ Binding—Full-length CIB1 consistently yielded twinned, poorly formed crystals. Because proteins homologous to CIB1, such as recoverin, have a disordered N terminus (31Flaherty K.M. Zozulya S. Stryer L. McKay D.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 709-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and secondary structure suggests that this region is also disordered in CIB1, CIB1 Δ1-8 was used for crystallization and structure determination. The structure of CIB1 was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing using chromium radiation (λ = 2.29 Å, Rigaku/MSC Inc., The Woodlands, TX). These data were collected to 2.7 Å, but phases were eventually extended to 2.0 Å using native data sets collected both in-house and at the SER-CAT beamline at Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). There are two molecules of CIB1 in the asymmetric unit. The electron density (Fig. 1A) has been fit with models of CIB1 encompassing residues 12-191 except for a disordered loop between residues 137 and 142 in molecule A and 136-145 in molecule B. The overall fold of CIB1 is shown in Fig. 1B and is very similar to other Ca2+-binding proteins containing four EF-hands, such as calmodulin and calcineurin B. However, we observed that only EF-hands 3 and 4 of CIB1 bind Ca2+ (Fig. 1, B and C), as previously demonstrated by NMR (5Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Calcium ions bind canonical EF-hands with high affinity due to acidic residues at positions 1, 3, 5, and 12, where residues at positions 1, 3, and 5 contribute individual ligands to the coordination sphere and the residue at position 12 contributes two ligands (32Michiels J. Xi C. Verhaert J. Vanderleyden J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In most EF-hands, a backbone carbonyl at position 7 as well as a water molecule that is hydrogen-bonded to a side-chain oxygen from position 7 complete the coordination sphere, yielding a pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. In EF4 of CIB1 (Fig. 1C), the side chains of Asp-161 (position 1), Asp-163, Asp-165, and Glu-172 (position 12) coordinate Ca2+, with Glu-172 being a bidentate ligand. Thr-167 (position 7) ligates Ca2+ through its carbonyl oxygen and also coordinates a water molecule that ligates Ca2+. Similarly, in EF3 (Fig. 1C), the Ca2+ is coordinated by the side chains of Asp-116 (position 1), Asp-118, Asp-120, and Asp-127 as well as the carbonyl of Thr-122 (position 7) and two water molecules. One ligating water molecule is bridged through an additional water molecule interacting with the side chain of Thr-122, and the other ligating water molecule is seen in only one molecule of the asymmetric unit. In EF4, this water molecule is replaced by the bidentate ligation of Glu-172 (position 12). Relative to EF4, the ligation sphere of the Ca2+ in EF3 is less well ordered, which is consistent with the fact that EF3 binds Ca2+ with a lower affinity than EF4 (5Yamniuk A.P. Nguyen L.T. Hoang T.T. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2558-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Calcium ions are not bound in EF1 and EF2. It is not surprising that Ca2+ is absent from EF1, because it has an additional eight amino acids within the loop that normally binds Ca2+. Following this extended loop region in EF1, the helix that typically corresponds to the second helix in an EF-hand i"
https://openalex.org/W2075384667,"Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) plays a key role in the regulation of epithelial Na+ transport. SGK phosphorylates Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) for degradation. Phosphorylation increases Na+ transport by reducing Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC, which increases ENaC expression at the cell surface. Thus, SGK expression must be tightly controlled to maintain Na+ homeostasis. This occurs in part by regulation of SGK transcription; a variety of signals including steroid hormones (aldosterone and glucocorticoids) increase SGK levels by inducing transcription of SGK. However, SGK has a short half-life, suggesting that SGK levels might also be controlled by regulation of SGK degradation. Here we found that SGK degradation is mediated in part by Nedd4-2. Consistent with this model, overexpression of Nedd4-2 decreased steady-state levels of SGK in a dose-dependent manner by increasing SGK ubiquitination and degradation in the 26S proteasome. Conversely, silencing of Nedd4-2 by RNA interference stabilized SGK. Nedd4-2 phosphorylation potentiates SGK degradation; degradation was reduced by Nedd4-2 and SGK mutations that disrupt phosphorylation or by inhibition of SGK kinase activity. Together with previous work, the data support a model in which SGK and Nedd4-2 regulate one another in a reciprocal manner. SGK phosphorylates Nedd4-2, which reduces Nedd4-2 binding and inhibition of ENaC. Conversely, phosphorylation increases Nedd4-2-mediated degradation of SGK. Thus, by phosphorylating Nedd4-2, SGK induces its own degradation. This feedback inhibition may fine-tune the regulation of epithelial Na+ absorption."

We found that diethyl maleate (DEM), a well known activator of Nrf2, induces one of the small Maf genes, mafG. To elucidate roles MafG might play in the oxidative stress response, we examined transcriptional regulation of the mouse mafG gene. MafG utilizes three independent first exons that are each spliced to second and third coding exons. Among the small maf genes, mafG showed the strongest response to DEM, and of the three first exons, the highest -fold induction was seen with the proximal first exon (Ic). Importantly, one ARE (Ic-ARE) is conserved in the promoter flanking exon Ic of the human and mouse mafG genes. The Nrf2/MafG heterodimer bound the Ic-ARE and activated transcription, whereas DEM failed to activate mafG in nrf2-null mutant cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation further revealed that both Nrf2 and small Maf proteins associate with the Ic-ARE in vivo. These results demonstrate that mafG is itself an ARE-dependent gene that is regulated by an Nrf2/small Maf heterodimer and suggest the presence of an autoregulatory feedback pathway for mafG transcriptional regulation.

Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has long been known that the genes encoding these enzymes are often coordinately regulated through AREs in their gene-regulatory regions (2Talalay P. Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 2003; 43: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The ARE is a Maf (musculo-aponeurotic fibrosarcoma) recognition element (MARE)-related sequence, with strong similarity to the MARE (3Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4A). Basic region-leucine zipper transcription factors, including CNC (Cap'n'Collar protein) family (Nrf1, Nrf2, Nrf3, and p45 NF-E2) and Bach (BTB and CNC homology) proteins (Bach1 and Bach2), form heterodimeric partners with a small Maf protein (MafG, MafK, and MafF), and then associate with various MARE-related sequences (including AREs).Fig. 4A putative ARE in the mafG gene Ic promoter.

Therefore, ARE-mediated transcription is either positively or negatively regulated, depending on which basic region-leucine zipper factors bind to the ARE(s). Whereas small Maf proteins lack any recognizable transcriptional effector domains (other than the basic regionleucine zipper motif), they are nonetheless regarded as critical regulators of ARE-mediated transcription, since CNC and Bach proteins require them as obligatory partners for site-specific association with the ARE. Moreover, it is well documented that homodimers and heterodimers composed exclusively of small Maf proteins can act as repressive competitors to small Maf/CNC and small Maf/Bach heterodimers. One implication of these data is that small Maf proteins can participate in both positive and negative regulation of MARE-dependent genes. Additionally, the amount of small Maf proteins could be an important determinant of the transcriptional activity of target genes (for reviews, see Refs. 4Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The positive contributions of CNC proteins and the negative contributions of Bach1 to ARE-mediated transcription have been validated by gene targeting strategies. ARE-dependent gene induction was greatly impaired in nrf2-null mutant mice (6Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar), and Nrf1 is also reported to contribute to the activation of ARE-dependent genes (7Chen L. Kwong M. Lu R. Ginzinger D. Lee C. Leung L. Chan J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4673-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 8Leung L. Kwong M. Hou S. Lee C. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48021-48029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The ARE-dependent HO-1 gene was significantly derepressed in bach1-null mutant mice, suggesting that HO-1 is negatively regulated by Bach1 (9Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Although nrf3-null and bach2-null mutant mice have been reported (10Derjuga A. Gourley T.S. Holm T.M. Heng H.H. Shivdasani R.A. Ahmed R. Andrews N.C. Blank V. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2004; 429: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the contribution of these factors to ARE-mediated regulation is still to be determined. In comparison with the cnc and bach family-targeted mutant mice, the phenotypes of small maf mutant mice were expected to be more complicated, since small Maf proteins can participate in both positive and negative regulation. The functions of small Maf proteins are compensatory and provide partially overlapping redundancy, since small maf single mutant mice (mafG–/–, mafK–/–, and mafF–/–) showed mild or subtle phenotypes (12Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3514-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D.

Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1335-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Tamagawa Y. Kure S. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We recently observed that a fraction of ARE-dependent genes (e.g. NQO1 and thioredoxin reductase 1) are not normally induced in either small maf compound mutant mice or in nrf2-null mutant mice. 2F. Katsuoka, H. Motohashi, J. D. Engel, and M. Yamamoto, unpublished observations. Therefore, we concluded that small Maf proteins act cooperatively with Nrf2 to activate the transcription of these genes. In contrast, HO-1 transcription is derepressed in small maf compound mutant mice, similarly to the bach1-null mutant (16Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Tamagawa Y. Kure S. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that small Maf proteins are also important for collaboratively repressing HO-1. In this way, we genetically confirmed that small Maf proteins act as required cofactors in both positive and negative MARE-dependent regulation of gene transcription. In the course of previous gene expression analyses, we found that diethyl maleate (DEM), a well known inducer of Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes, induced the expression of mafG. 3F. Katsuoka, H. Motohashi, J. D. Engel, and M. Yamamoto, submitted for publication. This observation suggested that mafG is an Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene. However, the mechanisms that regulate mafG transcription are only poorly understood. Here, we show that a functional promoter ARE controls mafG induction. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses, we demonstrate that Nrf2 and small Maf proteins bind specifically to the mafG ARE. We also confirm that induction of mafG is severely impaired in nrf2-null mutant cells. Thus, mafG is indeed an Nrf2/ARE-dependent gene. Animals—Germ line mutagenesis of mouse nrf2 was described previously (6Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y.

To induce ARE-dependent genes, MEFs were treated with 50 μm DEM (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) for 12 h.

These expression vectors and the luciferase reporter vectors were transfected into the cells using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). 12 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and the lysates were used for luciferase assays. The expressions of both firefly and sea pansy luciferase were quantified using a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega); firefly luciferase activity was normalized to co-transfected sea pansy luciferase activity for transfection efficiency.

J. 2003; 374: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene promoter (22Nioi P. McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); and mafG Ic promoter, (5′-GGC TGA TCC TTG CTT GCT GTT G-3′ and 5′-GCA AGC CTA GAA GGA AGC TGA G-3′). MafG Gene Expression Is Induced by DEM—In an earlier study, we found that DEM, a well known inducer of Nrf2/ARE-dependent genes, induced the expression of mafG in MEF.3 To confirm this observation, we treated wild type MEFs with DEM and examined the expression of small maf genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Among the small maf genes, mafG was the most significantly induced by DEM (Fig. 1A). Induction of mafG peaked 3 h after DEM treatment before gradually decreasing (Fig. 1B). Thus, mafG is a DEM-responsive gene induced at a relatively early stage in the course of the response. The HO-1 gene showed a similar induction profile (Fig. 1B). Notably, the induction of other ARE-dependent genes, such as NQO1 and PRDX1, peaked only after 12 h following DEM treatment (Fig. 1B). The mafG Gene Has Three Alternative First Exons—To decipher the mechanisms controlling mafG induction, we examined transcriptional regulation of the mafG gene. We previously isolated phage clones containing the mouse mafG locus and mapped coding exons II and III but did not determine the nature of the noncoding first exon(s) (13Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Onodera K. Akasaka J. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2164-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first performed 5′-RACE to determine first exon(s) utilized by the mafG gene and identified three (designated Ia, Ib, and Ic) (Fig. 2A). We also identified one splice isoform, designated “Ic-int” (Fig. 2B), which has an Ic first exon and intron sequence lying between the Ic and second exon but lacks the intron between exons II and III, demonstrating that this sequence was not due to genomic DNA contamination. We asked whether these splice isoforms (Ia, Ib, Ic, and Ic-int) are also found in the adult mouse and whether or not they are differentially utilized. To address the latter question, we designed a quantitative RT-PCR assay system which allowed specific transcript identification. Furthermore, to compare the relative abundance of each isoform, we prepared plasmid vectors containing each PCR product and used them as a copy number standard for quantitative RT-PCR. These results show that each splice isoform is differentially utilized (Fig. 2C). In the tissues tested, the Ib and Ic isoforms were relatively abundant (Fig. 2C). Whereas the Ia isoform was used relatively more rarely, this transcript seems to be preferentially expressed in hematopoietic tissues, such as spleen and bone marrow (Fig. 2C). The expression of the Ic-int isoform was utilized differently than the Ic isoform (Fig. 2C). In conclusion, accumulation of the four distinct MafG transcripts differs in a manner that is dependent on tissue type, suggesting that alternative transcriptional regulatory mechanisms differentially control expression from each of the three mafG promoters. An ARE Consensus Sequence in the Promoter-proximal Region of mafG Exon Ic—We next asked whether the distinct mafG transcripts are utilized differentially in response to stress. We performed quantitative RT-PCR using cDNA recovered from cells treated or untreated with DEM. The Ia, Ib, and Ic isoforms were all significantly induced by DEM, whereas the Ic-int isoform was not (Fig. 3A). After DEM treatment, the Ib isoform was still the most abundant species of the mafG transcripts (Fig. 3A). Notably, upon comparison of the induction ratios for each transcript, we found that isoform Ic was most markedly induced (Fig. 3B). While searching through the mafG genomic locus in silico, we discovered a potential ARE sequence 5′ to exon Ic (Ic-ARE) (Fig. 4A). The Ic-ARE partially matches the ideal ARE consensus sequence and is similar to the ARE identified in the NQO1 regulatory element (Fig. 4A). An NCBI data base search led to the identification of a putative first exon for human mafG corresponding nicely to the mouse Ic exon (Fig. 4B). The promoter-proximal region of exon Ic is highly conserved between mice and humans, including the putative mafG promoter Ic-ARE (Fig. 4B). An Nrf2/MafG Heterodimer Binds to, and Activates Transcription from, the mafG Ic-ARE—The potential binding interaction of the Nrf2/small Maf heterodimer to the Ic-ARE was examined by EMSA. To assess the binding affinity of the mafG Ic-ARE, we compared it with the high affinity ARE site identified in the mouse NQO1 gene as a positive control. The result clearly demonstrated that the Nrf2/MafG heterodimer binds well to the mafG promoter ARE (Fig. 5A). The binding affinity of the heterodimer for the Ic-ARE appeared to be somewhat weaker than for the NQO1-ARE (Fig. 5A); in contrast, MafG homodimers seemed to prefer the MafG-ARE over the NQO1-ARE (Fig. 5A). The binding activities to the MafG-ARE were competed efficiently by a 300-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild type MafG-ARE, but not by the mutant MafG-ARE, possessing mutated nucleotides at both ends of the TPA response element contained within the MafG-ARE (m1) (Fig. 5B). These results showed that DNA binding of Nrf2 and MafG depends on the integrity of the TPA response element core sequence of the MafG-ARE. To the contrary, these binding activities were eliminated by the addition of a 300-fold molar excess of the mutated MafG-ARE possessing a mutation in the sequence lying just outside of the short ARE consensus (m2). The mutated MafG-ARE possessing both of the mutations within a single ARE (m3) behaved in a similar way with m1 mutant oligonucleotides (Fig. 5B). Further study using a lower molar excess of competitors showed that m2-type MafG-ARE was almost comparable with the wild type MafG-ARE in the ability to suppress the Nrf2/MafG-shifted complexes (Fig. 5C). These results showed that the mutated nucleotides in m2-type MafG-ARE are not critical for the binding of Nrf2/MafG heterodimer and MafG homodimer to Ic-ARE at least in vitro (Fig. 5C). To examine whether the mafG promoter Ic-ARE is functional, we performed transient transfection assays. Oligonucleotides containing ARE sequences were inserted into luciferase reporter genes and transfected into 293T cells. In order to make a comparison with the activity of a known ARE, we co-transfected luciferase reporter constructs containing either the ARE from mafG promoter or the ARE derived from the mouse NQO1 gene. The ARE reporter gene was strongly activated by co-transfection with the Nrf2 expression vector alone (Fig. 5D). The ARE/luciferase reporter was activated to even higher levels when co-transfected with expression vectors that simultaneously forced Nrf2 and MafG expression (Fig. 5D). The induction of the reporter gene was comparable using either the mafG promoter or NQO1 promoter ARE sites (Fig. 5D). We further dissected the Ic-ARE activity by investigating the trans-activation potential of mutant AREs tested in EMSA. Strong induction of the reporter gene that is normally elicited by the Nrf2 expression vector was no longer observed with a mutated reporter gene possessing an m1-type mutation (Fig. 5E). Consistent with the result of EMSA, this showed that the TPA response element core sequence of the Ic-ARE is critical. Whereas m2-type mutation did not affect the binding activity of Nrf2/MafG, this mutation abolished Nrf2-mediated induction of the ARE luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5E). It is noteworthy that both m1-type and m2-type mutated reporter genes were slightly activated when both Nrf2 and MafG expression vectors were co-introduced by transfection. However, no combination of factors was able to activate the reporter gene possessing the m3-type mutation (Fig. 5E). These mutational analyses suggest that the sequences outside of the classical short ARE are important for maximum induction of mafG transcription. Nrf2 and Small Maf Interact with the Endogenous mafG Ic-ARE—In order to confirm the biological significance of the data obtained from both EMSA and reporter transfections, ChIP experiments were performed using Hepa-1c1c7 cells. To induce nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, Hepa-1c1c7 cells were treated with DEM for 3 h, fixed with formaldehyde, and used for ChIP assays. The association of Nrf2 with the NQO1 ARE was first examined as a positive control (22Nioi P. McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). As reported, Nrf2 and small Mafs associate strongly with the NQO1 ARE in DEM-treated cells but only weakly in mock-treated cells (Fig. 6). In the absence of IgG or in the presence of preimmune rabbit IgG, immunoprecipitations failed to select the NQO1 ARE (as well as other nonspecific genomic regions), demonstrating that the sites were not enriched in nonspecific fashion (Fig. 6). The LDH gene promoter region was not immunoprecipitated with either Nrf2 or small Mafs, suggesting that the antibodies used enriched DNA in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 6). Under such conditions, these experiments showed that both Nrf2 and small Mafs associated with the mafG Ic-ARE in DEM-treated cells (Fig. 6). These results clearly demonstrated that Nrf2 and small Mafs can associate with an endogenous genomic region containing the mafG promoter Ic-ARE. Interestingly, small Mafs also strongly associated with the mafG Ic-ARE in vehicle-treated cells, suggesting occupation of the Ic-ARE by either inactive or repressive binding complexes prior to DEM induction. Induction of the mafG Gene Is Dependent on Nrf2—Finally, we sought genetic confirmation to support the dependence of mafG transcription on Nrf2 expression. To this end, we prepared nrf2-null embryonic fibroblasts, treated the cells with DEM, and examined mafG mRNA accumulation. Before DEM treatment, the expression of mafG was slightly elevated in nrf2-null mutant cells (in comparison with wild type controls) by ∼1.5-fold. However, mafG was no longer significantly activated in nrf2-null mutant cells after adding DEM, whereas a dose-dependent induction of the mafG was observed in wild type cells (Fig. 7). These results demonstrate that mafG induction is dependent on Nrf2. In this study, we examined the transcriptional regulation of the mouse mafG gene and concluded that mafG is itself an ARE-dependent gene controlled by Nrf2. In agreement with the present data, other Nrf2 inducers have also been reported to induce the mafG gene. A hamster mafG homolog was identified as a hydrogen peroxide-inducible gene in a differential display analysis of gene expression (23Crawford D.R. Leahy K.P. Wang Y. Schools G.P. Kochheiser J.C. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another group reported that pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a thiol compound, induces human MAFG (24Moran J.A. Dahl E.L. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 371-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that the zebrafish mafG homolog is inducible by DEM (25Takagi Y. Kobayashi M. Li L. Suzuki T. Nishikawa K. Yamamoto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, mafG seems to be a stress-inducible gene in many species. When we initially cloned the first exons of mafG by 5′-RACE analysis, we found that the mouse mafG gene has at least three alternative first exons (Ia, Ib, and Ic). We previously reported that mafK and mafF also have multiple untranslated first exons (14Onodera K. Shavit J.A. Motohashi H. Katsuoka F. Akasaka J.E. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21162-21169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Motohashi H. Igarashi K. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohtani H. Nakafuku M. Nishizawa M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Taken together, it seems clear that all three small maf genes utilize multiple first exons. MafG does not appear to have tissue-specific first exons, such as the mafK IN exon that is employed exclusively in neurons (27Motohashi H. Ohta J. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, expression analysis revealed that mafG first exons are utilized differentially in various tissues. Based on the sequences derived from the 5′-RACE clones, we concluded that none of the alternative splice isoforms of mafG produce a change in the amino acid composition of the protein. We inferred that utilizing multiple first exons presents itself as a solution by which small maf genes can confer distinct, broad (but not ubiquitous) expression profiles. Although we cloned a splice isoform of mafG (Ic-int) that contains the intron between exon Ic and exon II and is expressed at a significant level, its biological significance is yet to be determined. All three first exons of mafG were induced upon oxidative stress. Whereas the Ib transcript was the most abundant before and after DEM treatment, the Ic transcript was the most strongly activated by DEM relative to its constitutive expression level. These observations show that the alternative first promoters vary in their inducible response to DEM. The critical transcription factor-binding site that could be responsible for DEM-mediated induction was anticipated to be an ARE(s). We searched for AREs in the mafG locus and identified one in the proximal promoter of exon Ic. Although the short ARE consensus sequence was originally defined as 5′-RGTGACnnnGC-3′, subsequent studies revealed that functional AREs, such as the one in the NQO1 gene, are often represented by a long ARE consensus sequence, 5′-TMAnnRTGAYnnnGCRwwww-3′ (22Nioi P. McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 28Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Indeed, the mafG Ic-ARE is similar to the longer consensus sequence and is also similar to the ARE found in the NQO1 gene regulatory region. Since the Ic-ARE is well conserved in the human MAFG gene, we suspect that these AREs are evolutionarily conserved for mafG regulation. In at least two previous reports, investigators failed to observe cooperative activation of AREs by Nrf2 and small Maf proteins (29Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40134-40141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Nguyen T. Huang H.C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although we also failed to observe this synergistic transcriptional activation in 3T3 or COS1 cells, 2 we did detect cooperativity in 293T cells. In the reporter analysis using 293T cells, we observed that the transcription mediated by the mafG Ic-ARE was cooperatively activated by Nrf2 and MafG. In this assay, a mutation outside the short ARE consensus of the Ic-ARE (Fig. 5C; m2) greatly inhibited induction of the reporter gene by Nrf2 and MafG. Since this mutation did not affect the binding of the Nrf2/Maf heterodimer in EMSA, unidentified factor(s), which recognize the sequence outside of ARE, might play critical cooperative roles with the Nrf2/Maf heterodimer in the transcriptional activation (31Wasserman W.W. Fahl W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, our observations provided support for the longer ARE consensus sequence as important for strong Nrf2-mediated induction. ChIP analysis showed that Nrf2 actually binds to the mafG Ic-ARE in a chromosomal context. Moreover, DEM treatment of nrf2-null mutant cells led to no mafG induction. That is not to say that these data refute a possible contribution of Nrf1 or Nrf3 to mafG regulation, but in MEFs, neither Nrf1 nor Nrf3 is able to compensate for the absence of Nrf2. In fact, Nrf2 and Nrf1 have been shown to play important roles in ARE-dependent gene induction in an overlapping manner (8Leung L. Kwong M. Hou S. Lee C. Chan J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48021-48029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis also showed that small Mafs bind to the mafG Ic-ARE. Although the small Maf antibody used in the ChIP assay recognizes primarily MafK, we suspect that all three small Maf proteins can bind to the mafG Ic-ARE, since this DNA binding motif is conserved among the small Maf proteins (5Motohashi H. O'Connor T. Katsuoka F. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). ChIP analysis showed that small Mafs bind to the mafG Ic-ARE even in untreated cells (Fig. 6), indicating that there is the small Maf binding activity independent of Nrf2. Since MafG homodimer is able to bind to the mafG Ic-ARE in EMSA, it is possible that small Maf proteins form inactive homodimers by themselves and occupy the mafG Ic-ARE in untreated cells. However, it is also possible that small Maf proteins heterodimerize with Bach1 to form a transcriptional repressor. The Bach1-MafG heterodimer may repress mafG gene transcription through mafG Ic-ARE in the same way as it represses HO-1 gene expression (9Sun J. Hoshino H. Takaku K. Nakajima O. Muto A. Suzuki H. Tashiro S. Takahashi S. Shibahara S. Alam J. Taketo M.M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 16Katsuoka F. Motohashi H. Tamagawa Y. Kure S. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The contribution of Bach1 proteins to the regulation of mafG is under investigation. This study also showed that ARE-dependent genes are not induced uniformly by DEM. Indeed, mafG and HO-1 were rapidly induced, whereas NQO1 and PRDX1 were slowly induced. These facts may help us to understand the biological significance of the induction of mafG upon exposure to oxidative stress. It is possible that rapidly induced genes may affect the expression of other ARE-dependent genes. Induced MafG could be utilized as a heterodimeric partner for Nrf2 to further induce ARE-dependent genes at a later stage of differentiation. On the other hand, induced MafG might heterodimerize with Bach1 or homodimerize with itself to repress ARE-dependent genes. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. We recently found that ARE-dependent genes are regulated differentially by small Maf proteins.3 MafG induction may exert distinct influences on the expression levels of target genes, depending on their dimeric context.

The exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) containing von Willebrand factor, P-selectin, and interleukin-8 within minutes after stimulation is important for vascular homeostasis. SNARE proteins are key components of the exocytic machinery in neurons and some secretory cells, but their role in regulating exocytosis in endothelial cells is not well understood. We examined the function of SNARE proteins in mediating exocytosis of WPBs in endothelial cells. We identified the presence of syntaxin 4, syntaxin 3, and the high affinity syntaxin 4-regulatory protein Munc18c in human lung microvascular endothelial cells. Small interfering RNA-induced knockdown of syntaxin 4 (but not of syntaxin 3) inhibited exocytosis of WPBs as detected by the reduction in thrombin-induced cell surface P-selectin expression. Thrombin ligation of protease-activated receptor-1 activated the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c, which, in turn, disrupted the interaction between syntaxin 4 and Munc18. Protein kinase Cα activation was required for the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c as well as the cell surface expression of P-selectin. We also observed that syntaxin 4 knockdown inhibited the adhesion of neutrophils to thrombin-activated endothelial cells, demonstrating the functional role of syntaxin 4 in promoting endothelial adhesivity. Thus, protease-activated receptor-1-induced protein kinase Cα activation and phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c are required for the cell surface expression of P-selectin and the consequent binding of neutrophils to endothelial cells.

WPBs are storage compartments containing von Willebrand factor, P-selectin, and interleukin-8. von Willebrand factor, a mediator of hemostasis, acts as a chaperone for coagulation factor VIII and thus controls the aggregation of platelets at sites of vascular injury (5Ruggeri Z.M.

The SNARE complex then brings the two membranes in apposition, a necessary step in overcoming the energy barrier required for membrane fusion.

The formation of the SNARE complex is tightly controlled by the syntaxin-binding protein Munc18 (also named nsec-1 in neurons) (11Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Disruption of the interaction of syntaxin with Munc18 is believed to be critical for SNARE complex formation (11Rizo J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The closed conformation adopted by syntaxin prior to the formation of the SNARE complex is stabilized by Munc18 binding; thus, syntaxin has to be freed from Munc18 inhibition to adopt the open conformation and thereby form the ternary complex (11Rizo J.

Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22de Vries K.J. Geijtenbeek A. Brian E.C. de Graan P.N. Ghijsen W.E. Verhage M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 385-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that Munc18/sce1 proteins play an important role in vesicle docking (23Voets T. Toonen R.F.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), but little is known about this process in the regulation of WPB exocytosis in endothelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the role of SNARE proteins in the mechanism of regulated WPB exocytosis in endothelial cells and the cell surface expression of P-selectin. We had the following objectives: (i) to identify specific syntaxin isoforms involved in the regulated exocytosis of WPBs in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs); (ii) to delineate key signaling pathways regulating the SNARE protein function induced by thrombin activation of endothelial cells; and (iii) to describe the role of SNARE proteins in the neutrophil adhesion response in endothelial cells. Our results demonstrate the following: (i) that syntaxin 4 regulates the exocytosis of WPBs and the subsequent adhesion of neutrophils to HLMVECs induced by thrombin; and (ii) that syntaxin 4 and Munc18c are both the targets of thrombin-induced PKCα activation, which disrupts syntaxin 4-Munc18c interaction and promotes the translocation of P-selectin to the plasma membrane. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit anti-syntaxin 3 antibody was generated against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing the cytosolic region of syntaxin 3 as described (25Naren A.P. Di A. Cormet-Boyaka E. Boyaka P.N. McGhee J.R. Zhou W. Akagawa K. Fujiwara T. Thome U. Engelhardt J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An affinity-purified rabbit anti-syntaxin 4 antibody was purchased from Calbiochem. The isoform specificity of syntaxin 3 was confirmed using GST-syntaxin fusion proteins (syntaxin 1A, 2, 3, and 4) as described (25Naren A.P. Di A. Cormet-Boyaka E. Boyaka P.N. McGhee J.R. Zhou W. Akagawa K. Fujiwara T. Thome U. Engelhardt J.F. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We carried out studies to examine the isoform specificity of the syntaxin 4 antibody (see supplemental Fig. S1, available in the on-line version of this article). Anti-PKCα, anti-PKCβ2, and anti-Munc18c antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the anti-P-selectin antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. Donkey Alexa-594 secondary antibody was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The PKC inhibitors Gö6976, rottlerin, and the membrane-permeable PKCζ inhibitory peptide were purchased from Calbiochem. The protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) agonist peptide TRAP-6 (SFLLRN) and the PAR-4 agonist peptide (GYPGQV) were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Cell Cultures—Human lung microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ) and cultured in EGM2-MV medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HLMVEC cultures in a T75 flask pre-coated with 0.2% gelatin were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Transfection of Microvascular Endothelial Cells—Human syntaxin 4-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) (5′-AAGGAGGAAGCTGATGAGAAC-3′), syntaxin-3 specific siRNA (5′-AACGTCCGGAACAAACTGAAG-3′), and scrambled control siRNA (5′-AAGGAGTAAGATGATGCGAAC-3′) were synthesized using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Validated PKCα-specific siRNA was obtained directly from Ambion (catalog number 51070). HLMVECs were plated on 0.2% gelatin-coated plates. At 24 h, cells (∼50% confluence) were transfected with the siRNAs using the GeneEraser siRNA transfection reagent (Stratagene, Kirkland, WA) according to the manufacture's protocol. These cells were used for immunoblotting or surface P-selectin assay 2 days after the transfection procedure was accomplished. ELISA for Cell Surface P-selectin Expression—Cell surface P-selectin expression was assessed by modified ELISA of non-permeabilized cells as described (7Takano M. Meneshian A. Sheikh E. Yamakawa Y. Wilkins K.B. Hopkins E.A. Bulkley G.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H2054-H2061PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxidase activity was detected using a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution (TMB; Pierce) and quantified by reading the plates on a spectrophotometric microplate reader at 450 nm. Immunofluorescence—Endothelial cells grown on gelatin-coated coverslips were washed 3× in ice-cold PBS and fixed in freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then permeabilized in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization, cells were incubated with anti-syntaxin antibodies for 2 h, washed 3× in PBS, and incubated with Alexa-594-labeled secondary antibodies. After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were mounted on objective glasses using Prolong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). HLMVECs were stained with anti-syntaxin antibodies and viewed on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 63 × 1.2 numerical aperture objective. Phosphoprotein Isolation—HLMVECs cultured on 100-mm dishes were treated with thrombin (Sigma) or the PAR-1 or PAR-4 peptide agonist in the presence or absence of PKC inhibitors or siRNAs in Hepes-buffered saline solution at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared at the indicated time points. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins from HLMVECs were separated by an affinity chromatography procedure using a phosphoprotein purification kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Using a phosphoprotein purification kit, 7–15% of total proteins are typically phosphorylated in cells grown under basal conditions. Immunodetection by a phospho-specific antibody showed that the kit yields a complete separation of non-phosphorylated (flowthrough) and phosphorylated proteins (elution fraction). In our studies, after equilibrating the column with phosphoprotein lysis buffer, 1.5 ml of cell lysate (from a 100-mm dish) was loaded onto the phosphoprotein purification column and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The lysate was then allowed to pass through the column, and the flow-through containing non-phosphorylated proteins was collected. After thorough washes with phosphoprotein lysis buffer, the same volume (1.5 ml) of phosphoprotein elution buffer was applied, and the eluted fraction containing phosphorylated proteins was collected. Equal volumes (20 μl) of samples from either the flow-through or eluted fraction were then loaded onto a gel for immunoblotting studies. The results are presented as the percentage of changes of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated syntaxin 4 or Munc18c. To confirm the results obtained using the kit, we also determined the phosphorylation of Munc18c in endothelial cells labeled with 32P as described (26Holinstat M. Mehta D. Kozasa T. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28793-28798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These results were consistent with the data obtained using the kit (see supplemental Fig. S2, available in the on-line version of this article). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in a PBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentrations were determined. For immunoprecipitation experiments, lysates were pre-cleared with 20 μl of appropriately suspended (25%; v/v) protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell lysates were then incubated with 2 μg of Munc18c antibody for 1 h at 4 °C.20 μl of protein A/G Plus-agarose was added later to the cell lysates, which were incubated at 4 °C on a rotating device overnight. Pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS. Proteins on the beads were eluted by the addition of sample buffer. Eluted samples or cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). After transfer, membranes were blocked by incubating with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS solution with 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with the indicated antibodies and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). Densitometry analysis was carried out using the ImageJ program. Neutrophil Adhesion Assay—HLMVECs were seeded and cultured (50,000 cells/well) in gelatin-coated 24-well plates. siRNA transfection was carried out as described above. Cells were used for the polymorphonuclear neutrophil adhesion assay 2 days after siRNA transfection. Human neutrophils from the whole blood of healthy donors were isolated using Polymorphprep (Accurate, Westbury, NY). Neutrophils were first incubated with 5 μm calcein AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, neutrophils were washed 2× with prewarmed (37 °C) Hepes-buffered saline solution and resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline solution. Labeled neutrophils were then added to the prepared endothelial monolayers at 2 × 105 cells/well and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Non-adherent calcein-labeled neutrophils were removed by careful washing. Neutrophil fluorescence readings were obtained using a fluorescein filter set. The readings were normalized to control cells without thrombin stimulation. Statistics—Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out by student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Cellular Distribution of Syntaxin 3 and Syntaxin 4 in Endothelial Cells—A typical HLMVEC contained hundreds of WPBs in the perinuclear region before thrombin stimulation that disappeared after thrombin challenge. The rapid exocytosis of WPBs observed in HLMVECs after thrombin stimulation is similar to what was found in other types of human endothelial cells; e.g. human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (6Knop M. Gerke V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Utgaard J.O. Jahnsen F.L. Bakka A. Brandtzaeg P. Haraldsen G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine the molecular basis of thrombin-stimulated exocytosis of WPBs in endothelial cells, we examined whether specific isoforms of syntaxin were expressed in HLMVECs. Syntaxins are critical components of SNARE machinery that regulate membrane trafficking (11Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 4 have been shown to regulate exocytosis in non-neuronal cells (27Kang Y. Huang X. Pasyk E.A. Ji J. Holz G.G. Wheeler M.B. Tsushima R.G. Gaisano H.Y. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Hansen N.J. Antonin W. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22871-22876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the expression and cellular distributions of syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 4 in HLMVECs by immunofluorescence. Syntaxin 3 staining was shown to be different from syntaxin 4. In HLMVECs, syntaxin 3 exhibited intense stainings at cell-cell contacts, and there was some intracellular punctate staining (Fig. 1, left). We observed both cell surface and intracellular syntaxin 4 staining (Fig. 1, right). Role of Syntaxin Isoforms in Mechanism of Thrombin-induced Surface P-selectin Expression in Endothelial Cells—To address the functional role of syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 4 in the regulated exocytosis of WPBs after thrombin stimulation, we used siRNAs against syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 4 to knock down their expression. The effects of siRNAs on the exocytosis of WPBs were examined by P-selectin surface expression in HLMVECs. Using syntaxin 3-specific siRNA, we reduced the expression of syntaxin 3 in HLMVECs without affecting the expression of syntaxin 4 (Fig. 2A). Syntaxin 4 siRNA transfection specifically decreased syntaxin 4 expression (Fig. 2B) and had no effect on syntaxin 3 or P-selectin expression. Syntaxin 4 siRNA caused a significant reduction in the thrombin-induced P-selectin surface expression over the 60-min time course compared with that in control cells, whereas syntaxin 3 siRNA had no significant effect (Fig. 2C). As syntaxin 4 expression was not completely inhibited by the siRNA (Fig. 2B), it is possible that this residual syntaxin 4 expression may have been sufficient to support some degree of the WPB exocytosis seen in Fig. 2C. Thrombin Stimulation Induces Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 4 and Munc18c in Endothelial Cells—We next addressed the possibility that the phosphorylation of SNARE proteins was involved in the mechanism of WPB exocytosis in endothelial cells. Thus, we examined the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and its regulatory protein, Munc18c, after thrombin challenge. Thrombin induced the marked phosphorylation of both syntaxin 4 and Munc18c (Fig. 3). The non-phosphorylated syntaxin 4 and Munc18c were significantly reduced, whereas phosphorylated syntaxin 4 and Munc18c were markedly increased within 5 min after thrombin exposure (Fig. 3, A and B). The phosphorylated syntaxin 4 and Munc18c remained elevated during the 30-min thrombin exposure period. PAR-1 Signaling Induces Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 4 and Munc18c—Because endothelial cells express two thrombin receptors, PAR-1 and PAR-4 (30Vogel S.M. Gao X. Mehta D. Ye R.D. John T.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hirano K. Kanaide H. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2003; 10: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Hamilton J.R. Frauman A.G. Cocks T.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we determined the contributions of these receptor in signaling syntaxin 4 and Munc18c phosphorylation. HLMVECs were stimulated with a selective PAR-1 or PAR-4 peptide agonist (described under “Materials and Methods”). The PAR-1 peptide had a similar effect as that of thrombin on the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c (Fig. 4A). Moreover, only the PAR-1 peptide was capable of stimulating the P-selectin surface (Fig. 4B). PKC-dependent Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 4 and Munc18c—Because PKC may regulate SNARE protein function (16Nagy G. Matti U. Nehring R.B. Binz T. Rettig J. Neher E. Sorensen J.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 9278-9286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22de Vries K.J. Geijtenbeek A. Brian E.C. de Graan P.N. Ghijsen W.E. Verhage M. Eur. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we examined the possible role of PKC in inducing the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c in endothelial cells. Gö6976 (an antagonist of calcium-dependent PKC isoforms), the PKCζ inhibitory peptide, and rottlerin (an inhibitor of PKCδ) were used. We observed that only Gö6976 significantly interfered with thrombin-induced phosphorylation of both syntaxin 4 and Munc18c (Fig. 5A). PKC-dependent Phosphorylation Disrupts Syntaxin 4 and Munc18c Interaction—The binding of syntaxin to Munc18, a high affinity syntaxin-binding protein, may limit the availability of syntaxin to form the SNARE complex (11Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Three munc18 isoforms have been identified; munc18a and 18b interact with syntaxins 1A, 2, and 3, but not with 4 (33Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and munc18c is a high affinity syntaxin 4-binding protein (34Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We carried out co-immunoprecipitation studies to examine whether PKC-induced phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c affected their interaction. Syntaxin 4 and Munc18c co-immunoprecipitated in resting endothelial cells, whereas thrombin stimulation resulted in the disassociation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c (Fig. 5B). Gö6976, which significantly blocked phosphorylation of both syntaxin 4 and Munc18, prevented the thrombin-induced syntaxin 4/Munc18c disassociation (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the PKCζ inhibitory peptide and rottlerin had no significant effect (Fig. 5B). The inhibitory effects of Gö6976 on phosphorylation and the syntaxin 4/Munc18c interaction were coupled to the inhibition on thrombin-induced P-selectin surface expression (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 4 and Munc18c in Endothelial Cells Requires PKCα Activation—The inhibitory effects of Gö6976 shown above suggest that conventional calcium-dependent PKC isoforms are involved in the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c. The conventional PKCα isoform, highly expressed in endothelial cells, regulates endothelial cell barrier function (26Holinstat M. Mehta D. Kozasa T. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28793-28798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Sandoval R. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Kouklis P. Ellis C.A. Tiruppathi C. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To address whether PKCα also mediates thrombin-induced phosphorylation of syntaxin4 and Munc18c, HLMVECs were transfected with a siRNA to knockdown PKCα expression in HLMVECs. Transfection of a scrambled control siRNA had no effect on PKCα expression, whereas the PKCα siRNA reduced PKCα expression without affecting the expression of PKCβ2 or P-selectin (Fig. 6A). PKCα siRNA inhibited the thrombin-induced syntaxin 4 and Munc18c phosphorylation, whereas scrambled control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 6B). Knockdown of PKCα expression also prevented thrombin-induced P-selectin cell surface expression (Fig. 6C). Elevated Intracellular Calcium Concentration Is Necessary for Thrombin-induced Phosphorylation of Syntaxin 4 and Munc18c—Because PKCα activation is calcium-dependent, intracellular calcium chelation with membrane permeable BAPTA-AM prevents PKCα translocation and activation (36Vallentin A. Prevostel C. Fauquier T. Bonnefont X. Joubert D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6014-6021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Cheng J.J. Wung B.S. Chao Y.J. Wang D.L. J.

Investig. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 39Lenz J.C. Reusch H.P. Albrecht N. Schultz G. Schaefer M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the role of intracellular calcium in signaling the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c. BAPTA-AM treatment interfered with thrombin-induced phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c (Fig. 7A) and with cell surface P-selectin expression (Fig. 7B). Syntaxin 4 Regulates Neutrophil Adhesion to Endothelial Cells—We next addressed whether the regulation of P-selectin surface expression by syntaxin 4 is a mechanism for controlling neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. Thus, we examined the role of syntaxin 4 in thrombin-stimulated neutrophil adhesion to HLMVECs using the isoform-specific syntaxin siRNAs described above. We observed that syntaxin 4 siRNA, but not syntaxin 3 siRNA, significantly inhibited neutrophil adhesion to thrombin-activated HLMVECs (Fig. 8). Studies were carried out to address constituents of the SNARE machinery regulating the exocytosis of WPBs in endothelial cells by thrombin. We demonstrated that SNARE proteins expressed in endothelial cells are early targets of thrombin-activated signaling and thereby play pivotal role in WPB exocytosis. It is known that the activation of G protein-coupled PAR-1 in endothelial cells by thrombin results in PKCα activation (26Holinstat M. Mehta D. Kozasa T. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28793-28798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Sandoval R. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Kouklis P. Ellis C.A. Tiruppathi C. J. Physiol. 2001; 533: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the basis of our findings, we propose that activation of PKCα is important in inducing the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c and thereby facilitating the formation of the SNARE complex that mediates the fusion of WPBs with the apical endothelial membrane. The resultant increased surface expression of P-selectin and the secretion of von Willebrand factor and interleukin-8 may contribute to the host defense response to inflammatory stimuli and infection. In the present study, we have focused on syntaxin 4, a constituent of the target SNARE apparatus. We showed that syntaxin 4 plays an essential role in the activation of WPB exocytosis induced by thrombin stimulation of endothelial cells. We observed that a siRNA-induced reduction in syntaxin 4 expression prevented P-selectin surface expression, whereas the inhibition of syntaxin 3 isoform (another syntaxin isoform expressed in endothelial cells) had no significant effect. We set out to address the response to thrombin, because it is a key mediator of vascular inflammation (40Esmon C.T. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1343-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) that has been shown to induce the rapid translocation of P-selectin to the plasma membrane of endothelial cells (7Takano M. Meneshian A. Sheikh E. Yamakawa Y. Wilkins K.B. Hopkins E.A. Bulkley G.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H2054-H2061PubMed Google Scholar, 41Burns A.R. Bowden R.A. Abe Y. Walker D.C. Simon S.I. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thrombin activates its receptor PAR-1, a member of a G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor family (31Hirano K. Kanaide H. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2003; 10: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), on endothelial cells. Studies using peptide agonists specific for PAR-1 and PAR-1 knock-out mice showed that thrombin induced vascular endothelial activation through the PAR-1 isoform (30Vogel S.M. Gao X. Mehta D. Ye R.D. John T.A. Andrade-Gordon P. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 4: 137-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hamilton J.R. Frauman A.G. Cocks T.M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A principal signal transduction pathway following thrombin cleavage of PAR-1 is the activation of phospholipase C through Gq followed by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol production, resulting in a rise in intracellular calcium and the activation of PKC (31Hirano K. Kanaide H. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2003; 10: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We found that the phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c was increased after stimulation with the PAR-1 agonist peptide, indicating that SNARE proteins are important targets of PAR-1 signaling in the endothelium. To address the basis of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c phosphorylation, we initially used PKC inhibitors, because multiple PKC isoforms, PKC α, δ, and ζ, are involved in signaling endothelial inflammatory responses (42Rahman A. True A.L. Anwar K.N. Ye R.D. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 43Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 44Javaid K. Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Frey R.S. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also targeted PKCα specifically by using siRNA to address its role in SNARE protein phosphorylation. Our finding that thrombin-induced phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c was significantly reduced by the inhibitor of calcium-dependent conventional PKC isoforms, Gö6976, and by PKCα siRNA suggests that PKCα is crucial in regulating SNARE protein phosphorylation. We observed that the inhibition of PKCα-induced phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c prevented their dissociation and that this was coupled to decreased WPB exocytosis in endothelial cells. Thus, our data are consistent with a model in which PKCα regulates exocytosis in endothelial cells by modifying the functions of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c through their phosphorylation. These data point to the important role of PKCα-dependent phosphorylation in disrupting the syntaxin 4 and Munc18c interaction, thus facilitating SNARE complex formation and stimulating WPB exocytosis. It is well established that nsec-1 (a homolog of Munc18c) binds to syntaxin 1A with high affinity in biochemical studies (19Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 45Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar); however, in vivo evidence of their association is controversial. Some studies failed to show their co-localization (46Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), but other studies have demonstrated their association in plasma membrane and granule membrane by chemical cross-linking (19Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 47Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Even though our data support the interaction of Munc18c with syntaxin 4 in endothelial cells and show that their interaction can be regulated by PKCα-dependent phosphorylation, we cannot exclude the possibility that Munc18c may have other functions that contribute to vesicle docking (23Voets T.

The elevation of intracellular calcium concentration has diverse regulatory functions in membrane trafficking, including the translocation and fusion of intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane (15Chen Y.A.

A localized rise of intracellular calcium may allow tight control of vesicle trafficking in a temporal and spatial manner. We observed that chelating intracellular calcium with BAPTA-AM in endothelial cells inhibited the PAR-1-activated phosphorylation of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c and blocked the exocytosis of WPBs, as was the case with the inhibition of PKCα. The role of intracellular calcium in regulating WPB exocytosis may be the result of PKCα activation (36Vallentin A. Prevostel C. Fauquier T. Bonnefont X. Joubert D. J. Biol.

Both intracellular calcium rise and PKCα activation are early signals regulating the vascular inflammatory response (43Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol.

However, syntaxin 4 and Munc18c, on the basis of inducing the release of WPB constituents such as P-selectin, may function to increase endothelial adhesiveness to leukocytes. We observed that the reduction in syntaxin 4 expression inhibited neutrophil adhesion to thrombin-activated endothelial cells, suggesting that inhibition of syntaxin 4-regulated P-selectin exocytosis may prevent the early component of the inflammatory response. Thus, the present study provides insights into the core molecular apparatus of syntaxin 4 and Munc18c and the essential role of PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of these proteins in signaling P-selectin translocation to the endothelial plasma membrane.

Here, we examined its effect on pluripotential embryonic stem (ES) cells under hypoxic stress. ES cells were found to produce VEGF and to express VEGF receptor-2 and neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1), a VEGF165 isoform-specific receptor. During hypoxia, expression levels of VEGF, Flk-1, and Nrp-1 were elevated. Inhibition or targeted gene inactivation of VEGF increased ES cell apoptosis during prolonged hypoxia (48 h) by about 10-fold. The survival activity of VEGF was specific since inhibition of other growth factors (including basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and placental growth factor) had no effect. Neuropilin-1 was involved in the VEGF-survival activity since overexpression of Nrp-1 decreased hypoxia-induced apoptosis about 3-fold. The hypoxia-response element, via which hypoxia-inducible transcription factors up-regulate VEGF expression under hypoxic conditions, was critical since targeted deletion of this element in the VEGF promoter enhanced hypoxia-induced ES cell apoptosis to the same extent as VEGF inhibition or gene inactivation. Thus, VEGF plays a critical role in survival of ES cells during prolonged hypoxia.

Certain tissues such as the cornea and cartilage in the adult remain avascular and receive oxygen from diffusion of nearby blood vessels, as vessels would impede transmission of light or cause bleeding of joints, respectively. During development, the oocyte in the ovarian follicle receives oxygen through diffusion from perifollicular blood vessels through the follicular fluid, whereas the oxygen needed for cellular metabolism and division of the preimplantation embryo is supplied by diffusion from the fluids within the oviduct and uterus, respectively. Development of the early pre-implantation embryo therefore occurs in an environment with reduced oxygenation until the onset of vascularization after blastocyst implantation (1Blackburn R.O.

VEGF is rapidly and significantly up-regulated in response to hypoxia via activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which bind to the hypoxia-response element (HRE) in the VEGF promotor (14Semenza G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), leading to angiogenesis and restoration of tissue oxygenation. Recent studies also indicated that VEGF may protect cells against hypoxic damage by directly stimulating their survival, independently of angiogenesis. For instance, VEGF appeared to be critical to prevent motor neuron degeneration, not only because it was essential to maintain sufficient perfusion but also because it exerted direct trophic effects on neuronal survival (15Oosthuyse B.

Because VEGF not only affects differentiated cell types but also adult precursors of several lineages including endothelial and neural progenitor cells, which express Flk-1, and hematopoietic stem cells, which express Flt-1 (18Rabbany S.Y.

Because ES cells constitute a potential renewable source of progenitors for tissue regeneration via cellular transplantation (21Czyz J. Wiese C. Rolletschek A. Blyszczuk P. Cross M. Wobus A.M. Biol.

Our findings indicate that ES cells during prolonged hypoxia produce elevated levels of VEGF and its receptors Flk-1 and Nrp-1 via mechanisms involving the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors. Using genetic and pharmacological analyses, we uncover a novel role for VEGF as a survival factor for ES cells in hypoxia. Targeted ES Cell Clones and Materials—ES cells deficient in VEGF (VEGF–/–), HIF-1α (HIF-1α–/–), or PlGF (PlGF–/–) were generated by homologous recombination and subsequent selection in high G418, as described previously (3Carmeliet P.

Mutation of the HIF-1α binding site in the VEGF promoter and generation of homozygous mutant (VEGFδ/δ) ES cells by selection in high G418 has been described in detail elsewhere (15Oosthuyse B.

VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-B), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and PlGF, and monoclonal antibodies against VEGF, bFGF, PDGF-B, IGF-1, EGF, or PlGF were purchased from R&D (Abingdon, UK). Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; ESGRO) was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen, HyClone (Logan, UT), and Roche Applied Science. Hypoxic Treatment of ES Cells—Undifferentiated ES cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks or 10-cm culture dishes on mitomycin C-treated embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 20 ng/ml LIF. ES cells were detached with 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA and seeded at low cell density (10,000 cells/35-mm Petri dish, precoated for at least 24 h with 0.2% gelatin) in culture medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml LIF and 5% fetal calf serum. After 24 h ES cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh culture medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum but without LIF was added. Experiments were performed in an incubator at 37 °C under normoxia (N) by maintaining the cells in 95% air and 5% CO2 or under hypoxia (H; 0.5% O2) by incubating cells in a humidified sealed chamber gassed with 0.5% O2,5%CO2, and 94.5% N2 (AGA, Lille, France) at a flow rate of 30 liters/h for 24 to 48 h. After incubation in normoxia or hypoxia for 24 or 48 h, ES cells were analyzed for apoptosis or used for Northern blot analysis as described below. Growth factors and antibodies were added to the culture medium as indicated. Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptosis of ES cells was measured (every 12 h) during a 24- or 48-h (prolonged) incubation with a photometric enzyme immunoassay (cell detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Roche Applied Science) for quantitation of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) (23Carmeliet P.

First, ES cells grown under normoxia or hypoxia as described above were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the floating dead cells. Subsequently, ES cells were detached and assayed for apoptosis, which was expressed as the average number of oligonucleosomes per 105 cells. Terminal deoxytransferase-mediated deoxyuridine nick end-labeling of cultured ES cells was performed using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Expression of VEGF, PlGF, and Their Receptors—VEGF in ES cell-conditioned medium was measured at the indicated times by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA isolated from 5 × 106 cells cultured for 24 h was prepared and hybridized as described previously (3Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L.

Hybridization probes were used for VEGF (a 655-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment encompassing the entire open reading frame of the murine VEGF188 isoform cDNA), for PlGF (a 1391-bp NotI-XhoI fragment, encompassing the entire open reading frame), for VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1 or Flt-1) (a PCR fragment encompassing nucleotides 421–1403 of the murine VEGFR-1 cDNA), for VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2 or Flk-1) (a PCR fragment encompassing nucleotides 3361–4440 of the murine VEGFR-2 cDNA), and for neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) (a PCR fragment encompassing nucleotides 358–761 of the murine Nrp-1 cDNA). Neuropilin-1 Overexpression in WT ES Cells—WT ES cells were electroporated with a plasmid bearing the human neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) gene under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter and the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene as a selection marker. WT ES cells transfected with a control plasmid only bearing the selection marker were used as controls. Overexpression of NRP-1 was quantified by reverse transcription-PCR as the number of mRNA copies per 100 mRNA copies of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Total RNA was extracted from ES cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following forward and reverse primer and probe (P), labeled with fluorescent dye (FAM or JOE) and quencher (TAMRA) as described previously (8Carmeliet P.

Expression of VEGF and Its Receptors by ES Cells and Up-regulation by Hypoxia—Undifferentiated wild type (WT) ES cells were found to produce detectable amounts of VEGF in normoxia, which were up-regulated when the cells were cultured in hypoxia (Table I). ES cells also produced the VEGF homologue PlGF, but its expression was not inducible by hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Hypoxic induction of VEGF was mediated via binding of HIF-1α to the HRE as both HIF-1α–/– ES cells and ES cells with a deletion of the HRE in the VEGF promoter (VEGF∂/∂ ES cells) were unable to up-regulate VEGF in response to hypoxia (Table I; Fig. 1, A and B).Table IVEGF secretion by ES cells in conditioned mediumTimeNormoxiaHypoxia (0.5% O2)WTVEGFd/dHIF-1α-/-WTVEGFd/dHIF-1α-/-h012 ± 311 ± 210 ± 212 ± 315 ± 210 ± 21214 ± 214 ± 511 ± 219 ± 511 ± 312 ± 32417 ± 412 ± 314 ± 532 ± 4ap < 0.05 versus 0 h.11 ± 311 ± 33619 ± 511 ± 213 ± 445 ± 6ap < 0.05 versus 0 h.13 ± 314 ± 24824 ± 4ap < 0.05 versus 0 h.9 ± 412 ± 255 ± 5ap < 0.05 versus 0 h.17 ± 614 ± 4a p < 0.05 versus 0 h. Open table in a new tab The survival function of VEGF for endothelial cells is known to be mediated via VEGF receptor type-2 (VEGFR-2; also termed Flk-1 or kinase insert domain-containing receptor) (25Gerber H.P. McMurtrey A. Kowalski J. Yan M. Keyt B.A. Dixit V. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30336-30343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 26Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that ES cells expressed VEGFR-2 and that expression of VEGFR-2 in WT ES cells was increased in response to hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Hypoxic induction of VEGFR-2 in WT ES cells was HIF-1α-dependent, since similar expression levels were detected in HIF-1α–/– ES cells in normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 1A). In contrast, hypoxic induction of VEGFR-1 (also termed Flt-1), was retained in HIF-1α–/– ES cells, whereas expression of PlGF, a Flt-1-specific ligand, was only slightly influenced by hypoxia (Fig. 1A). These data may reflect the differential roles of Flk-1 and Flt-1. Nrp-1, a selective receptor for the VEGF165 isoform is known to assist Flk-1 as a co-receptor (13Yamada Y. Oike Y. Ogawa H. Ito Y. Fujisawa H. Suda T. Takakura N. Blood. 2003; 101: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expression and potential role of Nrp-1 in ES cell survival was studied. WT ES cells expressed Nrp-1 in normoxia, and expression of Nrp-1 was increased in response to hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Hypoxic induction of Nrp-1 was blocked in HIF-1α–/– ES cells, indicating that HIF-1α was involved (Fig. 1A). ES Cell Apoptosis during Prolonged Hypoxia—To study whether VEGF affects survival of ES cells, we first optimized the experimental conditions to induce ES cell apoptosis. To quantify apoptosis the number of oligonucleosomes per 105 adherent cells was determined or the number of terminal deoxytransferase-mediated deoxyuridine nick end-labeling-positive cells was counted, yielding overall comparable results. ES cell apoptosis was found to be dependent on the cellular differentiation and on the duration and degree of hypoxia. When cultured in the presence of LIF, ES cells remained undifferentiated, as determined by their high nucleus-to-cytosol ratio and typical growth in small cell clumps. In contrast, when cultured for three subsequent passages without LIF, ES cells grew as monolayers of differentiated cells with flattened fibroblast-like appearance and a high cytosol-to-nucleus ratio. When undifferentiated WT ES cells were cultured for 24 h in progressively lower O2 concentrations, an increasing fraction of WT ES cells became apoptotic (Fig. 2A). In contrast, differentiated WT ES cells without LIF became resistant to apoptosis when cultured under low (0.5%) oxygen conditions for 24 h (not shown). After normoxia for 24 h, the number of oligonucleosomes per 105 cells was low (41 ± 5 with LIF and 31 ± 2 without LIF). When ES cells were cultured for 24 h at 0.5% O2, the number of oligonucleosomes per 105 cells was 340 ± 23 with LIF versus 52 ± 5 without LIF (p < 0.05 versus with LIF). Interestingly, ES cell apoptosis was also dependent on the duration of the hypoxic stress. Based on the finding that a fraction of undifferentiated WT ES cells became apoptotic when exposed to 0.5% O2 for 24 h, we had anticipated that longer periods of hypoxia would even further aggravate ES cell apoptosis. Surprisingly, however, the residual ES cells, which were still viable after 24 h of hypoxia, became resistant to apoptosis when stressed for another 24 h of hypoxia (i.e. from 24 to 48 h; phase B; Fig. 3A, solid line). This was not due to ES cell differentiation, as the colony morphology typical for undifferentiated cultures was retained. These data, therefore, indicate that a survival mechanism rescued the residual ES cells during prolonged hypoxia. Role of VEGF in ES Cell Survival during Prolonged Hypoxia; Pharmacological Evidence—Because VEGF functions as a survival factor for various cell types and is strongly induced by hypoxia in ES cells, we examined whether survival of WT ES cells under prolonged hypoxia was related to the hypoxic induction of VEGF. Supplementation of various neutralizing antibodies to the culture medium of WT ES cells, which were grown under hypoxia for 48 h, revealed that only anti-VEGF antibodies prevented survival of ES cells and maintained apoptosis during prolonged hypoxia (i.e. between 24 and 48 h) (Fig. 2B and Fig. 3A, dotted line). In contrast, antibodies against bFGF, PDGF-BB, EGF, IGF-1, or PlGF did not affect apoptosis (Fig. 2B), indicating that the survival activity was mediated by VEGF. Furthermore, apoptosis of WT ES cells cultured under hypoxia for 24 h was prevented by supplementation of culture medium, conditioned by WT ES cells under hypoxia for 24 h or for 48 h (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that the survival factor VEGF was secreted in the medium at significant amounts already after 24 h of hypoxia. Accordingly, only anti-VEGF antibodies inhibited the survival activity present in culture medium, conditioned by WT ES cells under hypoxia for 24 or 48 h (Fig. 2, C and D), confirming that VEGF was the survival factor secreted in the culture medium. Antibodies against bFGF, PDGF-BB, EGF, IGF-1, or PlGF did not inhibit the survival activity in culture medium, conditioned by WT ES cells under hypoxia for 24 or 48 h (Fig. 2, C–D). Moreover, recombinant VEGF165 inhibited apoptosis of WT ES cells both during short term (<24 h) and prolonged (>24 h) hypoxia, indicating that the VEGF-mediated survival signals overruled the death pathway in response to acute hypoxia (Figs. 3A, gray line and 2E). In contrast, the addition of recombinant PDGF-BB, EGF, IGF-1, or PlGF (Fig. 2E) was ineffective. Recombinant bFGF also rendered ES cells refractory to hypoxia-induced apoptosis, similarly as observed for VEGF (Fig. 2E). However, antibodies against bFGF did not affect survival of ES cells cultured under hypoxic conditions for 24 h with culture medium conditioned by ES cells under hypoxia for 24 h (Fig. 2C), whereas these antibodies also did not inhibit survival of ES cells cultured under hypoxia with medium conditioned by ES cells under hypoxia for 48 h (Fig. 2D). Therefore, endogenous bFGF is unlikely to contribute to the survival of ES cells during short term (<24 h) or during prolonged hypoxia (>24 h). Conversely, an immunoneutralizing antibody to VEGF maintained susceptibility of WT ES cells to apoptosis beyond 24 h of hypoxia (Fig. 3A; dotted line). These findings together with the observation that WT ES cells became refractory to apoptosis after 24 h of hypoxia suggested that VEGF was only produced at significant levels beyond 24 h. VEGF was indeed secreted at high levels by WT ES cells beyond 24 h and remained highly expressed during 48 h (Table I). Consistent with its inability to affect ES cell apoptosis during hypoxia, PlGF expression was not induced by hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Role of VEGF in ES Cell Survival during Prolonged Hypoxia; Genetic Evidence—To extend the VEGF immunoneutralization data, apoptosis was studied in ES cells lacking VEGF (VEGF–/–). VEGF–/– ES cells became apoptotic in response to short term hypoxia (<24 h), but in contrast to WT ES cells VEGF–/– ES cells remained susceptible to apoptosis up to 48 h of hypoxia, most likely because they did not produce the survival factor VEGF (Fig. 3B). The survival activity of VEGF was specific, as PlGF-deficient (PlGF–/–) ES cells became apoptotic in response to 24 h of hypoxia, but like WT ES cells PlGF–/– ES cells became refractory to hypoxia-induced apoptosis upon prolonged hypoxia (48 h) (Fig. 3C). The lack of an effect of PlGF on apoptosis in WT cells was not due to absent PlGF expression (Fig. 1A). Genetic Evidence for a HIF-1α → HRE → VEGF Survival Pathway during Prolonged Hypoxia—HIF-1α–/– ES cells were unable to up-regulate VEGF in response to hypoxia, consistent with the observation that hypoxic induction of VEGF expression is mediated by HIF-1α, more particularly via binding of HIF-1α to a specific HRE in the VEGF promoter (27Maxwell P.H. Ratcliffe P.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). ES cells in which the HRE in the VEGF promoter was mutated by gene targeting (VEGF∂/∂) could indeed not up-regulate VEGF expression in response to hypoxia (15Oosthuyse B. Moons L. Storkebaum E.

Genet. 2001; 28: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), similarly to the lack of hypoxic up-regulation of VEGF in HIF-1α–/– ES cells (Table I; Fig. 1B). VEGF∂/∂ ES cells became apoptotic during the first 24 h of hypoxia, and like VEGF–/– ES cells, remained sensitive to apoptosis during prolonged hypoxia (up to 48 h; Fig. 3D). Role of Neuropilin-1 in Survival of ES Cells during Hypoxic Stress—To study whether Nrp-1 plays a role in cell survival, WT ES cells were stably transfected with a plasmid containing the human NRP-1 gene (NRP-1+ ES cells), resulting in 30-fold higher NRP-1 expression levels than in WT ES cells transfected with a control plasmid (mRNA copies per 100 mRNA copies of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase: 0.86 ± 0.03 for WT ES cells versus 27 ± 6 for NRP-1+ ES cells, p < 0.05 by Mann-Whitney U test, n = 6). Because we anticipated that NRP-1 would enhance the VEGF-dependent survival effect, apoptosis of WT and NRP-1+ ES cells was studied at 24 h of hypoxia, i.e. at a time when VEGF levels were half-maximally elevated (Table I). NRP-1 expression levels determined the survival response of WT ES cells in hypoxia, since ES cells ove"

Under conditions of l-arginine or tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) depletion, nNOS also generates superoxide, O2·¯; however, the effects of methylarginines on this O2·¯ generation are poorly understood. Therefore, we measured the dose-dependent effects of ADMA and l-NMMA on the rate and amount of O2·¯ production from nNOS under conditions of l-arginine and/or BH4 depletion, using electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping. In the absence of l-arginine, ADMA (1 μm) inhibited O2·¯ generation by ∼60% from a rate of 56 to 23 nmol/mg/min, whereas l-NMMA (0.1–100 μm) had no effect. l-Arginine markedly decreased the observed O2·¯ adduct formation; however, O2·¯ generation from the enzyme still occurs at a low rate (12.1 nmol/mg/min). This O2·¯ leak is NOS-derived as it is not seen in the absence of calcium and calmodulin and demonstrates that O2·¯ generation from NOS occurs even when normal substrate/ cofactor levels are present. Under conditions of BH4 depletion, ADMA had no effect on O2·¯, whereas l-NMMA increased O2·¯ production almost 3-fold. This O2·¯ generation was >90% inhibited by imidazole, indicating that it occurred at the heme center. Thus, methylarginines can profoundly shift the balance of NO and O2·¯ generation from nNOS. These observations have important implications with regard to the therapeutic use of methylarginine-NOS inhibitors in the treatment of disease.

It was subsequently determined that these effects were mediated through inhibition of NO formation (1Hibbs Jr., J.B. Vavrin Z. Taintor R.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 550-565PubMed Google Scholar). This naturally occurring arginine analogue, together with its structural congener asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), form a pair of l-arginine derivatives with the ability to regulate the l-arginine:NO pathway. In fact, these two compounds, along with NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), have been shown to be potent inhibitors of NOS activity (2Cooke J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

It has been demonstrated that the methylarginine levels in isolated neurons and in the intact brain are sufficient to regulate NO production from neuronal NOS (nNOS) (4Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ADMA and l-NMMA are derived from the proteolysis of methylated arginine residues on various proteins. The methylation is carried out by a group of enzymes referred to as protein-arginine methyl transferases. Subsequent proteolysis of proteins containing methylarginine groups leads to the release of free methylarginine into the cytoplasm where NO production from NOS is inhibited (2Cooke J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2032-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 3Boger R.H. Vallance P. Cooke J.P. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 4: 1-3PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Leiper J.

In addition to inhibition of NO generation, methylarginines may have other important effects on NOS function. Our laboratory and several others have reported that when cells are depleted of the NOS substrate l-arginine, l-arg, or the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, BH4, NOS switches from production of NO to the superoxide anion radical, O2·¯ (6Pou S.

In the absence of either of these requisite substrates or cofactors, NOS-mediated NADPH oxidation is uncoupled from NO synthesis and results in the reduction of O2·¯ to form O2·¯ (6Pou S. Pou W.S.

O2·¯ exerts cellular effects on signaling and function that are quite different and often opposite to those of NO. Thus, O2·¯ is another very important NOS product, and its production may also be regulated by methylarginines. Furthermore, in view of their strong inhibition of NO generation, methylarginines could profoundly modulate the balance of NO and O2·¯ generation from the enzyme. Cytosolic l-arg concentrations are generally in the range of 50 to 200 μm, and moderate l-arg depletion has been observed in conditions such as wound healing and aging (4Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J.

The redox active cofactor BH4 has been shown to be highly susceptible to oxidative stress. Oxidation of BH4 has been shown to result in NOS-derived O2·¯ generation (9Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B.

However, little is known regarding the precise effects of methylarginines on NOS-derived O2·¯ generation. Although l-NAME has been shown to block O2·¯ production from nNOS, studies using l-NMMA have suggested that this endogenous methylarginine does not appear to inhibit O2·¯ generation (7Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L.

In addition, there have been no studies of the effects of endogenous methylarginines on the O2·¯ production that occurs in BH4-depleted enzyme. Therefore, critical questions remain regarding the fundamental effects of methylarginine analogues on NOS function and the process of O2·¯ release from the enzyme. Because the levels of the intrinsic methylarginines, l-NMMA and ADMA, have been shown to be sufficient to modulate basal nNOS function, (3Boger R.H. Vallance P. Cooke J.P. Atherosclerosis. 2003; 4: 1-3PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol.

Therefore, in the present study, we applied EPR spectroscopy and spin trapping techniques to measure the dose-dependent effects. of ADMA and l-NMMA on the rates and amounts of NO and O2·¯ production from nNOS under conditions of normal or depleted levels of l-arg and/or BH4. We observed that although both of these endogenous methylarginines inhibit NO formation, ADMA only partially inhibits O2·¯generation, whereas l-NMMA fails to inhibit and actually stimulates O2·¯ generation in BH4-depleted enzyme. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with nNOS were provided by the laboratory of Dr. Valina Dawson, Department of Neuroscience, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Unless noted otherwise, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma. d-NMMA was obtained from A. G. Scientific (San Diego, CA). Dowex was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chromatography columns were purchased from Evergreen Scientific (Los Angeles, CA). Centricon® concentrators were purchased from Amicon (Beverly, MA). The spin trap DEPMPO was purchased from Oxis (Portland, OR). The MGD was synthesized and iron complexes prepared as reported previously (21Wang P. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29223-29230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). nNOS Purification—Rat nNOS was purified from stably transfected human kidney 293 cells. These nNOS-transfected cells were grown in minimum essential medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were then harvested and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1.0 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol with 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μm leupeptin. After centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded on a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column. After washing the column with 0.45 m NaCl, nNOS was eluted with standard buffer containing 10 mm NADPH and concentrated using Centricon-30 concentrators. Excess NADPH, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 2-mercaptoethanol were removed by repetitive washing and 40-fold concentration with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 2 μm leupeptin. Concentrated enzyme was then stored at –80 °C in this buffer with the addition of 10% glycerol. Protein content was assayed by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of nNOS was >90% as determined by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (13Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). BH4 Depletion—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with rat nNOS were cultured in T-150 flasks at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2 95% air. After reaching ∼50% confluency, the cells were treated with 10 mm 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) for 72 h. At the end of this period, the cells had reached confluency and were prepared for nNOS purification as described above. Aliquots of the homogenate were prepared for BH4 determination. HPLC Measurements for BH4—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing ascorbate (1 mg/ml). Ascorbate was added to prevent BH4 auto-oxidation. 100-μl aliquots were loaded into microcentricon tubes with a molecular mass cutoff of 4 kDa. The samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The wash through was removed and subjected to HPLC analysis for determination of intracellular BH4 levels. The chromatographic system consisted of a Shimadzu pump with an ESA 7400 autosampler and a Toso Haas (Milford, MA) ODS-80Tm column (4.6 mm × 25 cm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size) reverse phase column. Electrochemical detection was carried out with an ESA coulochem 5600 with potential set at 0.4 and 1 V. Fluorescence detection was carried out at an excitation wavelength of 348 nm and an emission wavelength of 444. The mobile phase consisted of sodium acetate (6.8 g), citric acid (1.05 g), and EDTA (20 mg) at pH 5.8 adjusted with acetic acid with the total volume brought to 1 liter using HPLC-grade water. The mobile phase was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and dithiothreitol (24.7 mg) was added immediately before use. The mobile phase was degassed under helium during the chromatographic analysis with the flow rate set at 1.3 ml/min. EPR Spectroscopy and Spin Trapping—Spin trapping measurements of NO and oxygen radical generation were performed using a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer. The reaction mixture consisted of purified nNOS in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm Ca2+, 30 μm EDTA, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and 10 μm BH4 in 0.6 ml. For NO measurements, 5 μg of nNOS and 100 μm l-arg were added to the reaction system with Fe2+·MGD (0.5 mm Fe2+ and 5.0 mm MGD) used to trap NO, as described previously (22Xia Y. Cardounel A.J. Vanin A.F. Zweier J.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The samples were loaded into a quartz flat cell and measured at X-band in a TM110 cavity. Spectra were obtained using the following parameters: microwave power, 20 milliwatt; modulation amplitude,. 3.16 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz. For the detection of O2·¯, 5 μg of nNOS was added to the reaction system with 10 mm DEPMPO as the spin trap. Spectra were obtained using the following parameters: microwave power, 20 milliwatt; modulation amplitude, 0.5 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz. Quantitation of the free radical signals was performed by comparing the double integral of the observed signal with that of a known concentration of TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl) free radical in aqueous solution. To quantify rates of O2·¯ generation, adduct signals were corrected for trapping efficiency and decay rate as described previously (23Souza H.P. Liu X. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Laurindo F.R.

Citrulline Conversion Assay—nNOS activity was measured from the conversion of l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline as reported previously (4Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified enzyme (5 μg/ml) and cofactors were reacted with 5 μm l-[14C]arginine (317 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm Ca2+, 10 μm calmodulin, and 10 μm BH4 for 10 min at 37 °C and then stopped with 3 ml of ice-cold stop buffer using 20 mm HEPES with 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 5.5. Separation of l-[14C]citrulline from l-[14C]arginine was performed using the cation exchange resin Dowex AG50WX-8 (0.5 ml, Na+ form; Sigma). The l-[14C]citrulline in the eluent was then quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. Effects of Methylarginines on NO Release from nNOS—To determine the dose-dependent effects of ADMA and l-NMMA on the rate and amount of NO release from nNOS, EPR spin trapping measurements were performed on nNOS using the well characterized NO spin trap Fe·MGD. Purified nNOS (5 μg) was incubated in the presence of NOS cofactors and substrates (NADPH, calmodulin, tetrahydrobiopterin, calcium, and 15N-l-arg in concentrations as described under “Methods”). We have previously demonstrated that normal neuronal levels of l-arg are ∼100 μm (4Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33995-34002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A strong NO signal was observed exhibiting the characteristic doublet spectrum of the 15NO·Fe·MGD complex. Isotopically labeled l-arg was used to prove that the nitrogen was derived from the guanidino group of l-arg and also ensured that only the NO from nNOS was measured (25Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12705-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μm l-arginine, both ADMA (100 μm) and l-NMMA (100 μm) significantly inhibited, by 75 and 79%, respectively, the total amount of NO formation observed over 30 min from nNOS (Fig. 1). NO measurements were then performed using BH4-depleted nNOS. Under these conditions, as expected the enzyme generated almost no detectable NO (Fig. 1) because it has been demonstrated that the pterin cofactor, BH4, is required for NO formation from nNOS (10Vasquez-Vivar J.

Effects of Methylarginines on Superoxide Production in the Presence or Absence of l-Arg—To determine the concentration-dependent effects of ADMA and l-NMMA on O2·¯ production from nNOS, EPR spin trapping measurements were performed. Purified nNOS (3 μg) was incubated in the presence of NOS cofactors (NADPH, calmodulin, tetrahydrobiopterin, calcium) with or without l-arg. We have previously reported that in the absence of l-arg, NOS generates O2·¯. EPR measurements were carried out as described previously with the nitrone spin trap DEPMPO, which forms a stable O2·¯ adduct with a half-life of ∼16 min (24Roubaud V. Sankarapandi S. Kuppusamy P. Tordo P. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 257: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the absence of l-arg, nNOS gave rise to a strong DEPMPO-OOH signal characteristic of trapped O2·¯ (Fig. 2). The effects of ADMA on O2·¯ release, in the absence of l-arg, were then determined by adding varying concentrations of ADMA (0.01–100 μm). ADMA. (0.01–1.0 μm) dose-dependently inhibited NOS-derived O2·¯ generation with a 21% decrease in initial rate at 0.01 μm, a 45% decrease at 0.1 μm, and a 61% decrease at 1.0 μm ADMA, whereas above 1 μm no further inhibition was seen (Fig. 2). Experiments were then performed in the presence of l-arg (100 μm). Although l-arg markedly decreased the observed O2·¯ adduct formation, low levels of adduct formation were still seen, demonstrating that even in the normal state (in the presence of l-arg, as well as BH4), O2·¯ generation from the enzyme still occurs at a low rate (12.1 nmol/mg/min). This O2·¯ leak is NOS-derived as it is not seen in the absence of calcium and calmodulin, which are necessary for NOS activity (data not shown). The rate of this measured O2·¯ generation represents about 22% of that seen with l-arg depletion. These data demonstrate that there is significant O2·¯ generation from NOS even under conditions where normal substrate/cofactor levels are present. With addition of ADMA the level of observed O2·¯ production was not further inhibited (Fig. 3). Parallel experiments were carried out using l-NMMA to determine how this endogenous methylarginine modulates NOS-derived O2·¯ production. As previously reported, l-NMMA had no effect on O2·¯ generation in the absence of l-arginine (Fig. 4). However, with l-arginine present, l-NMMA at 100 μm resulted in a 44% increase in the rate of O2·¯ production (Fig. 5). Thus, from these studies it appears that the ability of l-NMMA to increase O2·¯ is a result of its ability to compete with l-arg, thereby partially blocking the prominent inhibitory action of l-arg on nNOS-derived O2·¯ generation.Fig. 5Effects of l-NMMA on NOS-derived O2·¯ in the presence of l-arg. EPR spin trapping measurements of O2·¯ production from nNOS were performed in the absence of 100 μm l-arg with the addition of l-NMMA (NMMA) (0.1–100 μm) and NOS cofactors as described in Fig. 1. The right panel shows the spectra observed after 30 min. The left panel shows the time course of NOS-derived O2·¯ generation determined from the observed EPR spectra recorded over a 60-min period in a series of experiments. Results graphed are the mean ± S.E. In the presence of l-arginine, NOS gave rise to a small signal compared with that in the absence of l-arg with both hydroxyl and O2·¯adducts seen. This reactive oxygen species generation was enhanced by high concentrations of NMMA (100 μm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thus, ADMA significantly inhibited nNOS-derived O2·¯ under conditions of l-arg depletion, whereas l-NMMA had little effect. These data suggest that ADMA, but not l-NMMA, inhibits O2·¯ formation by impeding electron transfer to oxygen, likely via its binding near the heme of the oxygenase domain. The bulky dimethyl group may extend to the vicinity of the oxygen binding position and impair oxygen binding to the heme, whereas the less bulky monomethyl would be less effective. Modulation of the Effects of Methylarginines on Superoxide Production by BH4—Like l-arg depletion, BH4 depletion triggers O2·¯ production from NOS. Therefore, experiments were performed to determine the effects of endogenous methylarginines on the process of O2·¯ formation from BH4-depleted NOS. Using DAHP, we depleted BH4 in nNOS-transfected 293 cells. To determine the extent of BH4 depletion and whether our enzyme was truly uncoupled, we performed HPLC and EPR experiments, respectively. HPLC with electrochemical and fluorescence detection was carried out to determine the levels of BH4 in the cells. Following 72 h of incubation with DAHP (10 mm), no detectable BH4 was measured: <0.05 μm, compared with levels of about 0.5 μm detected in normal untreated cells. NOS activity was measured on the purified enzyme using the l-[14C] arg to citrulline conversion assay, and >90% loss of NOS activity was observed. EPR spin trapping studies were performed using the NO spin trapping complex Fe·MGD. As shown in Fig. 1, there was almost no detectable NO generation from the enzyme prepared from the DAHP-treated cells, indicating that BH4 levels had been depleted sufficiently to inhibit normal NOS activity. The addition of exogenous BH4 fully restored NOS function, demonstrating that BH4 effects are reversible and do not otherwise alter the enzyme. To determine the effects of ADMA and l-NMMA on O2·¯ release from BH4-depleted nNOS, EPR spin trapping measurements were performed using the spin trap DEPMPO. Purified nNOS (3 μg) was incubated in the presence of NOS cofactors (NADPH, calmodulin, and calcium as described above) with or without the substrate l-arg. EPR measurements using the BH4-depleted nNOS gave rise to a strong. O2·¯ adduct signal (Fig. 6). The signal exhibited a rate of O2·¯ formation 68% greater than that seen with l-arg depletion using BH4-coupled nNOS, suggesting that NOS uncoupling through BH4 depletion results in an enhanced rate of O2·¯ generation and release from the enzyme as compared with l-arg depletion alone. The effects of ADMA on O2·¯ release were then determined by adding varying concentrations of the inhibitor (0.1–100 μm) (Figs. 6 and 7). Contrary to the previous experiments, ADMA had no effect on BH4-depleted nNOS regardless of whether the substrate l-arg was present or not. Because it has been previously reported (28Kotsonis P.

Surprisingly, when the experiments were repeated in the presence of l-NMMA, we observed an ∼2.6-fold increase in the rate of O2·¯ generation from BH4-depleted nNOS in the absence of l-arg (Fig. 8). The dextrarotary isomer of NMMA (d-NMMA) had no effect, demonstrating the specificity of this effect for the levorotary species. The increase in O2·¯ by l-NMMA was calcium- and calmodulin-dependent and almost totally (>90%) inhibited by imidazole, O2·¯ generation is the oxygenase domain. This effect was almost maximized at 0.1 μm l-NMMA with only a small further increase seen at 1 μm. Furthermore, in the presence of l-arg (100 μm), l-NMMA effects on O2·¯ were maintained. In the"

To identify the SeV protein(s) involved in mRNA cap methylation, we developed an in vitro assay system to detect mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase (G-7-MTase) activity. Viral ribonucleoprotein complexes and purified recombinant L protein but not P protein exhibited G-7-MTase activity. On the other hand, mRNA synthesis in a reconstituted transcription system using purified N-RNA (N protein-genomic RNA) complex as a template required both the L and P proteins. The enzymatic properties of SeV G-7-MTase were different from those of cellular G-7-MTase. In particular, unlike cellular G-7-MTase, the SeV enzyme preferentially methylated capped RNA containing the viral mRNA 5′-end sequences (GpppApGpG-). The C-terminal part (amino acid residues 1,756–2,228) of the L protein catalyzed cap methylation, whereas the N-terminal half (residues 1–1,120) containing putative RNA polymerase subdomains did not.

Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm synthesize capped mRNAs by their own transcription systems (reviewed in Refs. 1Banerjee A.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 175-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As in the case of eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 3Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1987; 34: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 4Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 1-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for cytoplasmic DNA viruses such as vaccinia virus and double-stranded RNA viruses such as reovirus, a γ-phosphoryl group is removed from the 5′-end of a nascent mRNA chain by viral RNA 5′-triphosphatase to generate a 5′-diphosphoryl-terminated acceptor RNA (ppN-) (1Banerjee A.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 175-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then a GMP moiety from GTP is transferred to the 5′-diphosphate end of the RNA by viral mRNA guanylyltransferase to produce the cap core structure (GpppN-) (1Banerjee A.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 175-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the methyl group is transferred to the guanine-7N position in the cap core structure from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; G-7-MTase, mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase; SeV, Sendai virus; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; cap-ribose MTase, mRNA (nucleoside-2′-O-)methyltransferase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PEI, polyethyleneimine; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. by mRNA (guanine-7-)methyltransferase (G-7-MTase) and also to the penultimate ribose-2′-OH position by mRNA (nucleoside-2′-O-)methyltransferase (cap-ribose MTase) (1Banerjee A.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 175-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, methylated cap structures, m7GpppN-(cap 0) or m7GpppNm-(cap I), are formed. Unlike cellular mRNA, the capping reactions of some viral mRNAs are carried out by unique mechanisms that differ from those of the cellular capping. For example, for plus strand RNA viruses within the alphavirus-like superfamily such as Semliki Forest virus, an m7GMP moiety of m7GTP, which is preformed by methylation of GTP, is transferred to the 5′-diphosphate end of the acceptor RNA to form a cap 0 structure (5Ahola T. Kääriäinen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which possesses a negative strand RNA genome and belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family of the order Mononegavirales, cap formation has been suggested to proceed through the transfer of a GDP moiety from GTP to the 5′-monophosphate end of the mRNA to form the cap core structure from the in vitro transcription studies with purified virions (6Abraham G. Rhodes D.P. Banerjee A.K. Cell. 1975; 5: 51-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Finally, the cap core is methylated at the ribose-2′-OH position and then at the guanine-7N position to generate the cap I structure (7Moyer S.A. Abraham G. Adler R. Banerjee A.K. Cell. 1975; 5: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Testa D. Banerjee A.K. J. Virol. 1977; 24: 786-793Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Horikami S.M. Moyer S.A. Proc. Natl.

Sendai virus (SeV), a prototype of the Paramyxoviridae family in the order Mononegavirales, possesses a monopartite negative strand RNA genome consisting of six genes encoding the nucleocapsid (N), phospho-(P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and large (L) proteins (reviewed in Ref. 10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott/Wlliams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1305-1340Google Scholar). The P gene also codes for C and V proteins (10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott/Wlliams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1305-1340Google Scholar). N proteins wrap the 15.3-kb RNA genome to form a helical nucleocapsid called the N-RNA complex, which serves as a functional template for transcription as well as replication (10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott/Wlliams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1305-1340Google Scholar). A viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex consisting of L and cofactor P proteins binds to the N-RNA complex to form the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which functions as a basal transcription apparatus (11Hamaguchi M. Yoshida T. Nishikawa K. Naruse H. Nagai Y. Virology. 1983; 128: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D.

The RNP contains about 30 L, 300 P, and 2,600 N protein molecules (14Lamb R.A. Mahy B.W. Choppin P.W. Virology. 1976; 69: 116-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). According to the 3′-entry model (10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott/Wlliams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1305-1340Google Scholar), the RdRp enters at the 3′-end of the genomic RNA and then initiates the sequential synthesis of a positive-sense leader RNA of about 50 nucleotides and at least six capped and polyadenylated mRNA species. During replication, a full-length positive-sense anti-genomic RNA is first synthesized from the genomic RNA, which is in turn used as a template for the synthesis of progeny genomic RNA (10Lamb R.A. Kolakofsky D. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott/Wlliams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 1305-1340Google Scholar). The mononegavirus L protein is believed to possess all enzymatic activities required for RNA synthesis (11Hamaguchi M. Yoshida T. Nishikawa K. Naruse H. Nagai Y.

Virology. 1988; 163: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and polyadenylation (18Hunt D.M. Hutchinson K.L. Virology. 1993; 193: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a protein kinase activity is thought to reside in the L protein (19Einberger H. Mertz R. Hofschneider P.H. Neubert W.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4274-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hammond D.C. Haley B.E. Lesnaw J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the precise enzymatic functions of the L protein remain to be studied. We established an accurate and efficient in vitro mRNA synthesizing system using purified SeV particles or RNP complexes (21Mizumoto K. Muroya K. Takagi T. Omata-Yamada T. Shibuta H. Iwasaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 22Takagi T. Muroya K. Iwama M. Shioda T. Tsukamoto T. Mizumoto K. J. Biochem.

Commun. 2003; 311: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Polyadenylated mRNA products synthesized from the isolated RNP complex contained cap structures, GpppA-, m7GpppA-(cap 0), and m7GpppAm-(cap I), suggesting that the complex possesses a capping enzyme system including mRNA guanylyltransferase, G-7-MTase, and cap-ribose MTase (22Takagi T. Muroya K. Iwama M. Shioda T. Tsukamoto T. Mizumoto K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here we developed an assay system to detect G-7-MTase activity associated with the SeV RNP or purified viral proteins independently of transcription. Our findings show that the SeV L protein is a viral mRNA-specific G-7-MTase, in which the C-terminal domain is responsible for G-7-MTase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first direct biochemical evidence to show that the Mononegavirales polymerase L protein catalyzes cap G-7-MTase activity. Preparation of SeV RNP-M, RNP, and N-RNA Complexes—The RNP-M (genomic RNA-N-P-L-M) and RNP (genomic RNA-N-P-L) complexes were prepared from SeV (Z strain) particles as described previously (23Ogino T. Iwama M. Ohsawa Y. Mizumoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The N-RNA complex lacking the P and L proteins was prepared from the RNP essentially as described by Udem and Cook (24Udem S.A. Cook K.A. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 57-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNP complex (1 mg of protein) was diluted in 5 ml of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% sodium lauroylsarcosine (Sigma) and CsCl to give an initial density of 1.29 g/cm3, and was centrifuged to equilibrium in a Beckman MLS-50 rotor at 90,000 × gav for 40 h at 20 °C. The nucleocapsid peak fractions with a density of 1.29–1.30 g/cm3 were pooled and diluted 10-fold with TE containing 500 mm NaCl. Then the N-RNA complex (180 μg of protein) was pelleted by centrifugation in a Beckman type 65 rotor at 80,000 × gav for 1 h at 4 °C and resuspended in 50 μl of TE containing 100 mm NaCl and 30% (w/v) sucrose. Expression and Purification of Recombinant SeV L and P Proteins— A136 and A50M cDNA fragments (25Kato A. Sakai Y. Shioda T. Kondo T. Nakanishi M. Nagai Y. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) derived from the SeV (Z strain) genome (GenBank™ accession numbers X00087 and X03614) were assembled and cloned into the pBluescript II KS+ plasmid to create a template for amplification of the L gene by PCR using ExTaq polymerase (Takara, Japan). To amplify DNA fragments encoding the wild-type L protein (1–2,228 amino acids) and its deletion mutants (1–1,120, 1,121–1,755, 1,756–2,228, and 1,121–2,228), the following sense (F, SalI site underlined) and antisense (R, KpnI site underlined and stop codon double-underlined) primers were used in various combinations: L1-_F, 5′-AGC GTC GAC ATG GAT GGG CAG GAG T; L1121-_F, 5′-AGC GTC GAC CCG GTG AAA GAC AAC ATC GA; L1756-_F, 5′-AGC GTC GAC GGT CTG ACG TTA CCA TTC GA; L-1120_R, 5′-GTG GTA CC T TAT TTC CTG AGA GTT CTA GTC A; L-1755_R, 5′-GTG GTA CC T TAA ACA CCT GAT CTG CCT ATC T; and L-2228_R, 5′-GTG GTA CC T TAC GAG CTG TCA TAT GGC T. The resulting PCR products were digested with SalI and KpnI and cloned into the SalI and KpnI sites of the pUC119 plasmid. The cloned PCR products were partially sequenced to ensure accuracy, and then their middle portions, which could not be sequenced, were exchanged for those from the original template cDNA by using restriction enzymes. The clones for the wild-type L protein, 1–1,120, and 1,121–2,228 were subcloned into the SalI and KpnI sites of a baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBacHis2 A-BSSK. This vector was constructed by inserting a double-strand oligonucleotide formed by annealing BSSK_F, 5′-GAT CCG TCG ACC CCG GGG GTA CCA (SalI and KpnI sites underlined), and BSSK_R, 5′-TCG ATG GTA CCC CCG GGG TCG ACG (KpnI and SalI sites underlined), into the BamHI and SalI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBacHis2 A (MaxBac Baculovirus Expression System, Invitrogen) to alter its multicloning site. The clones for 1,121–1,755 and 1,756–2,228 were subcloned into the SalI and KpnI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac-HTc (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System, Invitrogen). To produce a template for amplification of the coding sequence of P gene, SeV A7 and A21 cDNA fragments (25Kato A. Sakai Y. Shioda T. Kondo T. Nakanishi M. Nagai Y. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) were assembled and cloned into the pUC119 plasmid. To construct a baculovirus transfer vector for C-terminal His-tagged P protein, we first constructed an Escherichia coli expression vector for C-terminal His-tagged P protein. The P gene was amplified by PCR using the following sense and antisense primers: P_F, 5′-CCA GGA TCC ATG GAT CAA GAT GCC TTC AT (BamHI and NcoI sites underlined) and P_R2, GGT AGA TCT GTT GGT CAG TGA CTC TAT GT (BglII site underlined). The PCR products were digested with the NcoI and BglII and inserted into NcoI and BglII sites of the pQE-60 plasmid (Qiagen) to create a pQE-P-H vector. Next, to construct a baculovirus transfer vector for nontagged P protein, the coding sequence of P gene was amplified using the sense primer, P_F, and an antisense primer, P_R1, GGT AAG CTT CTA GTT GGT CAG TGA CTC TA (HindIII site underlined and stop codon double-underlined). The resulting PCR products were digested by BamHI and HindIII and inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of the pFastBac1 plasmid (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System, Invitrogen) to generate a pFastBac-P. Finally, a DNA fragment encoding a C-terminal portion of the P protein fused to a hexahistidine tag was obtained by digestion of the pQE-P-H vector with NdeI and HindIII. It was then inserted into the NdeI and HindIII sites of the above pFastBac-P vector to generate a baculovirus transfer vector for C-terminal His-tagged P protein (pFastBac-P-H). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing N-terminal His-tagged wild-type L protein (residues 1–2,228), its deletion mutants (residues 1–1,120, 1,121–2,228, 1,121–1,755, and 1,756–2,228), and C-terminal His-tagged wild-type P protein were generated using the respective transfer vectors for the MaxBac and Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression Systems (Invitrogen). Sf9 insect cells (1 × 108 cells) were infected with the respective baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of five plaqueforming units per cell and cultured in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fatal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) at 27 °C for 72 h. All subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. The baculovirus-infected cells were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The packed cell pellets (1.2–1.5 ml) were suspended in 10 ml of TMG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) containing 300 mm NaCl and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and the cells were disrupted by sonication. The disrupted cell suspensions were separated into supernatants (S15) and pellets (P15) by centrifugation at 15,000 × gav for 10 min at 4 °C. For purification of the His-tagged P protein, the supernatant fraction (S15) was mixed with 0.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-agarose resin (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with TMG containing 300 mm NaCl. Following successive washes of the resin with 5 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl three times and with 1 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole three times, the protein was eluted from the resin with 0.5 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole four times. For solubilization of the His-tagged wild-type L protein and its deletion mutants, the respective pellets (P15) were resuspended in 5 ml of TMG buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm PMSF and then sonicated several times. After centrifugation at 15,000 × gav for 10 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatants were incubated with 0.1 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resins. The resins were washed with 1 ml of TMG, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole three times, and then the proteins were eluted from the respective resins with 0.1 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole four times. The eluates containing the respective His-tagged proteins were pooled and then dialyzed against TEMG buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 5mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) containing 50 mm NaCl. Finally, 640 μg of the His-tagged P protein, 45 μg of the His-tagged wild-type L protein, and 20–70 μg each of the deletion mutants were obtained.

The PCR products were digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into the BamHI and SalI sites of the pQE-30 plasmid (Qiagen) to create a pQE-hCM vector. E. coli strain XL1-Blue harboring the pQE-hCM was grown in 800 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 28 °C until the A600 reached 0.6. After adding isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, the cells were cultured for another 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 20 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and then disrupted by sonication. Following centrifugation at 15,000 × gav for 20 min, the resulting supernatant (S15) was recovered and then incubated with 1 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose resin that had been equilibrated with TMG, 300 mm NaCl. After successive washes of the resin with 10 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl three times and with 2 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole twice, the protein was eluted from the resin with 1 ml of TMG, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole four times. The eluates containing the protein were combined and then dialyzed against TEMG, 50 mm NaCl. Finally, 1.8 mg of the His-tagged human G-7-MTase was obtained. Preparation of Capped RNA Substrates—Triphosphate-ended RNAs with 5 nucleotides were synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences) from synthetic DNA templates as described by Milligan and Uhlenbeck (27Milligan J.F. Uhlenbeck O.C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). To prepare the templates for T7 RNA polymerase, an oligonucleotide T7P(+) (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATA) corresponding to the T7 promoter sequence (–17 to –1) was annealed to each template oligonucleotide at the promoter region. The template oligonucleotides used to synthesize 5′-AGGGU, 5′-AGGGA, 5′-AGGAA, 5′-AGAAA, 5′-AAAAA, 5′-GGGGU, 5′-AAGGU, and 5′-ACCAA were as follows: 5′-ACCCT-T7P(–), 5′-TCCCT-T7P(–), 5′-TTCCT-T7P(–), 5′-TTTCT-T7P(–), 5′-TTTTT-T7P(–), 5′-ACCCC-T7P(–), 5′-ACCTTT7P(–), and 5′-TTGGT-T7P(–) (T7P(–) indicates 5′-TATAGTGAGTCGTATTA). After the transcription reactions, the transcription mixtures were treated with deoxyribonuclease I (Roche Applied Science). Then the RNA products were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. In Figs. 2, 3, 4, the transcripts containing RNAs with five nucleotides and unexpected sizes were used as capping substrates. In Figs. 5 and 6, the RNA products denatured with formamide were electrophoresed in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, and the RNAs with 5 nucleotides were eluted from gel slices in an elution buffer (1 m ammonium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% SDS). Then the eluted RNAs were recovered by ethanol precipitation and used as the capping substrates. The purified RNAs (20 pmol) were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with 40 μm [α-32P]GTP (2 × 105 cpm/pmol) and 0.2 μg of purified yeast capping enzyme (28Itoh N. Yamada H. Kaziro Y. Mizumoto K. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2057391792,"p73, a member of the p53 family of proteins, transcriptionally activates a number of genes involved in the control of cell cycle and apoptosis. Overexpression of p73 was detected in a large number of primary head and neck cancers, and in the established cell lines examined, these all contained inactivating p53 mutations. The significance of p73 overexpression in the pathogenesis of head and neck cancer is currently unclear. We have shown that the expression of adenovirus 5 E1A in a panel of head and neck cancer cell lines induces apoptosis independently of their p53 status. In this study we examined the role of p73 and its transcriptional targets in E1A-mediated induction of apoptosis. E1A expression resulted in significant activation of the TAp73 promoter but had no effect on the alternative, ΔNp73 promoter. E1A also increased expression of endogenous TAp73 mRNA and protein. E1A mutants lacking the p300- and/or pRB-binding sites showed reduced ability to activate the TAp73 promoter. Additionally, mutations in the E2F1-binding sites in the TAp73 promoter impaired activation by E1A. Importantly, expression of the 13S isoform of E1A substantially induced the p53 apoptotic target Noxa in several p53-deficient cancer cell lines. Our results indicate that E1A activation of p73 and the p53 apoptotic target Noxa can occur in the absence of a functional p53. This activation is likely to play a key role in the mechanism of p53-independent apoptosis induced by E1A in some cancers and may provide an avenue for future cancer therapies. p73, a member of the p53 family of proteins, transcriptionally activates a number of genes involved in the control of cell cycle and apoptosis.

This activation is likely to play a key role in the mechanism of p53-independent apoptosis induced by E1A in some cancers and may provide an avenue for future cancer therapies. The p73 gene, a member of the p53 family, is overexpressed in many types of cancer (for a recent review see Ref. 1Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The p73 protein shares 63% homology with the DNA-binding region of p53 with full conservation of all DNA contact residues. It also has 38% identity with the tetramerization domain and 29% identity with the transactivation domains of p53. However, in contrast to p53, human p73 transcripts result in multiple C-terminal splice variants, p73α to p73Φ. The p73 gene also has an alternative promoter within intron 3, from which a truncated p73 mRNA, known as ΔNp73, is transcribed. This form lacks the transactivation domain and acts as a dominant negative suppressor of p73 (2Grob T.J. Novak U. Maisse C. Barcaroli D. Luthi A.U. Pirnia F. Hugli B. Graber H.U. De Laurenzi V.

Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). p73 cooperates with p53 to induce specific targets such as PERP, Bax, and Noxa, which are involved in the p53-mediated induction of apoptosis. p73 has also been shown to be involved in p53-independent apoptosis induced by E2F1, because disruption of p73 function inhibits E2F1-induced apoptosis in p53-defective tumor cells and in p53-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (5Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 6Zaika A.

The p73 promoter is strongly activated in cells expressing exogenous E2F1 and suppressed by exogenous pRB (7Seelan R.S. Irwin M. van der Stoop P. Qian C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Liu W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several functional E2F1-binding sites are located upstream of p73 exon 1; two of these sites, located at positions -155 and -132, have been shown to be important in the E2F1-mediated transactivation of p73 (7Seelan R.S. Irwin M. van der Stoop P. Qian C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Liu W. Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 195-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of E1A to direct apoptosis is thought to be related to its ability to cause the release of transcription factor E2 from pRB (8Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).As discussed above, p73 transcriptionally activates target genes, some of which are also p53 targets, leading to apoptosis and growth arrest (1Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, heterozygous deletion of p73 has been found in neuroblastoma tumors, suggesting a role for p73 as a tumor suppressor gene (9Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A.

However, data from a wide range of human tumors and p73-deficient mice argue against a classical Knudson-type tumor suppressor role for the p73 gene (reviewed in Ref. 10Moll U.M. Erster S. Zaika A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 47-59PubMed Google Scholar). Only the wild type form of p73 has been identified in all tumors and tumor cell lines tested, and inactivating mutations in human tumors are extremely rare (10Moll U.M. Erster S. Zaika A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1552: 47-59PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p73-deficient mice lack a spontaneous tumor phenotype (11Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C.

Furthermore, overexpression of p73 has been shown with high frequency in human cancers (reviewed in Ref. 12Irwin M.S. Kaelin W.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar). Recently the oncogenic ability of p73 has been associated with the expression of ΔNp73, and this isoform has been shown to be up-regulated in a variety of primary tumors including cancers of the breast and genital tract (13Zaika A.I.

The E1A proteins, particularly the major ones of 289R and 243R, regulate transcription of both viral and cellular genes in adenovirus-infected cells. E1A activates the transcription of a number of genes including c-Fos, c-Jun, JunB, and c-Myc. E1A also represses the transcription of several cellular genes including, c-erbB2/neu (15Yu D. Suen T.C.

A number of studies have demonstrated the ability of E1A to induce cell death in a range of human cancer cell lines (15Yu D. Suen T.C. Yan D.H. Chang L.S. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4499-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Flinterman M. Ga ̈ken J. Farzaneh F. Tavassoli M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Expression of the 12S E1A is associated with the stabilization of p53, which was thought to be the cause of E1A-dependent apoptosis (18Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). We have shown E1A induction of apoptosis to be independent of the p53 status (16Flinterman M. Ga ̈ken J. Farzaneh F. Tavassoli M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Overexpression of E2F1, c-Myc, and E1A has been shown to result in the up-regulation of endogenous p73 proteins and activation of p73 transcription targets in p53-/- tumor cells (6Zaika A. Irwin M. Sansome C. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11310-11316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These data show that in the absence of p53, oncogenes can signal to p73 to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. In contrast, two recent reports have shown E1A to inhibit p73-activated transcription (19Steegenga W.T. Shvarts A. Riteco N. Bos J.L. Jochemsen A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3885-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Das S. El-Deiry W.S. Somasundaram K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An N-terminal deletion mutant of E1A, which does not bind to the p300/CBP family of co-activators, failed to inhibit p73-mediated transcription, suggesting that the transcriptional activation function of p73 is specifically targeted by E1A through a mechanism involving p300/CBP proteins (20Das S. El-Deiry W.S. Somasundaram K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18313-18320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).We have recently shown efficient induction of cell death by E1A of adenovirus 5 in a panel of head and neck cancer cell lines with mutated or deleted p53 (16Flinterman M. Ga ̈ken J. Farzaneh F. Tavassoli M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated whether p73 plays a role in the E1A-mediated induction of apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that E1A strongly activates expression of the transcriptional activating form of p73 (TAp73) but not the dominant negative suppressive form (ΔNp73). Both the p300- and pRB-binding sites of the E1A proteins seem to contribute to p73 activation, because mutations in these regions significantly reduced E1A-mediated transactivation of p73. In addition, the presence of both E2F1-binding sites in the p73 promoter seems to be required for efficient activation of the p73 promoter by E1A. This study also shows that the expression of E1A 13S strongly activates expression of the p53 apoptotic target gene Noxa in p53-deficient cell lines. In summary, our results demonstrate that in the absence of functional p53, E1A activates apoptotic pathways involving p73 and p53 targets such as Noxa.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Plasmids—Human HNSCC cell lines HN5, SCC25, HSC-3 and its metastatic match HSC-3 M3, HN30 and its metastatic match HN31 as well as non-small lung cancer cell line H1299, osteosarcoma Saos-2, neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa, normal human fibroblasts 1BR3, and human embryonal kidney 293A adenoviral packaging cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2.5 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml penicillin, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate, all purchased from Sigma. HNSCC cell lines H103, H357, and H376 were cultured in Nut mix (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 25 μg/liter hydrocortisone. Normal human keratinocytes Kf4 were cultured in collagen-treated wells in FAD medium (3 parts Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 1 part Ham's F-12 medium) containing 10% fetal calf serum, supplemented with 2.5 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml penicillin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 10-10m cholera enterotoxin, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. Cultures were grown in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator at 37 °C.PCR products encoding the various human adenovirus type 5 E1A isoforms were cloned into the pcDNA4-HA expression vector. E1A13S mutants with specific small in-frame deletions were similarly expressed from pcDNA4-HA (21Jelsma T.N. Howe J.A. Evelegh C.M. Cunniff N.F. Skiadopoulos M.H. Floroff M.R. Denman J.E. Bayley S.T. Virology. 1988; 163: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Three E1A conserved regions, CR1 (residues 1–82), CR2 (residues 93–139), and CR3 (residues 139–204) were expressed from pcDNA4-HA. The TAp73 and ΔNp73 luciferase reporter plasmids, pcDNA3.1-TAp73, and luciferase reporter constructs of p53/p73 target genes were provided by Prof. Gerry Melino. The TAp73PvuII minimal reporter luciferase construct and the E2F1 mutant constructs derived from the TAp73PvuII minimal promoter were provided by Dr. Wanguo Liu (Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Medical School, Rochester, NY). The pcDNA3.1-p53 expression construct was obtained from Prof. Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). pcDNA3.1 was purchased from Invitrogen. pTAT-GFP 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; CR, conserved region; DAPI, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; HNSCC, human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; MOI, multiplicity of infection; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; CBP, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein; PML, promyelocytic leukemia protein; TAT, transacting activator of transcription; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. and pTAT-E1A (13S) were obtained from Dr. Steven Dowdy (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA). The following replication-incompetent adenoviruses were used: Ad-E1A (dl324) containing functional E1A (both E1A12S and E1A13S) but with complete deletion of E1B and E3 (22Yan D.H. Chang L.S. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 343-345PubMed Google Scholar), Ad-Del (dl312) as a control containing a complete deletion of E1A and E3 (22Yan D.H. Chang L.S. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 343-345PubMed Google Scholar), Ad-p73 expressing TAp73 fused to GFP (obtained from Prof. Karen Vousden, Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, UK), and Ad-p53 expressing p53 fused to GFP (obtained from Prof. Bert Vogelstein).Adenovirus Amplification and Purification—Approximately 1 × 109 293A cells were infected with different adenovirus constructs. The cells were harvested when a complete cytopathic effect was observed, i.e. 95–100% of the cells were rounded and 5–10% were floating. The cells were lifted from the flask by pipetting gently and collected by centrifuging for 10 min at 200 × g. Purification and titration of the adenovirus was essentially done as described by Graham and Prevec (23Graham F.L. Prevec L. Murray E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology. 7. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1991: 109-123Google Scholar).MTT Cell Proliferation Assay—The cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 1.8 × 104 cells/well. The following day cells were infected with adenovirus at an MOI of 10 or treated with 1 μm TAT fusion proteins. Cell survival was measured by MTT assay as described previously (16Flinterman M. Ga ̈ken J. Farzaneh F. Tavassoli M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT in PBS was added to each well. Cells were incubated with the MTT solution for 2 to 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2; subsequently 150 μl of solubilization solution (50% dimethylformamide, 0.2% glacial acetic acid, 20 mm HCl, 20% SDS) was added to each well. The plates were incubated for a further 16–24 h at 37 °C, and the A595 was measured. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test.Protein Isolation and Transduction—TAT-E1A and TAT-GFP fusion proteins were isolated and purified as described previously (24Guelen L. Paterson H. Ga ̈ken J. Meyers M. Farzaneh F. Tavassoli M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, fusion protein encoding plasmids were transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). A single colony was expanded, and bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer Z (8 m urea, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0). The bacterial cell walls were disrupted by sonication on ice, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. TAT fusion proteins were isolated in Buffer Z supplemented with 10 mm imidazole by nickel ion affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in Buffer Z with increasing imidazole concentrations. Urea was eluted through PD-10 desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences) using PBS with 10% glycerol in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini Roche). The cells were seeded in Falcon 8-well culture slides and transduced at 50–80% confluence with TAT fusion proteins diluted in the culture medium.Transient Transfection and Fluorescence Microscopy—The cells were seeded in Falcon 8-well culture slides (Becton Dickinson) and transfected at 50–80% confluence with 400 ng of plasmid DNA preincubated with 1.4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™ reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Alternatively, they were transduced with TAT fusion proteins. The cells were washed in PBS and directly fixed in acetone for 20 min at -20 °C. TAp73 expression was detected with anti-p73 monoclonal mouse antibody clone GC15 (Oncogene), followed by horse anti-mouse Texas Red (Vector Laboratories). TAT-E1A was detected using anti-adenovirus type 5 E1A monoclonal mouse antibody clone M58 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and anti-mouse IgG (whole antibody) fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma). For detection of TAT-GFP and TAT-E1A the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and permeabilized 15 min in 0.2% Triton X-100. Subsequently, the cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) containing 2,4-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI), for the detection of cell death. The cells were visualized using an Olympus AX70 fluorescence microscope at high power (×1000).Analysis of Promoter Activation by Luciferase Assays—The cells were seeded at 1 × 105 per well in 48-well tissue culture dishes. At 80–90% confluence the cells were transfected with 100 ng of luciferase reporter plasmid and 300 ng of inducer expression plasmid, preincubated with 1.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty-four h post transfection the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed for 10 min in 40 μl of 1:1 Bright-Glo lysis buffer:Bright-Glo Luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The lysates were transferred to a 96-well plate, and luciferase activity was measured in a Wallac 1450 Trilux luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The experiments were carried out at least in triplicate, and the data shown are representative of at least two independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism software.Expression Analysis by RT-PCR—One day prior to infection with Ad-Del or Ad-E1A at an MOI of 5, the cells were seeded at 5 × 105/well in 6-well tissue culture dishes. At 24 h after infection the cells were harvested by trypsinization. Cell pellets were flash-frozen in liquid N2. Messenger RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was generated using the Superscript™ First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR and oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen). Specific cDNA strands were amplified by PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (HT Biotech). For the amplification of TAp73 cDNA, primers p73-F1 (5′-TCT GGA ACC AGA CAG CAC CT-3′) and p73-R1 (5′-GTG CTG GAC TGC TGG AAA GT-3′) were used. ΔNp73 cDNA was amplified using primers ΔNp73-F1 (5′-CGC CTA CCA TGC TGT ACG TC-3′) and p73-R1. GAPDH cDNA was amplified as an internal control for the RT-PCR procedure using primers GAPDH-F1 (5′-ACC TGA CCT GCC GTC TAG AA-3′) and GAPDH-R1 (5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′). Thirty cycles were performed consisting of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 58 °C, and extension at 72 °C (each step 30 s). For amplification of Noxa cDNA, primers Noxa-F1 (5′-AGG ACT GTT CGT GTT CAG CTC-3′) and Noxa-R1 (5′-GTG CAC CTC CTG AGA AAA CTC-3′) were used, and twenty-four cycles were performed, consisting of denaturation at 94 °C (30 s), annealing at 59 °C (30 s), and extension at 72 °C (1 min).Western Blot Analysis—The cells and tissues were washed in cold PBS and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfoxide). The lysate was passed through a 25-gauge needle and boiled for 4 min. Lysates were resolved by gel electrophoresis for 1.5–2 h at 100 volts on 6–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blotting was performed as described previously (25Sartor M. Steingrimsdottir H. Elamin F. Ga ̈ken J. Warnakulasuriya S. Partridge M. Thakker N. Johnson N.W. Tavassoli M. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for Western blot analysis were: mouse anti-E1A clone M58 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) in a 1:500 dilution, rabbit anti-PARP p85 fragment clone G734A (Promega) in a 1:2000 dilution, mouse anti-TAp73 clone GC15 (Oncogene) in a 1:100 dilution, mouse anti-TAp73 and anti-p53 clone X77 (gift from Prof. Thierry Soussi, Laboratoire de Génotoxicologie des Tumeurs, Institut Curie, Paris, France) in a 1:1000 dilution, mouse anti-p53 clone DO-7 (Nova Castra Laboratories) in a 1:1000 dilution, mouse anti-β-actin (Sigma) in a 1:500 dilution, rabbit anti-Cbl clone c-15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a 1:500 dilution, and mouse anti-Noxa clone 114C307 (Oncogene) in a 1:250 dilution. Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were used diluted 1:1000 and 1:2000, respectively.Flow Cytometry Analysis—5 × 105 HN5 cells were plated in 35-mm dishes and infected the next day with Ad-GFP, Ad-p73, and Ad-p53 at an MOI of 5. After 24 and 48 h, the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g together with the medium in which the cells were grown. The cells were washed in 2 ml of PBS and fixed in 2 ml of 70% ethanol. The cells were stored at -20 °C for a minimum of 1 h. Before analysis the cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 200 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of staining solution (40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 500 μg/ml RNase A in PBS). The cells were incubated 30 min at 37 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur.RESULTSE1A Induces Cell Death in p53-deficient Tumor Cells—The effect of E1A on cell survival of a panel of head and neck cancer cell lines including HN5, HSC-3, H103, H376, as well as non-small lung cancer H1299 cells, osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells, and 1BR3 normal fibroblasts was investigated. Triplicate cultures of cells were infected with replication-incompetent adenovirus that expresses both E1A12S and E1A13S isoforms (Ad-E1A) or an E1A deleted adenovirus as a control (Ad-Del). The cells were infected at an MOI of 10, and survival was measured by MTT assay after 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, in all of the cell lines a significant reduction in cell survival was observed in cells infected with Ad-E1A compared with cells infected with the control Ad-Del. Overall cell survival was reduced on average by more than 40% after Ad-E1A infection. More than 80% of HSC-3 and H376 cells were killed 48 h after Ad-E1A infection, whereas virtually all of the cells infected with Ad-Del were alive. On the other hand normal 1BR3 fibroblasts were not sensitive to E1A-induced cell death. In fact, these cells showed a significant increase (p = 0.0105) in cell survival after 48 h of infection with Ad-E1A compared with Ad-Del-infected cells.To verify that the cytotoxic effect of Ad-E1A was specific to the E1A protein and not due to other viral elements, we used a TAT-E1A fusion protein. This fusion protein contains an 11-amino acid positively charged peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR) that has been named a protein transduction domain and that is derived from the HIV-TAT protein. The TAT-protein transduction domain allows efficient and rapid uptake of the chimeric protein by cells both in vitro and in vivo (26Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar).Saos-2 cells were treated with 1 μm TAT-E1A or TAT-GFP (Fig. 1B). After 30 min of exposure TAT-E1A was detected in the cytoplasm of most cells. At 6 h after exposure TAT-E1A was translocated into the nucleus of some transduced cancer cells. DAPI staining of the DNA showed the appearance of apoptotic nuclei in cells that contained TAT-E1A but not TAT-GFP (Fig. 1B). Induction of cell death induced by TAT-E1A was further confirmed by MTT assay. Transduction of HeLa cells with TAT-E1A resulted in a significant decrease of cell survival (p < 0.0001), compared with HeLa cells exposed to TAT-GFP (Fig. 1C).We have previously reported that E1A expressed from an adenoviral vector is localized to the cytoplasm of normal fibroblast cells, whereas in tumor cells, which are sensitive to E1A-induced apoptosis, E1A expression is nuclear (16Flinterman M. Ga ̈ken J. Farzaneh F. Tavassoli M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar differences in the pattern of E1A localization was observed using the TAT-E1A fusion protein (data not shown).E1A Transactives TAp73 Promoter—Cell death induced by E1A was independent of p53 (Fig. 1), because all the cancer cell lines tested are known to contain either mutations or deletions in the p53 gene. We therefore examined the role of p53 family member p73 in E1A-induced cell death and analyzed the ability of E1A to transactivate the TAp73 promoter. As a result of alternative splicing, E1A is expressed as five isoforms shown in Fig. 2A. SH-SH5Y neuroblastoma cells with wild type but non-functional p53 (27Goldschneider D. Blanc E. Raguenez G. Barrois M. Legrand A. Le Roux G. Haddada H. Benard J. Douc-Rasy S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and HN5 cells with mutant stabilized p53 were co-transfected with plasmids encoding various E1A isoforms together with a luciferase reporter construct under the control of the TAp73 promoter. In SH-SY5Y cells the TAp73 promoter was activated 30- and 40-fold by E1A12S and E1A13S, respectively. Expression of E1A11S and E1A10S induced the TAp73 promoter 3–4-fold, whereas no transactivation was detected with expression of E1A9S in this cell line (Fig. 2B). In HN5 cells the TAp73 promoter was substantially activated by E1A11S, E1A12S, and E1A13S. The other E1A isoforms did not activate the TAp73 promoter (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that depending on the cellular background type, CR2 may co-operate either with CR1 or CR3 to induce E1A-induce"

This restrictive localization plays a key role in the regulation of the Ca2+-stimulable AC8 and the Ca2+-inhibitable AC6 by capacitative calcium entry. Interestingly, AC7, a Ca2+-insensitive AC, is found in the plasma membrane but is excluded from lipid rafts (Smith, K. E., Gu, C., Fagan, K. A., Hu, B., and Cooper, D. M. F. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 6025–6031). The mechanisms governing the specific membrane targeting of adenylyl cyclase isoforms remain unknown. To address this issue, a series of chimeras were produced between the raft-targeted AC5 and the non-raft-targeted AC7, involving switching of their major domains. The AC5-AC7 chimeras were expressed in HEK 293 cells and lipid rafts were isolated from the bulk plasma membrane by either detergent-based or non-detergent-based fractionation methods. Additionally, confocal imaging was used to investigate the precise cellular targeting of the chimeras. Surprisingly, the two tandem six-transmembrane domains of AC5 were not required for localization to lipid rafts. Rather, AC5 localization depended on the complete cytoplasmic loops (C1 and C2); constructs with mixed domains were either retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or degraded. Similar conclusions are drawn for the lipid raft localization of the Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulable AC8; again, the C1 and C2 domains are critical.

It is now becoming apparent that cell surface membranes are heterogeneous, containing “microdomains” of different lipid and protein composition, which are typified by lipid rafts (1Vereb G.

Lipid rafts are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, and they display a high concentration of signaling proteins, such as receptors, G-proteins, and effectors, including ion channels and adenylyl cyclases (ACs) (2Pike L.J.

Pharmacol. 2004; 143: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, by no means are all membrane-associated signaling proteins located in lipid rafts (4Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L.

Understanding how this differential PM localization occurs may illuminate the significance of this targeting.ACs are a class of integral membrane proteins that display heterogeneity in PM localization. There are nine membrane-associated AC isoforms that are regulated by a variety of factors, including phosphorylation, intracellular Ca2+, and GTP-regulatory proteins. AC1 and AC8 are activated by Ca2+ in a calmodulin-dependent manner, whereas AC5 and AC6 are inhibited by Ca2+, independently of calmodulin (6Cooper D.M.F. Karpen J.W. Fagan K.A. Mons N.E. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 23-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence from heterologous expression studies is beginning to suggest that Ca2+-sensitive ACs (specifically AC5, AC6, and AC8) are enriched in lipid rafts, whereas Ca2+-insensitive ACs (AC2, AC4, and AC7) (4Foster L.J. De Hoog C.L. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5813-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 7Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

This differential localization may be directly related to specific properties of AC regulation, since the residence of Ca2+-regulatable ACs in lipid rafts is crucial for their responsiveness to physiological elevations in cytosolic Ca2+. Specifically, the disruption of lipid rafts by depletion of cholesterol abolishes the regulation of AC6 and AC8 by capacitative calcium entry (CCE) (7Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F.

The significance of the presence of protein kinase C-stimulated but Ca2+-insensitive ACs (AC2, AC4, and AC7) in nonraft domains has not been addressed. However, it seems reasonable to speculate that differential PM localization may contribute to type-specific regulation of AC.The targeting of AC8 to the PM requires interactions between its two transmembrane domains (TMDs) (10Gu C. Sorkin A. Cooper D.M.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 185-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, constructs encoding separate transmembrane cassettes are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when expressed separately, but they are delivered to the PM when expressed together. However, nothing is known of the molecular determinants that target ACs to microdomains of the PM. In the present study, we sought to identify the structural elements of AC5 that determine its localization to lipid rafts. To address this issue, we generated a number of chimeric constructs between the raft-targeted AC5, and AC7, which is excluded from rafts, and examined the disposition of the chimeric forms when heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells. A nondetergent, sonication-based method for raft enrichment, combined with confocal microscopic analysis, was used to confirm the cellular localization of the chimeras. The presence of AC5-AC7 chimeras suggested to be in lipid rafts by the nondetergent method was also assessed by a raft preparation method involving cold extraction with the detergent, Triton X-100. Surprisingly, for an integral membrane protein, the targeting of AC5 to lipid rafts, generated by either detergent or nondetergent extraction, depended only on the cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2) 2Transmembrane ACs consist of a cytosolic N terminus followed by a six-transmembrane-spanning cassette (Tm1) and a large intracellular domain (C1a/b). This arrangement is repeated in the second portion of the molecule, with a second six-transmembrane-spanning cassette (Tm2) followed by a large C terminus (C2a/b). The C1a and C2a regions are the most conserved domains between ACs and combine to form the catalytic core (56Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The other regions of AC are less conserved between isoforms and are believed to be involved in the subtype-specific regulation. 2Transmembrane ACs consist of a cytosolic N terminus followed by a six-transmembrane-spanning cassette (Tm1) and a large intracellular domain (C1a/b).

The importance of the cytosolic domains was confirmed with AC8, which was also targeted to rafts. Combinations of half-molecules of AC8 lacking the cytosolic domains were enriched in nonraft domains of the PM, whereas combinations of half-molecules that included the cytosolic domains were delivered to rafts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Polyclonal caveolin antibody and monoclonal flotillin antibody were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Erembodegem, Belgium). Polyclonal AC7 antibody and c-Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Penta-His monoclonal antibody and Effectene were from Qiagen (Crawley, UK). Green fluorescent protein monoclonal antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Amersham Biosciences, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Promega (Madison, WI). Paraformaldehyde was obtained from TAAB Laboratories (Aldermaston, UK). Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Tissue culture medium was purchased from Sigma.cDNA Plasmid Constructs—The cDNA clones of rabbit AC5 (GenBank™ accession number Z29371) and bovine AC7 (GenBank™ accession number Z49806) were used to construct all chimeric constructs. The constructs AC7(AC5 Nt, C1, C2) and AC7(AC5 C1, C2) were as described earlier (11Seebacher T. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In AC5ΔC2b, the seven C-terminal amino acids, NGGPPLS, were removed, and in AC5(AC7 C2b) this stretch was replaced by the 13 C-terminal amino acids from AC7 (CTDTAKFQGLGLN). The reverse was generated with AC7; i.e. in AC7ΔC2b, CTDTAKFQGLGLN was removed, and in AC7[AC5 C2b] this stretch was replaced by NGGPPLS. AC7[AC5 C1a, C2] had the composition AC7–1 to 201-VD-AC5–406 to 645-TR-AC7–473 to 832-LE-AC5–1013 to 1264. The VD couple was used as a SalI restriction site and replaced EV or QD in AC5 or AC7, respectively. Similarly, TR was used as a MluI site for cloning purposes, replacing an LR or ID couple in AC5 and AC7, respectively. LE (XhoI restriction site needed for cloning) replaced VE or ID in AC5 and AC7, respectively. Otherwise, available restriction sites and standard cloning methods were used for generation of the chimeras. All constructs included a C-terminal -AAA-hexa-Myc tag (NotI restriction site ahead of the Myc tag) to be used for detection in Western blots. For expression, the clones were inserted into EcoRV/BamHI sites of the pIRES expression plasmid, except AC7, which for the purpose of immunoblotting was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/His B vector. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by double-stranded sequencing. The AC8 constructs were subcloned into N-terminal or C-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein vectors (Clontech) as described previously (10Gu C. Sorkin A. Cooper D.M.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 185-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Porton Down, UK) were grown in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were plated on 100-mm dishes at ∼70% confluence 1 day before transfection with 2 μg of cDNA using Effectene according to the manufacturer's procedures. Transiently transfected cells were used 2 days post-transfection. In addition, stably transfected HEK 293 cells were established by maintaining the cells in the presence of a 400 μg/ml geneticin sulfate (G-418).Nondetergent Isolation of Caveolar and Noncaveolar Membranes— Caveolar and noncaveolar membranes were isolated using a method that has been described previously (12Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK 293 cells were pelleted (195 × g, 5 min) and resuspended in ice-cold sodium carbonate solution (500 mm Na2CO3, 150 mm NaCl, pH 11.0) before sonication (Sonic Dismembrater; Fisher) at 4 °C, 30 s at setting 2, 30 s at setting 3, and 30 s at setting 4 with 3 min between each sonication (13Carey K.D. Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3185-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The suspension was transferred to a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer and homogenized with 20 strokes. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 60% sucrose in MES buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm Na2CO3, pH 6.4). The extract was placed below a 5 and 30% discontinuous sucrose gradient prepared in cold MES buffer and centrifuged in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 24,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Fractions (10 × 0.5 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient. The sucrose concentration of an aliquot (40 μl) of each fraction was measured in an Abbe refractometer. The remainder of the isolated fractions were diluted in 5 volumes of MES buffer and centrifuged in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The pelleted membranes were resuspended in 1% SDS containing 8 m urea, from which 30 μl was removed for protein determination (bicinchoninic acid assay kit; Sigma). Finally, samples were suspended in loading buffer (final concentration: 62.5 mm Tris, 150 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 8 m urea, and 0.002% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) heated to 42 °C for 5 min and stored at –80 °C.Detergent Isolation of Caveolar and Noncaveolar Membranes— Transfected HEK 293 cells were lysed using a modification of a glycerolstabilized lysis method (14Phillips D.R. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4582-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 15Caldwell K.K. Newell M.K. Cambier J.C. Prasad K.N. Masserano J.M. Schlegel W. Cooper D.M.F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The lysate from 2–3 150 × 25-mm dishes was adjusted to 3% sucrose, layered on top of a linear sucrose gradient (5–45%), and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm (1 h, 4 °C, SW28 rotor; Beckman Instruments). The PM appeared as a clear band around 30–37% sucrose, as described previously (16Nakahashi Y. Nelson E. Fagan K.A. Gonzales E. Guillou J.L. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18093-18097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The 30–37% sucrose fraction was pelleted in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 17,257 × g (20 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 1 ml of TNE (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined, and 100 μl of purified PM was mixed with 400 μl of TNE containing Triton X-100 at a 10:1 detergent/protein ratio, giving a final Triton X-100 concentration of 0.1%. The sample was homogenized with 20 strokes of a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer and left on ice for 30 min, followed by adjustment to 40% sucrose with the addition of 1 ml of 60% sucrose TNE. The rest of the procedure was essentially identical to that described for nondetergent isolation of membranes, except that TNE was the buffer used throughout the procedure. Pelleted samples were resuspended in 1% SDS and suspended in gel loading buffer (as described above but without urea).Immunoblotting Assays—Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE 7.5 and 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. (All AC5-AC7 gels were prepared with 8 m urea, since this reduced immunoreactive smearing and reduced adenylyl cyclase aggregation). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (TBS)) containing 5% skimmed milk powder for 30 min, followed by two 10-min washes in TBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS). Membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody (1:5000), anti-flotillin mAb (1:5000), anti-Gαs-olf polyclonal antibody (1:1000), anti-c-Myc mAb (1:1000), anti-GFP mAb (1:1000), or anti-penta-His mAb (1:2000) in TTBS containing 1% skimmed milk powder (antibody buffer). The membranes were washed (2 × 10 min) in TTBS and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution of stock) or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000) in antibody buffer for 1 h. Finally, the membranes were washed in TTBS (2 × 10 min), rinsed in TBS, and treated with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) (in detergent experiments, ECL plus was used) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue film.Immunofluorescence—HEK 293 cells (1 × 105 cells) were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips (22-mm diameter; BDH) and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then transfected with 0.4 μg of cDNA using the Effectene method described above. HEK 293 cells, which stably expressed the AC constructs, were also plated onto poly-l-lysine-pre-coated coverslips and grown for an identical period of time (i.e. 72 h). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 12.1 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm KH2PO4, and 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (1 h, 20 °C). After fixing, cells were washed further in PBS and permeabilized (1 h, 20 °C) with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% goat serum (blocking solution) and incubated (12 h, 20 °C) with anti-c-Myc mAb (1:300 dilution) or anti-AC7 polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution). After further washes in PBS (3 × 10 min), cells were incubated (1 h, 20 °C) with either Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (both 1:200) in blocking solution. Coverslips were mounted in Slowfade® light antifade (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's procedures, and the cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert LSM510 confocal microscope, using a ×63 oil immersion objective and a slice depth of 1 μm. The scale bar in all images represents 10 μm.Preparation of Crude Membranes—HEK 293 cells expressing the various AC constructs that were grown until 70% confluent in 100-mm diameter Petri dishes were detached with PBS containing 0.03% EDTA and centrifuged (195 × g, 5 min). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of HB buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg of DNase, pH 7.4) and lysed by passing the cell suspension through a 0.22-gauge needle 10 times. After further centrifugation (195 × g, 5 min) and dissociation, the lysate was centrifuged (17,257 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 25–500 μl of assay buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, 800 μm EGTA, 0.25% bovine serum albumin (fraction V), pH 7.4) and stored in liquid nitrogen until required.Measurement of Adenylyl Cyclase Activity—AC activity was measured as described previously (17Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 membranes (see “Preparation of Crude Membranes”) were incubated (20 min, 30 °C) in the presence of 12 mm phosphocreatine, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 40 μm GTP, 100 μm cAMP, 100 μm ATP, 25 units/ml creatine kinase, 70 mm Tris-Cl, 500 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP, 10 μm forskolin, and Ca2+ (see “Determination of Free Ca2+ Concentrations”). Reactions were terminated, and the [32P]-cAMP formed was quantified as described previously using [3H]cAMP as a recovery marker (7Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6025-6031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal.

Cooper D.M.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar) and the BAD4 computer program (20Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol.

Final assay mixture concentrations of Ca2+ (in the presence of 200 μm EGTA) are shown.RESULTSLocalization of AC5 in Lipid Rafts and of AC7 in Nonraft, Bulk PM—When heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells, Ca2+-regulatable AC8 and AC5 occur exclusively in lipid rafts, whereas the Ca2+-insensitive AC7 is found only in the nonraft, bulk membrane (7Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6025-6031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As a prelude to investigating the mechanisms underlying differential PM targeting of AC isoforms, HEK 293 cells were transfected with Ca2+-inhibitable AC5 (Myc-tagged) and Ca2+-insensitive AC7 (His-tagged), and their localization was examined. Transfected cells were fractionated using an optimized version of a described previously non-detergent-based method (i.e. sonication in sodium carbonate (see “Experimental Procedures”)) and sucrose gradient fractionation (12Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Ten equivalent volume fractions were collected from the sucrose equilibrium density gradient, and sucrose and protein concentrations were determined for each fraction (Fig. 1A). Compared with nonraft bulk membranes, lipid rafts have a higher lipid/protein ratio, permitting their isolation because of their increased buoyancy in sucrose density gradients (21Pike L.J. Han X. Chung K.N. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2075-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Caveolin, flotillin, and Gαs are specific raft marker proteins (22Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and their immunoreactivity was most pronounced in fraction 4, corresponding to ∼20% sucrose (Fig. 1, A and B). HEK 293 cells expressing Myc-tagged AC5 were fractionated, and Myc immunoreactivity was clearly enriched in the fraction that displayed the greatest immunoreactivity of raft marker proteins (Fig. 1B). Lipid raft microdomains also occur in Golgi membranes (25Gkantiragas I. Brugger B. Stuven E. Kaloyanova D. Li X.Y. Lohr K. Lottspeich F. Wieland F.T. Helms J.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1819-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and immunofluorescent confocal analysis confirmed that AC5 was localized predominantly at the PM and not in internal membranes in the majority of cells (Fig. 1B).The nonraft protein β-adaptin, a component of clathrin-coated pits, is excluded from buoyant membranes and occurs only in the bulk membrane. β-adaptin immunoreactivity, demonstrated that the nonraft, bulk PM corresponded to fractions 7 and 8 (Fig. 1C). These fractions sediment at ∼35–40% sucrose, and they account for the majority of the protein in the equilibrium density gradient (Fig. 1A). His-tagged AC7 was excluded from the lipid raft fraction and was detected only where β-adaptin immunoreactivity occurred (Fig. 1C). 3ACs tend to dimerize, and, at least in the case of AC8, this is mediated by the transmembrane cassettes (10Gu C. Sorkin A. Cooper D.M.F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 185-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Gu C. Cali J.J. Cooper D.M.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This property is extremely persistent, even in the presence of 8 m urea, and most likely accounts for the doublets commonly observed with AC immunoblots. Endoplasmic reticulum membranes also sediment at ∼35–40% sucrose; confocal analysis was therefore used to confirm that AC7 predominantly resided in the PM, with only weak intracellular labeling (Fig. 1C).Because AC5 and AC7 occurred in separate, identifiable domains of the PM, the region(s) involved in targeting AC to lipid rafts in HEK 293 cells could be explored by generating a series of chimeric constructs containing domains from AC7 inserted into AC5, Myc-tagged at the C terminus.The Transmembrane Domains and N Terminus Are Not Involved in AC5 Targeting to Lipid Rafts—The targeting of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor to lipid rafts has been described to be through the association of its transmembrane domains (TMDs) with cholesterol (27Liu P. Wang P. Michaely P. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31648-31654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Additionally, the localization of influenza hemagglutinin to rafts is abolished upon mutation of amino acids within the exoplasmic domain (28Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The two TMDs of ACs are poorly conserved between individual AC species, and it therefore seemed reasonable to consider that the TMDs might be important in membrane targeting. The TMDs of AC5 were exchanged with the corresponding regions from AC7. The resulting chimera (AC7[AC5 Nt, C1, C2]) (Fig. 2A) was expressed in HEK 293 cells, and its membrane localization was examined by the nondetergent method for raft enrichment. Surprisingly, AC7[AC5 Nt, C1, C2] with an approximate molecular Mr of 130 kDa, was clearly enriched in the buoyant membrane fraction (Fig. 2A). Additionally, confocal imaging demonstrated that AC7[AC5 Nt, C1, C2] was largely restricted to the PM (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that the cytoplasmic domains and not the TMDs of AC5 are important in raft localization.Fig. 2A role for the cytosolic domains, but not the N terminus or transmembrane domains, in AC5 localization to rafts. HEK 293 cells transfected with the indicated Myc-tagged AC5-AC7 chimeras were lysed and subjected to sucrose equilibrium density gradient centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions (lanes 3–8) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies raised against caveolin (cav) and Myc (α-myc). The same cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescent confocal imaging with an antibody raised against Myc. A, the TMDs of AC5 exchanged with the TMDs from AC7 (AC7[AC5 Nt, C1, C2]).

Here, we investigated the possibility that LPS transport proceeds via a soluble intermediate associated with a periplasmic chaperone analogous to the Lol-dependent transport mechanism of lipoproteins. Whereas newly synthesized lipoproteins could be released from spheroplasts of Escherichia coli upon addition of a periplasmic extract containing LolA, de novo synthesized LPS was not released. We demonstrate that LPS synthesized de novo in spheroplasts co-fractionated with the outer membranes and that this co-fractionation was dependent on the presence in the spheroplasts of a functional MsbA protein, the protein responsible for the flip-flop of LPS across the inner membrane. The outer membrane localization of the LPS was confirmed by its modification by the outer membrane enzyme CrcA (PagP). We conclude that a substantial amount of LPS was translocated to the outer membrane in spheroplasts, suggesting that transport proceeds via contact sites between the two membranes. In contrast to LPS, de novo synthesized phospholipids were not transported to the outer membrane in spheroplasts.

The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria consists of an inner (IM) 1The abbreviations used are: IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; OMP, OM protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid; ts, temperature-sensitive; SV, synthetic minimal medium.1The abbreviations used are: IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; OMP, OM protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid; ts, temperature-sensitive; SV, synthetic minimal medium. and an outer membrane (OM) separated by the peptidoglycan-containing periplasm. The lipidic components of the OM, phospholipids, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and lipoproteins, are all synthesized in the IM. Because of their hydrophobic lipid moiety, transport directly through the aqueous periplasm is thermodynamically unfavorable. Therefore, the transport process is expected to require a special machinery, including, for example, a soluble periplasmic chaperone that shields the lipid moiety. Alternatively, transport might proceed directly from IM to OM via a macromolecular complex bridging the periplasm. The existence of contacts between IM and OM has been reported previously (1Bayer M.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1968; 53: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). LPS can be divided in a hydrophobic lipid A part and a hydrophilic part, consisting of the oligosaccharide core and an O-antigen. In Escherichia coli K-12, lipid A consists of a glucosamine dimer substituted with, in general, six acyl chains. The core of the LPS consists of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues, which are attached to lipid A, and other sugars (2Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis is well described (2Raetz C.R. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar), and, recently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of its transport from the site of synthesis to its destination. The translocation of the lipid A core moiety of LPS across the IM requires the MsbA protein (3Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol.

When a temperature-sensitive (ts) msbA mutant was shifted to the restrictive temperature, LPS was found to accumulate in the IM (4Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MsbA is a transporter of the ATP-binding cassette protein family, and the presence of (Kdo)2-lipid A, a precursor of LPS, increased the ATPase activity of MsbA reconstituted in liposomes (6Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MsbA has been solved (7Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was recently shown that an OM protein designated Imp is required for the correct localization of LPS at the cell surface of Neisseria meningitidis. This protein is likely involved in a very late step in LPS transport, presumably the flip-flop from the inner to the outer leaflet of the OM (8Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). However, the transport of LPS through the aqueous periplasm remains enigmatic. Potentially, LPS could be transported across the periplasm in a way analogous to lipoprotein transport. The transport of lipoproteins, such as Braun's lipoprotein, also known as Lpp, to the OM is reasonably well understood nowadays. Lipoproteins are N-terminally lipidated (9Gupta S.D. Wu H.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 62: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after translocation across the IM via the Sec machinery and then recruited by the IM-located LolCDE complex, which, like MsbA, belongs to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily (11Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This complex utilizes ATP to enable the periplasmic chaperone LolA to form a complex with the lipoprotein (11Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After transport across the periplasm, lipoproteins are transferred from the LolA-lipoprotein complex to the receptor LolB in the OM (13Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated whether LPS can be released from spheroplasts by periplasmic components. However, we found that LPS is transported to the OM in spheroplasts, suggesting that transport proceeds via contact sites between the membranes.

To clone the crcA gene, a DNA fragment containing this gene was amplified from genomic DNA obtained from E. coli K-12 strain MC4100 by PCR performed in a volume of 50 μl with 1.75 units of Expand High Fidelity enzyme mix (Roche Applied Science), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 25 pmol of primers (Isogen) with the sequences AACATATGAACGTGAGTAAATATGTCG (NdeI restriction site is underlined) and AAGGATCCTCAAAACTGAAAGCGCATC (BamHI site is underlined). After initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C, 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C were performed, followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was cloned into pCRII-TOPO according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). From the resulting plasmid, pCRII-TOPO-crcA, an NdeI-BamHI fragment was cloned into pET11a, and from the resulting construct the sequence of crcA was confirmed. An XbaI-HindIII fragment from pET11a-crcA, including the ribosome-binding site of pET11a, was cloned into pMMB67EH, yielding pMMB67EH-crcA. Preparation of Spheroplasts—Cultures, pregrown overnight at 37 °C in either SV or LB medium for subsequent protein or LPS labeling, respectively, were diluted 10-fold in the same medium and grown to an optical density at 660 nm (A660) between 0.4 and 0.7. Cells from a 10-ml culture were converted to spheroplasts as described (16Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3973-3986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were pelleted and washed in 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.75 m sucrose and resuspended in 500 μl of the same buffer. Subsequently, 25 μl of lysozyme (2 mg/ml) and 1050 μl of 1.5 mm EDTA were added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 to 20 min. After this procedure, more than 99% of the cells were converted to spheroplasts as evaluated under a light microscope. Isolation of Periplasmic Fractions—MC4100 cells from five 1-liter cultures grown in LB at 37 °C to an A660 of ∼0.6 were pelleted and converted to spheroplasts as described above in a total volume of 1.2 liters. After removal of the spheroplasts by centrifugation in an SLA1500 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and of residual membranes by ultracentrifugation in a 60 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 38,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was concentrated to ∼15 ml in an Amicon 8400 concentrator using a 10-kDa cut-off polyethersulfone filter and nitrogen gas. The periplasmic fraction was finally dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 4 °C. Aliquots were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at –80 °C and used only once. Quantitative Western Blotting—A dilution series of purified LolA with known protein concentration was loaded as a standard next to a dilution series of periplasmic extracts on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After immunodetection with antiserum directed against LolA, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, H2O2, and 4-chloro-1-naphthol (18Foster R.G. Provencio I. Bovee-Geurts P.H. DeGrip W.J. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2003; 15: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the concentration of LolA in the periplasmic extracts was estimated by comparing the intensity of the bands with the standard. Spheroplast Release Assay—One-tenth of a spheroplast suspension was added to 375 μl of SV supplemented with 0.25 m sucrose. A concentrated periplasmic fraction (usually 50 μl), purified LolA (∼4 μg), or Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was added to the mixture. To label de novo synthesized proteins, the spheroplasts were incubated with 5 μCi [35S] cysteine/methionine (Promix label) for 3 min at 30 °C followed by a chase for 4 min with 2 μl of 0.1 m unlabeled cysteine/methionine. LPS and phospholipids were labeled by incubating the spheroplasts for 4 min at 37 °C with 2 μCi of [1-14C]sodium acetate, followed by a chase with 10 μl of 0.48 m unlabeled sodium acetate for 4 min. Alternatively, LPS was labeled by incubation of the spheroplasts with 2 μCi N-acetyl-d-[1-14C]glucosamine for 25 min. All radioactive compounds were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. After labeling, spheroplasts were chilled on ice for at least 1 min and centrifuged at 16,400 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge to separate the spheroplasts from the medium. Spheroplasts were resuspended in water, and hereafter, the proteins present in the spheroplast and supernatant fractions were precipitated by adding 0.10 volume of 70% (w/w) trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were resuspended in SDS buffer followed by immunoprecipitation as described (19Bosch D. de Boer P. Bitter W. Tommassen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against Lpp or OmpC and analysis of the precipitated proteins by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and subsequent autoradiography. Notably, spheroplasts lost the ability to release Lpp in the presence of LolA and of OM proteins (OMPs) into the medium if they were collected by centrifugation before the labeling procedure (data not shown). Purification of Radiolabeled LPS—E. coli O111::B4 cells were labeled overnight in 10 ml LB medium with 2 μCi of [1-14C]sodium acetate. Cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and LPS was extracted with the hot-phenol method (21Jann K. Jann B. Orskov F. Orskov I. Westphal O. Biochem. Z. 1965; 342: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS concentration was determined by measuring the Kdo content of the samples (22van Alphen L. Verkleij A. Leunissen-Bijvelt J. Lugtenberg B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1089-1098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isopycnic Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—After labeling for 1 min with 2 μCi of [1-14C]sodium acetate and a 30-min chase period with 15 μl of 0.48 m unlabeled acetate, cells or spheroplasts were resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Alternatively, 10 ml of mid-log cells were converted into spheroplasts as described and resuspended into LB containing 0.25 m sucrose (end volume of 22 ml). Spheroplasts or intact cells were labeled for 25 min with 80 μCi of [1-14C]sodium acetate. The cells or spheroplasts were broken by two 40-watt pulses of 10 s each using a microtip on a Sonifier B-12 (Branson Sonic Power Co.) and cooling on ice between the pulses. The sonicated samples were applied to the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient formed by layering sucrose solutions (buffered with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5)) into a centrifuge tube as follows: 2 ml of 56% sucrose; 4.75 ml of 42% sucrose and 4.25 ml of 25% sucrose (all w/w). After 22.5-h centrifugation at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C, 1-ml fractions were collected starting from the top (23Thom J.R. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5654-5661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity (24Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as an IM marker. The porins, visualized by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar), were used as a marker for the OM. LPS Analysis—LPS was routinely analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 14% acrylamide and subsequently visualized by silver staining (25Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar) and/or autoradiography. LPS from sucrose fractions was precipitated by adding 0.10 volume of 70% trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were resuspended in 160 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and lipid A was subsequently isolated as described (26Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43111-43121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The total amount of radioactive lipid A in each fraction was determined by scintillation counting in 5 ml of Lipoluma Plus (LUMAC) using a 1209 Rackbeta LSC (LKB Wallac) and/or analyzed by TLC as described (26Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43111-43121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Analysis of CrcA/PagP-mediated LPS Modifications—Cells containing pMMB67EH-crcA or the empty vector pMMB67EH were pregrown in LB medium at 37 °C, diluted 10-fold in 5 ml of LB containing 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce crcA expression, and grown for 80 min when the A660 reached ∼0.5. Hereafter, the cells were converted to spheroplasts. These spheroplasts or an equivalent amount of intact cells were resuspended into 3.75 ml of LB medium containing 0.25 m sucrose and labeled for 25 min with 20 μCi of [1-14C]sodium acetate at 37 °C. Pellets obtained from labeled cells or spheroplasts were resuspended in 160 μl phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Alternatively, pellets were resuspended, sonicated, and fractionated as described in isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation section. Phospholipid Analysis—Phospholipids were isolated from resuspended spheroplasts or medium fractions obtained after spheroplast release assays or from 200 μl of 1-ml sucrose fractions using a two-phase lipid extraction method (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The total amount of radioactive phospholipids was determined by scintillation counting in 5 ml of Lipoluma Plus (LUMAC) using a 1209 Rackbeta LSC (LKB Wallac). Phospholipids were routinely separated by TLC. The plates (silica gel 60, 20 × 10 cm, Merck) were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid at a ratio of 65:25:10 and subjected to autoradiography. Release of Lipoproteins from Spheroplasts—Previously, it has been demonstrated that de novo synthesized lipoproteins can be released from spheroplasts upon addition of concentrated periplasmic extracts containing the chaperone LolA (12Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Here, we wished to determine whether such extracts contain a chaperone for the release of LPS as well. Thus, concentrated periplasmic extracts were prepared as described and first tested for their activity in the release of Lpp. Indeed, de novo synthesized Lpp was released from the spheroplasts into the medium, specifically and efficiently, upon addition of either purified LolA or a concentrated periplasmic fraction (Fig. 1). With different batches of periplasmic extracts, the efficiency of Lpp release was variable (ranging from 30 to 80%). Quantification by Western blotting revealed that the amount of LolA in these periplasmic fractions correlated with their efficiency in releasing Lpp (data not shown). Thus, de novo synthesized Lpp was released from spheroplasts in a LolA-dependent manner. Failure to Release LPS from Spheroplasts—We subsequently investigated the possibility to release newly synthesized LPS from spheroplasts by addition of periplasmic extracts. Spheroplasts were incubated with [1-14C]sodium acetate to label, unspecifically, LPS. After labeling, the spheroplasts were separated from the medium by centrifugation and both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. All newly synthesized LPS remained associated with the spheroplasts both in the absence and in the presence of concentrated periplasmic fractions (Fig. 2). Even much further concentrated periplasmic fractions did not stimulate LPS release (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when LPS was specifically labeled with N-acetyl-d-[1-14C]glucosamine, a precursor of lipid A (data not shown). Since acetate enters the general metabolic pathway, also proteins were labeled with [14C]acetate. Several de novo synthesized proteins were released from spheroplasts even in the absence of a periplasmic extract (Fig. 2), consistent with the previously reported release of periplasmic proteins and OMPs from spheroplasts (28Sen K. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitation, one of the released proteins could be identified as porin OmpC (data not shown). At least two proteins, indicated with an asterisk in Fig. 2, were released only in the presence of periplasmic extract. Most likely, they represent lipoproteins. The results of these experiments suggest that LPS cannot be released (in a soluble form) from spheroplasts by periplasmic components. An alternative explanation could be that LPS after being released from spheroplasts forms aggregates that co-fractionate with the spheroplasts. To test this possibility, different amounts of purified 14C-labeled LPS were added to a spheroplasts suspension, and we investigated whether this LPS formed aggregates that co-fractionated with spheroplasts. However, after centrifugation, more than 98% of the labeled LPS molecules remained in the supernatant fractions. Therefore, we conclude that de novo synthesized LPS molecules remain associated with spheroplasts in the absence and presence of periplasmic components. Localization of de Novo Synthesized LPS in Spheroplasts—It has been described that part of the OM remains attached to the IM in spheroplasts (29Birdsell D.C. Cota-Robles E.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 427-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that LPS, synthesized de novo in spheroplasts, might still be transported to the OM. To investigate this possibility, pulse-labeled spheroplasts generated from strain MC4100 were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation. More then 90% of the IM marker lactate dehydrogenase was localized in the low density membrane fractions, whereas the porins were mainly present in the high density membrane fractions (data not shown). Also most LPS molecules, which were synthesized prior to the conversion of the cells to spheroplasts, were found in the high density membrane fractions when analyzed on a silver-stained gel (data not shown). Interestingly, the radiolabeled LPS molecules were equally distributed among the low density (inner) membrane fractions and the high density (outer) membrane fractions (Fig. 3). Apparently, a substantial proportion of the de novo synthesized LPS molecules was translocated to the (remnants of the) OM in the spheroplasts. The addition of concentrated periplasmic extracts during the labeling did not affect the localization of the newly synthesized LPS (data not shown). Inactivation of MsbA Prevents the OM Localization of de Novo Synthesized LPS in Spheroplasts—To exclude any artifacts in the procedure described in the previous section, we determined whether the OM localization of LPS in spheroplasts was dependent on the MsbA protein, which is required for the transport of LPS across the IM. When spheroplasts from the ts msbA mutant strain WD201 were labeled with [14C]acetate at the permissive temperature, the newly synthesized LPS fractionated mainly in the high density OM fractions in a sucrose gradient (Fig. 4), similarly as observed in spheroplasts from MC4100 (as described above). However, when the spheroplasts were labeled after 30-min incubation at the restrictive temperature (44 °C), the de novo synthesized LPS accumulated in the low density membrane fractions corresponding to the IM (Fig. 4). Newly synthesized LPS in spheroplasts generated from the isogenic wild-type strain W3110 that were similarly treated and labeled at 44 °C fractionated normally in the OM fractions of a sucrose gradient (data not shown). This demonstrates that LPS transport to the OM in spheroplasts is dependent on a functional MsbA protein as described previously and was confirmed in the present study (data not shown) for intact cells (4Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). De Novo Synthesized LPS Molecules Are Modified by CrcA in Spheroplasts—To confirm that LPS can indeed be transported to the OM in spheroplasts, we determined whether the OM protein CrcA could modify these LPS molecules. CrcA, also known as PagP, transfers a palmitate residue from the sn-1 position of a phospholipid to the N-linked hydroxymyristate on the proximal unit of lipid A (30Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). From its recently solved structure, CrcA was predicted to have its active site on the edge of the outer leaflet of the OM (31Hwang P.M. Choy W.Y. Lo E.I. Chen L. Forman-Kay J.D. Raetz C.R. Prive G.G. Bishop R.E. Kay L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To apply this approach, cells producing CrcA (CAG12077-pMMB67EH-crcA) or not (CAG12077-pMMB67EH) were converted to spheroplasts and labeled with [14C]acetate. Subsequently, their lipid A species were isolated and analyzed by TLC. Indeed, hepta-acylated lipid A species were produced abundantly in spheroplasts from cells expressing CrcA (indicated by arrows in Fig. 5), and these species were absent in those of the crcA disruption mutant CAG12077 carrying the empty vector (Fig. 5). The CrcA-modified lipid A species that were observed in the spheroplasts migrated to the same position as the lipid A species produced in labeled intact cells (Fig. 5). When these labeled spheroplasts were fractionated on a sucrose gradient, and the different fractions were analyzed for their lipid A species, the majority (>90%) of the CrcA-modified lipid A species was present in the high density OM fractions (data not shown), whereas the lipid A species in the IM fractions were not modified by CrcA. In conclusion, the results show that CrcA indeed modifies newly synthesized LPS molecules produced in spheroplasts. Since these modifications occur in the OM, these results confirm that LPS is indeed transported to the OM in spheroplasts. Transport of de Novo Synthesized Phospholipids Is Defective in Spheroplasts—In the previous sections, we demonstrated that LPS is transported to the OM in spheroplasts. We subsequently investigated the fate of newly synthesized phospholipids in spheroplasts. When intact cells of the msbA mutant WD2 were labeled at the permissive temperature of 30 °C with [14C]acetate, and the membranes were separated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation, de novo synthesized phospholipid molecules were found in both the low density (IM) and high density membrane (OM) fractions (Fig. 6). In contrast, in spheroplasts, the vast majority of de novo synthesized phospholipids localized in the low density membrane fractions (Fig. 6). Similar results were found when the wild-type strains W3110 and MC4100 were used (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the transport of newly synthesized phospholipids is defective in spheroplasts. Possibly, the transport of phospholipids to the OM requires periplasmic components analogous to LolA that were removed by spheroplast formation. To evaluate this possibility, we investigated whether phospholipids were released when spheroplasts were labeled in the presence of a periplasmic extract. However, these extracts did not enhance the release of phospholipids from the spheroplasts (data not shown). In addition, periplasmic extracts did not change the distribution of newly synthesized phospholipids between IM and OM of the spheroplasts (data not shown). Taken together, we conclude that phospholipid transport to the OM is defective in spheroplasts, where at least a significant proportion of the LPS molecules is still transported to the OM. Thus, LPS and phospholipids appear to have different requirements for their transport through the periplasm. The transport of lipoproteins from the periplasmic side of the IM to the OM via the Lol system has been characterized in considerable detail (12Matsuyama S. Tajima T. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3365-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Matsuyama S. Yokota N. Tokuda H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6947-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the possibility that LPS is transported to the OM via a similar mechanism, a possibility also suggested by others (see, e.g. reference (33Reuter G. Janvilisri T. Venter H. Shahi S. Balakrishnan L. van Veen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35193-35198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A putative periplasmic chaperone for LPS might shield the hydrophobic acyl chains of the LPS molecules from the aqueous periplasm by forming a complex that could traverse the periplasm and target to the OM. Our results demonstrate that LPS, in contrast to Lpp, could not be released in a soluble form from spheroplasts by periplasmic components. We expect that the periplasmic fractions were concentrated enough to contain sufficient amounts of this putative component. Since the OM contains much more LPS molecules than lipoproteins, one would expect this putative LPS chaperone to be at least as abundant as LolA. The latter was present in sufficient amounts in the isolated periplasmic fractions to release de novo synthesized Lpp efficiently. OmpA and the porins were released from the spheroplasts independent of the presence of a periplasmic extract. If LPS were released from spheroplasts, independent of a periplasmic chaperone, it would possibly form aggregates that could co-fractionate with the spheroplasts. However, this possibility is unlikely since purified LPS, added to spheroplasts, remained in the culture supernatant. Thus, it appears that LPS is not released from spheroplasts, neither in the presence nor in the absence of periplasmic extracts. This indicates that LPS is transported via a route different from that of lipoproteins as wells as from that of integral OMPs. Previously, electron microscopy studies showed that large parts of the OM remain attached to the IM of spheroplasts (29Birdsell D.C. Cota-Robles E.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 427-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), presumably via some sort of contact sites. When we localized the newly synthesized LPS produced by the spheroplasts, we observed that a large proportion of these LPS molecules co-fractionated with (remnants of) the OM. The distribution of the LPS molecules was not affected by the addition of periplasmic components. To demonstrate that the apparent OM localization of the LPS was not due to aberrant fractionation behavior of LPS-containing IM vesicles, we demonstrated that the transport of de novo synthesized LPS molecules to the OM in spheroplasts was dependent on a functional MsbA protein. Thus, it appears that transport of LPS in spheroplasts proceeds via the pathway that is normally used in intact cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the correct localization of newly synthesized LPS molecules to the OM of spheroplasts by demonstrating that these molecules were modified by CrcA in the OM. Together, this shows that transport of LPS is possible in spheroplasts, presumably via the contact sites between the IM and OM. Interestingly, a role for the zones of adhesion between IM and OM in the transport of LPS has been suggested previously, based on the observation that newly synthesized LPS molecules appeared at specific connection sites between IM and OM in freeze-etched Salmonella typhimurium (34Mühlradt P.F. Menzel J. Golecki J.R. Speth V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 35: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although the nature of such contact sites is unknown, they might be formed by proteins. Parts of the OM are known to remain attached to spheroplasts (29Birdsell D.C. Cota-Robles E.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 427-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), probably via such contact sites. Therefore, our results are consistent with the transport of LPS to the OM via the contact sites. In contrast to LPS, newly synthesized phospholipids did not fractionate with the high density OM in sucrose gradients, indicating that their transport is abolished in spheroplasts. It was proposed previously (4Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) that the transport of LPS and phospholipids share a common component at the level of the IM, MsbA. If phospholipids would subsequently continue on the same route of transport as LPS, we would have expected also phospholipid transport to occur in spheroplasts. Since this was not the case, the mechanism of phospholipid transport across the periplasm must be different from the mechanism of LPS transport. We also investigated the possibility that phospholipid transport occurs via a periplasmic chaperone, analogous to the lipoprotein chaperone LolA. However, we were not able to find evidence for a periplasmic chaperone that releases de novo synthesized phospholipids from the IM. Thus, the transport of phospholipids appears to have different requirements than that of LPS and lipoproteins. Future research must focus on elucidating the components involved in the transport to the OM of both LPS and phospholipids.

https://openalex.org/W2103403492,"Although the anti-inflammatory effect of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has been described, the contribution of this cytokine to cholesterol metabolism remains unclear. Our aim was to ascertain whether deficiency of IL-1Ra deteriorates cholesterol metabolism upon consumption of an atherogenic diet. IL-1Ra-deficient mice (IL-1Ra-/-) showed severe fatty liver and portal fibrosis containing many inflammatory cells following 20 weeks of an atherogenic diet when compared with wild type (WT) mice. Expectedly, the levels of total cholesterol in IL-1Ra-/- mice were significantly increased, and the start of lipid accumulation in liver was observed earlier when compared with WT mice. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that IL-1Ra-/- mice failed to induce mRNA expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, with concurrent up-regulation of small heterodimer partner 1 mRNA expression. Indeed, IL-1Ra-/- mice showed markedly decreased bile acid excretion, which is elevated in WT mice to maintain cholesterol level under atherogenic diet feeding. Therefore, we conclude that the lack of IL-1Ra deteriorates cholesterol homeostasis under atherogenic diet-induced inflammation.

When compared with other organs, the liver has one of the largest populations of macrophages, which are key components of the innate immune system. Resident hepatic macrophages, i.e. Kupffer cells, are derived from circulating monocytes that arise from bone marrow progenitors. Once localized within the liver, these cells differentiate to perform specialized functions, including phagocytosis. Kupffer cells also generate various products, including cytokines. These factors regulate not only the phenotypes of the Kupffer cells that produce them but also the phenotypes of neighboring cells, such as hepatocytes (1Laskin D.L. Weinberger B. Laskin J.D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 163-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many recent studies suggest that several proinflammatory cytokines produced by activated Kupffer cells might be involved in the onset of liver disease, including alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 1The abbreviations used are: NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; ACAT2, Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 2; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; Ct, threshold cycle number; CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; CYP27A1, sterol 27-hydroxylase; IL-1, interleukin-1; IL-1Ra, IL-1 receptor antagonist; IL-1Ra-/-, IL-1Ra-deficient; LRH-1, liver receptor homolog-1; SHP, small heterodimer partner 1; SR-BI, scavenger receptor class B type I; WT, wild type; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; HMG, human menopausal gonadotropin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.

Deaciuc I. Kugelmas M. Hill D. Semin. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and animal models of both NAFLD (4Fan J.G. Xu Z.J. Wang G.L. Ding X.D. Tian L.Y. Zheng X.Y. Zhonghua Gan. Zang. Bing. Za. Zhi. 2003; 11: 73-76PubMed Google Scholar) and alcohol-induced liver injury (6Thurman R.G Bradford B.U. Iimuro Y. Frankenberg M.V. Knecht K.T. Connor H.D. Adachi Y. Wall C. Arteel G.E. Raleigh J.A. Forman D.T. Mason R.P. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: e42-e46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to proinflammatory cytokines, anti-inflammatory cytokines are considered to have hepato-protective effects (5McClain C.J. Barve S. Deaciuc I. Kugelmas M. Hill D. Semin. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is one of the negative regulators to IL-1 signaling by binding and blocking the functional receptor (IL-1 receptor type-I) without activation (7Dinarello C.A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). IL-1Ra plays an anti-inflammatory role in acute and chronic inflammation (8Dinarello C.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 732-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). IL-1Ra is also produced by hepatocytes as well as macrophages/monocytes as an acute phase protein in vivo (9Gabay C. Gigley J. Sipe J. Arend W.P. Fantuzzi G. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently reported that IL-1Ra-deficient (IL-1Ra-/-) mice showed decreased weight gain when consuming the same amount of food as wild-type mice and that body lipid accumulation remained impaired even when they were fed a high fat diet (10Matsuki T. Horai R. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, the function of IL-1Ra in NAFLD is still not yet well understood. Atherogenic diet has been widely used to study atherogenesis in animal models. Early atherogenic diets contained high concentrations of cholesterol (5%) and fat (30%) either supplemented with cholic acid (2%) (11Thompson J.S. J. Atheroscler. Res. 1969; 10: 113-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or fed in combination with irradiation treatments (12Vesselinovitch D. Wissler R.W. J. Atheroscler. Res. 1968; 8: 497-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These early diets produced high mortality and were subsequently modified to reduce the concentrations of cholesterol (1.25%), fat (15%), and cholate (0.5%) (13Paigen B. Morrow A. Brandon C. Mitchell D. Holmes P. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 57: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Although this modified atherogenic diet produces an atherogenic lipoprotein profile and fatty streak lesions (14Paigen B. Mitchell D. Reue K. Morrow A. Lusis A.J. Leboeuf R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), it also induces inflammatory gene expression in the liver (15Liao F. Andalibi A. deBeer F.C. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that a fat-enriched diet induced NAFLD in animal models (4Fan J.G. Xu Z.J. Wang G.L. Ding X.D. Tian L.Y. Zheng X.Y. Zhonghua Gan. Zang. Bing. Za. Zhi. 2003; 11: 73-76PubMed Google Scholar). It is now well recognized that inflammation or cytokines increase serum lipid levels (16Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 17Khovidhunkit W. Kim MS. Memon R.A. Shigenaga J.K. Moser A.H. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1169-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). This increase in serum lipid levels can be considered part of the acute phase response that results in marked changes in the levels of a large number of circulating protein primarily due to alterations in the liver (18Macliewicz A. Kushner I. Baumann H. Acute Phase Proteins, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry and Clinical Applications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). However, the role of IL-1Ra on lipid metabolism remains poorly understood. To address the question more directly whether deficiency of IL-1Ra promotes development of NAFLD and changes lipid metabolism, we employed IL-1Ra-/- mice we had recently generated (19Horai R. Asano M. Sudo K. Kanuka H. Suzuki M. Nishihara M. Takahashi M. Iwakura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The present study aimed to definitively test the hypothesis that deficiency of IL-1Ra promotes NAFLD and alters lipid metabolism employing IL-1Ra-/- and wild type (WT) mice on atherogenic diet. Animals and Experimental Procedure—The creation of IL-1Ra-/- mice used in this study has been described previously (19Horai R. Asano M. Sudo K. Kanuka H. Suzuki M. Nishihara M. Takahashi M. Iwakura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In these mutant mice, the genes for all four isoforms of the IL-1Ra were disrupted. These mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J strain mice for eight generations. IL-1Ra genotyping was performed by a polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail DNA as described previously (19Horai R. Asano M. Sudo K. Kanuka H. Suzuki M. Nishihara M. Takahashi M. Iwakura Y. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1463-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). We used only male mice to rule out gender differences. IL-1Ra-/- mice and corresponding WT mice, derived by intercrossing WT littermates for knock-out, were studied at different times. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed a normal rodent diet containing 4.6% crude fat with less than 0.02% cholesterol (Clea Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Eight-week-old mice were switched to a high fat/cholesterol and cholate diet containing 15% total fat (8% cocoa butter), 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate (Clea Japan), hereafter referred to as the atherogenic diet. IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice were characterized immediately before and after consumption of the atherogenic diet for 1, 4, 8, and 20 weeks. The studies were carried out according to the protocols approved by the National Defense Medical College Board for Studies in Experimental Animals. Chemical Analysis of Serum and Tissue—On the day of analysis, food was removed from the cages in the morning, and the mice were fasted for 7 h. Blood was drawn from mice by cardiac puncture under light methoxyflurane anesthesia. Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and livers were immediately collected and weighed, and tissue samples were divided; some were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and others were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Blood was transferred into tubes, and serum was collected by centrifugation. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) determination was performed using a commercially available assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma diagnostic kit; Sigma). Plasma analysis of albumin and bilirubin levels was performed using a Paramax RX automated analyzer (Dade International). The plasma total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic assays as described previously (20Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, plasma lipoproteins were analyzed by an on-line dual enzymatic method for simultaneous quantification of cholesterol and triglycerides by HPLC at Skylight Biotech Inc. (Akita, Japan) according to the procedure as described by Usui et al. (21Usui S. Hara Y. Hosaki S. Okazaki M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 805-814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 200 μl of 20× saline-diluted sera was injected into two tandem connected TSK gel LipopropakXL columns (300 × 7.8-mm; Tosoh), and cholesterol and triglyceride contents in lipoproteins separated by size were determined by using enzymatic reagents specially prepared by Kyowa Medex (Tokyo, Japan). Total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations (in mg/dL) were calculated by comparison with total area under the chromatographic curves of a calibration standard of known concentration (22Okazaki M. Usui S. Hosaki S. Rifai N. Warnick G.R. Dominiczak M.H. Handbook of Lipoprotein Testing. Second Ed. American Association of Clinical Chemistry Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 647-669Google Scholar). Hepatic lipids were extracted according to the methods of Folch et al. (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was dissolved in 2-propanol and subsequently analyzed for total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and triglycerides using a commercially available reagent (TC kit, FC kit, and TG kit, Wako, Japan). Analysis of Fecal Bile Acids—Stools were collected from each animal over 72 h immediately prior to study, dried, weighed, and ground in a mechanical blender. Aliquots were taken for the measurement of total bile acid content by an enzymatic method as described (24Porter J.L. Fordtran J.S. Santa Ana C.A. Emmett M. Hagey L.R. Macdonald E.A. Hofmann A.F. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2003; 141: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The daily stool output (g/day/100 g of body weight) and fecal bile acid content (μmol/g of stool) were used to calculate the rate of bile acid excretion (μmol/day/100 g of body weight). Tissue Preparation and Histology—Livers were harvested, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in OCT compounds (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan), and sectioned (10-μm thickness). All samples were routinely stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Masson's trichrome, and oil red O. Analysis of Gene Expression by Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from each mouse liver using Tri Reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Quantitative gene expression analysis was performed on an ABI PRISM 7700 machine (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green technology. PCR primers (Table I) were designed using Primer Express 1.7 software with the manufacturer's default settings (Applied Biosystems) and validated for identical efficiencies (slope = -3.3 for a plot of Ct versus a log of ng of cDNA). In 96-well optical plates, 12.5 μl of SYBR Green master mix was added to 12.5 μl of cDNA (corresponding to 50 ng of total RNA input) and 300 nm forward and reverse primers in water. Plates were heated for 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C. Subsequently, 40 PCR cycles consisting of 15 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C were applied. At the end of the run, samples were heated to 95 °C with a ramp time of 20 min to construct dissociation curves to check that single PCR products were obtained. The absence of genomic DNA contamination in the RNA preparations was confirmed by using total RNA samples that had not been reverse-transcribed. 18S was used as the standard housekeeping gene. The ratio of target gene and 18S expression levels (relative gene expression numbers) was calculated by subtracting the threshold cycle number (Ct) of the target gene from the Ct of 18S and raising 2 to the power of this difference. Ct values are defined as the number of PCR cycles at which the fluorescent signal during the PCR reaches a fixed threshold. Target gene mRNA expression is thus expressed relative to 18S expression.Table IPCR primersForwardReverseACAT25′-GCCCCAGATTCTACAAGCAAGA-3′5′-TGTGGTAGATGGTTCGGAAATG-3′HMG-CoA reductase5′-TTTCTAGAGCGAGTGCATTAGCA-3′5′-GATTGCCATTCCACGAGCTATAT-3′18S rRNA5′-AGTCGGAGGTTCGAAGACGAT-3′5′-GCGGGTCATGGGAATAACG-3′CYP7A15′-GCTGAGAGCTTGAAGCACAAGA-3′5′-TTGAGATGCCCAGAGGATCAC-3′LXRα5′-GAGTTCTCCAGAGCCATGAATGA-3′5′-CATATGTGTGTTGCAGCCTCTCTA-3′SREBP25′-GTTCTGAGGAAGGCCATTGATT-3′5′-CCACATCACTGTCCACCAGACT-3′LDL receptor5′-CCAGTGTGACCGTGAACATGA-3′5′-TCCCCACTGTGACACTTGAACT-3′SHP5′-AGCTGGGTCCCAAGGAGTATG-3′5′-ACCAGGGCTCCAAGACTTCA-3′FXR5′-ATCTCCGCCGAACGAAGAA-3′5′-GGACCACGAAGATCAGATTGC-3′CYP27A15′-GCCTTGCACAAGGAAGTGACT-3′5′-CGCAGGGTCTCCTTAATCACA-3′LRH-15′-ACTGAGAAATTCGGACAGCTACTTC-3′5′-AGGTAGTCTTCTGCCTGCTTGCT-3′ABCA15′-CCCAGAGCAAAAAGCGACTC-3′5′-GGTCATCATCACTTTGGTCCTTG-3′SR-B15′-TTCAGGGCGTCCAGAA-3′5′-GATCTTGCTGAGTCCGTTCCA-3′IL-1Ra5′-CTTTACCTTCATCCGCTCTGAGA-3′5′-TCTAGTGTTGTGCAGAGGAACCA-3′IL-1 β5′-TGGTGTGTGACGTTCCCATT-3′5′-CAGCACGAGGCTTTTTTGTTG-3′CD685′-ATAGCCCAAGGAACAGAGGAAGA-3′5′-GGATGTAGGTGTCATCGTGAAG-3′TGF β5′-ACAAGGCTGCCCCGACTAC-3′5′-GTTGACTTTCTCCTGGTATGAGATAGC-3′ Open table in a new tab Statistical Analysis—The results are shown as the mean ± S.E. except the values of serum ALT, bilirubin, and albumin, which were determined using plasma pooled from groups of five mice. Two groups were compared using Student's t test or Student-Newman Keuls's test with the one-way analysis of variance. A value of p < 0.05 was regarded as a significant difference. Liver Size and Serum Transaminase—Analysis of livers of IL-1Ra-/- mice fed a standard laboratory rodent chow indicated that these mice appeared identical to those of WT mice as determined by morphological and histological studies (data not shown). We next tested the effect of an atherogenic diet (chow supplemented with 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate). In contrast to little changes in WT mice, there were dramatic morphological changes in the livers of IL-1Ra-/- mice fed the same diet (Fig. 1). Following 20 weeks of atherogenic diet, there was a prominent color and size change in the livers of IL-1Ra-/- mice versus WT mice (Fig. 1a). Four weeks after the start of the atherogenic diet, the liver weight to body weight ratios in the IL-1Ra-/- mice tended to become larger (but not significant) than those of WT (8.6 ± 0.9%, n = 5 versus 6.0 ± 0.6%, n = 5; p = NS; Fig. 1b). Following 8 weeks of the atherogenic diet, this parameter increased by 166% in IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with WT mice (15.7 ± 2.6%, n = 5 versus 5.9 ± 0.5%, n = 5; p < 0.05). Following 20 weeks of the atherogenic diet, the parameter increased ∼3-fold when compared with before atherogenic diet feeding in IL-1Ra-/- mice; however, the atherogenic diet caused only a small increase in liver weight to body weight ratios in WT mice (17.6 ± 2.4%, n = 5 versus 6.7 ± 0.6%, n = 5; p < 0.01). In conclusion, continued atherogenic diet caused significantly greater enlargement of livers in IL-1Ra-/- mice than in WT mice. As markers of liver injury, serum ALT, bilirubin, and albumin were monitored throughout the study. Before atherogenic diet, the serum level of ALT in both IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice was 40 units/liters. Following 20 weeks of atherogenic diet, the serum levels of ALT and bilirubin increased by 93 and 875%, respectively, in IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the serum level of albumin decreased by 28% when compared with WT mice (Fig. 1c). We detected moderate ascites in all IL-1Ra-/- mice but not in WT mice 20 weeks after the start of atherogenic diet. These data suggest that the atherogenic diet induces a more severe liver injury in IL-1Ra-/- mice than in WT mice. Histopathological Changes—Histological examination of livers from both mice demonstrated a time-dependent increase of the number and size of intracellular vacuoles, characteristics of lipid deposits (Fig. 2). These changes, however, were prominent in IL-1Ra-/- but not WT livers. Furthermore, following 20 weeks of the atherogenic diet, the morphology of the IL-1Ra-/- livers had been substantially altered, including extensive portal fibrosis and collagen deposition in a pericellular distribution in the lobule (Fig. 2b). Moreover, both lobular and portal inflammation was detected in IL-1Ra-/- liver (Fig. 2b). Oil red O staining of livers from both types of mice revealed that the deposition of neutral lipid increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3). However, the start of lipid deposition in IL-1Ra-/- livers occurred earlier when compared with the WT livers. Indeed, we could detect lipid deposits in IL-1Ra-/- liver after 1 week of atherogenic diet, with no deposits in WT liver. Furthermore, as expected from the gross morphology, neutral lipid accumulation was markedly more pronounced in the IL-1Ra-/- than the WT liver following 20 weeks of atherogenic diet. Alteration of Lipid Homeostasis in IL-1Ra-/- Mice—Following 4 weeks of the atherogenic diet, levels of total plasma cholesterol did not differ between IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice (224.9 ± 12.4 mg/dl versus 207.1 ± 20.5 mg/dl; n = 5: p = NS; Fig. 4a). However, after 8 weeks of the atherogenic diet, the levels of total cholesterol in IL-1Ra-/- mice increased by 198% when compared with WT mice (610 ± 224 mg/dl, versus 205 ± 12 mg/dl; n = 5; p < 0.05). After 20 weeks of atherogenic diet, moreover, the total cholesterol levels increased significantly in IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with WT mice (942 ± 160 mg/dl versus 240 ± 13 mg/dl, n = 5; p < 0.01). High resolution HPLC analysis of plasma lipoproteins following 4 weeks of the atherogenic diet revealed no significant differences in the levels of chylomicron-, VLDL-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol between the IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice (Fig. 4, b and c). However, after 20 weeks of atherogenic diet, HPLC analysis revealed markedly increased cholesterol levels in the VLDL and LDL fractions in the IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with the WT mice. The cholesterol levels in the VLDL and LDL fractions were 699 ± 126 mg/dl (n = 5, p < 0.01) and 192 ± 36 mg/dl (n = 5, p < 0.01), respectively in IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with 136 ± 7 mg/dl (n = 5) and 50 ± 4 mg/dl (n = 5), respectively, in the WT mice. In contrast, levels of HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in IL-1Ra-/- mice (31 ± 10 mg/dl, n = 5) when compared with those in WT mice (54 ± 3 mg/dl, n = 5; p < 0.05; Fig. 4, b and c). The hepatic cholesterol levels of both mice showed a time-dependent increase (Fig. 5). However, these changes were more prominent in the liver of IL-1Ra-/- than in WT mice, and the difference between these mice increased with prolonged diet. In agreement with the enlarged liver and distinct color change, hepatic cholesterol was significantly increased in IL-1Ra-/- mice after 20 weeks of the atherogenic diet regimen. No significant differences were observed for hepatic triglyceride levels between the IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice. The major component of hepatic cholesterol in both genotypes was cholesterol ester. Alteration of Bile Acids and Cholesterol Metabolism in IL-1Ra-/- Mice—The primary route of cholesterol elimination from the body is via bile, which is based on conversion of hepatic cholesterol to bile acids. Fecal bile acid excretion of WT mice increased with the duration of atherogenic diet; however, in IL-1Ra-/- mice, bile acid excretion was increasingly impaired under continued atherogenic diet (Fig. 6). Alteration of mRNA Expressions in IL-1Ra-/- Mice—Analyses of mRNA expression of genes involved in cytokine, monocyte activation, and the regulation of cholesterol, fatty acid, and bile acid metabolism were performed to identify pathways potentially responsible for the observed alterations in IL-1Ra-/- mice. Real-time PCR employed mRNA extracted from livers of both mice (Fig. 7). Prior to the start of the atherogenic diet (0 week), expression levels of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in IL-1Ra-/- mice were 30% lower than those in WT mice (p < 0.05; Fig. 7a). After 1 and 4 weeks of atherogenic diet, CYP7A1 expression decreased in both mice; however, transcript levels in IL-1Ra-/- mice were markedly lower (or absent). These results suggest that bile acid biosynthesis in IL-1Ra-/- mice might be attenuated as early as 1 week after the start of the atherogenic diet regimen. Although a previous study showed that lipopolysaccharide suppresses both CYP7A1 and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) (25Memon R.A. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30118-30126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), expression levels of CYP27A1 in both IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice decreased after 1 week of the atherogenic diet, and there was no significant difference between these two groups (Fig. 7c). Although atherogenic diet increased small heterodimer partner 1 (SHP) mRNA in both mice, expression was 1.8-fold higher (p < 0.01) after 1 week and 3-fold higher (p < 0.001) after 4 weeks of the atherogenic diet in IL-1Ra-/- when compared with WT mice (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, expression of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) increased in both mice after 4 weeks of atherogenic diet; however, a 1.8-fold higher (p < 0.05) increase was observed in IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with WT mice (Fig. 7c). Moreover, after 1 week of the atherogenic diet, mRNA expression of Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) was only marginally if at all increased in the IL-1Ra-/- mice, whereas a 2-fold increased level was observed after 4 weeks of the atherogenic diet (p < 0.05;Fig. 7a). In contrast, no differences were observed in hepatic expression of LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, SREBP2, nuclear liver X-receptor α, and farnesoid X-receptor between IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice. Furthermore, hepatic expression of the HDL-cholesterol regulatory genes ATP binding cassette-A1 (ABCA1) and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) did not differ between IL-1Ra-/- and WT mice. IL-1Ra, as expected, was absent in IL-1Ra-/- mice, whereas the expression level of IL-1β in IL-1Ra-/- mice was significantly elevated even before atherogenic diet (p < 0.05) and more than 10-fold (p < 0.001) up-regulated following 4 weeks of the atherogenic diet (Fig. 7d). Moreover, 4 weeks of atherogenic diet increased transforming growth factor-β (4.5-fold, p < 0.01) and CD68 (7-fold, p < 0.01) in the IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with WT mice. The present study demonstrates that IL-1Ra-/- mice develop severe NAFLD and portal fibrosis with many inflammatory cells following 20 weeks of the atherogenic diet when compared with WT mice. We also found that mRNA levels of IL-1β and transforming growth factor-β were significantly elevated in livers of IL-1Ra-/- mice. These findings are in accord with several previous studies implicating cytokine imbalances in murine models of NAFLD (4Fan J.G. Xu Z.J. Wang G.L. Ding X.D. Tian L.Y. Zheng X.Y. Zhonghua Gan. Zang. Bing. Za. Zhi. 2003; 11: 73-76PubMed Google Scholar) and fibrosis (26Baroni G.S. D'Ambrosio L. Curto P. Casini A. Mancini R. Jezequel A.M. Benedetti A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Boros D.L. Whitfield J.R. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that cytokines, such as IL-1β, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and hepatic fibrosis. In our IL-1Ra-/- mice, excessive IL-1 signaling may induce inflammation in the liver and, thus, the IL-1 system might play a role in the development of NAFLD and fibrosis. The atherogenic diet we used in this study appears associated with these dramatic changes in the livers of IL-1Ra-/- mice, corroborating a recent study showing that high cholesterol levels induce expression of several genes involved in acute inflammation and that cholate induces expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix deposition in hepatic fibrosis (28Vergnes L. Phan J. Strauss M. Tafuri S. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42774-42784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Expectedly, the levels of total cholesterol in IL-1Ra-/- mice were significantly higher, and the start of lipid deposition in livers of IL-1Ra-/- mice was observed earlier than in WT mice. These results suggest that deficiency of IL-1Ra yields abnormal lipid metabolism upon feeding on atherogenic diet. The primary route of cholesterol elimination from the body is via bile, based on both direct canalicular excretion of biliary cholesterol as well as conversion of hepatic cholesterol to bile acids (29Vlahcevic Z.R. Stravitz R.T. Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Pandak W.M. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1949-1957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In our study, WT but not IL-1Ra-/- mice demonstrated increased bile acid excretion to maintain physiological cholesterol levels, suggesting that impairment of bile acid excretion yields significant cholesterol accumulation in response to atherogenic diet in IL-1Ra-/- mice. In our study, a 2-fold increase in mRNA level of ACAT2 was observed in the IL-1Ra-/- mice when compared with WT mice after 4 weeks. ACAT2 is thought to function in intestinal cholesterol absorption and transport into chylomicrons as well as in providing cholesteryl esters for VLDL assembly in the liver. Indeed, ACAT2-deficient mice have reduced cholesterol absorption and are resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia by a high fat, high cholesterol diet (30Buhman K.F. Accad M. Novak S. Choi R.S.

When Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably expressing nectin-1 (nectin-1-MDCK cells) are cultured at normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, E-cadherin and nectin-1 are concentrated at the cell-cell contact sites. When these cells are cultured at low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, E-cadherin disappears from the cell-cell contact sites, but nectin-1 persists there. When these cells are re-cultured at normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, E-cadherin is recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites. We found here that this recruitment was dependent on protein synthesis, because a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, prevented the accumulation of E-cadherin. When nectin-1-MDCK cells, precultured at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, ALLN (<i>N</i>-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal), were re-cultured at normal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, E-cadherin was recruited to the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites but the level of E-cadherin was reduced. Similar results were obtained when wild-type MDCK cells were used instead of nectin-1-MDCK cells. These results suggest that degradation of one or more protein factors and <i>de novo</i> synthesis of the same or different protein factor(s) are needed for the formation of the E-cadherin-based AJs. We biochemically identified the annexin II-S100A10 complex as such a candidate. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol, which abolished the localization of the annexin II-S100A10 complex at the plasma membrane, inhibited the re-concentration of E-cadherin at the nectin-based cell-cell contact sites in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> switch experiment. Knockdown of annexin II by RNA interference also inhibited the re-concentration of E-cadherin. These results indicate that the annexin II-S100A10 complex is involved in the formation of the E-cadherin-based AJs in MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078660746,"HER2, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase family, functions as an accessory EGFR signaling component and alters EGFR trafficking by heterodimerization. HER2 overexpression leads to aberrant cell behavior including enhanced proliferation and motility. Here we applied a combination of computational modeling and quantitative experimental studies of the dynamic interactions between EGFR and HER2 and their downstream activation of ERK to understand this complex signaling system. Using cells expressing different levels of HER2 relative to the EGFR, we could separate relative contributions of EGFR and HER2 to signaling amplitude and duration. Based on our model calculations, we demonstrated that, in contrast with previous suggestions in the literature, the intrinsic capabilities of EGFR and HER2 to activate ERK were quantitatively equivalent. We found that HER2-mediated effects on EGFR dimerization and trafficking were sufficient to explain the observed HER2-mediated amplification of epidermal growth factor-induced ERK signaling. Our model suggests that transient amplification of ERK activity by HER2 arises predominantly from the 2-to-1 stoichiometry of receptor kinase to bound ligand in EGFR/HER2 heterodimers compared with the 1-to-1 stoichiometry of the EGFR homodimer, but alterations in receptor trafficking yielding increased EGFR sparing cause the sustained HER2-mediated enhancement of ERK signaling.

HER2 (also known as ErbB2) is a key member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CCD, charge-coupled device; Nd:YAG, neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet. family, which also includes EGFR (HER1/ErbB1), HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4 (ErbB4). HER2 is overexpressed in one-third of all breast cancers and correlates with poor prognoses in that disease (1Slamon D.J. Clark G.M. Wong S.G. Levin W.J. Ullrich A. McGuire W.L. Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (9991) Google Scholar). Its overexpression is also noted in other carcinomas including those of the lung, pancreas, and colon (2Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5659) Google Scholar). Lacking a ligand, HER2 generally relies on dimerization with other family members for its activation. Dimerization, in turn, results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of HER2 and subsequent activation of signaling cascades. The intrinsic affinity of HER2/EGFR heterodimerization is approximately equal to that of EGFR/EGFR homodimerization, although overexpression gives HER2 the overall appearance of being a preferred dimerization partner (3Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23343-23351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover HER2 has been reported to mediate enhanced signaling relative to other family members, and HER2-containing heterodimers are often postulated as being exceptionally potent transducers of downstream signaling pathways including the ERK pathway (4Tzahar E.

The EGFR family operates within an intricate signaling and regulatory network with complexity at several highly interconnected levels. These include ligand binding, receptor dimerization, receptor trafficking, and recruitment of signaling components into several different cellular compartments. With four distinct receptors that interact in various combinations and more than eight EGFR family ligands, opportunity exists for a large number of possible dimer species feeding into the ERK, phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and other signaling pathways. The amplitude, duration, and quality of signals generated by a given ligand are functions of receptor activation states, quantities, and locations that are determined by regulated intracellular trafficking. Altering the expression level of a single receptor, such as EGFR or HER2, perturbs all of these processes simultaneously. Delineation of the relationship between each signaling determinant and the net output of the system requires a quantitative model that can integrate all of these processes and their key variables. Endocytic trafficking is responsible for the short and long term regulation of receptor number at the cell surface. It also dictates the distribution of receptors and ligands between surface and internal compartments. It is principally regulated at two steps: (i) internalization wherein ligand binding enhances receptor localization to coated pits, which facilitate endocytosis, and (ii) endosomal sorting wherein receptors and ligands are either targeted for lysosomal degradation or recycled to the surface for successive rounds of trafficking (9Burke P.M. Schooler K. Wiley H.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 10Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Both steps are subject to interference by overexpression of HER2 (11Worthylake R. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8865-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). Elevated EGFR expression may also alter the endocytic and endosomal sorting dynamics through the saturation of the internalization and sorting machinery involved in these processes (13French A.R. Sudlow G.P. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15749-15755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol.

Elevated HER2 expression, by contrast, interferes with internalization by driving the formation of heterodimers following EGF stimulation that have a reduced internalization rate relative to EGF-EGFR complexes (3Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23343-23351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Further elevated HER2 levels can shunt EGF-EGFR complexes to the recycling pathway by saturating EGF endosomal sorting through competitive interference (5Lenferink A.E.

The net effect of HER2 overexpression is a slower degradation of EGF/EGFR complexes along with a shift in spatial location toward the cell surface (12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-induced receptor activation and transphosphorylation stimulate the recruitment of a repertoire of signaling molecules by both EGFR and HER2. EGFR homodimers and EGFR/HER2 heterodimers associate with many of the same signaling molecules including Src, Shc, phospholipase Cγ, Sos, Grb2, Grb7, and Crk (18Alroy I. Yarden Y. Fed. Eur. Biol. Sci. Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 19Yarden Y. Eur. J. Cancer. 2001; 37: S3-S8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, controlled dimerization of these receptors has indicated the presence of differential signaling between homodimers and heterodimers. For example, c-Cbl is able to associate with homodimers but unable to associate with heterodimers (7Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Among the pathways common to both the EGFR and HER2, the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is implicated in cell proliferation and tumor progression. The ERK cascade is a central element in the transmission of signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. Overexpression of HER2 has been shown to potentiate and prolong EGF-induced ERK activation (6Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that EGFR/HER2 heterodimers result in an increased proliferation and focus forming ability of cells relative to homodimers (7Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar, 20Muthuswamy S. Gilman M. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6845-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The overall effect of elevated HER2 expression on EGF signaling can be conceptually divided into two actions. The first is a direct signaling effect wherein heterodimerization allows the activation of two receptor kinases per one ligand molecule; the second is an indirect trafficking effect wherein elevated HER2 expression alters the normal trafficking and down-regulation of the EGFR and thus its consequent signaling. The signaling effect of HER2 overexpression should manifest itself as an increase in signal amplitude, whereas the trafficking effect would operate at longer time scales resulting in an increase in signal duration. These qualitative characteristics have been seen in ERK, p70/p85S6K, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation data in response to EGF stimulation (6Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). However, the trafficking and signaling of EGFR and HER2 are intimately linked through their dependence on dimerization and receptor expression levels. Moreover the recursive nature of receptor recycling can obscure any simple relationship between expression levels and receptor activity. Consequently these relationships cannot easily be separated experimentally, making computational methodologies necessary. In this work we determined the quantitative abilities of EGFR and HER2 to activate the ERK pathway. We developed and validated a computational model of EGFR/HER2 trafficking that can predict the levels of various homo- and heterodimers in response to EGF stimulation. By correlating these predicted quantities of activated receptors with experimental ERK signaling data, we were able to computationally separate the direct (signaling) and indirect (trafficking) effects of elevated HER2 expression. In determining the intrinsic signaling abilities of EGFR and HER2 for the ERK pathway, we found that they are quantitatively equivalent. The framework of our model suggests that the short term enhancement of ERK activity by HER2 is predominantly due to the 2-to-1 stoichiometry of receptor kinase to ligand in EGFR/HER2 heterodimers compared with the 1-to-1 stoichiometry in EGFR/EGFR homodimers, whereas the long term maintenance of ERK activity arises almost exclusively from increased EGFR levels as a result of the HER2-mediated reduction in EGFR down-regulation. Cell Culture and Lysate Preparation—184A1 human mammary epithelial cells with varying levels of HER2 expression, as described previously, were maintained in DFCI-1 medium supplemented with 12.5 ng/ml EGF (12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar, 22Band V. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1249-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Before the experiments, cells were incubated overnight in DFCI-1 medium without EGF, bovine pituitary extract, or fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. In experiments with mAb 2C4, cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml 2C4 for 4 h before human EGF treatment. Cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were scraped into lysis buffer, allowed to lyse for 10 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g to clear insoluble debris. Protein concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/ml as determined using the micro-BCA protein determination kit (Pierce). ERK Activity Assay—ERK kinase activity was measured using an in vitro assay in 96-well format as described previously (23Asthagiri A.R. Horwitz A.F. Lauffenburger D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly protein-A coated wells (Pierce) were coated with 06-182 anti-ERK1/2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Following washing, 50 μg of cell lysate were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Wells are washed and resuspended in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 15 mm magnesium chloride, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Upstate Biotechnology), 4 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide (Upstate Biotechnology), and 4 μm calmidazolium (Upstate Biotechnology)). The in vitro reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 μm ATP (1 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP) and 40 μg of myelin basic protein. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with agitation, reactions were quenched with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and the contents were filtered through a 96-well phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). Following washing five times with 75 mm phosphoric acid and three times with 70% ethanol, 32P on each filter was quantified and corrected for background radioactivity. Antibody Tags—Monoclonal antibody 13A9 against EGFR and the Fab fragment of mAb 7C2 against HER2 were gifts from Genentech, Inc. Fab fragments of mAb 13A9 were generated using immobilized papain (Pierce). The immunoglobulins were dialyzed against 20 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm EDTA for 24 h followed by incubation with immobilized papain in digestion buffer (20 mm cysteine-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) for 48 h in 37 °C. The Fab fragments were then separated from undigested whole IgG and Fc using a protein A column. The fraction containing Fab fragments was dialyzed against phosphate-buffer saline, pH 7.4, and its purity was confirmed by SDS gel electrophoresis. The Fab fragments (50 kDa) were labeled with Alexa Fluor-546 using NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivatives of the dyes in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 8.0. The coupling reaction was carried out at room temperature for 60 min with continual stirring. Labeled Fab fragments were separated from the fluorophore using G-25 gel filtration. The degree of labeling ranged within 0.7-1.5 for all labeled Fab fragments used in this study. These values were verified by spin-coating nanomolar concentrations of the labeled Fab fragments on glass coverslips followed by the generation of intensity histograms of individual diffraction-limited hotspots. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—A fluorescence laser microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss) equipped with a 100× oil immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat, numerical aperture = 1.4, Zeiss), and a 2× relay lens in the emission path to the CCD was used for wide field, single molecule imaging. The overall magnification was 200×, yielding a 100 nm/image pixel. A green laser (Nd:YAG Verdi V-10, Coherent) was used to excite the dye (Alexa Fluor-546, Molecular Probes) at 532 nm wavelength. The laser was coupled by a fiber coupler to the microscope, and the illumination intensity was adjusted to 5 kilowatts/cm2. An ultrafast shutter, controlled by the CCD controller, was set in front of the laser beam to produce 10-ms laser exposures at 7.5 Hz. The dichroic beam splitter and band pass emission filters (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT) were set to collect the emission between 550 and 600 nm. Single molecule fluorescence images were acquired by a backilluminated, thermoelectrically cooled CCD camera (Spec-10 1340x400B, Roper Scientific) with 90% quantum efficiency and single molecule sensitivity. It was estimated that one intensity count in the CCD image corresponds to two detected photons. Cells were incubated simultaneously with 20-40 nm labeled Fab fragments, LC and 13A9, for 10 min at room temperature, washed, and then imaged in physiological buffer containing 162 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Alexa-546 (LC) was the donor, and Alexa-647 (13A9) was the acceptor of energy. The dyes were excited by a 532 nm laser (Nd:YAG Verdi V-10, Coherent) and 632 nm laser (dye laser CR-599, Coherent), respectively, using a dual dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology). Donor and acceptor emissions were sent simultaneously onto two defined areas on the CCD camera while toggling between the two lasers. The green and red emissions were separated using a dichroic wedge mirror. FRET was detected by Alexa-647 indirect excitation with 532 nm as the energy was transferred from the excited Alexa-546. The intensities in the acceptor and FRET channels were used to define a cut-off value, and signals that overlapped in the two channels were further pursued for analysis. The bleed-through of the donor (10%) and the acceptor (7%) into the FRET (red) channel was determined empirically and was subtracted pixel by pixel to obtain the true FRET signal (Fc).Fc=(FRET)−0.10×(DONOR)−0.07×(ACCEPTOR)(Eq. 1) FRET, DONOR, and ACCEPTOR are the fluorescence intensities in the corresponding channels. FRET efficiency (E) was then calculated pixel-by-pixel according to Equation 2 where γ is the acceptor to donor ratio of the quantum yields of the fluorophores, the objective, and the CCD camera and equals 0.82. E=100×FcFc+γ×(DONOR)(Eq. 2) Model Development and Implementation—The complete receptor trafficking model is a composite of the global trafficking model and receptor interaction module presented previously (3Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23343-23351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). The global trafficking models (equations shown under “Appendix I”) for EGFR and HER2 were solved at steady state in the absence of EGF stimulation to determine the initial distribution of receptors. Receptor synthesis rates were fit to match reported values of surface EGFR and surface HER2 per cell (12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). Once the initial receptor distributions were determined, the global trafficking model equations were solved transiently over a 2-h time period in response to appropriate EGF stimulation. At each time point, the total EGF, EGFR, and HER2 in each compartment were calculated. These values served as inputs into a quasisteady dimerization submodel (equations shown under “Appendix II”), which was used to estimate the quantity of each possible receptor species, including EGF-EGFR homodimers and EGF-EGFR/HER2 heterodimers, in the surface and internal compartments. The dimerization submodel consists of kinetic equations describing every possible binary EGFR/HER2 interaction with and without EGF. Assuming a conservation of mass over the time scale of receptor-receptor interaction, that is there is no significant gain or loss of receptors or ligand to trafficking, these reactions can be assumed to be at pseudosteady state, and their solution is readily obtained. All necessary parameter values governing EGFR and HER2 interactions are found in the literature (3Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23343-23351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the total ERK signal generated is the linear combination of the total number of signaling receptors multiplied by their respective ERK signaling abilities (see Equations 3, 4, 5, 6 under “Results”). The total (surface + inside) number of signaling receptors was determined at each time point from the trafficking model for the desired level of HER2 expression. We assumed that three species in our model were capable of recruiting signals: EGFR/EGF-EGFR, EGF-EGFR/EGF-EGFR, and EGF-EGFR/HER2. Thus, we assumed that one active kinase (i.e. EGF-EGFR complex) is sufficient to phosphorylate a dimer and enable signal recruitment. It should be noted that the EGFR/EGF-EGFR species only became significant at ligand concentrations below Kd (1 ng/ml EGF) and could be neglected at saturating ligand concentrations (100 ng/ml EGF). For clone 24H trafficking model predictions following 2C4 administration, minor adjustment was required since blocking heterodimerization with mAb 2C4 did not quite return the trafficking behavior of clone 24H to that of the parental cell line, most likely due to clonal differences between the two cell lines; experimental measurements of EGFR down-regulation in clone 24H following mAb 2C4 pretreatment differ by a factor of 1.34 from that in the parental cell line (12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). This correction factor was incorporated into model predictions of ERK signal following mAb 2C4 pretreatment by multiplying trafficking model predictions of the number of actively signaling EGFRs for clone 24H by 1.34. To use the trafficking model to make predictions for the 1 ng/ml EGF case, adjustments were needed to the internalization rates used in the global trafficking model (12Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). These internalization rates for EGFR and HER2 were predicted from the internalization model for the parental and clone 24H cell lines (3Hendriks B.S. Opresko L.K. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23343-23351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). HER2 internalization rates were predicted to be 0.04 and 0.03 min-1, and EGF-EGFR complex internalization rates were predicted to be 0.17 and 0.12 min-1 for the parental and clone 24H cell lines, respectively. Model solutions and manipulation were performed using MATLAB Version 6.5. To separate the signaling and trafficking effects of HER2 on EGFR signaling we first needed to build a quantitative model of receptor location and dimerization as a function of time. Using this model, we could then associate a signal output from each receptor type at each corresponding time. Calculated estimates of the number of actively signaling receptors were compared with experimental signaling measurements to back-calculate the individual signal contributions of EGFR and HER2. This deconvolution of signaling can be considered as three processes: (i) signaling data collection, (ii) trafficking model development, and (iii) model/data correlation analysis. For our analysis we examined a downstream signal activated by both EGFR and HER2, namely ERK activity. ERK activity is an important determinant of cell proliferation and thereby a reasonable metric by which to gauge the increased signaling brought about by elevated HER2 expression in the context of tumor progression. For our signaling experiments we used the same set of human mammary epithelial cells exhibiting different levels of HER2 expression as we have used previously to develop the trafficking model (3Hendriks B.S.

Each cell line has roughly 2 × 105 surface EGFR/cell and surface HER2 expression of 3 × 104, 2 × 105, and 6×105/cell for the parental, clone 12, and clone 24H cell lines, respectively (3Hendriks B.S.

Lauffenburger D.A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1130-1137PubMed Google Scholar). We measured ERK activity in response to 100 ng/ml (16 nm) EGF stimulation in each cell line with an in vitro kinase assay over a 2-h time course (Fig. 1A). At early time points there was an increase in signal amplitude with increasing HER2 expression, corresponding to an increased number of actively signaling receptors. At longer time scales, signal duration increased with increasing HER2 expression, corresponding to the inhibition of receptor down-regulation as a consequence of elevated HER2 expression. Using a lower EGF concentration of 1 ng/ml, we found little difference in ERK activity with clone 24H being marginally higher at longer time points (Fig. 1C). To probe the role of heterodimerization in ERK activity we repeated the 100 ng/ml EGF experiment following preincubation with mAb 2C4, an antibody that has been shown to bind to HER2 and block heterodimerization (24Agus D.B.

This pharmacological decoupling of HER2 from the EGFR was able to reverse most of the effects of elevated HER2 expression on ERK activity both in terms of peak levels and prolongation of signaling.

However, the molecular mechanism of its action is still unclear. In this study, we have shown that, via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, persistent exposure of mouse epithelial cells to nicotine elicits Ras signaling and subsequent Raf/MAP kinase activity, accompanied by a significant increase in cyclin D1 promoter activity and its protein expression. AP-1 is required for activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. The induction of cyclin D1 expression and its promoter activity by nicotine is abolished by the suppression of Raf/MAP kinase signaling. Furthermore, upon nicotine treatment, the cells do not arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle following serum starvation. The perturbation of the G1 cell cycle checkpoint is caused by the deregulation of retinoblastoma/E2F activity. Therefore, our data indicated that by targeting the Ras pathway, long-term exposure to nicotine disrupts cell cycle restriction machinery and thus potentiates tumor development.

Nicotine is an addictive component of cigarettes and exists at high concentrations in the bloodstream of smokers (1Benowitz N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In the brain, nicotine mediates fast synaptic transmission in key regions controlling behavior via nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotine acetylcholine receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-OH kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; Rb, retinoblastoma; MCA, mecamylamine; Ab, antibody; FTI, S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid. (2Pontieri F.E. Tanda G. Orzi F. Di Chiara G. Nature. 1996; 382: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that through the stimulation of nAChRs on endothelial cells, nicotine regulates angiogenesis in murine models of inflammation, ischemia, and atherosclerosis (3Heeschen C.

Albuquerque E.X. Conti-Fine B.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. 1998; 287: 435-439PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity nAChRs are also found on the surface of lung cancer cells of all histologic types and in normal lung tissue (5Chini B. Clementi F. Hukovic N. Sher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Growing evidence indicates that nicotine is able to activate several mitogen-related signaling pathways upon its interaction with nAChRs on the surface of bronchial epithelial cells (3Heeschen C.

Zheng H. Larrick J.W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although this effect has been suggested to contribute directly to lung carcinogenesis, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in nicotine-mediated tumorigenesis has yet to be fully understood. Studies show that the addition of nicotine in pharmacological concentrations (90–1000 nm) results in the activation of several important, pro-survival signaling pathways (12Cattaneo M.G. Codignola A. Vicentini L.M. Celmenti F. Sher E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5566-5568PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cattaneo M.G. D'Atri F. Vicentini L.M. Biochem.

For example, an increase in protein kinase C (PKC) activity was detected in various human or murine lung cancer cell lines in response to nicotine exposure, which antagonized opioid-induced apoptotic signaling (8Quik M. Chan J. Patrick J. Brain Res. 1994; 655: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Itier V. Bertrand D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The activities of MAP kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 were also elicited by nicotine. The activation of these kinases is responsible for the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, which blocks apoptosis in lung cancer cells (9Heusch W.L. Maneckjee R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Cattaneo M.G. D'Atri F. Vicentini L.M. Biochem.

Using short-term cultures of normal human or murine bronchial epithelial cells or airway epithelial cells, studies show that nicotine is able to induce the activation of Akt. Therefore, this kinase was suggested to be involved in tobacco-related carcinogenesis (17Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997PubMed Google Scholar, 18West K.A.

Because these results were obtained from the transient exposure of cells to nicotine, the impact of persistent nicotine exposure on the cells is not clear. Ras plays an essential role in cellular proliferation, cell development, and cellular differentiation (19Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3783) Google Scholar, 20Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 21Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). As a crucial signal transducer, Ras governs multiple downstream effector pathways, including Raf/MAP kinase, PI3K, JNK/p38, and Rho (22Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Pledger W.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 127-134PubMed Google Scholar). Ras acts at different phases of the cell cycle, including early G1, the G1/S boundary, and at G2/M (26Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Ma P. Magut M. Chen X. Chen C.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the early G1 phase, Ras activity is required for the release of cells from quiescence (28Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Using Ras effector loop mutants, one study demonstrates that Ras uses multiple downstream effectors to disrupt cell cycle control, resulting in anchorage-independent growth (26Kang J.-S. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3370-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Jong J. Kang J. Krauss R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2586-2595Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other studies show that the introduction of Ras or Raf into mouse embryo fibroblasts causes the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16INK4A and p21WAF1/CIP1 in a p53-dependent manner, leading to senescence (30Serrano M. Gomez-Lahoz E. DePinho R.A. Beach D. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1995; 267: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 31Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar). The association of cyclin D1 with the cyclin-dependent kinases cdk4 and cdk6 results in phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, which releases the transcription factor E2F. E2F subsequently activates S-phase-specific genes (21Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar, 27Ma P. Magut M. Chen X. Chen C.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2928-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Studies have suggested an interaction between Ras and cyclin D1 (47Rusanescu G. Gotoh T. Tian X. Feig L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 59). In cells overexpressing ras, cyclin D1 mRNA levels were increased (1Benowitz N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Ras can cause the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, such as c-Jun (33Rodriguez-Puebla M.L. Robels A.I. Conti C.J. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Wulf G.M. Ryo A. Wulf G.G. Lee S.W. Niu T. Petkova V. Lu K.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3459-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). As one of the AP-1 proteins, c-Jun promotes G1 phase progression and further elicits the related gene inductions (32Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 37Hubler L. Bradshaw-Rouse J. Heideman W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6247-6282Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The suppression of Jun expression prevented cell cycle transition by the addition of serum to G0/G1-arrested cells (38Riabowol K.

Blood. 1992; 79: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, these data indicate that AP-1 family members are involved in promoting cell cycle progression. To understand the molecular mechanisms of nicotine-induced lung cancer development, our study investigated the impact of long-term nicotine exposure on mouse epithelial cells and the intracellular signaling pathways that are activated by such treatment. We have demonstrated that chronic exposure of mouse epithelial LA4 cells to nicotine activates Raf/MAP kinase pathway through Ras activation. Upon treatment, the expression of cyclin D1 and its promoter activity was augmented in cells. Cells treated with nicotine for 8 weeks were no longer able to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in response to serum starvation, displaying perturbation of Rb/E2F signaling. Overall, the results suggested that persistent exposure to nicotine mitigates cell growth control through activation of the Ras pathway, which potentiates the development of lung cancer. Cells and Materials—Mouse lung epithelial cells, LA4, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), propagated for two passages, and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen. For each experiment, the cells were freshly thawed and cultured at 1 × 105 cells/ml density in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For the long-term treatment, cells were split every 3 days with the medium supplemented with 0.5 μm nicotine to keep the drug at a constant concentration. For the controls, cells were cultured in parallel with the treated cells and split every 3 days. For transient nicotine treatment, the drug was added into cell culture at a concentration of 0.5 μm. Cells were transiently infected with retroviral vector containing cyclin D1 or dn-Raf on the last 2 days of the 8-week nicotine treatment. The expression of the proteins was confirmed by Western analysis. PKC inhibitor GO6976 was from LC Laboratories. Nicotine was obtained from Sigma. The sequence of cyclin D1 antisense oligo is 5′-AGGAGCTGGTGTTCCATGGCG-3′. Immunoblotting Analysis—After the nicotine treatment, cells were treated with various inhibitors for 60 min and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in detergent buffer. The samples were then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Raf, JNK, p38, Akt, and the phospho-specific antibodies, as well as the antibodies against cell cycle regulators, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p53 antibody was obtained from Oncogene Research Products. Measurement of Ras Activity—Cells (30 × 106/sample), with or without 8 weeks of exposure to nicotine, were washed with phosphate-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and cultured in the same medium with 0.5 mCi/ml ortho-32P for 2 h. For the inhibition of nAChR experiments, following the nicotine treatment cells were treated with mecamylamine (MCA), an nAChR antagonist, 50 μm) for 60 min. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-114, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 100 μg of aprotinin and leupeptin/ml. Equal amounts of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ras Ab (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY), followed by the addition of a second Ab conjugated with protein A-Sepharose beads. Precipitates were washed with lysis buffer, and bound nucleotides were eluted with elution buffer containing 20 mm EDTA and 25 μm each of cold GDP and GTP at 65 °C. The eluted products were separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates and exposed on the films. Assay of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAP Kinase) Activity— Cells were treated with nicotine for various times and then lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm benzamidine. Supernatant was collected. Fifty micrograms of cell extracts were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm okadaic acid, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 1 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). Reaction mixes were then spotted onto p81 filters. Filters were washed in 50 mm phosphoric acid and dried with ethanol. Radioactively labeled myelin basic protein bound to the washed filters was determined by scintillation counting (40Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13642-13648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the inhibition of Ras or nAChRs, following the 8-week nicotine exposure cells were treated with S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTI), a Ras inhibitor (0.1 μm), or MCA (50 μm) for 60 min and then subjected to the kinase assay. On the last 2 days of 8 weeks of nicotine exposure, dn-Raf were transiently infected into cells for 48 h to suppress endogenous Raf activity. Assay of PKC Activity—Cells were treated with nicotine for various times and then subjected to the kinase assay. For the short-term nicotine exposure experiments, the inhibitors and nicotine were added together into the culture and incubated for 1 h. For the long-term exposure, the inhibitor was added at the last hour of the 8-week nicotine treatment. PKC activity was measured using a commercial assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). After the treatments, cells were lysed in lysate buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. Cell extracts were normalized for protein concentration, and 100 μg of extract was incubated with a PKC-specific peptide substrate, [γ-32P]ATP, inhibitors of cAMP-dependent kinase, and calmodulin kinase for 10 min at 30 °C. 32P incorporated into the substrate was separated from residual 32P using p81 filters and subsequently quantified by scintillation counting (41Chen C.-Y. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15320-15328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). DNA Profile Analysis—Following exposure to nicotine for 8 weeks, cells were cultured in the medium containing 10 or 0.5% serum plus nicotine for 48 h and then treated with various inhibitors for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were washed in cold 1 × PBS twice and fixed with fixation solution containing 65% ethanol and 35% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The samples were stained with staining solution (1 × phosphate-buffered saline, 8 mg/ml RNase, and 18 mg/ml propidium iodide) and incubated in the dark for over 30 min at room temperature. A BD Biosciences FACScan was used to analyze the samples. For the suppression of Raf, after 8 weeks of nicotine treatment cells were transiently transfected with a dn-Raf construct using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) and were cultured in the growth medium supplemented with nicotine for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were subjected to 48 h of serum starvation in the presence of nicotine. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—Following the treatments, cells (50 × 106) were washed with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline twice and resuspended in 1 ml of the lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine). The lysate was sheared by being passed 40 times through a 25-gauge needle and centrifuged at 280 × g for 10 min. The collected supernatant was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was subsequently saved as the cytosol fraction. The pellet was washed with the lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. Promoter Reporter Assay—On the last 2 days of the 8-week nicotine exposure, cells were cultured in the medium containing 0.5% serum for 48 h. FTI was then added into the cultures for 1 h. For the positive controls, after serum starvation cells were re-fed with the growth medium in the presence or absence of nicotine. Subsequently, untreated and treated cells were co-transfected with 15 μg of the luciferase construct and 2 μg of β-galactosidase (an internal control). Forty-eight hours later, the luciferase activity was analyzed. For the suppression of Raf, on the last days of the 8-week nicotine exposure cells were transiently infected with dn-Raf for 48 h and then subjected to the assay. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—After exposure to nicotine for 8 weeks, cells were incubated with FTI (0.1 μm) for 1 h or transiently infected with dn-Raf for 48 h. For a positive control, cells were transiently infected with v-ras for 48 h. Subsequently, untreated or treated cells were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg aprotinin/ml) and incubated on ice for 15 min. 30 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 40 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the pellet and incubated on ice for 30 min. Thereafter, the nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Binding reactions were carried out in 15-μl volumes consisting of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 m potassium glutamate, 50 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC), 200 ρg of end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide, and 10 μg of nuclear extract for 15 min on ice. The resulting complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis at room temperature on 5% acrylamide gels. The sequence of the cyclin D1 promoter AP-1 site is 5′-TCCATTCTGACTCATTTTTTTTAA-3′. Ras Activity Is Elicited by Chronic Exposure to Nicotine— Nicotine is one of the major components in tobacco and exists at concentrations of 90–1000 nm in the bloodstream of smokers (1Benowitz N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Apart from its addictive effects on the central nervous system, nicotine has been suggested to act as a tumor promoter through its ability to activate various mitogenic-related signaling pathways, such as PKC and Akt (8Quik M. Chan J. Patrick J. Brain Res. 1994; 655: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Itier V. Bertrand D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 17Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997PubMed Google Scholar, 18West K.A. Brognard J.

However, these observations were obtained under the experimental settings of transient exposure to nicotine; thus, the molecular mechanism of nicotine-mediated tumor promotion is still unclear. To further investigate the effect of nicotine on lung tumorigenesis, normal mouse lung epithelial LA4 cells were used. The cells were exposed to nicotine for a short or long period. For the long-term (8 weeks) treatment, cells were split every 3 days, and the fresh-made medium containing nicotine was then added into the culture. Untreated cells were cultured in parallel with the treated cells, and the medium was changed every 3 days. Ras activation is associated with more than 30% of human lung malignancy, and in many cases the occurrence of lung cancer is often linked to a prolonged period of smoking (1Benowitz N. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 1318-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). This led us to first examine the expression and activity of Ras in response to nicotine. The cells were treated with nicotine (0.5 μm) for 1 h or 2 or 8 weeks. Immunoblotting for Ras expression was then performed (Fig. 1a, left panel). A moderate amount of Ras was detected by an anti-Ras Ab in untreated cells, and the level of the protein did not alter at the various time points of nicotine exposure. Ras is a small GTPase and functions as a molecular switch. In response to growth stimulation, Ras binds to GTP and further interacts with its downstream effectors to elicit various biologic activities in cells (22Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of Ras, following the same treatment, was determined by GTP/GDP exchange assay (Fig. 1b, right panel). The GTP-bound form of Ras was not detected in untreated cells or cells treated with nicotine for 1 h. Two weeks after the exposure, there was a slightly increased amount of Ras bound to GTP. However, exposure to nicotine for 8 weeks resulted in a significant increase in the active form of Ras. Ras activity was also examined after 12 weeks of nicotine exposure, and the level remained at a similar level as that of 8 weeks of exposure (data not shown). nAChRs belong to the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that are predominantly expressed in neural tissue as well as in other tissues (2Pontieri F.E. Tanda G. Orzi F. Di Chiara G. Nature. 1996; 382: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 3Heeschen C. Jang J. Weis M. Pathak A. Kaji S. Hu R. Tsao P.S. Johnson F.J. Cooke J.P.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). nAChRs have been reported to be found on normal lung epithelial and cancer cells with high affinity (5Chini B. Clementi F. Hukovic N. Sher E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1572-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6Maneckjee R. Minna J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brain Res. 1994; 655: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By binding to nAChRs, nicotine can mediate many biological processes, such as controlling behavior by affecting the central nervous system as well as regulating cell growth in non-neuronal cells. To determine whether nAChRs are required for nicotine-mediated Ras activation, MCA (an nAChR antagonist) was used. Following 8 weeks of exposure to nicotine, the cells were treated with MCA (50 μm) for 60 min, and an immunoblotting assay was conducted. The level of Ras expression did not change in response to the co-treatment (Fig. 1b, right panel). However, the addition of MCA blocked nicotine-induced Ras activation (Fig. 1b, left panel), indicating that the increase of Ras activity mediated by chronic nicotine exposure is through nAChR ligand-receptor interaction. This also suggests that the activation of Ras elicited by 8 weeks of nicotine exposure is still reversible. Effect of Nicotine on Ras Downstream Effectors—Ras controls the activity of multiple effectors (22Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized Ras downstream signaling is Raf/MAP pathway. Through a serine/threonine phosphorylation cascade, Ras activates MAP and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 kinases, which in turn regulate the activity of transcriptional factors (22Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the activity of Ras is dramatically increased in LA4 cells in response to chronic exposure to nicotine, it led us to examine whether Raf is activated under the same conditions. Immunoblotting for Raf expression was performed (Fig. 2a, left panel). The nicotine treatment did not alter the level of Raf protein expression compared with untreated control. Upon mitogenic stimulation, Raf is able to interact with Ras at the plasma membrane and transmit activation signals to downstream effectors (22Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We next tested whether Raf translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane in response to nicotine exposure. After treating the cells with nicotine for various periods, the plasma membrane fraction was isolated for immunoblotting (Fig. 2a, top panel at the right). A moderate amount of Raf protein was detected in the plasma membrane fraction from the cells treated with nicotine for 2 weeks. Eight weeks of nicotine exposure caused a significant increase in the amount of Raf translocated to the membrane fraction. The protein could not be detected in this subcellular fraction from untreated cells or cells treated with nicotine for 1 h. The relative purity of the plasma membrane from the cells, with or without nicotine exposure, was confirmed by the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in the plasma membrane fraction (Fig. 2a, middle panel at the right) and compared with the cytosol fraction (Fig. 2b, bottom panel at the right). The data indicate that Raf activity, but not expression, is augmented by persistent nicotine treatment. MAP kinase is one of the Raf downstream effectors (22Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further determine the activation of Raf induced by nicotine treatment, we examined the status of MAP kinase using a MAP kinase assay (Fig. 2b). Exposure of the cells to nicotine for 2 weeks moderately increased MAP kinase activity. The kinase activity was significantly augmented by exposure to nicotine for 8 weeks.

Given that genome annotation is a largely predictive process, key challenges are to validate these predictions and to fill in gaps for known functions for which genes have not been annotated. We have addressed these issues by functional analysis of methionine metabolism. Transport, followed by metabolism of 35S methionine into the cysteine adduct mycothiol, demonstrated the conversion of exogenous methionine to cysteine. Mutational analysis and cloning of the Rv1079 gene showed it to encode the key enzyme required for this conversion, cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL). Rv1079, annotated metB, was predicted to encode cystathionine γ-synthase (CGS), but demonstration of a γ-elimination reaction with cystathionine as well as the γ-replacement reaction yielding cystathionine showed it encodes a bifunctional CGL/CGS enzyme. Consistent with this, a Rv1079 mutant could not incorporate sulfur from methionine into cysteine, while a cysA mutant lacking sulfate transport and a methionine auxotroph was hypersensitive to the CGL inhibitor propargylglycine. Thus, reverse transsulfuration alone, without any sulfur recycling reactions, allows M. tuberculosis to use methionine as the sole sulfur source. Intracellular cysteine was undetectable so only the CGL reaction occurs in intact mycobacteria. Cysteine desulfhydrase, an activity we showed to be separable from CGL/CGS, may have a role in removing excess cysteine and could explain the ability of M. tuberculosis to recycle sulfur from cysteine, but not methionine.

The ability of living organisms to produce or acquire sulfur compounds is central to biological processes. Key sulfur-containing metabolites derived from methionine include N-formyl methionine for the initiation of peptide chain biosynthesis and S-adenosylmethionine for many one-carbon transfer reactions. Compounds, such as glutathione or its replacement in the actinomyctes, mycothiol, are synthesized from cysteine for redox maintenance. The mshC gene in the biochemical pathway for mycothiol biosynthesis is essential for growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1Sareen D. Newton G.L. Fahey R.C. Buchmeier N.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6736-6740Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Coenzyme A, also derived metabolically from cysteine, is required for many reactions in intermediary and lipid metabolism. Since mycobacteria have both a high proportion of genes for lipid biosynthesis (2Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry 3rd, C.E.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6509) Google Scholar) and a notably high and diverse lipid content, the production of coenzyme A must be a core activity. Thus, for pathogenic mycobacteria, acquisition of sulfur from the host is a major requirement for growth in vivo. Our interest in the pathways for the biosynthesis and utilization of cysteine and methionine arose from the observation that methionine, but never cysteine, auxotrophs of the M. tuberculosis complex could be isolated (3McAdam R.A. Weisbrod T.R. Martin J. Scuderi J.D. Brown A.M. Cirillo J.D. Bloom B.R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wooff E. Michell S.L. Gordon S.V.

These observations, together with the lack of further attenuation of a methionine auxotroph of Mycobacterium bovis BCG (4Wooff E. Michell S.L. Gordon S.V. Chambers M.A. Bardarov S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hewinson R.G. Wheeler P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), suggested methionine might be an important source of sulfur in the host. However, this view conflicted with the lack of any obvious route for the conversion of methionine to cysteine.

However, the four genes (Rv0391, Rv1079, Rv3340, and Rv3341) encoding enzymes of the appropriate protein family (5Hacham Y. Gophna U. Amir R. Mol. Biol.

One of these genes, Rv1079, annotated metB and predicted to encode cystathionine γ-synthase (CGS), was also similar to CGL genes. During the course of our work, using a Bayesian method for “pathway hole” filling to identify enzymes missing in metabolic pathways constructed from annotated genomes, Rv1079 was identified as a CGL (7Green M.L. Karp P.D. BioMed. Central Bioinform. 2004; 5: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Given that members of this protein family are enzymes with broad substrate specificity (5Hacham Y.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the activities Rv1079 encodes by both mutational analysis and cloning the gene. Although reverse transsulfuration is a likely route for the conversion of methionine to cysteine, at least three biochemical pathways have been described for microbial conversion of methionine to cysteine (Fig. 1). It is important to establish which occur in the M. tuberculosis complex because if alternative pathways exist, their relative importance, for instance during growth within the host, can be ascertained. Therefore, we carried out a complete re-examination of sulfur amino acid metabolism in the M. tuberculosis complex. Briefly, our strategy was to trace the metabolic fate of 35S-labeled amino acids, perform experiments with the γ-lyase/γ-synthase inhibitor (see Fig. 1 to view its sites of action) propargylglycine (10Reed D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 92-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and to assay key enzymes in the pathways of sulfur amino acid metabolism to test and extend the genome annotation and to corroborate our own work, described herein, on Rv1079. A more general issue we are addressing is the continual need to refine and revise genome annotation. This is particularly important in research on the M. tuberculosis clade that includes the strains used in this study, M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis H37Rv, which have over 99% sequence identity. Hitherto almost intractable to investigation, expression profiling (11Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Voskuil M.I. Liu Y. Mangan J.A. Monahan I. Dolganov G. Efron B. Butcher P.D. Nathan C. Schoolnik G.K. J.

A. 2001; 98: 12712-12717Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) of these important pathogens have allowed insights into the genes required for their virulence and those that are expressed once inside the host. Interpretation of this rapidly emerging data requires accurate annotation of the genes identified, and our work contributes to this process. Strains of Tubercle Bacilli and Growth Conditions—Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The strains of mycobacteria used were M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its metB::hyg mutant (13Parish T. Gordhan B.G. McAdam R.A. Duncan K. Mizrahi V. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 3497-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and M. bovis BCG Pasteur (Statens Serum Institute) and its cysA::Tn5367 mutant in which the Tn5367 transposon carries a kanamycin resistance gene (4Wooff E. Michell S.L. Gordon S.V. Chambers M.A. Bardarov S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hewinson R.G. Wheeler P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Table I). It should be noted that we shall use the original designation of the M. tuberculosis metB::hyg mutant throughout even though, as will become apparent, the gene name is somewhat misleading. These strains were routinely grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium with 10% ADC (albumin-dextrose-catalase) supplement (Difco) plus 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80 at 37 °C in Roller bottles rotated at 4 rpm or, where specifically stated, in square-bottomed bottles that were shaken daily and the OD600 of the cultures determined. Hygromycin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (25 μg/ml) was included in cultures of the mutants with the corresponding antibiotic resistance. Modifications made to the media for experiments specified in the text were (i) making “sulfate-free 7H9” in which all the sulfate (4.16 mm), present as magnesium sulfate, was substituted with magnesium citrate keeping the concentrations of Mg2+ and citrate ions the same as in the standard medium and (ii) the addition of methionine or cysteine, and (iii) the addition of propargylglycine (2-amino-4-pentynoic acid) at various concentrations as shown under “Results.” Dry weights were determined by drying samples on cellulose acetate (0.22-μm pore size) filters to constant weight for the BCG strains and correlated to OD600. Dry weights of virulent bacteria were estimated from the OD600 of their cultures.Table IStrains and plasmids used in this studyDescriptionRef.PlasmidpET21aVector allowing cloned gene to be overexpressed from the T7 promoterNovagenpLK101pET21a-derivative with M. tuberculosis metB gene cloned downstream of T7 promoter.This studyStrainM. tuberculosis H37RvType strain of the M. tuberculosis complexVLA Weybridge stockM. tuberculosis H37Rv metB::hygInactivation of metB (Rv1079) by insertion of hygromycin gene13Parish T.

Tait R.C. Rodriguez R.L. Tait R.C. Recombinant DNA Techniques. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA1983Google Scholar) was used as the overexpression host for Rv1079. The E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as required. The Rv1079 coding region from H37Rv chromosomal DNA was amplified using the primers metBF (5′-CGACCGTCATATGAGCGAAGACCGCACGGGAC-3′) and metBR (5′-CGTCTGCTGCGGCCGCTTAACCCAGGGCCTGTT-3′). PCR was carried out using Advantage-HF PCR Kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. The amplified DNA was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) to generate construct pLK99. After sequencing, the insert was excised from this vector by digestion with NdeI and NotI (restriction sites underlined) and cloned into NdeI/NotI-restricted pET21a (Novagen), generating the plasmid pLK101. Complementation of E. coli ΔmetB—E. coli ΔmetB was lysogenized using a λDE3 lysogenization kit (Novagen) to allow expression of target genes cloned in the pET vector under the control of the T7 promoter. pLK101 and pET21a were transformed into E. coli ΔmetB(DE3) and transformants selected on agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Amp). Isolated colonies were selected from the plates, checked for the presence of the plasmid by PCR, and then grown in LBAmp to yield stocks of E. coli ΔmetB(DE3)/pET21a and E. coli ΔmetB(DE3)/pLK101. These strains were plated out on isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG, 0.4 mm) and glucose (0.4%w/v) supplemented M9 minimal medium (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of methionine (0.15 mm) to demonstrate Rv1079 complementation of the metB mutation. For protein extraction E. coli ΔmetB(DE3)/pET21a and E. coli ΔmetB(DE3)/pLK101 were grown in 0.4 mm IPTG supplemented LB broth with Amp. Chemicals and Radiochemicals—All reagents were the purest grade available from Sigma or Merck (AnalaR or HPLC grade) except O-acetylhomoserine, which was prepared by acetylation of l-homoserine with acetic anhydride (16Nagai T. Flavin M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17B: 423-424Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The O-acetylhomoserine thus prepared was 98% pure with the 2% contaminant being unreacted homoserine (quantified by HPLC-MS, see below for methods). HPLC solvents were from Rathburn. Water was MilliQ grade. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Biosciences: to optimize stability we purchased methionine at low specific activity (<18.5 Bq/pmol) and added 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 μm bathophenantholinedisulfonic acid (BDPS) to cysteine (∼37 kBq/pmol) on receipt. HPLC Instrumentation—All derivatives of metabolites were chromatographed on a Symmetry C8 (Waters) reverse phase HPLC column (3.9 × 150 mm). UV analysis was accomplished with a Waters 625 LC system equipped with a 486 UV detector, whereas HPLC-RA or HPLC-MS employed a HP1050 HPLC system connected in series to either an A525 radioactivity-detector (Canberra Packard, Pangbourne, Berks) or an LCQ mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Hemel Hempstead, Berks), respectively. Uptake of Methionine and Cysteine into Intact Bacteria—Initially, bacteria, at >1 mg (dry wt.)/ml, were suspended in 50 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.5 with 0.4 mm MgCl2 with 38 kBq/ml l-[35S]methionine or l-[35S]cysteine at 37 °C. Concentrations of amino acids were adjusted to the concentrations referred to in the descriptions of individual experiments with the corresponding unlabeled amino acid. In the incubations with cysteine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 μm BDPS were included. The radioactivity taken up was determined by collecting bacteria on glass fiber filters followed by scintillation counting (4Wooff E. Michell S.L. Gordon S.V. Chambers M.A. Bardarov S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hewinson R.G. Wheeler P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In incubations with methionine, (i) to obtain kinetic data, suspensions of bacteria were incubated for 8 or 12 min to obtain initial rates. Three experiments were performed and the range of Km and Vmax values obtained is reported. (ii) Subsequently, for metabolic-tracing experiments, bacteria were grown as 20-ml cultures in 7H9 with 60 μm methionine at similar rates (mean generation time = 1.0–1.2 days) to OD600 of 0.05, then [35S]methionine (1.00 MBq; 0.054 μmol) was added and the cultures harvested 4–5 days later, still during log phase, when the OD600 reached 0.4–1.0. During the period of culture including [35S]methionine, 1.8–3.4% of the methionine was taken up per mg (dry wt.) bacteria. Cultures at the end of the period contained 3–6 mg of bacteria. Thus, typically, around 10% of the radioactivity in the culture flask was taken up. In incubations with cysteine, uptake was rapid for 8 min but continued thereafter so that about 3× more had been taken up by 1 h. Radioactivity was taken up at similar rates for 10 nm and 20 μm cysteine, but at half the rate with 50 μm cysteine. For metabolic tracing experiments, because cysteine is toxic in the Middlebrook media used in this study (4Wooff E. Michell S.L. Gordon S.V. Chambers M.A. Bardarov S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Hewinson R.G. Wheeler P.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (further results in this report), bacteria were grown to and OD600 of 0.4–0.8 (log phase), then 740 kBq of [35S]cysteine and unlabeled cysteine to give a final concentration of 20 μm was added, and the incubation was continued for 4 h. Control incubations comprised sufficient heat-killed bacteria from a suspension of M. bovis BCG in 50 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.5 with 0.4 mm MgCl2 heated at 100 °C for 15 min to give a pellet of 25 μl. This was mixed with 150 kBq of 35S-amino acid, then acid and solvent was added to the mixture, which was analyzed for thiols or amino acids by the methods given below starting from the first pellet stage. Detection of Thiols Formed as Bimane Derivatives—Monobromobimane (mBBR) derivatives were prepared to give stable, UV-absorbing derivatives of thiols. The principle of this procedure is that the rapid reaction with mBBR minimizes losses of the unstable thiols (17Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). At the end of uptake experiments, the bacteria were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 × g at 37 °C. Typically the pellet was <50 μl. Immediately (without washing) the pellet was acidified to pH 3–4 with 100 μl of 10 mm methane sulfonic acid, then 100 μl of acetonitrile was added, and the pellet was resuspended. The suspension was frozen and thawed twice then adjusted to pH 8 with 200 μl of the following mixture: 0.5 m HEPPS-KOH, pH 8, water (MilliQ), 0.25 M KOH (16: 174:10, v/v/v). The alkaline suspension was mixed rapidly, 7 μl of 150 mm mBBR in acetonitrile was added immediately, mixed, and allowed to react at 60 °C for 20 min. The mixture was then acidified to pH 4–5 with 1.25 m methane sulfonic acid, and clarified by centrifugation and, if necessary, filtration. This material was injected directly into HPLC in 20-μl portions: in experiments with radiochemicals, this volume gave sufficient (>2 KBq) radioactivity for analysis. After injection, a gradient of 41 mm acetic acid adjusted to pH 3.5 with ammonium hydroxide (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) was run: 0 min, 100% A; 25 min 76% A; 50 min 20% A; 52 min 20% A; 56 min 100% A. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The major thiol detected was mycothiol, ranging from 19 nmol/mg (dry wt.) bacteria in M. bovis BCG grown with 270 μm methionine to 4 nmol/mg (dry wt.) bacteria in M. bovis BCG ΔcysA grown with 60 μm methionine. These values are in agreement with the literature (18Spies H.S. Steenkamp D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). No radioactive N-acetylcysteine was formed showing that the above protocol effectively preserved the bacteria after the end of the incubation and did not provoke a detoxifiction response (19Newton G.L. Av-Gay Y. Fahey R.C. Biochem. 2000; 39: 10739-10746Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mass spectra of metabolites were collected over the range m/z = 150–800 using the electrospray probe in the positive ion mode. Product ion mass spectra of protonated molecular ions were collected with a collision energy of 35% and an isolation width of 2 amu (atomic mass units). Detection of Amino Acids—Typically, pellets of bacteria were treated as described above for thiol detection, except that (i) they were washed once in 1.5 ml of MilliQ water when the mass of methionine and cystathionine was to be quantified and (ii) ethanol was used instead of acetonitrile. After acid-ethanol extraction, the mixture was either derivatized as such or centrifuged to separate soluble, pooled amino acids and insoluble material including protein, which were derivatized separately. The material was dried under vacuum. The insoluble fraction was hydrolyzed for 18 h at 105 °C in constant boiling 6 m HCl (Fisher Chemicals) purged with nitrogen, and treated with Na2SO3 (20Swadesh J.K. Thannhauser T.W. Scheraga H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 141: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In our hands, we recovered >80% of l-cysteine treated in this way. PTC derivatives were prepared and analyzed by the method of Pramanik et al. (21Pramanik B.C. Moomaw C.R. Evans C.T. Cohen S.A. Slaughter C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In our hands, we found that the ion pair reagent (triethylamine) completely suppressed the ionization and thus the identification of analytes. Removal of triethylamine required adjustment of the gradient by lessening the content of organic modifier. Thus, the optimal gradient used in this study was with 14 mm ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 6.4 with acetic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile/water (3:2 by vol) as solvent B: 0 min 100% A; 4 min 58% A; 16 min 58% A; 24 min 55% A; 25 min 10% A; 29 min 10% A; 30 min 100% A. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Mass spectra of metabolites were collected as described above for bimane derivatives. Identification of Metabolites—Radioactive metabolites were identified, and where indicated, quantified as Bq, by matching corresponding peaks from selected ion and HPLC-RA traces and comparison of product ion mass spectra with authentic reference chemicals where available. When metabolites were quantified as moles, keto acids and thiols were quantified by the peak area of their UV-absorbing derivatives and amino acid derivatives were quantified by the abundance of their mass ions. Preparation of Extracts and Enzyme Assays—Cell-free extracts were prepared by ultrasonication of washed bacteria and clarified as described previously for mycobacteria (22Wheeler P.R. Gregory D. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1980; 121: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar) and by the same method but with 40 s (2 × 20 s) ultrasonication for E. coli, then desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The buffer used throughout was designed to maintain enzyme activities (23Lockwood B.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). γ- and β-Lyases and cysteine desulfhydrase activities were determined by assaying for the keto acids produced (24Ohmori S. Nakata K. Nishihara K. Yamamoto S. Kawase M. Tsuboi S. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 574: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Concentrations of substrates are given in the results section. CGS (MetB) was assayed for both the elimination reaction by detecting 2-ketobutyrate (24Ohmori S. Nakata K. Nishihara K. Yamamoto S. Kawase M. Tsuboi S. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 574: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the substitution reaction (25Ravanel S. Droux M. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 572-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) by stopping reactions by adding 4 μl of 1.25 m methane sulfonic acid, then detecting cystathionine formed by HPLC-MS of its PTC-derivative (see “Detection of Amino Acids” and Fig. 3). All enzyme assays were buffered with 50 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5. In all assays with cysteine, 1.25 mm dithioerythritol was included, or if the concentration of cysteine was above 1 mm, a 25% molar excess of dithioerythritol was included. The dithioerythritol was not transformed in any of the assays conducted (results not shown). Reactions were started by the addition of cell-free extract except when the effect of propargylglycine was tested (26Washtien W. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Johnston M. Jankowski D. Marcotte P. Tanaka H. Esaki N. Soda K. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4690-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Then, extracts were preincubated with propargylglycine (range of concentrations: 4–100 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C before starting the reaction by adding substrate. In all the protocols above, reactions were stopped by acidification to pH 3 or lower (24Ohmori S. Nakata K. Nishihara K. Yamamoto S. Kawase M. Tsuboi S. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 574: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Growth Experiments with M. bovis BCG cysA::Tn5367 That Can Be Used to Interpret Biochemical Pathways—If a methionine auxotroph is more susceptible to propargylglycine than its parent strain, this provides a line of evidence that it is dependent upon the propargylglycine-sensitive steps shown in Fig. 1, and that alternative pathways are not operating. First, we confirmed that M. bovis BCG cysA::Tn5367 used methionine as its sole sulfur source by showing its growth was limited by methionine. When Middlebrook 7H9 medium was supplemented with 30 μm methionine, the mean generation time was 1.0–1.2 days in log phase and it grew to a final OD600 of 1.0. Below 30 μm methionine, the final OD600 of cultures was proportional to the amount of methionine added to the medium (i.e. at 6 μm it was 0.2). The cysA mutant failed to grow in unsupplemented Middlebrook 7H9. Then, growth inhibition experiments were conducted with 0.1–200 μm propargylglycine. The MIC that inhibited growth (defined as never attaining an OD600 reading above 0.05 during 6 weeks at 37 °C) for propargylglycine was 1 μm for the cysA mutant, but 100 μm for the other three strains. The same MIC values were obtained with bacteria grown with methionine at 60 or 270 μm, or in unsupplemented Middlebrook 7H9, which supported growth of all the other strains (Table I) use"
https://openalex.org/W2080730150,"Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is exposed on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis. The protein annexin A5 (anxA5) shows high affinity for PtdSer. When anxA5 binds to the PtdSer-expressing membranes during apoptosis, it crystallizes as an extended two-dimensional network and activates thereby a novel portal of cell entry that results in the internalization of the PtdSer-expressing membrane patches. This novel pathway of cell entry is potentially involved in the regulation of the surface expression of membrane receptors. In this study we report the regulation of surface expression of the initiator of blood coagulation tissue factor (TF) by this novel pathway of cell entry. AnxA5 induces the internalization of tissue factor expressed on the surface of apoptotic THP-1 macrophages. This down-regulation depends on the abilities of anxA5 to bind to PtdSer and to form a two-dimensional crystal at the membrane. We furthermore show that THP-1 cells produce and externalize anxA5 that cause the internalization of TF in an autocrine type of mechanism. We extended our in vitro work to the in vivo situation and show in a mouse model that anxA5 causes the down-regulation of TF expression by smooth muscle cells of the media of the carotid artery that was mechanically injured. In conclusion, anxA5 down-regulates surface-expressed TF by activating the novel portal of cell entry. This mechanism may be part of a more general autocrine function of anxA5 to regulate the plasma membrane receptor repertoir under stress conditions associated with the surface expression of PtdSer.

Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 2Gerke V. Moss S.E. Biochim. Biophys.

The outer phospholipid leaflet of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells in contact with the extracellular environment is usually devoid of negatively charged phospholipids. Under certain conditions such as platelet activation or apoptosis the anionic phospholipid phosphatidyl-serine (PtdSer) is transported to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane involving the ABC1 transporter (4Marguet D. Luciani M.F. Moynault A. Williamson P. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Because of the high affinity for PtdSer, anxA5 has been used as a specific and reliable method to measure platelet activation (6Dachary-Prigent J. Freyssinet J.M. Pasquet J.M. Carron J.C. Nurden A.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and apoptosis in several experimental models (7Reutelingsperger C.P. Dumont E. Thimister P.W. van Genderen H. Kenis H. van de Eijnde S. Heidendal G. Hofstra L. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Although, it has been shown that anxA5 is involved in various intra- and extracellular processes including blood coagulation, signal transduction, anti-inflammatory processes, membrane trafficking, and ion channel activity (1Raynal P. Pollard H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 63-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 8Liemann S. Lewit-Bentley A.

Haemost. 1995; 73: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), the exact biological function of the anxA5 remains unknown (10Brachvogel B. Dikschas J. Moch H. Welzel H. von der Mark K. Hofmann C. Poschl E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2907-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the biological functions of anxA5 are believed to depend primarily on its interactions with lipids in membranes. In this regard, it has been shown that anxA5 enters a proteolipid complex, crystallizing in the form of an extended two-dimensional protein network in contact with the lipid bilayer and stabilized by protein-protein interactions (11Oling F. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This two-dimensional network is proposed to act as an antithrombotic shield on the surface of the placental syncytium (12Rand J.H. Wu X.X. Andree H.A. Lockwood C.J. Guller S. Scher J. Harpel P.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Recently our laboratory discovered that anxA5 and cell surface-expressed PtdSer open a novel portal of cell entry (71Kenis H. van Gendeven H. Bennaghmouch A. Rinia H.A. Frederik P. Narula J. Hofstra L. Reutelingsperger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52623-52629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). AnxA5 crystallizes in a two-dimensional network on the PtdSer-expressing membrane patch and bends thereby the patch into the cell leading to invagination, budding and endocytic vesicle formation. We hypothesized that the PtdSer-anxA5 portal of cell entry may internalize membrane proteins that are embedded in the Ptd-Ser-expressing membrane patch. A close interaction has been described for PtdSer and the coagulation protein tissue factor (TF) (13Oguchi A. Morioka M. Obi N. Nishida J. Kinoshita T. Int. J. Hematol. 1999; 69: 119-125PubMed Google Scholar, 14Osterud B. Blood Coag. Fibrinolysis. 1998; 9: S9-S14PubMed Google Scholar). TF, a 47-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein, is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily that initiates blood coagulation by binding the coagulation factor VII in its non-activated (FVII) and activated form (FVIIa) (15Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Brand K. Ruf W. Thromb. Haemost. 1991; 66: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The binary complex TF-FVII(a) proteolytically activates factors IX and X, triggering the downstream coagulation pathway (16Carson S.D. Brozna J.P. Blood Coag. Fibrinolysis. 1993; 4: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Rapaport S.I. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Osterud B.

TF is hardly present in the intima and media of healthy blood vessels, whereas it is abundant in the adventitia (20Nemerson Y. Giesen P.L.A. Blood Coag. Fibrinolysis. 1998; 9: S45-S47PubMed Google Scholar). In animal models of balloon injury, TF is rapidly induced in the smooth muscle cell (SMC) of the media (21Hatakeyama K. Asada Y. Marutsuka K. Kataoka H. Sato Y. Sumiyoshi A. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and accumulates in the SMC of the developing neointima (20Nemerson Y. Giesen P.L.A. Blood Coag. Fibrinolysis. 1998; 9: S45-S47PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hatakeyama K. Asada Y. Marutsuka K. Kataoka H. Sato Y. Sumiyoshi A. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Membrane phospholipids, especially PtdSer, are essential for the assembly of the coagulation complex including TF-FVIIa, factor IXa-factor VIIIa and factor Xa-factor Va, which ultimately leads to thrombin generation (22Mann K.G. Krishnaswamy S. Lawson J.H. Semin. Hematol. 1992; 29: 213-226PubMed Google Scholar, 23Rosing J. Speijer H. Zwaal R.F.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10319-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The exteriorization of PtdSer on the cell surface membrane during apoptosis enhances the procoagulant activities in several cell types (25Flynn P.D. Byrne C.D. Baglin T.P. Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Blood. 1997; 89: 4378-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. Petri M. Schlissel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface does not only constitute a suitable surface in which the coagulation reactions take place, but it has also been implied in the regulation of TF activity. It is believed that the exteriorization of PtdSer during apoptosis places PtdSer in close proximity to the extracellular domain of TF and enhances its cofactor function (28Kunzelmann-Marche C. Satta N. Toti F. Zhang Y. Nawroth P.P. Morrissey J.H. Freyssinet J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 83: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been shown that apoptotic cells show an increased TF activity, which can be inhibited by anxA5 (29Barrowcliffe T.W. Fabregas P. Jardi M. Cancelas J. Rabaneda M. Feiez J.

This could be explained by the fact that the crystallization of anxA5 when bound to PtdSer, provokes shielding of the procoagulant surface reducing the availability for anionic phospholipid-dependent coagulation reactions, such as the activation of factor X and IX by the TF-FVIIa complex (32Kondo S.

In the present study we have shown a new mechanism by which anxA5 plays its anticoagulant role. We have conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments showing that by modifying plasma membrane dynamics, anxA5 down-regulates the expression of the transmembrane protein TF through internalization in Ptd-Ser-containing patches.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureTHP-1 and Jurkat cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 with glutamax-I and phenol red (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories GmbH), 25 mm HEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. THP-1 monocytes were stimulated with 100 nm PMA for 24 h to differentiate into macrophage-like adherent cells.Labeling of ProteinsAnxA5 and its mutants M23 and M1234 were labeled with Oregon Green and Alexa 568 as described previously (71Kenis H. van Gendeven H.

FVIIa was labeled with fluorescein as described (36Bock P.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6633-6639Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, FVIIa (Novoseven, NovoNordisk) was reacted with N-α-[(acetylthio)acetyl]-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl. Then, 1 mg/ml acetylthioacetate-Phe-Pro-Arg-FVIIai was mixed with 0.5 mg/ml iodoacetamide fluorescein, to which 50 μl of 2 m NH2OH was added. After 1 h of incubation in the dark, the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled FVIIai (FVIIa-F) was separated from free dye on a PD-10 (G25) column equilibrated in sterile PBS. The concentration of the labeled proteins was determined by measurements of the absorbance at 496 nm.Cell StimulationTo induce apoptosis, THP-1 macrophages were treated with 100 μm etoposide (Sigma), a topoisomerase-II enzyme inhibitor, and Jurkat cells were stimulated with anti-Fas (200 ng/ml), both dissolved in serum-free Medium 199 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.5 mm CaCl2. The respective control cultures were incubated in equal volumes of culture media.Visualization of PtdSer ExpressionEtoposide-stimulated THP-1 macrophages were rinsed once with PBS. Binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) was added, which was supplemented with 1 μg/ml anxA5-Oregon Green and 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI). The cells were incubated in the dark for 5 min at room temperature, washed with binding buffer, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (4% (w/v) PFA, HEPES 10 mm, NaCl 140 mm, CaCl2 2.5 mm, pH 8) for 15 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were mounted in a solution containing glycerol 90%, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.002% NaN3, and 2% 1.4 diazabicyclo (2,2,2)-octane (DABCO, Merck) also with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole hydrochloride) to stain the nuclei. Confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) (Bio-Rad) was employed to visualize and quantify PtdSer-expressing cells. At least 2000 cells were counted in more than 20 fields. Apoptotic index was calculated as PtdSer-positive/PI-negative cells per 102 of total cells.CSLM Analysis of AnxA5 and FVIIa-F InternalizationTHP-1 macrophages or Jurkat cells, that were stimulated to express PtdSer, were incubated in M199 medium with 20 μg/ml anxA5-Alexa 568, 50 nm FVIIa-F, or 20 μg/ml anxA5-Alexa 568 + 50 nm FVIIa-F. The cytoskeleton-disrupting agents latrunculin B (Sigma) and colchicine (Sigma), and the anti-anxA5 monoclonal antibody WAC2a were added if indicated. After the treatment, cells were washed in PBS and then rapidly rinsed in a buffer containing EDTA, 5 mm, HEPES 25 mm, NaCl 140 mm, pH 7.4, and in a low pH glycine buffer containing glycine 0.1 m, pH 2.5 to remove surface-bound anxA5-Alexa 568 and FVIIa-F, respectively. Cells were fixed and mounted as described above. Slides were examined with CSLM, and the images were recorded and analyzed with NIH image, ImageJ software, and Adobe Photoshop. Control experiments were done with the anxA5 mutants M23-Alexa 568 and M1234-Alexa 568, which do not form a two-dimensional network on the surface and do not bind to PtdSer, respectively, and with anxA1-Alexa 568, which binds to PtdSer but does not form a two-dimensional network.AnxA5 Antigen QuantificationAnxA5 antigen was measured in the extracellular medium, and in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 macrophages stimulated or not with etoposide. Cells were collected, centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in PBS. Cell suspensions were lysed by five freeze-thaw steps, and soluble (cytosol) and insoluble (membrane) fractions were separated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Total protein concentration was determined by a protein determination assay (Micro BCA protein assay, Pierce), and anxA5 antigen was measured by an anxA5-specific ELISA (Zymutest Annexin V, Hyphen BioMed) as described previously (37Krailadsiri P. Seghatchian J. Amiral J. Vissac A.M. Contreras M. Trans. Sci. 1997; 18: 223-226Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Measurement of TF ActivityTF activity expressed at cell membrane surfaces was measured through its ability to enhance the FVIIa-catalyzed activation of factor X. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with etoposide in the presence of anxA5 (20 μg/ml), anxA1 (20 μg/ml), cytoskeleton-disrupting agents when necessary, and the anti-anxA5 antibody (10 μg/ml) for 4 h. After washing with PBS and sodium citrate buffer (sodium citrate 1 mg/ml, HEPES 25 mm, NaCl 140 mm, pH 7.4) to remove surface-bound anxA5 or anxA1, cells were first washed with rinse buffer (HEPES 10 mm, NaCl 136 mm, MgCl2 2 mm, KCl 2.7 mm, glucose 1 mg/ml, and bovine serum albumin 1 mg/ml, pH 7.5), and second incubated with a reaction mixture containing: 100 nm FX, 10 pm FVIIa, 3 mm CaCl2, and 200 μm Pentafluor FXa substrate (Pentapharm). Fluorescence tracings were recorded in a 96-well plate spectrofluorometer (Spectramax Gemini XS, Molecular Devices) at 37 °C with an excitation and emission wavelength of 350 and 450 nm, respectively. Known amounts of purified factor Xa were used to construct a reference line.Animal ModelTo perform the experiments in vivo, we used a mouse model of acute vascular injury (38Lindner V. Fingerle J. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Adult male 16–24-week-old Swiss Mice weighing between 30 and 45 g were anesthetized with an injection of pentobarbital (70 mg/kg i.p). A ventral incision was made in the neck area, the bifurcation of the right common carotid artery was exposed carefully, and the accompanying nerve was separated. To control the blood flow temporarily, we put three sutures: one proximally of the bifurcation of the artery and two distally of the bifurcation, one on each external carotid artery. A flexible wire of 0.35-mm diameter was inserted into the external carotid artery to remove the endothelium (3 times). Later, the flow was restored by releasing the sutures on the commune artery and the internal carotid artery. The external carotid artery was tied off proximally of the incision.For detection of PtdSer exposure, 4 mg/kg anxA5-Alexa 568 (two-photon microscopy analysis) or 4 mg/kg anxA5-biotin (immunohistochemical studies) were injected immediately after injury through the jugular vein. After 30 min, mice were perfused via the left ventricle with 0.9% saline for 3 min. To obtain evidence about the nature of the apoptotic cells, the injured right and uninjured left common carotid arteries from mice perfused with anxA5-Alexa 568 were immediately removed and frozen to -80. Afterward, samples were cut into cryosections of 6 μm, incubated in Syto-13 (green) for nuclei staining, and analyzed using a two-photon microscope (Bio-Rad 2100MP). To perform the immunohistochemical studies, mice that had received anxA5-biotin were perfused with 2% PFA solution and sacrificed. The injured right and uninjured left common carotid arteries were immediately removed, further fixed in a 1% PFA solution, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-μm longitudinal sections.Surgery was performed using a stereomicroscope (Leica MZ FL III, Leica, Switzerland). The mouse body temperature was maintained at 36.5 °C, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored.ImmunohistochemistryAnxA5-biotin and TF Staining—4-μm sections from uninjured and injured mouse arterial tissue were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated, and incubated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. For anxA5-biotin detection, slides were incubated in VECTASTAIN ABC kit PK-6100 for 30 min. For TF staining, sections were first incubated with rabbit anti-mouse TF antibodies (1:200) at 4 °C overnight and later with Swine anti-rabbit peroxidase (1:150) for 45 min. The sections were developed in a freshly prepared developing medium containing: DAB, Tris-HCl, and imidazole (activated with 1.5% of H2O2).Measuring Positivity—TF and anxA5-biotin-stained sections were digitally photographed. The images were used to quantify the staining with Adobe Photoshop software. The TF and anxA5-biotin-positive areas were measured in the intima/media layer and expressed in percentage of the total area.Statistical AnalysisResults are presented as mean ± S.D. Normal distribution of data were checked by means of the Shapiro-Wilks test. A Levene statistical test was performed to check the homogeneity of variances. The unpaired Student's test was used to assess statistical differences between data from two groups. Differences between data obtained from more than two experimental conditions were tested by a one-way analysis of variance. Subsequent analysis for significant differences between two groups was performed by means of the multiple comparison Sheffe's test. Probability values of <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSThe PS-anxA5 Portal of Cell Entry Is Present in THP-1 Macrophages—We investigated the internalization of the transmembrane receptor tissue factor through the PtdSer-anxA5 portal of cell entry (71Kenis H. van Gendeven H.

THP-1 macrophages were selected because they express both the transmembrane receptor tissue factor and PtdSer constitutively as well as inducibly (28Kunzelmann-Marche C. Satta N. Toti F. Zhang Y. Nawroth P.P. Morrissey J.H. Freyssinet J.M. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 83: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of PtdSer was up-regulated by activation of apoptosis with etoposide (39Zhuang J. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Incubating THP-1 macrophages with etoposide over 4 h increased the number of PtdSer-expressing cells from 6.9 ± 2.9% to 15.1 ± 5% when measured with anxA5-Oregon Green (Fig. 1).Next, we examined whether PtdSer-expressing THP-1 macrophages internalize anxA5. THP-1 macrophages were incubated with or without etoposide in the presence of anxA5-Alexa 568 and analyzed by CSLM. Fig. 2 shows that 11.3 ± 2.0% of untreated cells (Fig. 2, panel A) and 19.6 ± 1.9% of etoposide-treated cells (Fig. 2B) internalized anxA5-Alexa 568. The cells that had internalized anxA5-Alexa 568 expressed PtdSer at their cell surface, as was demonstrated by washing with EDTA followed by incubation with anxA5-Oregon Green (Fig. 2, panel C). We confirmed that the uptake occurred through the PtdSer-anxA5 portal of cell entry by examining the internalization of the anxA5 mutants M1234-Alexa 568 and M23-Alexa 568. Both mutants were not internalized (data not shown), indicating that the internalization of anxA5-Alexa 568 is dependent on its ability to bind to PtdSer and to organize in a two-dimensional network on the membrane surface (71Kenis H. van Gendeven H. Bennaghmouch A. Rinia H.A. Frederik P. Narula J. Hofstra L. Reutelingsperger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52623-52629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The latter dependence was confirmed by experiments with anxA1, which binds to PtdSer without forming a two-dimensional network (40Govorukhina N. Bergsma-Schutter W. Maze ̀res-Dubut C. Maze ̀res S. Drakopoulou E. Bystrykh L. Oling F. Mukhopadhyay A. Reviakine I. dai Kee Him J. Brisson A. Bandorowicz-Pikula J. Annexins: Biological Importance and Annexin-related Pathologies. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown2002: 40-58Google Scholar). THP-1 macrophages that were incubated with etoposide and anxA1-Alexa 568 showed a modest internalization of anxA1 (Fig. 3, panel A). It has been suggested that macrophages present an anxA1 receptor (41Fan X. Krahling S. Smith D. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2863-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), making it highly probable that the observed internalization of anxA1-Alexa 568 occurred through the internalization of the ligated anxA1 receptor. This latter type of internalization depends on the polymerization of actin (42Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar) whereas anxA5 internalization does not (71Kenis H. van Gendeven H. Bennaghmouch A. Rinia H.A. Frederik P. Narula J. Hofstra L. Reutelingsperger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52623-52629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We inhibited actin polymerization and endocytic vesicle trafficking in THP-1 macrophages with latrunculin B and colchicine, respectively. These cytoskeletal-disrupting agents prevented anxA1-Alexa 568 internalization (Fig. 3, panel C) but not anxA5-Alexa 568 internalization (Fig. 3D). These results clearly demonstrate that the PS-anxA5 portal of cell entry is present in THP-1 macrophages.Fig. 2THP-1 macrophages with surface-expressed PtdSer internalize anxA5. THP-1 macrophages were either untreated or treated with 100 μm etoposide for 4 h in the presence of 20 μg/ml anxA5-Alexa 568. The cells were subsequently analyzed by CSLM. Panel A, THP-1 macrophages that were incubated with anxA5-Alexa 568. Panel B, THP-1 macrophages that were incubated with etoposide and anxA5-Alexa 568. To detect PtdSer exposure in those cells with anxA5 internalized, apoptotic cells were treated with EDTA and counterstained with anxA5-Oregon Green (panel C).

Panel D, quantification of the number of THP-1 macrophages internalizing anxA5-Alexa 568 in the absence (control, white bars, n = 6) and in the presence of etoposide (gray bars, n = 10). *, p < 0.05 compared with untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3THP-1 macrophages internalize anxA1 and anxA5 through distinct mechanisms.Panels A and B present CSLM analyses of THP-1 macrophages that were co-incubated with 100 μm etoposide and 20 μg/ml anxA1-Alexa 568 (A)or20 μg/ml anxA5-Alexa 568 (20 μg/ml) (B). Panels C and D present CSLM analyses of THP-1 macrophages that were stimulated with etoposide and the cytoskeleton-disrupting agents latrunculin B and colchicine in the presence of anxA1-Alexa 568 (panel C) or anxA5-Alexa 568 (panel D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TF Is Internalized through the PS-AnxA5 Portal of Cell Entry—To analyze TF internalization we selected its ligand FVIIa as the TF-imaging probe. For that purpose FVIIa was labeled with fluorescein at its active site yielding a fluorescent FVIIa derivative (FVIIa-F) that blocked TF activity completely (data not shown), indicating that FVIIa-F binds to TF in the same manner as FVIIa.Incubation of THP-1 macrophages with FVIIa-F in the absence or in the presence of etoposide resulted in a modest internalization of FVIIa-F (Fig. 4, panels A and B). 13.5 ± 2.9% and 18.8 ± 4.4% of the THP-1 macrophages internalized FVIIa-F in the absence and presence of etoposide, respectively (Fig. 4, panel D). The relation of FVIIa-F internalization with etoposide treatment was comparable to that of anxA5-Alexa 568 internalization (Fig. 2, panel D), suggesting an involvement of cell surface-expressed PtdSer. To investigate whether PtdSer and TF are part of the same membrane patch, THP-1 macrophages were incubated with etoposide in the presence of anxA5-Alexa 568 and FVIIa-F. CSLM analysis revealed that both anxA5-Alexa 568 and FVIIa-F were internalized massively and showed co-localization in endocytic vesicles (F"

However, we show here that Erk kinase inhibitors were unable to prevent B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-induced apoptosis, leading us to speculate that Erk kinases are linked to regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor. Cotreatment of hepa1c1c7 cells with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and Erk kinase inhibitor PD98059, U0126, or SL327 led to enhanced nuclear accumulation of Ah receptor but with a reduced capacity to complement TCDD induction of Cyp1a1. This is explained in part by the ability of Erk kinase inhibitors to alter the steady-state levels of cellular Ah receptor, a result that leads to a dramatic induction in detectable receptor levels. These changes in cellular Ah receptor levels are associated with delayed degradation of the Ah receptor because TCDD-initiated degradation is reversed when cells are co-treated with TCDD and Erk kinase inhibitors. Erk kinase is linked to Ah receptor expression, as demonstrated by reductions in total Ah receptor levels after overexpression of constitutively active MEK1. In addition, Erk kinase activity modulates the transcriptional response because MEK1 overexpression enhances TCDD-initiated transactivation potential of the receptor. Thus, Erk kinase activity facilitates ligand-initiated transcriptional activation while targeting the Ah receptor for degradation. Immunoprecipitation experiments of the Ah receptor indicate that Erk kinase activity is associated with the receptor. It is interesting that the carboxyl region of the Ah receptor is associated with the transactivation region as well as the site for ubiquitination, indicating that Erk kinase-dependent phosphorylation targets the carboxyl region of the receptor.

Upon association with ligand, the Ah receptor rapidly migrates to the nucleus, where it partners with another basic helix-loop-helix protein, Arnt, to form a transcriptionally active complex that is capable of binding to enhancer sequences. Initiated by ligand binding, conformational changes in hsp90 and the hsp90-interacting protein p23 lead to unmasking of a nuclear localization sequence that triggers uptake of the Ah receptor to the nucleus (5Bunger M.K.

Once in the nucleus, partnering of the Ah receptor with Arnt leads to displacement of hsp90 and the formation of a transcriptional complex that associates with xenobiotic-responsive elements (XREs) followed by transcriptional activation of target genes (7Thomas R.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8432-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the cellular or signaling events that lead to ligand-dependent proteolysis. Because the carboxyl end of the Ah receptor plays a critical role in both transcriptional potential and cellular half-life, it is quite possible that this region of the receptor contains important target sequences that are subject to cellular signaling events required for function. Along with the mechanics of ligand binding and nuclear translocation, evidence exists that intracellular signaling pathways play an important role in Ah receptor activation. Ah receptor ligands such as TCDD are known to activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, such as the Erk1/2 MAP kinases, the p38 MAP kinases, and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (15Tan Z. Chang X. Puga A. Xia Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Tan Z. Huang M. Puga A. Xia Y. Toxicol. Sci. 2004; Google Scholar, 17Hoffer A. Chang C.Y. Puga A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 238-247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular cross-talk between these kinases and the cellular mechanisms underlying gene expression through Ah receptor activation seem evident because chemical inhibitors of Erk, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 kinases interfere with TCDD-mediated transcriptional activation of Cyp1 genes (18Guo M. Joiakim A. Dudley D.T. Reiners J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Davis Jr., J.W. Burdick A.D. Lauer F.T. Burchiel S.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2003; 188: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the treatment of mouse hepa cells with Erk kinase inhibitors PD98059 (20Dudley D.T. Pang L.

Chang X. Puga A. Xia Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has also demonstrated that pyridinyl imidazole compounds, inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase activity, weakly inhibit histone acetyltransferase activity, potentially inhibiting TCDD induction of Cyp1a1 transcription (22Shibazaki M. Takeuchi T. Ahmed S. Kikuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3869-3876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms linking kinase control and Ah receptor directed gene transcription are blurred by findings that most kinase inhibitors also inhibit ligand binding to the Ah receptor (23Joiakim A. Mathieu P.A. Palermo C. Gasiewicz T.A. Reiners Jr., J.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 1279-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Reiners Jr., J.J. Lee J.Y. Clift R.E. Dudley D.T. Myrand S.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, PD98059, an Erk kinase inhibitor with structural similarity to Ah receptor inhibitory flavonoids (25Zhang S. Qin C. Safe S.H. Environ. Health Perspect. 2003; 111: 1877-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), directly interferes with TCDD binding to the Ah receptor (24Reiners Jr., J.J. Lee J.Y. Clift R.E. Dudley D.T. Myrand S.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been observed with the pyridinyl imidazole compounds that are used as tools to inhibit p38 MAP kinase. Thus, definitive evidence that MAP kinase activity participates in Ah receptor-mediated control is lacking. We have recently demonstrated that the cellular and molecular actions associated with the carcinogenic actions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) can be attributed in part to involvement of the Ah receptor as well as MAP kinases (26Chen S. Nguyen N. Tamura K. Karin M. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19526-19533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Benzo[a]pyrene activates the Ah receptor, leading to induction of CYP1 proteins and the resulting metabolism of B[a]P to B[a]P-7,8-epoxide. The formation of B[a]P-7,8-epoxide becomes a substrate for epoxide hydrolase and the formation of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol. Although B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol has limited mutagenic potential, metabolism by the CYP1 proteins leads to the generation of the ultimate carcinogen, B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE-2). It is interesting that B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol is an efficient Ah receptor ligand that can activate the receptor to a DNA binding form, resulting in the induction of microsomal CYP1A1. It is assumed that the induction of CYP1A1 facilitates the metabolism of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol to BPDE-2. The intracellular formation of BPDE-2 culminates in cellular apoptosis. Because apoptosis and Ah receptor control have been linked to the actions of the MAP kinase family of proteins, we became interested in examining the contribution of cellular signaling events as modulators of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-initiated apoptosis. Exposure of human HepG2 cells and mouse hepa1c1c7 cells to either B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol or BPDE-2 leads to the activation of Erk kinase as well as p38 (26Chen S. Nguyen N. Tamura K. Karin M. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19526-19533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation by MAP kinase inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 and the blockage of p38 activation by SB203580 each prevented BPDE-2-induced apoptosis in mouse hepa1c1c7 cells. It is noteworthy that p38 activation has been implicated in apoptosis, particularly with agents that lead to nuclear stress and DNA damage. This was verified when p38-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (p38–/–) were shown to be resistant to the apoptotic actions of BPDE-2 (26Chen S. Nguyen N. Tamura K. Karin M. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19526-19533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hence, there are important ties linking the actions of cellular MAP kinases to Ah receptor-mediated metabolism of B[a]P and the onset of an apoptotic episode. These findings led us to initiate a series of experiments examining in greater detail the potential link between Erk kinase and apoptosis. We will present evidence that activation of the Ah receptor by B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol targets apoptosis independent of the actions of Erk kinase and BPDE-2-initiated apoptosis. However, the actions of Erk kinase have a dramatic effect on the functional parameters of the Ah receptor, linking phosphorylation as an important signaling pathway in the transactivation potential of the receptor as well as its susceptibility and targeting for ubiquitination.

Wild-type mouse hepa1c1c7 and Arnt-defective BPRc1 cells were a generous gift from Dr. James Whitlock (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). All cell lines in this study were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (10,000 units/ml). Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Whole Cell Extracts and Nuclear Extracts—For total cellular protein preparations, cells were collected from a single P100 tissue culture plate and lysed in a buffer containing 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with a complement of protease and phosphatase mixture inhibitors (Sigma). After incubation of this mixture for 30 min on ice, the preparation was centrifuged for 20 min in a refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was collected and used for Western blot studies. To obtain nuclear protein preparations (10Chen Y-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), cells were grown and treated in P150 plates, the media removed and the cells washed twice with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, before being collected by scraping into 1 ml of MDH buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The cells were then homogenized with 30 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem power-driven tissue homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was washed twice in 1 ml of MDHK buffer (3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m KCl). This pellet was then suspended in 100 μl of HDK buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 0.4 m KCl) and lysed on ice for 30 min. This solution was centrifuged for 20 min in a refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge at 16,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was collected and glycerol was added, giving a final glycerol concentration of 10%, and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman Coulter TL100 table-top ultracentrifuge. The final supernatant was designated as nuclear extract. Protein concentrations for all samples were determined by Bio-Rad analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA Fragmentation—Detection of apoptotic oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was performed as described previously (26Chen S. Nguyen N. Tamura K. Karin M. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19526-19533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were exposed to different concentrations of B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol for 24 h, and the cells were collected after trypsinization and centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 55 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.8% SDS) and treated with 20 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by the addition of 25 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for incubation at 55 °C overnight. Lysates were extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the DNA was precipitated after the addition of 2 volumes of ice-cold ethyl alcohol. The DNA was collected in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge, the alcohol solution was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm EDTA. The DNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Reverse Transcription of RNA Followed by PCR Analysis for Cyp1a1 RNA Content—Total RNA was extracted from cells using acidic phenol/guanidinium isothiocyanate solution (TRIzol; Invitrogen). Using Onmiscript Reverse Transcriptase reagents (Qiagen), ∼2 μg of total RNA was used for the generation of cDNA, as outlined by the manufacturer. After synthesis of cDNA, amplification of mouse Cyp1a1 was performed with sense (5′-CTGGCTGTCACCGTATTCTGC-3′) and antisense (5′-GGGTATCCAGAGCCAGTAACC-3′) primers at a final concentration of 1 μm (28Galijatovic A. Beaton D. Nguyen N. Chen S. Bonzo J. Johnson R. Maeda S. Karin M. Guengerich F.P. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). Using 2 μl of the cDNA reaction, PCR analysis was conducted using HotStarTaq (Qiagen) reagents, as outlined by the manufacturer. Cycling was carried out at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 95 °C (30 s), 58 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (60 s) for 35 cycles. After 10 cycles, mouse actin oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-ATGGCCACTGCCGCATCCTC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGTACATGGTGGTACCACC-3′) were added to a final concentration of 0.5 μm. The protocol was preceded by an extended elongation time of 10 min at 72 °C. Western Blot Analysis—All Western blots were performed using NuPAGE gel electrophoresis as outlined by the supplier (Invitrogen). Protein was heated at 70 °C for 10 min in loading buffer and resolved on appropriate gels under denaturing conditions, and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry transfer system (Norvex). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Each membrane was again washed, and the conjugated horseradish peroxidase was detected using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system and scanned with a Storm 840 scanner (both from Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—A complementary pair of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides containing the sequence 5′-GATCCGGCTCTTGTCACGCAACTCCGAGCTCA-3′ and 5′-GATCTGAGCTCGGAGTTGCGTGAGAAGAGCCG-3′ (10Chen Y-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were synthesized, annealed, and labeled at their 5′ ends by using Klenow and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). DNA binding was measured by EMSA. The binding reactions contained nuclear protein (10 μg), 2.4 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded XRE in a final volume of 30 μl that contained 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol (v/v). To determine the specificity of binding to XRE, a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled XRE oligonucleotide was used. DNA-protein complexes were separated under nondenaturing conditions on a 6% polyacrylamide gel using 1× TBE (89 mm Tris borate, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) as a running buffer. The protein-DNA complexes were visualized using a Storm 840 scanner. Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase Assay—Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase analysis was carried out as described previously (29Rutten A.A. Falke H.E. Catsburg J.F. Wortelboer H.M. Blaauboer B.J. Doorn L. van Leeuwen F.X. Theelen R. Rietjens I.M. Arch. Toxicol. 1992; 66: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells in 6-well plates and treated overnight. Media was replaced containing 1.5 mm salicylamide and 2.5 μm ethoxyresorufin, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. A sample of media was removed, and resorufin was determined by fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 530 nm; emission wavelength, 590 nm), and activity quantitated from standard curves. Ligand Binding Assay—Analysis of ligand binding to the Ah receptor was carried out by examining the ability of various chemicals to interfere with [3H]TCDD binding to the cytosolic receptor (30Seidel S.D. Winters G.M. Rogers W.J. Ziccardi M.H. Li V. Keser B. Denison M.S. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2001; 15: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For cytosol preparation, cells were collected and resuspended in HED buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After homogenizing the cells through 20–30 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjm tissue grinder, an equal volume of HED2G buffer (HED buffer with 20% glycerol) was added and the mixture centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min in a refrigerated Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant was transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a tabletop centrifuge (TL100; Beckman Coulter), and the supernatant was used in binding assays. In this assay, 500 μl of hepa1c1c7 cytosol (5 mg/ml) was incubated with 1–10 nm [3H]TCDD (original specific activity of 27.5 Ci/mmol). For each assay, to monitor competitive binding, a control binding assay was conducted that included 1 μm TCDF. Competition for binding was analyzed using different concentrations of U0126, PD98059, and β-naphthoflavone. All reagents were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. To remove free [3H]TCDD, dextran-coated charcoal (5 mg of charcoal/5 mg of protein) was added to each binding reaction, the mixture was incubated for 10 min on ice, and the dextran-charcoal was removed by centrifugation. 300 μl of cytosol was layered onto linear 10–30% sucrose density gradients prepared in HEDG buffer (HED buffer supplement with 10% glycerol). Gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for 16 h at 235,000 × g in a Beckman Coulter SW60 Ti rotor. The gradients were collected by puncturing the bottom of the tube and collecting 200 μl per fraction, and the radioactivity in each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding of [3H]TCDD to the Ah-receptor was calculated as a percentage of the [3H]TCDD bound in control samples containing no competitor. Expression Vectors and Transient Transfection—A human MEK1 wild-type expression plasmid and a MEK1 constitutively active variant (point mutations at S218E and S222A, and a deletion of amino acid residues 31–52) were introduced into expression vector pMEV-2HA (Biomyx) (31Mansour S.J.

For transient expression studies, hepa1c1c7 cells were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates in medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 24 h of culture, 4 μg of plasmid were transfected into each well using Lipofectamine 2000. After incubation for 48 h, whole cell extracts were prepared and used in Western blot analysis for the detection of Ah receptor and phosphorylated Erk1/2. Plasmids pCMV/GRDBD/AhR and p(GRE)2T105Luc were kindly provided by Dr. Lawrence Poellinger (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). The plasmid pCMV/GRDBD/AhR contains an N-terminal zinc finger DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor linked to the C-terminal amino acids 83–805 of the Ah receptor. This construct can be activated by ligand as measured by GRE-driven luciferase activity when cotransfected with the p(GRE)2T105Luc plasmid (8Whitelaw M.L. Gustafsson J.A. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8343-8355Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of pCMV/GRDBD/AhR and 4 μg of p(GRE)2T105Luc plasmids; after 24 h, the cells were treated with TCDD or Erk kinase inhibitors. To examine the effect of MEK1 expression, 2 μg of the MEK1 wild-type or constitutively active expression plasmids were also included. Luciferase Activity Assay—Luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (10Chen Y-H. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26261-26266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells were treated and lysed on plates in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used for luciferase and protein assays. A cell extract aliquot of 10 μl was mixed with 100 μl of reaction mixture, which contained 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 4 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tricine, and 1 mm DTT. Reactions were started by adding 30 μl of luciferin (0.3 mg/ml) and light output measured for 10 s at 24 °C using a LMax II384 luminometer (Molecular Devices). The results were normalized by protein concentrations. Coimmunoprecipitation with Anti-Ah Receptor Antibody—Cells were treated for 5 h with either TCDD or U0126 and collected after trypsinization. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.2% Tween 20 supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and"
https://openalex.org/W2027702572,"The human constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is an important ligand-activated regulator of oxidative and conjugative enzymes and transport proteins. Because of the lack of a crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain (LBD), wide species differences in ligand specificity and the scarcity of well characterized ligands, the factors that determine CAR ligand specificity are not clear. To address this issue, we developed highly defined homology models of human CAR LBD to identify residues lining the ligand-binding pocket and to perform molecular dynamics simulations with known human CAR modulators. The roles of 22 LBD residues for basal activity, ligand selectivity, and interactions with co-regulators were studied using site-directed mutagenesis, mammalian co-transfection, and yeast two-hybrid assays. These studies identified several amino acids within helices 3 (Asn165), 5 (Val199), 11 (Tyr326, Ile330, and Gln331), and 12 (Leu343 and Ile346) that contribute to the high basal activity of human CAR. Unique residues within helices 3 (Ile164 and Asn165), 5 (Cys202 and His203), and 7 (Phe234 and Phe238) were found control the selectivity for CAR activators and inhibitors.

Receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormone and retinoic acid (RAR) are critical for cellular differentiation and development, whereas many “adopted orphan” receptors are metabolic sensors regulating cholesterol, fatty acid, and glucose turnover (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schu ̈tz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

The most important structural component found in NRs is the ligand-binding domain (LBD). The NRs display great selectivity for ligands because of distinct sizes, contours, and lipophilicities of their ligand-binding pockets (LBP) that are caused by variations of the lining residues. Ligand binding induces conformational changes in the LBD. These changes allow the NR to recruit co-activators needed for histone acetylation, or co-repressors required for histone deacetylation at the NR target gene (4Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 5Weatherman R.V. Fletterick R.J. Scanlan T.S. Annu. Rev.

After binding of an agonist, helix 12 is stabilized in an orientation where it forms a hydrophobic co-activator surface together with helices 3 and 4, and the conserved “charge clamp” residues glutamate (helix 12) and lysine (helix 3) are essential for co-activator binding and ligand-induced NR activation. This co-activator surface overlaps with the binding site for co-repressors that are composed of helices 3 and 4. Antagonist binding stabilizes another orientation of helix 12, which prevents co-activator recruitment and promotes co-repressor binding (6Steinmetz A.C. Renauld J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The human constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) belongs to the nuclear receptor subfamily 1I together with pregnane X (PXR, NR1I2) and vitamin D receptors (VDR, NR1I1) (7Robinson-Rechavi M.

CAR and PXR share some ligands including a variety of xenobiotics, steroid hormones, and prescription drugs. These two receptors are important activators of overlapping sets of genes that code for cytochrome P-450, conjugative enzymes, and transport proteins (9Ueda A. Hamadeh H.K. Webb H.K. Yamamoto Y.

Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CAR also protects against the toxicity of endogenous cholestatic bile acids and bilirubin by enhancing their metabolism (17Guo G.L. Lambert G. Negishi M. Ward J.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Kliewer S.A.

Important hepatic enzymes that are involved in fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism such as squalene epoxidase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 are repressed by CAR (9Ueda A.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 409: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Unlike most NRs, human and mouse CAR have high constitutive activity in the absence of any added ligand (20Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.-S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This seems to be because of the constitutive interaction of CAR with several co-activators including SRC-1, GRIP-1, PGC-1, and TIF2 (21Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.S. Chen J. Simhal D. Seol W.

The prototypic cytochrome P-450 inducer phenobarbital stimulates translocation of CAR, but has not been shown to bind CAR LBD unlike many other activators (12Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Nature Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 13Honkakoski P. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The differences in ligand specificity between human and mouse CAR are significant. For example, mouse CAR is inhibited by a limited set of steroids related to 3α-androstenol (ANDR) (21Forman B.M. Tzameli I. Choi H.S. Chen J. Simhal D. Seol W. Evans R.M. Moore D.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 24Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Ma ̈kinen J. Gynther J. Savolainen H.

Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and 17α-ethynyl-3,17β-estradiol (EE2) (28Ma ̈kinen J. Reinisalo M. Niemi K. Viitala P. Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Chung H. Pelkonen O. Honkakoski P. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 465-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are potent activators of mouse CAR. However, they do not activate human CAR at all (13Honkakoski P. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and EE2 even inhibits it (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Ma ̈kinen J. Gynther J. Savolainen H. Poso A. Honkakoski P. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4687-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, of the few known modulators of human CAR, EE2 and ANDR are repressors (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Ma ̈kinen J. Gynther J.

Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A likely explanation for this discrepancy is the use of different cell lines in co-transfection assays. It is known that the responses of selective modulators of estrogen and progesterone receptors vary because of differential content and selection of NR co-regulators in cell lines (35Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 36Lin Z. Auboeuf D. Wong J. Chen J.D. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7940-7944Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In our studies with HEK293 cells, clotrimazole has consistently activated human CAR (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Ma ̈kinen J. Gynther J.

Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of human CAR LBD has not been reported, and partly for that reason the molecular determinants for its ligand specificity remain obscure. We wished to study the importance of the amino acid residues forming the LBP of human CAR. To select the critical residues for mutation analysis, homology models of human CAR LBD were created. Twenty-two LBP amino acids were identified and alanine scanning mutagenesis was carried out. The activities and ligand specificities of these mutants were tested in mammalian activity assays. The yeast two-hybrid assay was applied to study the interactions between the mutated LBDs and the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR). Then, to gain insight to the molecular mechanisms of ligand binding, improved CAR models were constructed, and the ligands were docked and run through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Various ligand derivatives were used to complement the mutation analysis. These studies identified, for the first time, several amino acids that (i) contribute to the high basal activity of human CAR, (ii) control the ligand selectivity, and (iii) explain some of the species differences in CAR ligand specificity. Chemicals—All steroids were at least 99% pure and from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). TMPP and triphenyl phosphate (TPP) were synthesized and purified to more than 99% purity (32Honkakoski P. Palvimo J.J. Penttila ̈ L. Vepsa ̈la ̈inen J. Auriola S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of highest quality and bought from Sigma or Biomol (Plymouth, PA). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma. DNA Plasmids—The cytomegalovirus promoter-driven GAL4-human CAR LBD (residues 108–348) fusion protein plasmid has been described (30Ma ̈kinen J. Frank C. Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Gynther J. Carlberg C. Honkakoski P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The GAL4-human CARΔ8 (residues 108–340) plasmid lacking eight residues of helix 12 was generated by standard PCR methods. Alanine scanning mutants of the human CAR LBD were done according to instructions in the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The GAL4-dependent reporter UAS4-tk-luciferase plasmid was a gift from R. M. Evans, and pCMVβ was purchased from Clontech, Inc. All plasmids were purified with Qiagen columns (Hilden, Germany) and LBD regions were verified by dideoxy sequencing. Co-transfection Assays—HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were cultured and transfected with GAL4-LBD expression vector, GAL4-responsive reporter, and β-galactosidase control plasmid as described (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J.

Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Chung H. Pelkonen O. Honkakoski P. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 465-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Every transfection experiment also contained expression vectors for GAL4 lacking any LBD and wild-type human CAR LBD for standardization. After transfection, cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of vehicle (0.1%, v/v) or test chemicals. The optimum concentrations were chosen from preliminary dose-response tests. The cells were washed, lysed, and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activities (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Ma ̈kinen J. Gynther J. Savolainen H. Poso A. Honkakoski P. J. Med.

The normalized luciferase activities are from three to six independent transfections and expressed as mean ± S.E. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The human CAR and all mutant LBDs were inserted between the EcoRI and BamHI sites in pGBKT7 plasmid (Clontech). pGADT7 plasmids containing human NCoR and human SRC-1 NR interaction domains (NRID) have been reported (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J.

Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar)) were amplified from human RNA and inserted into pGADT7 accordingly. Yeast colonies were selected, amplified, and treated with vehicle or CAR modulators for 3.5 h, and β-galactosidase activities and cell densities were measured as described previously (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J.

Each experiment included recombinant yeast expressing GAL4 alone or wild-type human CAR for standardization. The normalized β-galactosidase activities (mean ± S.E.) are from two separate experiments, each with three independent colonies. Computational Methods—The initial homology model was built on the VDR LBD template (39Rochel N. Wurtz J.M. Mitschler A. Klaholz B. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) using Quanta98 software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) and CLUSTALW alignment (40Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56214) Google Scholar). The coordinates of CAR side chains were taken from VDR when identical or from Ponder's rotamer library (41Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Minimization in vacuo was done using the Adopted-Basis Newton Raphson method of the CHARMM program (42Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14054) Google Scholar). The ligands were docked manually, and MD simulations were done using the AMBER7.0 simulation package (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and the Cornell et al. (43Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11686) Google Scholar) force field. The parameters of the ligands were generated with the Antechamber suite of AMBER7.0 in conjunction with the general amber force field. The atomic point charges of ligands were calculated with the two-stage RESP (44Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10280Crossref Scopus (5848) Google Scholar) fit at the HF/6–31G* level using ligand geometries optimized with the semi-empirical PM3 method using the Gaussian98 program (Gaussian Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). The final homology models of the human CAR LBD with NRID peptides were built using INSIGHT II (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) based on CLUSTAL W alignments (40Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56214) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). PXR (45Watkins R.E. Davis-Searles P. Lambert M.H. Redinbo M.R. J. Mol.

Cell. 2000; 5: 173-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) were used as template structures for human CAR and CAR/SRC-1 complex, whereas the structure of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α complexed with silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid receptors (46Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) was included to model the human CAR/NCoR complex. Non-conserved side chains were assigned by SCWRL 2.95 (47Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). This program has given excellent agreement within the LBP residues when applied to crystal structures of estrogen receptor, VDR, and PXR. The protonation state was adjusted to mimic pH 7.4. MD simulations of the models were performed in a solvent box filled with SPC water (48Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reidel, Dordrecht1981: 331-342Google Scholar). Na+ and Cl- ions were added to ensure the overall neutrality of the systems. The models were minimized using 2000 steps of steepest descent within the GROMOS96 force field (GROMACS version 3.14). MD simulations with periodic boundary conditions were performed at 310 K using the program package GROMACS. The Particle-Mesh-Ewald method was applied for long-range electrostatic interactions, a cutoff of 0.9 nm was used for van der Waals interactions, and constant pressure was maintained at 105 pascal. The CAR model without any NRID peptide was equilibrated with decreasing constraints (from 1000 to 100 KJ/mol) on backbone atoms for 400 ps, followed by a free MD simulation of 2.25 ns. For the models with NRID peptides, an equilibration period of 250 ps with constraints of 1000 KJ/mol on the backbone atoms (excluding residues 24–52 because the VDR template was engineered in this part) was followed by a free MD simulation carried out for 2.25 ns. Bonds between heavy atoms and their corresponding hydrogen atoms were constrained to their equilibrium length using the LINCS algorithm. Because the interaction between the ligand-free CAR and NCoR is absent or very weak (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Ma ̈kinen J. Gynther J. Savolainen H. Poso A. Honkakoski P. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 4687-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Ma ̈kinen J. Frank C. Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Gynther J. Carlberg C. Honkakoski P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), ANDR and EE2 were first docked into the LBP prior MD simulations (docking procedure described below). Trajectories of the free MD simulations were analyzed using NMRCLUST (49Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Resulting clusters were examined and the representative frames were minimized with GROMACS. The stereochemical quality of the models was evaluated using PROCHECK (50Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and PROFILES-3D (51Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 208-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The size of the LBP was determined using the program SURFNET (52Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Ligands were built within SYBYL 6.9 considering their protonation state at pH 7.4 and minimized using the TRIPOS force field and default settings (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Docking procedures were performed with GOLD 2.1 (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Goldscore was chosen as fitness function. For each ligand, docking runs were performed with a maximum allowed number of 30 poses. These were grouped into clusters (Table I). For dockings of clotrimazole and TMPP in CAR-SRC1 as well as ANDR and EE2 in CAR-NCoR models, MD simulations were performed with the settings described above. Missing parameters for the ligands were obtained manually using the GROMOS96 topology. Figures were prepared using VMD (53Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol.

None of the chemicals changed the activity of GAL4 only. In competition assays (Fig. 1, B and C), the presence of TMPP and clotrimazole shifted the inhibition curves of EE2 and ANDR to the right, with 5–10-fold increases in apparent IC50 values. Therefore, the inhibitors and activators compete for the same or overlapping binding site within the human CAR LBD. Because the ligand response is a net result from interactions of human CAR with associated co-regulators, yeast two-hybrid assays with NRID peptides from SRC-1 and NCoR were set up. There was a very strong basal interaction between human CAR and the SRC-1 NRID (Fig. 1D) that was not much affected by TMPP, increased 35% by clotrimazole, and decreased 10–20% by the inhibitors ANDR and EE2. The very weak basal interaction between human CAR and the NCoR NRID was not affected by TMPP, modestly increased (3-fold) by clotrimazole, and strongly enhanced (over 12-fold) by inhibitors ANDR and EE2. Our data support the results that human CAR inhibitors act by promoting NCoR interaction and activators slightly increase SRC-1 interaction (24Jyrkka ̈rinne J. Ma ̈kinen J. Gynther J. Savolainen H.

https://openalex.org/W1977510226,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a signaling protein that binds to Patched and mediates its effects through Gli transcription factors. Shh is important in regulating survival and growth in both the embryo and the adult. It is known to be involved in pituitary development, but its role in the adult pituitary has not been investigated. Here, we show Shh and Gli1 immunoreactivity in adult human corticotroph cells. Administration of Shh (5 microg/ml) alone and in combination with corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH; 100 nM) in dispersed rat anterior pituitary and AtT-20 mouse corticotrophinoma cells increased corticotrophin (ACTH) secretion and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) promoter activity. Shh and CRH act additively in increasing CRH receptor 1 (CRH-R1). Unexpectedly, we found that CRH on its own increased Gli-dependent transcription, which in turn stimulated POMC transcription. Gli1 is necessary for CRH signaling, since knocking down Gli1 by RNA interference abolished the stimulatory effect of CRH on POMC. Taken together, our results demonstrate a new role for Shh and Gli1 in corticotroph function and provide a new link between Shh and CRH signaling pathways."

Triggered by cellular receptor binding, the trimeric envelope complex mediates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes through the rearrangement of the fusion protein subunit into a six-helical bundle core structure. Here we describe the biophysical and functional properties of a membrane-anchored fragment of gp41 (gp41ctm) that includes the complete C-terminal heptad repeat region 2, the connecting part, and the transmembrane region.

Trimeric gp41ctm is protease-resistant and recognizes neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10. However, gp41ctm and gp41ctm proteoliposomes elicit no clear neutralizing immune responses in preliminary mouse studies. We further show that gp41ctm and surprisingly also gp41ctm proteoliposomes have potent anti-viral activity.

It has been suggested that mAb 2F5 binds to native gp160 and that CD4 receptor binding reduces mAb 2F5 interaction (43Finnegan C.M. Berg W. Lewis G.K. DeVico A.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12123-12134Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies indicate that mAb 2F5 targets the gp41 fusion intermediate prehairpin structure (44Gorny M.K.

The latter scenario is also supported by mutations that destabilize the six-helical bundle formation and enhance mAb 2F5-neutralization activity (46Follis K.E. Larson S.J. Lu M. Nunberg J.H. J.

Due to the broadly neutralizing activity of mAb 2F5, it is of considerable interest to understand the antigenic properties and eventually stabilize them in a model antigen (37Pai, E. F., Klein, M.

Here we report the structural and functional characterization of a gp41 construct comprising the env transmembrane domain and the extracellular C-terminal region including the peptide regions that have been shown to exert fusion inhibition (C34, T-20). We show that the env transmembrane domain constitutes the trimerization domain. Trimeric gp41ctm is protease-resistant and is recognized by mAbs 2F5 and 4E10. gp41ctm exerts potent anti-viral activity in solution and surprisingly when incorporated into liposomes. However, initial immunization studies in mice indicate low immunogenicity of gp41ctm in solution, whereas gp41ctm incorporated into liposomes generates IgG and IgA responses, which have no clear neutralization capacity. Expression Constructs—HIV-1 (strain HXB2R) gp41 cDNA (nucleic acid position 1885–2118; gp41 residues 118–195) was amplified by standard PCR and cloned into the expression vector pRSET (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing revealed the C-terminal addition of 18 amino acids (APRALEIILFNFKKEIYI) encoded by the vector sequence (gp41ctm). HIV-1 gp41 cDNA (nucleotides 1605–1743; gp41 residues 24–70) (gp41-N-FLAG; N-terminal helix) were amplified by PCR with the addition of a C-terminal FLAG tag and cloned into a pRSET expression vector. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—gp41ctm and gp41-N-FLAG were expressed in Escherichia coli host strain BL21(DE3) pUBS. The expression of the proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. gp41ctm-expressing cells were lysed by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS). The cleared supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column in buffer A, and gp41ctm was eluted by applying a 0.1–1 m NaCl gradient. gp41ctm-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against H2O, subsequently adjusted to buffer A, and subjected to one more Q-Sepharose purification step. Final purification included separation on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 1% β-octylglucopyranoside (OG)). Lysates from cells expressing gp41-N-FLAG were loaded onto a S-Sepharose column in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl and eluted by applying a 0.1–1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing gp41-N-FLAG were identified by SDS-PAGE und used for pull-down experiments. CD Analysis—The CD spectrum of gp41ctm (0.16 mg/ml) in 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl was recorded at 20 °C using a 1-mm cell on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric controller. The thermodynamic stability was measured at 222 nm by monitoring the CD signal in the temperature range of 4–98 °C. The measured signal was then converted into molar ellipticity. Chemical Cross-linking—gp41ctm (PBS, 1% β-OG) and gp41ctm incorporated into liposomes (PBS) were incubated with ethylene glycol bis(-succinimidylsuccinate) (EGS, Pierce) for 20 min at room temperature as indicated. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and the bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Liposome Preparation and Flotation Assay—gp41ctm proteoliposomes (25% l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 50% l-α-phosphatidylserine, 25% cholesterol) were prepared as described previously (47Scianimanico S. Schoehn G. Timmins J. Ruigrok R.H. Klenk H.D. Weissenhorn W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Lipid films were resuspended with gp41ctm in buffer A, and the detergent was removed by dialysis with a liposomat (Dianorm). The proteoliposomes were adjusted to 50% sucrose (in PBS), overlaid with 40, 30, 10, and 0% sucrose (in PBS), and centrifuged in a SW 41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 12 h. After incubation (15 min at room temperature) of gp41ctm proteoliposomes with either mAb 2F5 or 4E10, similar sucrose gradient centrifugation analyses were applied to separate free mAb and gp41ctm/mAb proteoliposomes. Samples of fractions containing gp41ctm/mAb proteoliposomes were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For the immunization studies, the liposomes were produced by the cross-flow injection technique using a multiple injection mode (48Wagner A. Vorauer-Uhl K. Kreismayr G. Katinger H. J.

The lipid mixture was dissolved in 95% ethanol at 50 °C, and the temperature of the protein/detergent solution was equilibrated at 50 °C at a β-OG concentration of 1%. For vesicle formation, the protein/detergent solution was pumped from container A to container B, and while pumping the micellar protein solution through the cross-flow injection module, the ethanol/lipid solution was injected followed by immediate dilution with PBS in vessel B. After dilution, the β-OG concentration was reduced to 0.1% resulting in a stable liposome solution. The successful incorporation of gp41ctm was confirmed by Western blot and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using mAb 2F5. Pull-down Assay—gp41-N-FLAG and gp41ctm were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in buffer B, diluted 1:2 in Tris-buffered saline, 1% Triton-100 and loaded onto a FLAG-agarose column, washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline, 1% Triton-100, and eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. HIV Neutralization Assay—TZM-b1 cells, a HeLa cell line derivative expressing CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5, and firefly luciferase upon infection with HIV were seeded at a density of 3 × 103 cells/96-well plate (50Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z. Arani R.B. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. Wu X. Shaw G.M. Kappes J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). The next day cells were pretreated with T-20, gp41ctm, and liposomes with and without incorporated gp41ctm at different concentrations for 30 min at room temperature. 1000 infectious units/well (as determined on TZM-b1 cells) of HIVNL-4.3 were used to challenge the cells, and 2 days later the cells were lysed and the activity of firefly luciferase activity was determined (Steady-Glo luciferase system, Promega). Because of the induction of firefly luciferase upon infection, the reduction of the relative light units detectable correlates with the inhibition of infection by T-20, gp41ctm, and liposomes with and without incorporated gp41ctm, respectively. The viability of the cells was not affected by the addition of gp41ctm or gp41ctm liposomes. The same assay and HIV strain were also used to measure the neutralization capacity of the sera obtained by gp41ctm immunization of mice. The sera were diluted 1:10, 1:25, 1:50, and 1:100. Immunization—BALB/c inbred female mice 6–8 weeks of age were immunized intraperitoneally (intraperitoneal). Six mice per group were primed with gp41ctm or with gp41ctm proteoliposomes. The second immunization was performed 3 weeks later using the same preparations. Control groups were immunized with an empty liposome preparation utilizing the same immunization procedures. Two weeks following the boost, mice were bled from Sinus orbitalis and sera were stored at –20 °C before further analyses. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—An ELISA protocol was performed as described earlier (31Stiegler G. Kunert R. Purtscher M. Wolbank S. Voglauer R. Steindl F. Katinger H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2001; 17: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) utilizing gp41ctm protein (2.5 μg/ml carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) as coating antigen. Serial dilutions of sera in PBS/Tween 20 containing 1% skim milk were added to the coated plates, and the mixtures were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2a (γ-chain-specific) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Following additional washing steps, plates were stained with 3,3′,5.5′-tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. The reaction was stopped with 1.25 m H2SO4, and the plates were measured (wavelength 450 nm). The cutoff value is defined as the mean value of absorption of serum samples of mice immunized with empty liposome preparations plus two standard deviations. Syncytium Inhibition Assay—The inhibition of HIV-1 replication by serum samples was assessed in a standard syncytium inhibition assay. Experiments were performed with sera from mice immunized with gp41ctm or gp41ctm-containing liposomes. Sera from mice, which had received liposomes only, were run in parallel as negative controls. AA-2 cells were used as the indicator cell line with syncytium formation as readout. 10 serial 2-fold dilutions of serum samples in cell culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm l-Gln, 5 μg/ml polybrene) were preincubated with 102-103 TCID50 of tissue culture line adapted, HIV-1 RF, for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of the AA-2 cells. Cells were incubated for 5 days before the assessment of syncytium formation. Experiments were performed with four replicates per dilution step. The presence of at least one syncytium per well was considered as an indication for HIV-1 infection. The 50% inhibiting titer was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench (51Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hygiene. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Unspecific inhibition by control sera was used as cutoff. All of the assays included a virus titration of the inoculum to confirm the infectious titer. Oligomerization and Protease Sensitivity of gp41ctm—Initial attempts to express gp41 residues 118–195 comprising the C-terminal helical region, the connection to the transmembrane region, and the gp41 transmembrane region (Fig. 1) failed because of bacterial cytotoxicity. However, we were able to select a clone that has an extended 3′-open reading frame derived from the plasmid sequence that includes 18 residues and allows bacterial expression. gp41ctm can be purified to homogeneity and is monodisperse in solutions containing 1% detergent (β-OG or CHAPS). It forms soluble aggregates in PBS or H2O (data not shown) but elutes from a gel filtration column at ∼14 ml in PBS containing 1% CHAPS or 1 β-OG (data not shown), indicating a distinct oligomeric state. The elution volume may also indicate an extended conformation of gp41ctm, because a 50-kDa marker protein (antibody Fc fragment) elutes at ∼15 ml and a 220-kDa protein (catalase) elutes at 12 ml under the same conditions (data not shown). Chemical cross-linking of gp41ctm in detergent (Fig. 2A) and of gp41ctm incorporated into liposomes (Fig. 2B) with increasing concentrations of EGS cross-linking reagent gives rise to a second band migrating at ∼30 kDa and a third band migrating at ∼45 kDa in both experiments (Fig. 2). This is consistent with the trimeric nature of the envelope glycoprotein (52Blacklow S.C. Lu M. Kim P.S.

A, soluble gp41ctm (PBS, 1% β-OG) was incubated with increasing concentration of EGS (lane 1, no EGS; lane 2, 0.1 mm; lane 3, 0.25 mm; lane 3, 0.5 mm; lane 4, 1 mm; lane 5, 5 mm). B, sucrose gradient-purified gp41ctm liposomes were incubated with EGS (lane 1, no EGS; lane 2, 1 mm; lane 3, 5 mm). The samples were separated on a reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. gp41ctm monomers and putative dimers and trimers are indicated by numbers. C and D, protease digestion of gp41ctm (C) and of gp41ctm incorporated into liposomes (D). Trypsin and chymotrypsin were used at the concentrations (w/w) indicated. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Note that gp41ctm incorporated into liposomes is resistant to trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion. The fuzzy broad band (arrow)in D migrating at ∼6 kDa corresponds to lipids. M, molecular weight standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the presence of structural features, we subjected gp41ctm alone or incorporated into liposomes to protease digestion. This shows cleavage of gp41ctm at high protease concentrations (1:100 w/w) resulting in two smaller tryptic bands migrating at ∼9 and ∼4 kDa as well as two slightly smaller chymotryptic fragments migrating at ∼8 and ∼3 kDa (Fig. 2C). In contrast, gp41ctm incorporated into liposomes was not cleaved under the same conditions, thus indicating increased resistance (Fig. 2D). CD Analysis of gp41ctm—Secondary structure analysis of gp41ctm by circular dichroism revealed α-helical spectra with an approximate calculated helical content of ∼30%. This is independent of the buffer conditions, because the same spectra were obtained in buffers containing either H2O or PBS or PBS and 1% β-OG (Fig. 3A). The thermal stability of gp41ctm is indistinguishable in PBS and in PBS containing 1% β-OG and shows somewhat greater stability in H2O. The unfolding transition of gp41ctm occurs at ∼48 °C in PBS buffers and at ∼52 °C in H2O (Fig. 3B). gp41ctm Binding to the gp41 N-terminal Helix—gp41ctm contains the C-terminal helical region (HR2), which interacts with the N-terminal triple-stranded coiled-coil region (HR1) in the gp41 core structure (Fig. 1) (4Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 6Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). To show that the C-terminal helical region of gp41ctm is available for binding to gp41 HR1, we performed a pull-down assay with FLAG-tagged gp41-N-FLAG. As expected gp41-N-FLAG bound to the column and could be eluted (lane 1), whereas gp41ctm did not bind (lane 2). When we preincubated gp41-N-FLAG and gp41ctm prior to column binding, the complex composed of both fragments was eluted, indicating that HR2 from gp41ctm interacts with HR1 of gp41-N-FLAG (Fig. 4A, lane 3). gp41ctm Interaction with mAbs 2F5 and 4E10 —gp41ctm contains two membrane proximal epitope sequences (Fig. 1) that are recognized by broadly neutralizing human antibodies, mAb 2F5 and 4E10. Therefore we analyzed whether these mAbs recognize trimeric gp41ctm in a membrane environment. gp41ctm was incorporated into liposomes and incubated with mAbs, and free mAbs were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This revealed that both mAbs 2F5 and 4E10 bound to gp41ctm and were found in the upper fraction of the gradient (Fig. 4B) similar to the floatation of gp41ctm liposomes alone (Fig. 4B), whereas antibodies incubated with empty liposomes remain in the loading zone of the gradient (data not shown). This indicates that gp41ctm can be incorporated into the liposomes with the extracellular region being accessible for mAb 2F5 and 4E10 interaction.

The low density of BST-1 expression on bone marrow (BM) stromal cells and the low specific activity of the enzyme made it unclear whether cADPR generation by a BST-1+ stroma could stimulate HP proliferation in the BM microenvironment. We developed and characterized two BST-1+ stromal cell lines, expressing an ectocellular cyclase activity similar to that of BST-1+ human mesenchymal stem cells, the precursors of BM stromal cells. Long term co-culture of cord blood-derived HP over these BST-1+ feeders determined their expansion. Influx of paracrinally generated cADPR into clonogenic HP was mediated by a concentrative, nitrobenzylthioinosine- and dipyridamole-inhibitable nucleoside transporter, this providing a possible explanation to the effectiveness of the hormone-like concentrations of the cyclic nucleotide measured in the medium conditioned by BST-1+ feeders. These results suggest that the BST-1-catalyzed generation of extracellular cADPR, followed by the concentrative uptake of the cyclic nucleotide by HP, may be physiologically relevant in normal hemopoiesis.

However, the nature of the signals and the mechanisms by which stromal cells regulate the behavior of HP remain largely to be defined. Particularly, it is unknown whether perturbations of the balance between growth-stimulatory and -inhibitory factors may influence the expansion and self-renewal capacity of the hemopoietic reservoir.Recently, we have demonstrated that the potent intracellular calcium mobilizer cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (3Lee H.C.

The paracrine interaction between stroma and HP has been investigated in a transwell co-culture setting where human HP were cultured over confluent monolayers of murine stromal cells transfected with human CD38: NAD+ efflux from stromal cells through connexin 43-formed hemichannels (8Bruzzone S.

This inhibited colony output during long term culture (LTC) of human HP over CD38+ feeders (6Zocchi E. Podesta ̀ M. Pitto A. Usai C. Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A.

Thus, while co-expression of CD38 with connexin 43 (as occurs in the transduced stromal cell lines) results in a significant (2–3-fold) increase of the [Ca2+]i of CD38+ stromal cells (18Bruzzone S.

Accordingly, expression of BST-1 on the hematopoietic stroma might represent the critical feature ensuring paracrine production of HP-expanding cADPR, while limiting the extent of the [Ca2+]i perturbation induced on stromal cells by autocrine cADPR.The aims of this study were: (i) to compare the effect of LTC over CD38+versus BST-1+ stroma on the in vitro clonogenic capacity of human HP and (ii) to investigate the mechanism of uptake of paracrinally produced cADPR by human HP.Two BST-1-expressing stromal cell lines were generated and their biochemical characterization demonstrated distinctive properties as compared with the corresponding CD38-expressing cells. LTC of cord blood-derived HP over these BST-1+ feeders significantly increased colony output compared with controls, co-cultured over cyclase negative feeders, in sharp contrast with the inhibitory effect induced by LTC over CD38+ stroma. A concentrative transport of paracrinally generated cADPR into HP was found to be mediated by a NBMPR- and dipyridamole-sensitive CNT. These results are consistent with a role of BST-1-generated cADPR in the expansion of human HP in the bone marrow microenvironment.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSamples—Cord blood (CB) samples were obtained from umbilical and placental tissues scheduled for discard. CB-derived mononuclear cells (CB MNC) were isolated by centrifugation of the blood on Ficoll Paque Plus (Amersham Bioscience). CD34+ cells (the MNC enriched in HP) were separated by immunoaffinity on magnetic columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions, as described (5Podesta ̀ M.

The plasmid obtained was sequenced on both strands of the cDNA to verify the presence of the correct insert. The pcDNA3.1/BST-1 construct was transfected into 3T3 cells with Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), according to manufacturer's instructions. One day after gene transfer, Geneticin (1 mg/ml) was added to the culture medium, and transfected cells were cultured in antibiotic selection.Five magnetic bead immuno-selections for expression of BST-1 were performed on transfected cells using anti-BST-1 (CD157) antibody (Immunotech, Marseille, France) and sheep anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-280, Dynal, Oslo, Norway), as described (19Zocchi E.

Expression of BST-1 was monitored by assay of the ectocellular ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity (see below).FACS Selection of COS-7 Cells for BST-1 Expression—The simian epithelial cells COS-7 naturally express BST-1 (see “Results”). Two cell populations, expressing low (BST-1dim) and high (BST-1bright) levels of BST-1 were selected from wild-type COS (COSwt) by repeated FACS sorting, using a commercial anti-human BST-1 (CD157) antibody (see above) and a FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma, Milan, Italy). Both monoclonal antibodies were applied under previously determined saturating conditions using the Indirect Immunofluorescence assay. Briefly, 2 μl of anti-BST-1 monoclonal antibody were added to 1 × 106 COS-7 cells in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA) and cells were incubated for 30 min on ice, in the dark. Cells were then washed twice in PBS, and 150 μl of the second monoclonal antibody (at a 1:75 dilution in PBS-BSA) was then added and cells were further incubated for 30 min. Finally, cells were washed twice and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 106cells/ml. Deoxyribonuclease I (from bovine pancreas, Calbiochem Biochemicals, Nottingham, UK) and propidium iodide at 1 μg/ml (Sigma Aldrich Fine Chemicals, Milan, Italy) were added to the cells, which were then filtered on a 70-μm cell strainer (Falcon-BD) immediately before sorting. Control cells were exposed only to the secondary antibody.Flow cytometric analysis and cell sorting were performed by using a FACS Vantage SE flow sorter (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with an air-cooled 50-megawatt argon ion laser. BST-1+ COS-7 cells were gated within a viable, propidium iodide-negative, population using a Forward Scatter versus FL-3 logarithmic amplified channel dotplot. In each experiment, sorting gates were set to sort both the dimmest and the brightest BST-1+ populations in the same two-way sorting experiment. A total of four sorting experiments were performed: between each round, the COSdim and COSbright populations were expanded in vitro.Assay of ADP-ribosyl Cyclase Activity—Ectocellular ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was measured by incubating 3 × 106 cells in a total volume of 400 μl of PBS-glucose (10 mm) with 0.1 mm NAD+. At different times (0, 1, and 4 h), 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn. Reactions were stopped by addition of 220 μl of 0.9 m perchloric acid to each aliquot. After deproteinization, acid was removed and cADPR content was measured in each aliquot according to the enzymatic cycling assay (20Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem.

An aliquot was diluted 200-fold in PBS for NAD+ levels determination. The remaining volume was subjected to deproteinization, acid extraction, and NAD+ degradation, and cADPR content was determined by the enzymatic cycling assay (20Graeff R. Lee H.C. Biochem.

For determination of the [Ca2+]i on CD34+ cells, aliquots of 2 × 105 cells were incubated in a total volume of 1.0 ml, in the presence of 50 μm cADPR, without or with 10 nm NBMPR. After 24 h, 10 μm FURA 2-AM was added, and cells were further incubated for 60 min.

Transfected cells were maintained under Geneticin (1 mg/ml) selection in the same medium. After irradiation (1500 Gy), feeder cells were seeded into 24-well plates in complete medium, without Geneticin, and used for the co-culture experiments. Freshly separated CB MNC were seeded in transwells (Costar, Milan, Italy) at 2 × 106/well in LTC medium (Myelocult, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) over irradiated, confluent (∼2 × 106 cells) feeder layers. At weekly intervals, transwells were transferred over freshly irradiated feeders, cells were recovered from individual wells and counted, and aliquots were seeded in growth factor-supplemented semisolid medium to determine the content in clonogenic precursors (see below).Semisolid Colony Growth Assay—After liquid culture, aliquots of 2 × 104 MNC were seeded in growth factors-supplemented methylcellulose medium (Methocult, Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) and cultured at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere, as described (5Podesta ̀ M.

After 14 days, colonies were scored and identified according to standard criteria. Colonies grown from cells preincubated for 1–7 days in liquid culture in the absence of added cytokine identify the committed HP, i.e. the colony-forming cells (CFC) (22Pike B. Robinson W.A. J. Cell.

Murine 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with the sense cDNA for murine BST-1, while simian COS-7 epithelial cells, which constitutively express BST-1 (Table I), were sorted into high (COSbright) and low (COSdim) expressing BST-1+ subpopulations by FACS, using a commercially available monoclonal antibody against human BST-1 (see “Experimental Procedures”).Table ICyclase activity, intracellular cADPR, NAD+, and NADH levels and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration of cyclase-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts and of sorted BST-1+ COS cellsADP-ribosyl cyclase[cADPR]i[NAD+NADH]i[Ca2+]ipmol cADPR/min/mgpmol/mgnmol/mgnm3T3 controlNDaNot detectable.0.32 ± 0.065.11 ± 0.825 ± 73T3 BST-1+1.65 ± 0.33.75 ± 0.66.1 ± 0.823 ± 53T3 CD38+91.25 ± 23.050.48 ± 8.033.32 ± 0.245 ± 8COSwt0.9 ± 0.025.7 ± 1.34.3 ± 0.521 ± 3COSdim0.13 ± 0.092.5 ± 0.84.2 ± 0.722 ± 3COSbright1.72 ± 0.57.2 ± 1.64.8 ± 0.724 ± 2a Not detectable.

A clear-cut separation of BST-1dim and BST-1bright COS subpopulations was observed after four cycles of FACS selection (Fig. 1) and routinely checked thereafter, during the course of the co-culture experiments.The levels of ecto-cyclase activity measured on the BST-1+ cell lines were similar (1.65 versus 1.72 pmol cADPR/min/mg for BST-1+ 3T3 and COSbright, respectively) and comparable with the cyclase activity constitutively expressed by BST-1+ human mesenchymal cells, the progenitors of BM stroma, expanded in vitro from BM aspirates (24Koc O.N.

The intracellular cADPR concentration ([cADPR]i) in CD38+ 3T3 cells was accordingly 1 log higher than that measured in BST-1+ 3T3 and in COSbright cells (13 and 7 times higher, respectively) (Table I). The limited increase of the [cADPR]i of BST-1+ cells was not paralleled by any significant increase of the basal [Ca2+]i compared with cyclase negative controls, neither in BST-1-transfected 3T3 fibroblasts nor in COSbright cells: conversely, the [Ca2+]i of CD38+ 3T3 was twice as high that of control values (Table I), as reported previously (11Franco L.

On the contrary, expression of CD38 in 3T3 fibroblasts reduced the [NAD+NADH]i to ∼50% of control values (Table I), similarly to earlier results (19Zocchi E. Daga A. Usai C. Franco L. Guida L.

Lee H.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the medium conditioned by BST-1+ 3T3 the [cADPR] was even lower (0.18 ± 0.09 nm, n = 5) and near the sensitivity threshold of the assay.Previous observations had shown an increased, [Ca2+]i-related IFN-γ concentration in the medium conditioned by CD38+ 3T3 feeders compared with controls (6Zocchi E. Podesta ̀ M. Pitto A. Usai C. Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); this prompted us to measure the [IFN-γ] in the medium of confluent monolayers of BST-1+ 3T3 and of COSbright cells. No significant differences were observed between these cell lines and the corresponding controls (3T3 transfected with the empty vector and COSwt), as measured with a colorimetric immunoassay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) on 7-day medium from confluent, irradiated feeder layers (6Zocchi E. Podesta ̀ M. Pitto A. Usai C. Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A.

This effect was attributed to the autocrine cADPR-[Ca2+]i loop in the CD38+ 3T3, which induced overproduction of hemopoiesis-inhibiting IFN-γ (6Zocchi E. Podesta ̀ M. Pitto A. Usai C. Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To compare the effects of stromal BST-1 and CD38 on HP expansion, CB MNC were co-cultured in transwells over either BST-1+ or CD38+ 3T3 feeders and their clonogenic capacity was assayed weekly for up to 5 weeks (see “Experimental Procedures”). Controls were cultured over 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the empty vector pcDNA 3.1.As shown in Table II, the clonogenic activity, measured both as CFC frequency and total colony number, was significantly higher in CB MNC cultured over BST-1+ feeders compared with controls, starting from the 2nd week of culture. Conversely, co-culture over CD38+ feeders strongly inhibited colony production from the 1st week of culture (Table II). Colony output of CB MNC cultured over 3T3 cells transfected with antisense CD38 was not significantly different from controls (data not shown). In previous experiments, addition of NAD+ glycohydrolase (NAD-ase) to the medium prevented the stimulatory effect of a short term co-culture over CD38+ stroma on CFC output (6Zocchi E. Podesta ̀ M. Pitto A. Usai C. Bruzzone S. Franco L. Guida L. Bacigalupo A. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1610-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This result was taken as an indication that release of NAD+ from the feeder cells provides the substrate for the extracellular generation of cADPR. Here we tested the effect of NAD-ase on the long term co-culture of CB MNC over BST-1+ 3T3. Addition of NAD-ase (2 units/ml, twice weekly for 2 weeks) to the culture medium prevented the stimulation of colony output by the BST-1+ feeder: colony frequencies (CFC/105 MNC seeded) were 22 ± 3 versus 7 ± 1 for BST-1+ and control feeder, respectively, and 7 ± 2 versus 6 ± 1 for BST-1+ and control feeder in the presence of NAD-ase (mean ± S.D. from three experiments).Table IIColony frequency and total colony output of CB MNC cultured over BST1+ 3T3 fibroblastsCFC/105 MNCTotal CFCBST1+pControlpCD38+BST1+pControlpCD38+1st week76603248844471886934528966101645441448162411006630120072621023105462010Median760.4600.08324880.84440.271Range23-10010-695-4146-120020-96610-2102nd week45258270100152851844532851196253943511940703214302860Median280.0750.111960.07450.083Range14-943-350-1128-9406-1000-323rd week2382691642380921601382268478134140026811004400Median230.0280.062690.01160.094Range11-780-130-426-14000-260-84th week1850185073073032111416222120024004102860Median12<0.0430.06024<0.0150.040Range4-320-110-17-4160-220-2 Open table in a new tab The effect of long term co-culture over a BST-1+ stroma on colony output was also investigated with the different COS feeders, COSwt (controls), COSbright and COSdim, expressing distinctively different levels of ectocyclase activity (Table"
https://openalex.org/W2121938511,"Blind subterranean mole rats of the Spalax ehrenbergi superspecies in Israel have evolved multiple adaptive strategies to face underground hypoxia. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and erythropoietin (Epo) are key factors in the development of normal erythropoiesis and angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantification that Spalax fetal liver and kidney express higher levels of Epo mRNA than Rattus, generating reinforcement of fetal erythropoiesis underground and adapting it to life underground in an atmosphere of abrupt and sharp fluctuations of O2 supply. In neonates, Rattus liver and kidney express higher Epo levels than Spalax under both normoxia and hypoxia, probably due to Rattus ineffective erythropoiesis during embryonic life and its birth in a poorly ventilated breeding nest under ground. Adult Rattus kidney and liver, and adult Spalax liver express similar levels of Epo mRNA under normoxia and hypoxia. However, adult Spalax hypoxic kidney, the major site of erythropoietin production in adult mammals, shows levels that were twice as high as that of Rattus. Spalax expresses remarkably higher levels of HIF-1alpha mRNA than Rattus at all developmental stages studied, which peaked in neonates, as an adaptation against hypoxia."

FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations result in constitutive activation of FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity. The consequences of this activation are an increase in total phosphotyrosine content, persistent downstream signaling, and ultimately transformation of hematopoietic cells to factor-independent growth. The Src homology (SH)2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 is involved in the down-regulation of a broad range of growth factor and cytokine-driven signaling cascades. Loss-of-function or deficiency of SHP-1 activity results in a hyperproliferative response of myelomonocytic cell populations to growth factor stimulation. In this study, we examined the possible role of SHP-1 in regulating FLT3 signaling. We found that transformation of TF-1 cells with FLT3/ITD mutations suppressed the activity of SHP-1 by ∼3-fold. Suppression was caused by decreased SHP-1 protein expression, as analyzed at both the protein and RNA levels. In contrast, protein levels of SHP-2, a phosphatase that plays a stimulatory role in signaling through a variety of receptors, did not change significantly in FLT3 mutant cells. Suppressed SHP-1 protein levels in TF-1/ITD cells were partially overcome after cells were exposed to CEP-701, a selective FLT3 inhibitor. SHP-1 protein levels also increased in naturally occurring FLT3/ITD expressing AML cell lines and in primary FLT3/ITD AML samples after CEP-701 treatment. Furthermore, a small but reproducible growth/survival advantage was observed in both TF-1 and TF-1/ITD cells when SHP-1 expression was knocked down by RNAi. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence that suppression of SHP-1 by FLT3/ITD signaling may be another mechanism contributing to the transformation by FLT3/ITD mutations.

This provides growth and survival signals for AML cells through either direct or indirect phosphorylation and activation of a wide range of signal transduction molecules including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, RAS/MAPK, Cbl, Shc, Vav, SHP-2, Src homology (SH)2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP), Stat5, and phospholipase C-γ (21Tse K.F.

All of these observations suggest that FLT3/ITDs play an important role in leukemogenesis by triggering disturbed signaling pathways through protein phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of protein on tyrosine residues is a critical mechanism for signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This process is regulated by the opposing activities of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). These enzymes maintain a dynamic balance of protein phosphorylation and thereby set the duration and magnitude of the response to extracellular stimuli (32O ̈stmana A. Bo ̈hmer F.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity is often up-regulated by activated kinases, providing a feedback loop to fine-tune the regulation of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation (33Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 34Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Any deviation in this balance caused by either increased PTK activity or decreased PTP activity can trigger accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, which in turn can lead to abnormal cell proliferation and differentiation. An example of the consequence of loss of this regulation is the constitutive activation of Akt seen with loss of PTEN activity. Both loss of expression and mutations within the conserved catalytic domain in PTEN occur in a wide spectrum of cancers including glioblastomas, breast, and prostate carcinomas, and small cell lung cancers (35Sulis M.L. Parsons R. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 478-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Two SH2 domain-containing PTPs, SHP-1 and SHP-2 are widely involved in regulating the signaling pathways of a variety of cytokine and growth factor receptors involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (36Neel B.G. Gu H. Pao L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence has also implicated these phosphatases in the pathogenesis of lymphoma, leukemia, and other cancers (37Zhao R. Fu X. Teng L. Li Q. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42893-42898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Yi T. Pathak M.K. Lindner D.J. Ketterer M.E. Farver C. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5978-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Despite a high degree of homology with SHP-1, SHP-2 has a completely distinct expression profile and function. In most circumstances, SHP-2 plays a positive role in activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway by growth factors and cytokines (39Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 40Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman J.R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Gain of function mutations of SHP-2 have been reported in 34% of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and in some cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML (42Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X. Buechner J. Jung A. Hahlen K. Hasle H. Licht J.D. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). The SHP-2 mutations found in JMML, D61Y and E76K, exhibit elevated phosphatase activity compared with wild-type SHP-2. Expression of these mutants in COS-7 cells causes prolonged activation of ERK2 in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation and is associated with increased cell proliferation (42Tartaglia M. Niemeyer C.M. Fragale A. Song X. Buechner J. Jung A. Hahlen K. Hasle H. Licht J.D. Gelb B.D. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). More recent studies have also shown that Ba/F3 cells expressing those same mutants demonstrate enhanced growth factor-independent survival (43Loh M.L. Vattikuti S. Schubbert S. Reynolds M.G. Carlson E. Lieuw K.H. Cheng J.W. Lee C.M. Stokoe D. Bonifas J.M. Curtiss N.P. Gotlib J. Meshinchi S. Le Beau M.M. Emanuel P.D. Shannon K.M. Blood. 2004; 103: 2325-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). These experimental data suggested that the SHP-2 mutations found in JMML might contribute to leukemogenesis by activating Ras/ERK signaling pathways and might explain the characteristic GM-CSF hypersensitivity of JMML hematopoietic progenitors. In contrast to SHP-2, which is widely expressed, SHP-1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. It mainly functions as a negative regulator of a wide variety of signaling pathways involving cytokines and growth factors that include erythropoietin (Epo) (44Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.

Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The important roles of SHP-1 in development and function of myeloid cells has been demonstrated by the studies of two naturally occurring loss-of-function SHP-1 gene mutations in motheaten (me/me) and viable motheaten (mev/mev) mice (49Shultz L.D. Rajan T.V. Greiner D.L. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These mice express either no SHP-1 or a catalytically defective SHP-1 protein, respectively. The hematopoietic abnormalities are characterized by hyperproliferation and abnormal activation of myeloid/monocytic cells. Infiltration of macrophages into the lungs causes a hemorrhagic pneumonitis and eventual death of the mice. Bone marrow progenitor cells from me/me and mev/mev mice have enhanced clonogenic and/or proliferative responses to multiple growth factors and cytokines, including granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Epo, and IFNs (50Tapley P. Shevde N.K. Schweitzer P.A. Gallina M. Christianson S.W. Lin I. Stein R.B. Shultz L.D. Rosen J. Lamb P. Exp. Hematol. 1997; 25: 122-131PubMed Google Scholar, 51Jiao H. Yang W. Berrada K. Tabrizi M.

Med. 1997; 186: 1575-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have also shown that SHP-1 is up-regulated when leukemic cell lines like K562, 32D, and HT93 are induced to differentiate (54Bruecher-Encke B. Griffin J.D. Neel B.G. Lorenz U. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 55Ward A.C. Oomen S.P. Smith L. Gits J. van Leeuwen D. Soede-Bobok A.A. Erpelinck-Verschueren C.A. Yi T. Touw I.P.

Cancer Res. 2000; 19: 363-366PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of wild-type SHP-1 in these cell lines leads to enhanced differentiation and decreased proliferation while introduction of a dominant negative mutation results in increased proliferation and a delay of differentiation. In a mast cell line expressing a c-Kit activation loop mutant, increased degradation of SHP-1 through a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway has been reported (57Piao X. Paulson R. Van Der Geer P. Pawson T. Bernetein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14665-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These observations together provide strong support that SHP-1 functions as a tumor suppressor during myelopoiesis. This prompted us to investigate whether SHP-1 is involved in cell transformation and leukemogenesis mediated by FLT3/ITD signaling. In this study, we report for the first time that SHP-1 activity is suppressed by FLT3/ITD mutations and that this suppression is associated with a cell growth and a survival advantage. Reagents—Monoclonal mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and recombinant protein A-agarose beads were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), monoclonal antibody to SHP-1 and SHP-2 from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and polyclonal antibodies to FLT3, SHP-1, SHP-2, and actin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system were from Amersham Biosciences. Recombinant human GM-CSF and FL were obtained from Pepro Tech (Rocky Hill, NJ). CEP-701 was kindly provided by Cephalon Inc. (West Chester, PA). RNeasy total RNA purification and QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kits were obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Dicer small interfering RNA (siRNA) generation kit was obtained from Gene Therapy Systems, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment—Primary AML samples were collected through an institutional review board-approved protocol. Frozen aliquots of AML samples were thawed and incubated for 12 h followed by centrifugation over Ficoll to eliminate cells dying from the freeze-thaw process. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. MV4-11 cells were maintained in Iscoves modified Dulbecco medium (IMDM) (Invitrogen) with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini BioProducts, Woodland, CA). All other cells (including primary AML samples) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Medium was supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 ng/ml GM-CSF for TF-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). TF-1 cells were stably transfected with pCI-neo vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) containing full-length cDNA coding for either a wild-type FLT3 or a FLT3/ITD by electroporation, as described previously (21Tse K.F. Mukherjee G. Small D. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1766-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks and subcloned by limiting dilution. Cells were maintained in log-phase growth for experiments. Pervanadate was freshly prepared by mixing equal volumes of 0.1 m H2O2 and 0.1 m sodium orthovanadate and incubated for 10–20 min before use. When CEP-701 (stored as a 4 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at –20 °C) was used to treat cells, the corresponding control samples also contained identical amounts of Me2SO (<0.25%). MTT Proliferation Assay—Cells were aliquoted into 96-well plates at an initial density of 1–5 × 104/ml in duplicate or triplicate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the indicated period of time. The MTT assays (Roche Applied Science) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were read at 562 nm in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). To immunoprecipitate specific proteins, clarified whole cell lysates were incubated with corresponding antibodies followed by binding to protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Immunoblotting assays were performed with the designated antibodies and immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For reprobing, blots were stripped with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol. Quantitation of immunoblots by densitometry was performed with NIH Image 1.62. p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate (p-NPP) Hydrolysis Assay—SHP-1 and SHP-2 were immunoprecipitated and washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors, and twice with p-NPP assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Phosphatase catalytic activity was assayed at 37 °C for 15 min in 200 μl of p-NPP buffer containing 20 mmp-NPP. Optical density was determined at 405 nm in a microplate reader. RNA Purification and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 1 × 107 cells using RNeasy total RNA purification kits. The RNA samples (15 μg/lane) were separated on 1% formaldehyde-denaturing agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Full-length SHP-1 cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP by random primer labeling (Stratagene) was used as a probe. Hybridization was performed in 5× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate), 50% deionized formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate (Mr 500,000), 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 16–24 h. The membrane was washed under monitoring and then exposed to XAR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) at –80 °C. SHP-1 RNA Interference—SHP-1 siRNA was prepared with Dicer siRNA generation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, T7 promoters were added to both ends of selected SHP-1 sequence (5′-GTCAGGGTGGGGGATCAGGTG... GCCAAGGCTGGCTTCTGGGAG-3′) by means of PCR. The resultant DNA templates were used for an in vitro transcription reaction with T7 RNA polymerase to generate double strand (ds) RNA, which was digested into small interference RNA fragments with recombinant Dicer enzyme. GFP siRNA was prepared simultaneously from gWIZ/GFP control plasmid as a control. The SHP-1 siRNA transfected TF-1 cells were incubated overnight and aliquoted for MTT proliferation assays or for determination of SHP-1 mRNA levels and protein levels by quantitative real time RT-PCR and immunoblotting assays at intervals of 24 h. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNAs were purified as above. One-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) on an iCycler iQ Real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad). Primers used in the reactions were as follow: SHP-1 FP, 5′-ATGCAGAGACCCTGCTCAAG-3′, SHP-1 RP, 5′-ACCAGCTCTGTCAGAGTCG-3′; GAPDH FP, 5′-CCTCAACGACCACTTTGTCA-3′, GAPDH RP, 5′-GGTGGTCCAGGGGTCTTACT-3′. Serially diluted β-actin cDNA and primers were included as a standard curve. FLT3/ITD Induces Factor-independent Growth and Increases in Phosphotyrosine Levels in TF-1 Cells—TF-1 is a Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph–), CD34+, FLT3-negative human GM-CSF-dependent myeloid leukemia-derived cell line (58Kitamura T. Tange T. Terasawa T. Chiba S. Kuwaki T. Miyagawa K. Piao Y.-F. Miyazono K. Urabe A. Takaku F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). It is capable of differentiating upon treatment with differentiation agents, with δ-aminolevulinic acid inducing erythroid differentiation and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) inducing macrophage differentiation. In this study, TF-1 cells were transfected by electroporation with pCI-neo vectors expressing either wild-type FLT3 or FLT3/ITD. After selection of stable transfectants in G418 + GM-CSF for 2 weeks, the ability of the cells to survive in the absence of GM-CSF was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Wild-type FLT3-expressing TF-1 cells (TF-1/FLT3) still required GM-CSF to maintain normal growth. In contrast, FLT3/ITD-expressing TF-1 cells (TF-1/ITD) grew in the absence of GM-CSF (data not shown). The same results have been observed when BaF3 and 32D cells are transfected with wild-type FLT3 or FLT3/ITDs (29Levis M. Allebach J. Tse K.F. Zheng R. Baldwin B.R. Smith B.D. Jones-Bolin S.

The phosphotyrosine levels of cell extracts from TF-1, TF-1/FLT3, and TF-1/ITD cells were examined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10. TF-1/ITD cells were notable for significantly increased levels of phosphotyrosine proteins when compared with TF-1 and TF-1/FLT3 cells (Fig. 1, compare lane 5 to lanes 1 and 3). In addition, after a brief treatment with pervanadate, a potent membrane-permeable PTP inhibitor, the phosphotyrosine level in TF-1/ITD cells was further dramatically increased (Fig. 1, lane 6). This contrasts with the minimal to moderate increases observed in TF-1 and TF-1/FLT3 cells after pervanadate treatment, respectively. Total phosphotyrosine protein levels are the result of the balance between protein-tyrosine kinase and phosphatase activities. The increased k"

A catalytic triad of Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 in 3α-HSD/CR has been proposed based on structural analysis and sequence alignment of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. The 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction has not been kinetically analyzed in detail, however. In this study, we combined steady-state kinetics, site-directed mutagenesis, and pH profile to explore the function of Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 in 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction. The catalytic efficiency of wild-type and mutants S114A, Y155F, K159A, and Y155F/K159A is 4.3 × 107, 7.3 × 104, 1.7 × 104, 2.4 × 105, and 71 m–1s–1, respectively. The values of pKa on kcat/Km for the wild-type, S114A, Y155F, K159A, and Y155F/K159A are 7.2, 7.4, 8.4, 9.1, and 10.2, respectively. Mutant S114A/Y155F exhibits a pH-independent profile with 10–5 times of wild-type activity at pH 10.5. The activity decreases as the pH lowers, which indicates that a functional group with an apparent pKa of 7.2 is involved in the general base catalysis for wild-type 3α-HSD/CR. The pKa shift to 9.1 for mutant K159A suggests the role of Lys-159 is to lower the pKa of the residues involved in the general base catalysis. Because pH dependence is observed for both S114A and Y155F mutants and pH independence is observed in S114A/Y155F, Tyr-155 may be important as a general base catalysis in the wild-type, whereas Ser-114 may act as a general base on mutant Y155F to catalyze the reaction. 3α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSD/CR) from Comamonas testosteroni, a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase, catalyzes the oxidation of androsterone with NAD+ to form androstanedione and NADH.

The induced enzyme is then involved in the initial stage of the steroid catabolic pathway by oxidating the hydroxyl group at the C3 position, thereby forming a ketone group. This oxidation is followed by isomerization, dehydrogenation, and hydroxylation of the oxidized steroid, which leads to the opening of the B-ring. The complete degradation of the steroid molecule yields CO2 and H2O and provides carbon and energy (3Maser E. Xiong G. Grimm C. Ficner R. Reuter K. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130–132: 707-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 3α-HSD/CR from C. testosteroni is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family (5Mobus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SDR constitutes a large protein family with a majority of oxidoreductases with NAD(P)+ as cofactor (6Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M. Shafqat J. Nordling E. Kallberg Y.

Structurally, SDR displays an α/β folding pattern highly similar to a Rossmann fold, which consists of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices. Although there is little sequence identity within 15–30% between different SDR enzymes, the conserved sequences include an N-terminal Gly-X3-Gly-X-Gly cofactor binding motif and a triad of catalytically important Ser, Tyr, and Lys residues, of which Tyr is the most conserved in the SDR family. Mechanistically, the catalytic roles of Tyr, Lys, and Ser in the active site in SDR family have been proposed through extensive studies by chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, sequence alignment, and structural comparison (6Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M. Shafqat J. Nordling E. Kallberg Y. Persson B. Jornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 143–144: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar).

Mutants of K183R from 11β-HSD and K156I from Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase have been found to have no enzyme activity, whereas the mutants K163I and K163R from 7α-HSD and K156R from alcohol dehydrogenase have been found to have enzyme activities decreased to 5.3, 64, and 2.2%, respectively. S146A and S146H mutants from 7α-HSD have enzyme activities decreased to 20.3 and 35.6% of kcat of the wild-type. The mutant S138A of 3β/17β-HSD results in an almost complete loss of enzyme activity, whereas substitution of Thr restores the full enzymatic activity with S138T (11Oppermann U.C. Filling C.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), indicating the ability of the side chain of Ser to form a hydrogen bond, an essential factor in the catalysis. The conserved Tyr residue acts as a general base to extract the proton of the hydroxyl group of steroid and facilitate the hydride transfer to NAD+. This function of Tyr is assisted by the adjacent amino group of Lys through electrostatic interaction to lower the pKa of Tyr. The formation of the carbonyl group in the product is then stabilized by the hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Ser during the catalysis. In addition to the triad of Tyr, Ser, and Lys, a residue of Asn was found to be important in the catalysis as it is involved in the proton relay system (6Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N.

The structures of the binary complex with NAD+ cofactor and apoenzyme of 3α-HSD/CR have been solved (3Maser E. Xiong G. Grimm C. Ficner R. Reuter K. Chem. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 41333-41339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the binary complex, the NAD+ cofactor is bound at the C-terminal ends of the β-strands in the 3α-HSD/CR from C. testosterone. The orientation of the nicotinamide ring is bound in a syn conformation to facilitate the stereo-specific hydrogen transfer of the 3β-proton of androsterone to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and forms androstanedione and B-side-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the forward reaction (Fig. 1). Kinetically, the 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction shows an ordered bi bi mechanism with the pyrimidine nucleotide being the first substrate to bind and the last product to be released (18Skalhegg B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 50: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The chemical mechanism for the 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction is based on sequence comparisons and structure analyses in the SDR family (17Grimm C. Maser E. Mobus E. Klebe G. Reuter K. Ficner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41333-41339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A triad of Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 in 3α-HSD/CR is conserved within the SDR family. It has been suggested that this triad acts as a catalytic group involved in enzyme catalysis. The functional role of Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 in the 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reaction, however, has not been analyzed in detail kinetically. To shed more light on the conserved catalytic residues in 3α-HSD/CR and the SDR family, using mutagenesis and kinetic studies we investigated the roles of the triad of Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 in the catalytic mechanism of 3α-HSD/CR. Mutants S114A, Y155F, K159A, and double mutants S114A/Y155F and Y155F/K159A were constructed, expressed, and purified. The enzyme activities were measured and compared with the mutants to probe the catalytic role. The acid-base chemistry was studied through pH profiling to evaluate the residues involved in the general base to catalysis. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenetic replacements were performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using Pfu polymerase and pet15b-3α-HSD/CR plasmid obtained from Dr. E. Maser (5Mobus E. Maser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30888-30896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as template. The primers used to create the cDNA encoding of the S114A, Y155F, K159A, S114A/Y155F, and Y155F/K159A mutants are shown in Table I. The plasmid S114A/Y155F mutant was constructed with plasmid S114A and Y155F primer. The parental DNA template was digested by DpnI endonuclease, which is specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA and targets the sequence of 5′-Gm6ATC-3′. The resulting nicked vector DNA incorporating the desired mutations was then transformed into DH5α supercompetent cells. The selected colonies were then chosen, and plasmid from DH5α cells was purified. The mutant vectors were used to transform into competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. All mutants of 3α-HSD/CR cDNA were sequenced to ensure fidelity. The overexpressed proteins were purified as wild-type recombinant 3α-HSD/CR. SDS-PAGE was used to analyze protein purity.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagenesisMutationDirectionNucleotide sequence of primeraThe boldface codons indicate the mutation on the amino acid residues by the replacement of the underlined codons.S114AForward5′-gccgtcgtcatctcggccgtggcttccgcgc-3′Reverse5′-gcgcggaagccacggccgagatgacgacggc-3′Y155FForward5′-gggcggaaatctggcctttgcgggcagcaagaatg-3′Reverse5′-cattcttgctgcccgcaaaggccagatttccgccc-3′K159AForward5′-ctggcctatgcgggcagcgcgaatgctttgacggtggc-3′Reverse5′-gccaccgtcaaagcattcgcgctacccgcataggccag-3′S114A/Y155FbPlasmid S114A/Y155F mutant was constructed with S114A plasmid and Y155F primer.Forward5′-gggcggaaatctggcctttgcgggcagcaagaatg-3′Reverse5′-cattcttgctgcccgcaaaggccagatttccgccc-3′Y155F/K159AForward5′-cggaaatctggcctttgcgggcagcgcgaatgctttgacgg-3′Reverse5′-ccgtcaaagcattcgcgctgcccgcaaaggccagatttccg-3′a The boldface codons indicate the mutation on the amino acid residues by the replacement of the underlined codons.b Plasmid S114A/Y155F mutant was constructed with S114A plasmid and Y155F primer.

Recombinant proteins were then overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells grown in 1 liter of Luria Bertani medium containing 50 mg of ampicillin at 37 °C by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the culture had reached an optical density of 0.6–1 at 600 nm. After 4 h, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. After ultracentrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min, the resulting supernatant was loaded into a His-bind nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column. The protein was eluted with a gradient from 20 mm to 0.5 m imidazole. The purity of the protein was confirmed by separation on 15% SDS/PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The dimeric properties of 3α-HSD/CR and the mutants were confirmed through gel filtration chromatography (20Maser E. Mobus E. Xiong G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A Sephadex 75 HR 10/30 column was equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The sample consisting of 20 μl of protein solution with a concentration of 2 mg/ml was loaded into the column. Elution was carried out at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and the eluted protein was detected by absorbance at 280 nm. The molecular weight of mutants was calculated by a plot of log MW from protein marker versus elution volume. The molecular weight of recombinant enzymes was determined by nanoelectrospray ionization/mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometric analysis was carried out on a Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-Tof) Ultima™ Global (Micromass MS Technologies). For all spectra, a myoglobin solution (10 pmol/μl) was used to calibrate the time of flight. Intact proteins were diluted with 1:1 acentontrile/water containing 0.1% formic acid. The sample was introduced into the mass spectrometer by infusion through a Z-spray nanoelectrospray ion source with a flow rate of 1 μl/min. Data were obtained over an m/z range of 500–2500. The raw combined mass spectra were background subtracted, peak centered, and subjected to Transform Algorithm (MassLynx Software 4.0) to produce reconstructed zero-charge spectra. The conformations of wild-type and mutant were assessed by circular dichroism spectroscopy by recording the ellipticity as a function of wavelength between 240 and 200 nm using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were obtained by the average of triple measurements with 2.8 μm enzymes in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The rate of scan was 10 nm/min between 240 and 200 nm at room temperature. Kinetic Studies—The 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed oxidation of androsterone was monitored by the formation of NADH spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Initial rates were measured at varied concentrations of androsterone and saturated NAD+. All reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. A typical assay for enzymatic reaction included 1 mm NAD+, various concentration of androsterone, 4 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5% methanol in 0.1 m Ches at pH 9.0. All kinetic assays were thermostatted at 25 °C, and the pH of the assay solution was maintained with 0.1 m of the indicated buffers: Mes, pH 5.5–6.5; Hepes, pH 7.0–7.5; Taps, pH 7.9–8.5; Ches, pH 8.6–9.5; and Caps, pH 10.0–11.3. Data were fitted using Enzfitter software for appropriate rate equations to obtain kinetic parameters. Data for substrate saturation curves at a fixed concentration of the second substrate were fitted using Equation 1, v = VA/(Km + A), where v and V represent the initial and maximum velocities and Km is the Michaelis constant. The pH dependences of kinetic parameters were fitted using Equation 2, log v = log[C/(1 + H/Ka)] for profiles where the log of the parameter decreased at low pH with a unit slope. v is either kcat or kcat/Km, C is the pH-independent value of the parameter, H is the hydrogen ion concentration, and Ka is the acid dissociation constant for reactant or enzyme groups that have a given protonation state for optimum binding and/or catalysis. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, Purification, and Characterizations of the Wild-Type and Mutant Enzymes— Wild-type and mutant 3α-HSD/CR forms (S114A, Y155F, K159A, Y155F/K159A, and Y155F/S114A) were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 and purified by metal-chelate chromatography. DNA sequence was performed and compared with the wild-type through the Blastn program and confirmed the required mutant except for an additional point mutation that occurred at the base position of 45 in which guanine was replaced by cytosine. The silent mutant did not affect the amino acid composition that encoded the same amino acid residue of alanine. The reported 3α-HSD/CR gene had 774 base pairs, which translated into 258 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 26.4 kDa. Each expressed enzyme was found by SDS-PAGE to have an apparent homogeneity (Fig. 2). However, the observed molecular masses of the wild-type and mutants shown in the SDS-PAGE were between the molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) 28.9 and 35.7 kDa. Therefore, the molecular mass of the recombinant enzymes was measured by nanoelectrospray ionization/mass spectrometry to ensure the expressed and purified 3α-HSD/CR and mutants were correct. The observed masses were consistent with the expected masses for wild-type and mutants, which are shown in Table II. The difference in mass of 131 between the calculated and measured mass of wild-type enzyme was attributed to the removal of N-terminal methionine residue during E. coli protein synthesis. The dimeric properties of 3α-HSD/CR and mutants (S114A, Y155F, K159A, S114A/Y155F, and Y155F/K159A) were confirmed through gel filtration chromatography with a Sephadex 75 HR 10/30 column. The secondary structure of wild-type and mutants was measured with a circular dichroism spectropolarimeter to ensure the global conformation was not affected by the amino acid replacement. No apparent difference in spectrum was observed between wild-type and mutants (data not shown), implying conformational similarity between the wild-type and mutant forms.Table IIThe molecular masses and kinetic constants for wild-type and 3α-HSD/CR mutants3α-HSD/CRMolecular massaThe molecular masses of recombinant enzymes were determined by nanoelectrospray ionization/mass spectroscopy analysis on a Q-TOF (quadrupole time of flight) Ultima™ Global.

Open table in a new tab Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of S114A, Y155F, K159A, Y155F/S114A, Y155F/S114A, and Wild-type 3α-HSD/CR—3α-HSD/CR catalyzes the reversible oxidoreductive reaction of androsterone with cofactor NAD+. The addition of substrates is an ordered bi bi mechanism in which pyrimidine nucleotide is the first substrate to be bound and the last product to be released. The enzyme binds nucleotide NAD+, followed by androstanone, to facilitate the oxidative-reductive reaction. The steady-state kinetics of 3α-HSD/CR that catalyzed the oxidation of androsterone was studied by varying the concentration of androsterone at the saturated NAD+. Because the three residues, Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159, in 3α-HSD/CR are well conserved within the SDR family, they have been proposed to form a triad essential for catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to evaluate the functional role of Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 residues located in the active site. The kinetic data were compared with wild-type and mutants at pH 10.5, the optimum rate for forward reaction. The obtained kinetic parameters for wild-type and mutants are shown in Table II. Depending on the amino acid substitution, differential effects on the kinetic constants were observed. The activity was decreased 17–2600-fold for the single mutants S114A, Y155F, and K159A in kcat and 200–3400-fold in kcat/Km. The double mutants S114A/Y155F and Y155F/K159A severely impaired catalysis, decreasing it by 105-fold in kcat. The drop in kcat/Km values was more pronounced for Y155F/K159A with 106-fold decrease. Mutant S114A had a similar Km value to wild-type enzyme, whereas the mutants Y155F, K159A, and Y155F/K-159A increased 10–20-fold. The Km value for S114A/Y155F was 0.1 times that for wild-type. The low activities observed confirm that the residues of S114, Y155F, and K159A are important groups involved in the 3α-HSD/CR-catalyzed reactions. pH Dependence of the Mutants and Wild-type 3α-HSD/CR—To ascertain the important functional groups involved in binding/catalysis on the enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the pH profile on the oxidation of androsterone with NAD+ was studied. The stability of the 3α-HSD/CR at extreme pH was studied by incubating at fixed pH for a period of time. An aliquot of enzyme was taken to assay the relative enzyme activity at pH 9. Our data indicated the enzyme was stable for at least 2 h at pH 5.5 and 10.5 (data not shown). The kinetic parameters of kcat and kcat/Km were obtained by varying the concentration of androsterone at saturated concentrations of NAD+ at pH 5.5–11. Plots of log kcat and log kcat/Km versus pH for the wild-type 3α-HSD/CR and mutants are shown in Fig. 3. The pKa and the pH-independent constants (C) of the kinetic parameter of wild-type and mutants obtained by fitting to Equation 2 are shown in Table III. The reactions catalyzed by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase showed a pH dependence of the kinetic parameter kcat/Km with pKa = 7.2 ± 0.1. The kinetic parameter of kcat was slightly increased with the higher pH values, but no break in the pH rate profile could be assigned. Substitution of amino acids caused a shift of the pKa of mutants in the kinetic parameter kcat/Km and kcat to the basic side. The mutant Y155F showed a pH-dependent profile, whereas the double mutant Y155F/S114A exhibited a pH-independent one, which indicated the group(s) involved in the general base had disappeared. A comparison of pH-independent constants of the kinetic parameter kcat/Km between wild-type and mutants is shown in Table III. Our results gave decreases in kinetic parameter kcat/Km of mutants ranging from 180- to 6 × 105-fold.Table IIIThe pH-independent constants and pKa values for wild-type and mutated 3α-HSD/CR3α-HSD/CRkcat/KmkcatpKaC-Fold decreaseaThe -fold of the decrease is the ratio of the C values for wild-type versus mutants.pKaCm-1 s-1s-1Wild-type7.2 ± 0.1(4.3 ± 0.5) × 107NDbNot defined.

Open table in a new tab The catalytic groups in the short chain dehydrogenase family studied include the most conserved residues of serine, tyrosine, and lysine and form the catalytic triad. Studies of sequence alignment, structure analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic characterization elucidate the role of the catalytic triad. The most conserved residue of tyrosine acts as a general base in the extraction of the proton from the hydroxyl group of steroid and facilitates the hydride transfer to NAD+ (Fig. 4). Lysine lowers the pKa of tyrosine, whereas serine is involved in the hydrogen bonding with substrate. In addition to the catalytic groups Ser, Tyr, and Lys, the residue Asn is also important in maintaining the active site configuration (12Filling C. Berndt K.D. Benach J. Knapp S. Prozorovski T.

Asn is involved in proton relay during catalysis. The proton relay system involves proton transfer from the hydroxyl group of Tyr, 2′OH of the ribose, the Lys side chain, and a bound water connected to the carbonyl group of Asn. Mutation of Asn to Leu renders a loss of activity in 3β/17β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Hence, it has been proposed that the catalytic tetrad consists of Asn, Ser, Tyr, and Lys and is involved in the catalysis of the SDR family (6Oppermann U. Filling C. Hult M. Shafqat N. Wu X. Lindh M.

Based on the structure determination and sequence alignment of 3α-HSD/CR with the SDR family, it could be that the conserved residues of Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 act as a catalytic triad that facilitates the oxidation of androsterone with NAD+ as coenzyme. However, no detailed kinetic study has been reported on how Ser-114, Tyr-155, and Lys-159 are involved in the catalysis/binding. In this study, we have characterized the roles of these residues in 3α-HSD/CR through studies using site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state kinetics, and pH profiling. Steady-state Kinetics of 3α-HSD/CR and Mutants—The studies on the pH profile for wild-type 3α-HSD/CR and mutants showed a plateau above pH 10.5, which indicated an optimum enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Therefore, the activity for wild-type and mutants was further measured and compared at pH 10.5. The kinetic parameters of kcat and kcat/Km on 3α-catalyzed oxidation of androsterone with NAD+ at pH 10.5 are shown in Table II. All mutants we studied decreased the activities in the kinetic parameters of kcat and kcat/Km due to the loss of the functional groups involved in the catalysis. Amino acid substitutions of Ser-114 to alanine and Tyr-155 to phenylalanine removed the hydroxyl group and caused the decrease in activity."

In contrast, gene transfer of apoE4-mut2 (apoE4 (W276A, L279A, V280A, V283A)) did not correct hypercholesterolemia and induced mild hypertriglyceridemia. ApoE-induced hyperlipidemia was corrected by co-infection with a recombinant adenovirus expressing human lipoprotein lipase. Both apoE4 mutants caused only a small increase in hepatic very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride secretion. Density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of plasma and electron microscopy showed that wild-type apoE4 and apoE4-mut2 displaced apoA-I from the high density lipoprotein (HDL) region and promoted the formation of discoidal HDL, whereas the apoE4-mut1 did not displace apoA-I from HDL and promoted the formation of spherical HDL. The findings indicate that residues Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, and Val-269 of apoE are responsible for hypertriglyceridemia and also interfere with the formation of HDL. Substitutions of these residues by alanine provide a recombinant apoE form with improved biological functions.

This region contains two hydrophobic stretches of amino acids between residues 261–269 and 276–283.In the present study, the hydrophobic residues of both regions were mutated to alanines and the functions of the mutant apoE forms were studied in vivo using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. This analysis showed that residues Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, and Ala-269 can account for the apoE-induced hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, the 261–269 apoE sequence is responsible for displacing apoA-I from the HDL region, leading to reduction in plasma apoA-I and HDL levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Recombinant Adenoviruses Expressing the Wild-type and the Mutant Forms of ApoE4—Two apoE4 mutants were generated (apoE4-mut1 (apoE4 (L261A, W264A, F265A, L268A, V269A)) and apoE4-mut2 (apoE4 (W276A, L279A, V280A, V283A))) using the mutagenesis kit QuikChange-XL (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers used are apoE4-mut1-s (5′-GCC TTC CAG GCC CGC GCC AAG AGC GCG GCC GAG CCC GCG GCG GAA GAC ATG CAG CGC-3′), apoE4-mut1-a (5′-GCG CTG CAT GTC TTC CGC CGC GGG CTC GGC CGC GCT CTT GGC GCG GGC CTG GAA GGC-3′), apoE4-mut2-s (5′-GAC ATG CAG CGC CAG GCG GCC GGG GCG GCG GAG AAG GCG CAG GCT GCC GT-3′), and apoE4-mut2-a (5′-GCC CAC GGC AGC CTG CGC CTT CTC CGC CGC CCC GGC CGC CTG GCG CTG CA-3′).

Following 18 cycles of PCR amplification of the template DNA, the PCR product was treated with DpnI to digest plasmids containing methylated DNA in one or both of their strands. The reaction product consisting of plasmids containing newly synthesized DNA carrying the mutations of interest was used to transform competent XL-10 blue bacteria cells (Stratagene). Ampicillin-resistant clones were selected, and plasmid DNA was isolated from these clones and subjected to sequencing to confirm the presence of the point mutations.The recombinant adenoviruses were constructed as described (14Kypreos K.E.

Usually, titers of ∼2–5 × 1010 pfu/ml were obtained.Cell Culture Studies—Human HTB13 cells (SW1783, human astrocytoma) grown to confluence in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were infected with AdGFP-E4 or the adenoviruses expressing the mutant apoE forms AdGFP-E4-mut1 and AdGFP-E4-mut2 at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Twenty-four-hours postinfection, cell were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh serum-free medium was added. After 24 h of incubation, medium was collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SDS-PAGE for apoE expression.Animal Studies—Female apoE-deficient mice 4–6-weeks-old were used in these studies. Groups of 8–10 female mice were injected intravenously through the tail vein with a dose of 2 × 109 pfu. Blood was obtained from the tail vein after a 4-h fast preceding adenoviral injection and 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days postinfection. Aliquots of plasma were stored at 4 and –20 °C.RNA Analysis—To assess the expression of apoE4, apoE4-mut1, and apoE4-mut2 in infected mice, at least 3 mice from each group were sacrificed at 5 days postinfection. Livers were collected from individual animals, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from the livers and analyzed for apoE mRNA expression by Northern blotting and quantitated by phosphorimaging (13Kypreos K.E. Morani P. Van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Zannis V.I.

A total of 25 fractions of 50-μl volume each were collected for further analysis. Triglycerides and cholesterol were determined using the GPO-Trinder Kit (Sigma) and CHOL-MPR3 kit (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations of the serum and the FPLC fractions were determined spectrophotometrically at 540 and 492 nm, respectively, as described previously (14Kypreos K.E.

Four days postinfection, mice were fasted for 4 h and then injected with Triton WR-1339 at a dose of 500 mg/kg of body weight, using a 15% solution (w/v) in 0.9% NaCl (Triton WR-1339 has been shown to completely inhibit VLDL catabolism (20Aalto-Setala K.

This solution was then overlaid with 1 ml of 1.21 g/ml KBr, 2.5 ml of 1.063 g/ml KBr, 0.5 of 1.019 g/ml KBr, and 0.5 ml of saline. The mixture was centrifuged for 22 h in a SW-41 rotor at 30,000 rpm. Following ultracentrifugation, 10 fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Electron Microscopy—Aliquots of the fractions from equilibrium density gradient centrifugation after dialysis against ammonium acetate and carbonate buffer were stained with sodium phosphotungstate, visualized in the Phillips CM-120 electron microscopy (Phillips Electron Optics, Eindhoven, Netherlands), and photographed as described previously (11Li X. Kypreos K. Zanni E.E. Zannis V. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10406-10417Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The photomicrographs were taken at ×75,000 magnification and enlarged three times.RESULTSThe Full-length ApoE4 and the Mutant ApoE Forms ApoE4-mut1 and ApoE4-mut2 Are Secreted Efficiently by HTB-13 Cells—To test the expression and the relative levels of secretion of the mutant apoE4 forms apoE4-mut1 and apoE4-mut2 in comparison to wild-type apoE4, HTB-13 cells that do not synthesize endogenous apoE were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing apoE4, or apoE4-mut1, or apoE4-mut2, or the control adenovirus AdGFP at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Analysis of the culture medium by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and sandwich ELISA showed that apoE4, apoE4-mut1, and apoE4-mut2 are secreted efficiently at comparable levels (in the ranges of 130 and 170 μg of apoE/ml, respectively, 24-h postinfection).Residues Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, and Val-269 Are Responsible for the ApoE-induced Hypertriglyceridemia— We used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in apoE–/– mice to assess the effects of the wild-type apoE4 and the two mutants, apoE4-mut1 or apoE4-mut2, forms on the induction of hyperlipidemia in vivo. The apoE–/– mice were infected with either the control adenovirus AdGFP or the recombinant adenoviruses expressing the wild-type apoE4 or the mutant forms apoE4-mut1, which contains the point mutations L261A, W264A, F265A, L268A, V269A, and apoE4-mut2, which contains the point mutations W276A, L279A, V280A, V283A, and blood samples were collected 4 and 5 days postinfection and analyzed for plasma lipids levels. This analysis showed that the infection of mice with 2 × 109 pfu of recombinant adenovirus expressing the apoE4 or apoE4-mut2 did not alter significantly the plasma cholesterol levels 4 or 5 days postinfection and induced hypertriglyceridemia, as compared with the mice infected with the control virus (Fig. 2) and non-infected mice (data not shown). ApoE4-mut2 overexpression resulted in mild hypertriglyceridemia as compared with the wild-type apoE4 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the infection of mice with recombinant adenovirus expressing apoE4-mut1 at a dose of 2 × 109 greatly reduced plasma cholesterol levels 4 or 5 days postinfection and did not cause hypertriglyceridemia (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and apoE levels of apoE–/– mice infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing apoE4, apoE4-mut1, apoE4-mut2, or the control AdGFP virus. Mice were infected at least in triplicate with the indicated doses of recombinant virus, and serum samples were isolated and analyzed for cholesterol (A) and triglyceride levels (B) on the indicated days postinfection, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ApoE levels were determined on day 5 postinfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The expression of apoE4, apoE4-mut1, and apoE4-mut2 was assessed in mice from each group 5 days postinfection by Northern blotting and apoE mRNA was quantitated by phosphorimaging. This analysis showed that apoE mRNA levels in the three groups were similar (Fig. 3). However, only apoE4-mut1 cleared efficiently the cholesterol of apoE-deficient mice without induction of hypertriglyceridemia, whereas the full-length apoE4 and the apoE4-mut2 did not correct the cholesterol levels of the apoE–/– mice and induced hypertriglyceridemia (Fig. 2).Fig. 3Steady-state hepatic apoE mRNA levels in the livers of individual mice infected with adenoviruses expressing apoE4, apoE4-mut2, or apoE4-mut1.

As an additional control, the infection of mice with 2 × 109 pfu of the control virus AdGFP did not result in any change in the cholesterol and triglyceride profiles of the apoE–/– mice (data not shown).Fig. 4FPLC profiles of serum cholesterol (A–C) and triglycerides (D–F) of adenovirus-infected mice. Serum samples were obtained from uninfected apoE-deficient mice or mice infected with 2 × 109 pfu of the recombinant adenoviruses expressing WT apo-E4 (A and D), apoE4-mut1 (B and E), or apoE4-mut2 (C and F) 5 days postinfection and were fractionated by FPLC.

In mice infected with adenoviruses expressing either apoE-mut1 or apoE4-mut2, the rate of VLDL triglyceride secretion increased 1.9-fold as compared with mice infected with the control adenoviruses but was only 27% of the rate of VLDL secretion observed in mice infected with the apoE4-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 5). The findings suggest that residues Leu-261, Trp-264, Phe-265, Leu-268, Val-269, or residues Trp-276, Leu-279, Val-280, and Val-283 of the human apoE have a major effect on the secretion of hepatic triglycerides and when they are altered to the less hydrophobic alanines, the rate of triglyceride secretion is diminished.Fig. 5Hepatic VLDL-triglyceride (TG) secretion analysis in mice infected with either the control AdGFP adenovirus or recombinant adenoviruses expressing WT apoE4, apoE4-mut1, and apoE4-mut2. Triton WR-1339 (500 mg/kg of body weight) was injected into 3 fasted mice/virus group. Serum samples were collected at 20, 40, 60, and 90 min after the injection with the detergent. Control serum samples were isolated 1 min immediately after the injection with the detergent. Serum triglyceride levels were determined, and a linear graph of serum triglyceride concentration versus time was generated. The rate of VLDL-triglyceride secretion expressed in mg/dl/min was calculated from the slope of the linear graph for each individual mouse.

This treatment corrected both the hypertriglyceridemia and the hypercholesterolemia that occurs in mice treated with apoE4 or apoE4-mut2 alone (Fig. 6, A, B, G, and H). Co-infection of apoE4-mut1 with the adenovirus expressing human lipoprotein lipase decreased slightly the plasma cholesterol levels and had no significant effect on plasma triglyceride levels (Fig. 6, D and E). These findings indicated that under conditions of overexpression of apoE4 or apoE4-mut2, the endogenous lipoprotein lipase activity is rate-limiting for the lipolysis and clearance of VLDL.

The isozymes were found to share similar apparent affinities for cofactors. However, with respect to isocitrate, IDP1 had an apparent <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value ∼7-fold lower than that of IDP2, whereas, with respect to α-ketoglutarate, IDP2 had an apparent <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> value ∼10-fold lower than that of IDP1. Similar <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values for substrates and cofactors in decarboxylation and carboxylation reactions were obtained for IDP2, suggesting a capacity for bidirectional catalysis <i>in vivo</i>. Concentrations of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate measured in extracts from the parental strain were found to be similar with growth on different carbon sources. For mutant strains lacking IDP1, IDP2, and/or the mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup>-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), metabolite measurements indicated that major cellular flux is through the IDH-catalyzed reaction in glucose-grown cells and through the IDP2-catalyzed reaction in cells grown with a nonfermentable carbon source (glycerol and lactate). A substantial cellular pool of α-ketoglutarate is attributed to IDH function during glucose growth, and to both IDP1 and IDH function during growth on glycerol/lactate. Complementation experiments using a strain lacking IDH demonstrated that overexpression of IDP1 partially compensated for the glutamate auxotrophy associated with loss of IDH. Collectively, these results suggest an ancillary role for IDP1 in cellular glutamate synthesis and a role for IDP2 in equilibrating and maintaining cellular levels of isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate."
https://openalex.org/W2121224552,"There is little information available concerning the link between the ryanodine (RY) receptors and the downstream Ca(2+) signaling events in beta-cells. In fura-2 loaded INS-1E cells, activation of RY receptors by 9-methyl 5,7-dibromoeudistomin D (MBED) caused a rapid rise of [Ca(2+)]i followed by a plateau and repetitive [Ca(2+)]i spikes on the plateau. The [Ca(2+)]i plateau was abolished by omission of extracellular Ca(2+) and by SKF 96365. In the presence of SKF 96365, MBED produced a transient increase of [Ca(2+)]i, which was abolished by thapsigargin. Activation of RY receptors caused Ca(2+) entry even when the ER Ca(2+) pool was depleted by thapsigargin. The [Ca(2+)]i plateau was not inhibited by nimodipine or ruthenium red, but was inhibited by membrane depolarization, La(3+), Gd(3+), niflumic acid, and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, agents that inhibit the transient receptor potential channels. The [Ca(2+)]i spikes were inhibited by nimodipine and ryanodine, indicating that they were due to Ca(2+) influx through the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels and Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR). Activation of RY receptors depolarized membrane potential as measured by patch clamp. Thus, activation of RY receptors leads to coherent changes in Ca(2+) signaling, which includes activation of TRP-like channels, membrane depolarization, activation of the voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels and CICR."
https://openalex.org/W2153455336,"Nucleosome packaging regulates many aspects of DNA metabolism and is thought to mediate genetic instability and transcription of expanded trinucleotide repeats. Both instability and transcription are sensitive to repeat length, tract purity, and CpG methylation. CAT or AGG interruptions within the (CAG)n or (CGG)n tracts of spinocerebellar ataxia, type 1 or fragile X syndrome, respectively, confer increased genetic stability to the repeats. We report the formation of nucleosomes on sequences containing pure and interrupted (CAG)n and (CGG)n repeats having lengths above and below the genetic stability thresholds. Increased lengths of pure repeats led to increased and decreased propensities for nucleosome assembly on the (CAG)n and (CGG)n repeats, respectively. CpG methylation of the CGG repeat further reduced assembly. CAT interruptions in (CAG)n tracts decreased nucleosome assembly. In contrast, AGG interruptions in (CGG)n tracts did not affect assembly by hypoacetylated histones. The latter observation was unaltered by CpG methylation of the repeats. However, nucleosome assembly by hyperacetylated histones on interrupted CGG tracts was increased relative to pure tracts and this effect was abolished by CpG methylation. Thus, CAT or AGG interruptions can modulate the ability of (CAG)n and (CGG) tracts to assemble into chromatin and the effect of the AGG interruptions is dependent upon both the methylation status of the DNA and the acetylation status of the histones. Compared with the genetically unstable pure repeats, both interruptions permit a propensity of nucleosome assembly closer to that of random (genetically stable) sequences, suggesting an association of nucleosome assembly of trinucleotide repeats and genetic instability.

The expansion of repeat tracts is associated with at least 42 human diseases (1Cleary J.D. Pearson C.E. Cytogenet. Genome. Res. 2003; 100: 25-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although the instability of CAG/CTG repeats is the cause of 12 diseases, six rare chromosomal fragile sites, three of which are disease-associated, are caused by unstable CGG/CCG tracts. In addition to genetic instability, both CAG- and CGG-expanded repeats have been associated with altered transcription regulation and altered chromatin packaging (2Wang Y-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1994; 265: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 3Eberhart D.E. Warren S.T. Somat. Cell. Mol.

Genetic instability and transcription of the expanded repeats are modulated by various factors including repeat tract length, repeat tract purity, and aberrant CpG methylation. Mechanistically, the effects of each DNA variable may be transmitted by alterations in histone protein-DNA assembly. However, the interrelation of repeat purity upon nucleosome packaging is unknown. Repeat instability is dependent upon both the length and purity of the repeat tract. Longer alleles are more likely to undergo further expansion than their predecessor alleles. Sequence interruptions within the repeat tracts confer increased genetic stability to the tracts (4Chung M Ranum L.P.W. Duvick L.A. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Nat.

In non-affected individuals, the (CAG)n tract of spinocerebellar ataxia, type 1 (SCA1) 1The abbreviations used are: SCA1, spinocerebellar ataxia, type 1; FRAXA, fragile X syndrome; nt, nucleotide.1The abbreviations used are: SCA1, spinocerebellar ataxia, type 1; FRAXA, fragile X syndrome; nt, nucleotide. contains 1–3 CAT interruptions, usually centrally located and separated by one CAG (4Chung M Ranum L.P.W.

In the normal population, the (CGG)n tract of fragile X syndrome (FRAXA) contains 1–3 AGG interruptions, typically at every tenth repeat (6Eichler E.E. Holden J.J.A. Popovich B.W. Reiss A.L. Snow K.

Longer lengths of the pure repeats correlate with instability and disease. The stability threshold lengths at which increased instability occurs are ≥35 pure CAG and ≥25–34 pure CGG for SCA1 and FRAXA, respectively (4Chung M Ranum L.P.W. Duvick L.A. Servadio A. Zoghbi H.Y.

The limited types of interruptions, CAT and AGG, and the pattern of their placement within the SCA1 and FRAXA repeat tract suggest a degree of specificity in their ability to protect from instability. There have only been a limited number of experimental studies investigating the role of interruptions in repeat instability. Several have used endogenous interruptions and configurations (9Pearson C.E. Eichler E.E. Lorenzetti D. Kramer S.F. Zoghbi H.Y. Nelson D.L. Sinden R.R.

Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 252-253PubMed Google Scholar). Alterations in nucleosome formation can affect various processes including transcription. Expanded CTG/CAG and CGG/CCG repeat tracts have variously been associated with decreased (15Choong C.S. Kemppainen J.A. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. Mol.

A loss of FMR1 transcription is linked to full CGG expansions (>200 repeats) and aberrant CpG methylation of the repeat and proximal regions (20Hornstra I.K. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Yang T.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, “premutation” lengths of FRAXA (CGG)n where n = 40–200 displayed increased levels of transcription compared with shorter non-disease-associated lengths of 30 repeats (17Tassone F. Hagerman R.J. Chamberlain W.D. Hagerman P.J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 97: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Kenneson A. Zhang F. Hagedorn C.H. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol.

Yadav-Shah M. Sherman S.L. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These expanded lengths were also associated with variant sites of transcription initiation (23Beilina A. Tassone F. Schwartz H. Sahota P. Hagerman P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, these premutation lengths were associated with premature ovarian failure (24Murray A. Semin. Reprod. Med. 2000; 18: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the recently described fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (25Hagerman P.J. Hagerman R.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 805-816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) that are clinically distinct from FRAXA mental retardation. Altered transcription regulation of genes with expanded repeats is thought to be mediated by altered chromatin packaging at the expanded repeat. Aberrant CpG methylation is associated with CGG instability in addition to affecting FMR1 transcription. In the absence of aberrant CpG methylation, CGG deletions can occur in the male germ line during development of a FRAXA fetus (26Malter H.E. Iber J.C. Willemsen R. de Graaff E. Tarleton J.C. Leisti J. Warren S.T. Oostra B.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), whereas the expanded and methylated repeats are postnatally stable. Similarly, the absence of CpG methylation may enhance CGG deletions in the somatic tissues of high functioning FRAXA males that inherited an expanded CGG tract that had experienced only partial aberrant CpG methylation (27Wöhrle D.

Pearson, unpublished data. Modulation of CpG methylation and histone modifications can affect cytogenetic fragile site expression and transcriptional activity at the FRAXA locus. Cytogenetic fra(X)(q27.3) fragile site expression, which is unique to FRAXA patient cells with CGG expansions, can be blocked by histone acetylation/methylation by exposure to butyrate (30Pomponi M.G. Neri G. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1994; 51: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). De-methylation of DNA by 5-azadeoxycytidine can reactivate suppressed FMR1 transcription in FRAXA patient cells (31Chiurazzi P. Pomponi M.G. Willemsen R. Oostra B.A. Neri G. Hum. Mol.

In this paper, we examined the effect of repeat interruptions, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation status on the formation of nucleosomes on SCA1 and FRAXA repeats with repeat lengths above and below the genetic stability thresholds. DNA—Genomic clones containing human SCA1 (pAG49 and pAG44–24B) and FRAXA (pFXA39, pFXA9+27, pFXA53, and pFXA9+9+32) genomic repeat tracts have been constructed to obtain highly purified DNA samples containing repeat lengths and interruption patterns that are present within the human population. The characterization of all of the plasmids has been described in detail (9Pearson C.E. Eichler E.E. Lorenzetti D. Kramer S.F. Zoghbi H.Y. Nelson D.L. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Nichol K. Pearson C.E. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1246-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Clones pAG49 and pAG44–24B were digested with restriction enzymes StuI and EagI to yield DNA fragments “49” (305 bp) and “12+1+12+1+14” (290 bp). Plasmids pFXA39, pFXA9+9+9+9, pFXA53, and pFXA9+9+32 were digested with restriction enzymes MaeIII and NheI to yield DNA fragments “39” (206 bp), “9+9+9+9” (206 bp), “53” (248 bp), and “9+9+32” (245 bp), respectively. Fragment “49” contains a pure (CAG)49 tract, whereas “12+1+12+1+14” contains 44 CAG repeats interrupted by four CAT interspersions (Fig. 1). Similarly, fragments “39” and “53” contain pure CGG repeats (39 and 53 repeats, respectively), whereas fragments “9+9+9+9” and “9+9+32” contain CGG repeats interrupted by AGG interspersions (39 repeats interrupted by 3 AGG sequences and 52 repeats interrupted by 2 AGG sequences, respectively) (Fig. 1). Each of the SCA1 and FRAXA genomic fragments contains human flanking sequences. For SCA1, these sequences are 62 nt upstream and 96 nt downstream of the CAG tract (sites 1498–1559 and 1647–1742 from GenBank™ accession number NM000332), and for FRAXA, these sequences are 37 nt upstream and 49 nt downstream of the CGG tract (sites 24–60 and 151–199 from GenBank™ accession number S65791). The purified DNAs were radioactively labeled with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (New England Biolabs Inc.) in the presence of [α-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). To produce methylated DNAs, the above fragments were methylated with SssI methylase (New England Biolabs Inc.) in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine. The degree of methylation was determined by resistance to cleavage with a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HhaI. For use as a control, a 262-bp PCR product was generated from nucleotides 239 to 500 of the pUC19 vector. Competitive Nucleosome Reconstitution—Hypoacetylated histone octamers were isolated from HeLa cells (35Hsieh C-H. Griffith J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 535-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Also, HeLa cells were treated with 10 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h to generate hyperacetylated histone octamers. Hyperacetylation of core histone proteins was ∼33-fold higher compared with hypoacetylated octamers as quantified by Western blot analysis using an antibody to acetylated histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology). The ability of DNA fragments to form nucleosomes was assayed using competitive nucleosome reconstitution (36Wang Y-H. Griffith J.D.

DNA fragments (50 ng) labeled with 32P were incubated with 2.5 μg of either hypoacetylated or hyperacetylated histone octamers along with 10 μg of calf thymus DNA in a solution containing 2 m NaCl. NaCl was incrementally reduced to a final concentration of 0.1 m. The assembly mixtures were then directly electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 150 volts for 4 h at room temperature to separate free DNA from the nucleosome-assembled DNA. Results were visualized by autoradiography. The amount of DNA in each band was determined by PhosphorImager scanning (Amersham Biosciences). Each DNA was reconstituted in three separate but identical experiments for each set of histone octamers. For each DNA sample, a “no histones” assembly reaction was performed to serve as a control in which the reaction mixture did not contain histone octamers and the DNA was treated in the same manner, including stepwise salt dilution. The assembling efficiency was represented by the ratio of DNA in complex over free DNA for each sample. The assembling efficiency for the pUC19 fragment was assigned a value of 1. The free energy of nucleosome assembly was calculated according to the equation, E (the repeat-containing fragment) = RT ln(ratio of DNA in complex to free DNA for pUC19 fragment) – RT ln(ratio of DNA in complex to free DNA for the repeat-containing fragment) (37Wang Y-H.

CAT Interruptions Hinder Hypoacetylated Nucleosome Formation on CAG Tracts—The effect of repeat interruptions on nucleosome assembly was determined by comparing a genomic SCA1 CAG tract containing 44 repeats (multiply) interrupted by 4 CAT units (designated as “12+1+12+1+14,” where + signs represent CAT interruptions) with a similar length of 49 pure uninterrupted CAG repeats (Fig. 1). Using hypoacetylated histone octamers, nucleosomes were assembled upon DNA fragments with the interrupted and pure repeats and compared with a random-sequence control pUC19 fragment, representing a “base line” for nucleosome assembly (see “Materials and Methods”). Following gel electrophoresis, the nucleosome-assembled DNAs appeared as retarded bands (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). Assembly was quantified as the ratio of the nucleosome-assembled DNA to free DNA and normalized to the unit ratio generated from pUC19 nucleosome assembly (Fig. 2B). Both the pure 49 repeat and the interrupted “12+1+12+1+14” repeat assembled nucleosomes stronger than the control fragment by as much as 16.3 ± 3.9- and 7.9 ± 3.5-fold, respectively. However, nucleosome assembly on the interrupted repeat was significantly reduced by ∼2-fold as that for the pure repeat (p = 0.007). Thus, the presence of four CAT interruptions within a tract of 44 CAG repeats can significantly reduce the ability of an expanded repeat to assemble into nucleosomes. However, although reduced, the propensity of the interrupted tract to form nucleosomes was still greater than that of the non-repetitive control, indicating that interruptions reduce but do not abolish the tendency of CTG/CAG to assemble into chromatin. AGG Interruptions Do Not Affect Hypoacetylated Nucleosome Formation on Unmethylated or Methylated CGG Tracts—We next determined the effect of AGG interruptions on the formation of hypoacetylated nucleosomes on genomic FRAXA CGG repeat tract by comparing pure repeat tracts having 39 and 53 repeats with similar but interrupted lengths of 39, “9+9+9+9,” and 52, “9+9+32,” repeats (where + signs represent AGG interruptions) (Fig. 1). Both unmethylated and CpG-methylated (“39M,” “9+9+9+9M,” “53M,” and “9+9+32M”) versions of the above DNAs were tested for their ability to assemble nucleosomes. The assembly results of Fig. 3A were quantitated in Fig. 3B. All of the CGG fragments (pure or interrupted, methylated or unmethylated) showed considerably lower abilities to assemble into nucleosomes relative to the control pUC19 fragment reduced to levels of 10–40%. However, unlike CAT-interrupted CAG tracts (above), AGG interruptions in CGG tracts did not significantly affect hypoacetylated nucleosome assembly (pure 53 repeats versus “9+9+32,” p = 0.80; pure 39 repeats versus “9+9+9+9,” p = 0.10) (Fig. 3). Similarly, interruptions failed to significantly affect hypoacetylated nucleosome formation upon CpG-methylated CGG tracts (“53M” versus “9+9+32M,” p = 0.70; “39M” versus “9+9+9+9M,” p = 0.97). CpG Methylation Diminishes Hypoacetylated Nucleosome Formation on Pure and Interrupted CGG Tracts—The effect of DNA methylation on nucleosome assembly over the pure and interrupted CGG repeats was also assessed in Fig. 3. When compared with its unmethylated counterpart, each methylated CGG tract showed a significantly decreased ability to assemble hypoacetylated nucleosomes (pure 53 repeat DNA versus “53M,” p = 0.04; “9+9+32” versus “9+9+32M,” p = 0.01; pure 39 repeat DNA versus “39M,” p = 0.06; “9+9+9+9” versus “9+9+9+9M,” p = 0.01). Thus, CpG-methylation strongly decreased nucleosome formation on CGG repeats, regardless of tract repeat purity. AGG Interruptions Increase Hyperacetylated Nucleosome Formation on Unmethylated CGG Tracts—In vivo, acetylated rather than deacetylated histones are bound to the unmethylated CGG repeat at the FMR-1 gene (34Coffee B. Zhang F. Ceman S. Warren S.T. Reines D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 923-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next determined the effect of AGG interruptions on nucleosome formation using hyperacetylated histone octamers (see “Materials and Methods”). Among the unmethylated DNA samples, a significant increase in hyperacetylated nucleosome formation is exhibited by AGG-interrupted CGG tracts (“9+9+32” versus pure “53” repeat DNA, p = 0.04; “9+9+9+9” versus pure “39” repeat DNA, p = 0.02) (Fig. 4). Also noteworthy is a subtle increased hyperacetylated nucleosome formation on shorter versus longer CGG tracts (compare pure “39” versus pure “53” and “9+9+9+9” versus “9 + 9+32”) (Fig. 4). This CGG tract length effect was observed for hyperacetylated but not hypoacetylated histones.Fig. 1SCA1 and FRAXA genomic fragments. The fragments used herein were derived from human genomic clones and contained both human non-repetitive flanking sequences (for details see “Materials and Methods”) and repeat tracts that were pure or harbored interruptions in the schematically indicated configurations. In the schematic, the CAG and CGG repeats are indicated by hollow circles, whereas the CAT and AGG interrupts are indicated by filled circles. In the fragment nomenclature, the CAT and AGG interruptions are indicated as + signs and the intervening number is that of the contiguous number of CAG or CGG repeats.

We next determined whether methylating the CGG repeats would alter their ability to assemble into hyperacetylated nucleosomes. Strikingly, the enhanced nucleosome assembly by the AGG-interrupted tracts was abolished by CpG-methylation (Fig. 4, “9+9+32M” versus “53M,” p = 0.16; “9+9+9+9M” versus “39M,” p = 0.93). This indicates that the improved nucleosome formation mediated by AGG interruptions is dependent upon both the acetylation state of the histones and upon the CpG-methylation state of the DNA. In this study, extending our original observation that expanded CTG/CAG and CGG/CCG repeats preferentially assemble (2Wang Y-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1994; 265: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 36Wang Y-H. Griffith J.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) or exclude (38Wang Y-H.

Biol. 1996; 263: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) nucleosome formation, we assessed the effect of repeat purity on the ability of these disease-associated repeats to assemble nucleosomes. Specifically, we show that CAT interruptions in SCA1 CAG tracts decreased their preferential nucleosome assembly, whereas AGG interruptions in FRAXA CGG tracts increased nucleosome assembly by hyperacetylated histones, which lessen the nucleosome exclusion ability of pure CGG repeats. Therefore, the common trend of repeat interruptions is to diminish the strong nucleosome-enhanced or -excluded formations, thereby modulating the repeats to be more like random sequences in their ability to assemble into chromatin (Fig. 5). Such effects on chromatin structure may permit the interrupted repeats to be metabolized (with regard to transcription or mutation) more like random sequences rather than like genetically unstable sequences. The effect of AGG interruptions on nucleosome assembly of the CGG repeats has been modeled using DNA flexibility as an indicator (14Metzenberg S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 252-253PubMed Google Scholar). Flexible dinucleotides GA and AG (part of AGG interruptions) in the sequence cause lower free energy of bending of the CGG sequence and should promote nucleosome assembly. Similarly, AG steps are lost when CAT interruptions are present within CAG tracts. These losses may reduce the enhanced ability to assemble nucleosomes. Interestingly, the short tracts of (GGA)n repeats, which contain the AGG unit, have been shown to be flexible (40Takayanagi K. Mishima Y. Kominami R. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and preferentially assemble into nucleosomes (41Yoshimura A. Ura K. Asakura H. Kominami R. Mishima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The differences in the ability of repeat tracts to assemble nucleosomes in the presence or absence of interruptions may be intensified for larger expansions. Such differences could affect higher order chromatin organization, which could have biological effects. Indeed, the strong correlation between the unstable chromatin phenotype of the (CCGNN)48 sequence in yeast (42Kirkpatrick D.T. Wang Y-H. Dominska M. Griffith J.D. Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7661-7671Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the unfavorable energies of nucleosome formation of repeating CCGNN DNA (37Wang Y-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8863-8867Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) measured in vitro by the same assay used in this study further argues that the propensity of nucleosome assembly measured in vitro can provide insight into chromatin stability in vivo. Interruptions have been shown to reduce genetic instability of CAG and CGG repeats in humans. In bacterial and SV40 cell systems, the SCA1 and FRAXA clones containing interrupted repeat tracts are more stable than clones containing pure repeats of similar length (29Nichol K. Pearson C.E. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 1246-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 3K. N. Edamura and C. E. Pearson, unpublished data. Our data show the ability of interruptions to amend the nucleosome assembly of both repeats from opposite strengths to a level closer to that of non-repetitive genetically stable sequences, suggesting a possible mechanism by which interruption-altered nucleosome formation along trinucleotide repeats could modulate either transcriptional activity or genetic stability of these sequences (Fig. 5). Also, both AGG interruptions and CpG methylation provided genetic stability of CGG tracts in both bacterial and primate (SV40) DNA replication model system.3 Whereas the overall deletion frequencies were similar with methylated or unmethylated DNA, in both systems, the ability to retain AGG interruptions is stronger only with unmethylated DNA in the primate cell system, which correlates with the increased nucleosome assembly of unmethylated, interrupted DNA by hyperacetylated histones. We propose that the stabilization of AGG interruptions and the increased nucleosome-assembling ability by unmethylated, interrupted (CGG)n tracts may be related. FMR1 gene expression has been shown to be significantly affected by chromatin structure. CGG repeats, in general, display a strong tendency to exclude nucleosome assembly (38Wang Y-H. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22937-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Wang Y-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24325-24328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we have confirmed this same phenomenon and extended it to include CGG tracts that are CpG-methylated or AGG-interrupted. Alterations in nucleosome assembly mediated by CGG expansions, CpG methylation, and AGG interruptions may modulate chromatin accessibility. Transcription factors USF1, USF2, and α-Pal/Nrf-1 have been shown to interact with the FMR1 promoter (44Kumari D. Usdin K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4357-4364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 45Smith K.T. Coffee B. Reines D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1611-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The binding of such proteins to the CGG repeat and the adjacent promoter can influence directly and indirectly the susceptibility of repeat mutation and/or transcriptional levels or transcription start sites of the FMR1 gene. Our study shows that AGG-interrupted CGG tracts assemble hyperacetylated nucleosomes more efficiently compared with pure repeats, which may suggest that the increased transcription of premutation FRAXA repeat lengths (17Tassone F. Hagerman R.J. Chamberlain W.D. Hagerman P.J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 97: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 18Kenneson A. Zhang F. Hagedorn C.H. Warren S.T. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 2004; 114: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) may differ for interrupted alleles compared with the pure CGG tracts. Such effects of AGG interruptions may influence the susceptibility of the individual to fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome and/or premature ovarian failure, both of which are associated with premutation CGG lengths. Transcription of expanded CGG repeats in transgenic mice showed intranuclear inclusions similar to fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome patients (46Willemsen R. Hoogeveen-Westerveld M. Reis S. Holstege J. Severijnen L.A. Nieuwenhuizen I.M. Schrier M. van Unen L. Tassone F. Hoogeveen A.T. Hagerman P.J. Mientjes E.J. Oostra B.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 949-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), whereas significant neurodegeneration was observed in transgenic Drosophila expressing expanded CGG repeats (47Jin P. Zarnescu D.C. Zhang F. Pearson C.E. Lucchesi J.C. Moses K. Warren S.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 739-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Interruptions did not significantly affect poor nucleosome assembly upon CpG-methylated DNAs, which may reflect the dominant inhibitory effect of CpG-methylation on FMR1 transcriptional activity. The altered nucleosome assembly upon AGG- and CAT-interrupted tracts of FRAXA and SCA1 repeats may explain their ability to genetically stabilize the repeats and may also correlate with altered transcription levels.

https://openalex.org/W2111304119,"Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a common autosomal dominant disorder caused by loss or malfunction of hamartin (tsc1) or tuberin (tsc2). Many lesions in TS do not demonstrate loss of heterozygosity for these genes, implying that dominant negative forms of these genes may account for some hamartomas and neoplasms in TS. To test this hypothesis, we expressed a dominant negative allele of tuberin (ΔRG) behind the cytomegalovirus promoter in NIH3T3 cells and transgenic mice. This allele binds hamartin but has a deletion in the C terminus of tuberin, leading to constitutive activation of rap1 and rab5/rabaptin. Expression of ΔRG in NIH3T3 cells led to a strong induction of reactive oxygen species, induction of vascular endothelial growth factor, and malignant transformation in vivo. Expression of ΔRG driven by the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter led to high level expression in all murine tissues examined, including skin, kidney, liver, and brain. Surprisingly, mice expressing the ΔRG transgene developed a fibrovascular collagenoma in the dermis, which closely resembles the Shagreen patch observed in human patients with TS. In addition, numerous small subpial collections of external granule cells in the cerebellum were observed, which may be the murine equivalent of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas or tubers commonly seen in TS patients. Thus, expression of a dominant negative tuberin in multiple tissues can lead to a tissue-specific phenotype resembling some of the findings in human TS. Our data are the first to demonstrate that specific signaling abnormalities underlie specific hamartomas in a model of a human genetic disorder.

Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes morbidity and mortality because of seizures, mental retardation, hamartomas, and benign and malignant neoplasms (1Shepherd C.W.

Neoplasms of the kidney can cause renal failure, pain, and life-threatening hemorrhage, and renal neoplasms remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in adults with TS. No medical therapy exists to slow the progression of these hamartomas and tumors or to shrink them once they become problematic. A common feature of all TS associated hamartomas and benign and malignant tumors is that these tumors are highly angiogenic. Indeed, our laboratory has demonstrated that these lesions produce the angiogenic stimulator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (7Arbiser J.L. Brat D. Hunter S. D'Armiento J. Henske E.P.

Although tuberin and hamartin deletions have been generated in mice, these models do not fully recapitulate human TS. Notably, whereas neoplasms occur commonly in these mice, hamartomas have not been described (8Onda H. Lueck A. Marks P.W. Warren H.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 9Kobayashi T. Minowa O. Kuno J. Mitani H. Hino O. Noda T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1206-1211PubMed Google Scholar). These hamartomas include human skin lesions, including collagenomas and angiofibromas as well as certain brain lesions such as the abnormalities in neural migration that result in tubers and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. Second, no phenotype/genotype correlation has been established between mutations in tuberin and hamartin and human phenotypes. However, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is most common in neoplasms such as angiomyolipoma, lymphangiomyomatosis, and renal cell carcinoma but much less common in hamartoma tissue even when neoplasms and hamartomas coexist in the same patient (10Henske E.P.

A potential reason for this lack of correlation is that LOH of these genes may result in a wide variety of signaling abnormalities in differing tissues, thus making it difficult to assign a phenotype to a specific signaling abnormality. In this study, we study the effect of a tuberin mutant (12Pasumarthi K.B. Nakajima H. Nakajima H.O. Jing S. Field L.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in a transgenic mouse when the transgene is expressed behind the cytomegalovirus promoter. Our transgenic mouse model directly addresses the contribution of a specific signaling abnormality to the TS phenotype in vivo. We demonstrate that dominant negative tuberin can induce signaling abnormalities in cultured cells and induce development of hamartomas in transgenic mice. Notably, these hamartomas occur in a tissue-specific manner even when the transgene is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. Plasmids and Cell Lines—The plasmid pCMVΔRG was obtained from Loren Fields (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN). This plasmid was transfected into NIH3T3 cells using Lipofectin and selected with G418. Resistant colonies were pooled and labeled 3T3ΔRG. pCMVΔRG was linearized with BgII and XbaI, gel-purified, and injected into mouse embryos. Western Blotting—For signal transduction analysis, starved NIH3T3 and ΔRG NIH3T3 cells, untreated and treated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB, were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm EDTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 1% aprotinin). The sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with anti-tyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-Akt antibody (catalog number 9272, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-phospho Akt (Ser-473) antibody (catalog number 9271, Cell Signaling), phospho S 6 ribosomal protein (Ser-240/-244, catalog number 2215, Cell Signaling), and phospho-P70S6 kinase (Thr-421/Ser-424, catalog number 9204, Cell Signaling) and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Reactive Oxygen Generation—Confluent cells in 100-mm dishes were washed with 6 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution and released by using 0.25% trypsin (w/v)/1 mm EDTA followed by the addition of 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. After pelleting, the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. Dichlorofluorescein diacetate was added to a final concentration of 2 μm and incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence was determined by using a FACS from BD Biosciences (excitation wavelength, 488 nm; emission wavelength, 515–545 nm). Reverse Trancription-PCR for VEGF—Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Sigma). Reverse transcription-PCR was conducted with the Promega accession reverse transcription-PCR kit. Primers used were as follows: actin (728 bp), forward 5′-AAG ATG ACC CAG ATC ATG TTT GAG AC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTG CTT GCT GAT CCA CAT CTG CTG G-3′; VEGF (445 bp), forward 5′-TCA TGC GGA TCA AAC CTC ACC AA-3′ and reverse 5′-TCT CGC CCT CCG GAC CCA AAG T-3′. Reactions were performed in an Eppendorf master cycler. One PCR cycle at 45 C° for 45 min and 94 C° for 2 min followed by 40 PCR cycles under standard conditions with an annealing temperature of 60 °C were performed. β-Actin mRNA was used as a reference message to normalize the content of total RNA. VEGF expression was calculated as the relative expression ratio to that of β-actin. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Quantification was determined by triplicate repeats. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice were produced by standard mechanisms. Briefly, the ΔRG transgene (see Fig. 5) was purified using a Qiaex II extraction kit (Qiagen), resuspended in injection buffer at 2 ng/μl, and microinjected into C57BL/6 fertilized embryos. Embryos were transferred into ICR recipient females, and resultant pups were screened for the presence of the transgene by both PCR (see Fig. 6) and Southern blot (data not shown). Fig. 6 shows the screening methodology and representative results for PCR screening of the transgenic mice. Primers TSC2F (GTCCAGGAGAGACTCAGGTGCCAGT) and TSC2R (CTGTAAGGTCTGCAACTCCGGAGAA) span intron 8 and thus give a wild-type band of 568 bp and a transgene specific band of 281 bp) Three independent founder mice were identified (#922,928,945) and established as independent lines.Fig. 6PCR screening of typical litter from ΔRG line number 922.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections were prepared on poly-l-lysine coated slides. To block the endogenous peroxidase activity, the sections were treated with methanol containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min and then washed in PBS. They were stained using a standard avidin-biotin peroxidase kit (Nichirei Co., Tokyo, Japan) with antibodies against MCP-1 (Genzyme Techne, Minneapolis, MN) and anti-CCR-2B (see Fig. 8) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (both diluted in PBS, 1:250) (13Yamamoto T. Eckes B. Krieg T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2936-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Subsequently, they were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody followed by the streptavidin-peroxidase treatment. The sections were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution as chromogen and then counterstained with hematoxylin and dehydrated, cleared, and mounted. Negative controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibodies and by their substitution with corresponding IgG at the dilution used for the specific antibodies in this study. Primary Single Muscle Fiber Isolation and Culture—Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. The skin was prepared with 70% ethanol, and the legs were skinned and placed into room temperature Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Muscles were dissected out and placed into collagenase type I (Worthington) 400 units in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and digested at 37 °C for 70 min. Individual live muscle fibers were collected under a dissecting microscope using polished glass pipettes and then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 20% fetal bovine serum supplemented with antibiotics and glutamine. Satellite Cell Proliferation Assay—Bromodeoxyuridine was added to cultures at a final concentration of 10 μm (for varying length pulses all ending at 72 h of culture). At the end of the pulse, fibers were washed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, then washed again in PBS. Fibers were then treated with 4 m HCl for 10 min, washed with PBS, then treated with 1% Triton-X in PBS for 4 min and washed again with PBS. Primary anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (rat monoclonal, Harlan Sera Labs) was applied in a 1:10 dilution at 4 °C overnight. After PBS washes, the secondary antibody donkey anti-rat (Alexa Fluor 594, Molecular Probes) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature at 1:400 dilution. After PBS washes, the fibers were mounted using VectaShield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs, Burlingame CA). Fluorescent, stained satellite cells were counted as a function of unit length of fiber (one 200X field diameter) (14Csete M. Walikonis J. Slawny N. Wei Y.W. Korsnes S. Doyle J.C. Wold B. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Satellite Cell Apoptosis—After 72 h in culture, fibers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde as above, washed in PBS, then permeabilized with 0.1 m sodium citrate + 0.1% Triton-X on ice for 2 min. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling was then performed with antibody to the nick end DNA conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. Fibers were mounted, and stained fluorescent satellite cells were counted as for proliferation studies. The ΔRG allele of tuberin was introduced into NIH3T3 fibroblasts to assess signaling abnormalities. Because various oncogenes have been shown to induce reactive oxygen, and reactive oxygen has been shown to contribute to cellular transformation (15Arbiser J.L. Petros J. Klafter R. Govindajaran B.

The ΔRG allele of tuberin caused a significant increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide as shown by DCF fluorescence (Fig. 1). We have shown previously that PDGF-BB plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis lesions. Thus, we assessed the effect of the ΔRG allele on response to exogenous PDGF-BB. Cells expressing ΔRG or parental NIH3T3 were exposed to PDGF-BB. Cells expressing ΔRG showed an increase in phosphorylation of a 185-kB protein consistent with PDGFRβ (Fig. 2A). In addition, cells expressing ΔRG had increased levels of phosphorylation of akt at baseline and enhanced phosphorylation of akt in response to PDGF-BB (Fig. 2B). Loss of tuberin has been associated with activation of protein synthesis, namely through the activation of the ribosomal proteins S 6 and S 6 kinase. Similarly, expression of the ΔRG mutant tuberin led to activation of S 6 and S 6 kinase (Fig. 3). Expression of the ΔRG allele also caused a strong induction of the angiogenic factor VEGF (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Introduction of the ΔRG allele into NIH3T3 cells induces expression of VEGF m RNA.Lane 1, NIH3T3 pCDNA; Lane 2, NIH3T3 Δ RG. M, molecular weight marker.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Three lines of transgenic mice were established (922, 928, and 945). Integration of the mutant allele was confirmed by PCR using primers flanking exons 8 and 9 of tuberin. Genomic DNA gives a band of 567 bp, whereas transgene DNA (cDNA) gives a 281-bp band (Figs. 5 and 6). Among the seven 922 mice examined, five showed aggregates of granular cells at the surface of the cerebellum immediately underneath the pia. Aggregates ranged in size from 10–25 cells in histologic cross sections and took the form of linear arrangements along the surface of the molecular layer or as small nodules that extended into the subarachnoid space. Cells with aggregates had the morphology of mature granular cells with no evidence of cytologic atypia (Fig. 7, A–D). Solitary granular cells and small clusters (3–4 cells) were also noted at the surface of the cerebellum in similar frequency as wild type controls. In the seven 945 mice examined, three brains were noted to have similar aggregates of granular cells at the cerebellar surface, and the range of sizes was slightly smaller (10–15 cells). Among the eight age-matched wild type mice, the cerebellum showed only rare individual cells or small clusters at the pial surface. In no cases did the aggregates extend outward into the subarachnoid space. No developmental or dysplastic changes resembling cortical tubers were noted in the cortex of cerebral hemispheres. No subependymal dysplastic growths were noted in along the ventricular system. No neoplastic growths were noted within the lateral ventricles of any brains. The dermis and perimuscular area were remarkable for thickened muscle and a myxoid accumulation of cells in a perimuscular area, which was rich in mast cells (Fig. 7, E–G). These lesions histologically resemble collagenomas (Shagreen patches), which are present in a significant number of patients with tuberous sclerosis. These lesions are present in all of the transgenic mice but not in the wild type littermates. To assess whether the transgene resulted in increased proliferation or apoptosis of muscle satellite cells, we performed proliferation and apoptosis assays on wild type and transgenic mice. No differences in proliferation or apoptosis were observed, suggesting that these do not represent accumulations of muscle satellite cells (data not shown). Monocyte chemotactic factor 1 (MCP-1) has been associated with various mesenchymal proliferations, including cirrhosis of the liver. Recently, MCP-1 has been shown to be up-regulated in human lesions of TS. 2T. Darling, personal communication. We examined the expression of MCP-1 and its receptor, CCR-2, and found that the expression of both of these genes is elevated in the dermal lesions of the transgenic mice but not in wild type mice (Fig. 8). Tuberous sclerosis is a common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by an increased incidence of benign and malignant tumors as well as developmental hamartomas. In childhood, the major cause of morbidity and mortality are cerebral tubers, which histologically are giant cells with a tendency to calcify and become foci for seizures. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas appear in a periventricular distribution and may cause ventricular obstruction through continued growth. Lesions in TS can be divided into those that usually show LOH for tsc1/tsc2 and those that do not. Angiomyolipomas and lymphagiomyomatosis, clonal neoplasms with features of smooth muscle, fat, and melanocytes, commonly exhibit LOH (10Henske E.P. Wessner L.L. Golden J. Scheithauer B.W.

Henske E.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 810-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cerebral tubers usually do not exhibit LOH (19Henske E.P. Scheithauer B.W. Short M.P. Wollmann R. Nahmias J. Hornigold N. van Slegtenhorst M. Welsh C.T. Kwiatkowski D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 400-406PubMed Google Scholar). We propose two potential explanations for the development of lesions in TS in the absence of LOH. First, we propose that certain mutations in tsc2 can act as dominant negatives and acquire novel functions through the activation of aberrant signaling pathways (12Pasumarthi K.B. Nakajima H. Nakajima H.O. Jing S. Field L.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A consequence of this is heightened sensitivity of certain cells to physiologic levels of growth factors. We and others have previously demonstrated that TS model cells are highly sensitive to PDGF (20Arbiser J.L. Govindarajan B. Bai X. Onda H. Kazlauskas A. Lim S.D. Amin M.B. Claesson-Welsh L. Am. J.

Physiol. 2003; 285: C409-C418Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A second mechanism that we have observed is LOH of other tumor suppressor genes, and we have previously observed LOH of p16ink4a in a tumor arising in a mouse heterozygous for tuberin (22Govindarajan B. Mizesko M.C. Miller M.S. Onda H. Nunnelly M. Casper K. Brat D. Cohen C. Arbiser J.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 3469-3475PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although this tumor had lost p16ink4a, it retained a wild type tsc2 gene (22Govindarajan B. Mizesko M.C. Miller M.S. Onda H. Nunnelly M. Casper K. Brat D. Cohen C. Arbiser J.L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 3469-3475PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several other potential targets of tuberin have been discovered. Several groups have found that tuberin serves as an inhibitor of phosphoinositol-3 kinase/akt signaling, and overexpression of tuberin leads to decreased phosphorylation of akt (23Manning B.D.

In addition, overexpression of tuberin has been shown to inhibit signaling through pathways that inhibit protein processing, such as target of rapamycin, ribosomal protein S 6, and S 6 kinase (Fig. 3) (25Goncharova E.A. Goncharov D.A. Eszterhas A. Hunter D.S. Glassberg M.K. Yeung R.S. Walker C.L. Noonan D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Chou M.M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Krymskaya V.P. J. Biol.

These proteins are involved in the translation of proteins involved in cell growth, such as VEGF (Fig. 4) (28el Hashemite N. Walker V. Zhang H.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5173-5177PubMed Google Scholar). However, systemic long term use of rapamycin in humans may not be an optimal therapy for TS, as rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant and may lead to severe infections and neoplasms because of loss of immune surveillance (29Thomson A.W. Woo J. Lancet. 1989; 2: 443-444Abstract PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other targets of tuberin have been proposed. In a study of Eker rat cells containing a tetracycline inducible tuberin, gene chip array has found several genes induced, including thiol-specific antioxidant and glutathione peroxidase, indicating that tuberin may protect cells against oxidative stress, and cells lacking tuberin or may have increased reactive oxygen species (30Orimoto K. Tsuchiya H. Sakurai J. Nishizawa M. Hino O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that reactive oxygen species have been shown to contribute to mitogenesis and tumorigenesis (31Arnold R.S. Shi J. Murad E. Whalen A.M. Sun C.Q. Polavarapu R. Parthasarathy S. Petros J.A. Lambeth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5550-5555Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In normal cerebellar development, external granular cells at the cerebellar surface are a proliferative population that eventually migrates inwardly to populate the internal granular cell layer. After this process early in life, the external granular layer is largely depleted with only scattered remnant granular cells. In the transgenic animals in this study, we found numerous microscopic aggregates of mature granular cells in the subpial region suggesting that their normal migration inward may have been disrupted. This particular phenotype is not encountered in the cerebellum of tuberous sclerosis patients. However, the cortical tubers and subependymal nodules that characterize this disease in the cerebral hemispheres are architecturally abnormal collections of neuronal and glial elements that are most likely caused by disordered migration and development. Subpial cerebellar aggregates of granular cells may be the murine manifestation of this disordered developmental program. No other central nervous system stigmata of tuberous sclerosis were noted in transgenic mice, and no neurologic symptoms could be ascribed to the cerebellar changes. We have demonstrated that mutant tuberin can cause increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen. Reactive oxygen has been implicated in the induction of fibrogenic cytokines, such as MCP-1, and increased expression of MCP-1 and its receptor CCR2 have been observed in fibrotic processes associated with reactive oxygen, such as bleomycin-induced scleroderma, idiopathic scleroderma, and hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis (32Muhlbauer M.

Lesional skin from transgenic mice demonstrate elevated levels of MCP-1 compared with wild type littermate skin, suggesting that MCP-1 may play a pathogenic role in TS lesions. Interestingly, PDGF is a known stimulant of MCP-1, and the introduction of the ΔRG allele of tuberin results in increased responsiveness to PDGF (35Distler O. Pap T. Kowal-Bielecka O. Meyringer R. Guiducci S. Landthaler M. Scholmerich J. Michel B.A. Gay R.E. Matucci-Cerinic M. Gay S. Muller-Ladner U. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2665-2678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This increased sensitivity could underlie in part the increased production of MCP-1 in our transgenic mice. Inhibition of MCP-1/CCR-2 interactions may be beneficial in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis, and mice deficient in either of these genes have a decreased fibrotic response to various experimental stimuli (32Muhlbauer M. Bosserhoff A.K. Hartmann A. Thasler W.E. Weiss T.S. Herfarth H. Lock G. Scholmerich J. Hellerbrand C.

Prior studies have addressed signaling abnormalities in the absence of tsc2. However, none of these studies have addressed signaling abnormalities seen in the presence of a dominant negative tuberin. In this study, we show that a dominant negative tuberin can recapitulate many of the signaling abnormalities observed because of loss of tuberin. In vivo expression of mutant tuberin results in a unique phenotype not previously observed in nonhuman tuberous sclerosis models. Finally, we show that constitutive expression of a dominant negative gene leads to a tissue-specific phenotype resembling the human disease. Our model may be valuable in assessing contributions to tissue specificity and may prove useful in pharmacologic studies to prevent or treat tuberous sclerosis."

Variations may be accounted for in part by the specific conditions and the different methods employed, which are gel shifts and footprints versus solution FRET studies.

The cofactor is essential for the growth of yeast, and deletion of the gene encoding NC2α led to an early embryonic phenotype in mice (34Iratni R. Yan Y.T. Chen C. Ding J. Zhang Y. Price S.M.

Oxygen deficiency induces binding of NC2 to certain mammalian genes correlated to repression of transcription, which argues for a similar role in vivo (37Denko N. Wernke-Dollries K. Johnson A.B.

However, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NC2 seems to affect gene transcription both positively and negatively (38Chitikila C. Huisinga K.L. Irvin J.D. Basehoar A.D. Pugh B.F. Mol.

The positive effect is not entirely understood at present, but it may reflect the capacity of NC2 to facilitate binding of TBP to promoters (40Cang Y. Prelich G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12727-12732Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The NC2 complex consists of two subunits, named NC2α (Drap1) and NC2β (Dr1), which dimerize through histone fold domains of the H2A/H2B type present in the amino termini (8Kamada K. Shu F. Chen H.

Here we study the binding of NC2 to mammalian genes using gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitations. NC2 is shown to localize to the promoter regions of many genes. Ratios of TBP to NC2 vary from one gene to another without uncovering an obvious correlation to the presence of bona fide TATA boxes. In fact, in vitro analyses revealed that NC2·TBP displays moderate sequence specificity for TATA. We further show that NC2 increases both the on-rate of TBP to DNA and the stability of TBP·DNA complexes. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Human NC2 subunits were expressed as both two single subunits and bicistronic co-expression constructs in pET11d as described previously (46Gilfillan S. Stelzer G. Kremmer E. Meisterernst M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Truncation mutants were constructed using PCR primers harboring a stop codon at the desired position. All vectors were confirmed by sequencing. The human TBP, also in pET11d, was expressed and purified as described previously (47Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4712-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 48Kretzschmar M. Stelzer G. Roeder R.G. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3927-3937Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Human TFIIA was expressed and purified as described elsewhere (31Xie J. Collart M. Lemaire M. Stelzer G. Meisterernst M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The binding reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 4 mm MgCl2,25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.2, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, glycerol (7–10%), and 70–90 mm KCl. Protein and DNA amounts are given in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 27 °C, loaded on a 5% acrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 50:1), and run at 120 V in Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 248 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were usually run at room temperature, but when TFIIA was included, the gels were run at 4 °C. Band intensity was quantified using a phosphorimager (Packard Instantimager). DNA Templates Used in EMSA—Oligonucleotides were annealed in buffer (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, and 1 mm MgCl2) by heating to 95 °C for 3 min and cooling gradually to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides (designed to contain 4-bp 5′ overhangs) were stored at 4 °C and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by Klenow fill-in using standard procedures. The 35-bp sequences used were as follows (the TATA sequence is underlined): H2B promoter, CTGAAGCGATTCTATATAAAAGCGCCTTGTCATAC; Vβ promoter, CCAGGATGCATTCTGTGGGGATAAAATGTCACAAA; HLAA promoter, TCGCGGTCGCTGTTCTAAAGTCCGCACGCACCCAC; interleukin-2 promoter, CCAGAATTAACAGTATAAATTGCATCTCTTGTTCA; and adenovirus major late promoter (AdML-TATA and AdML-wt), CCTGAAGGGGGGCTATAAAAGGGGGTGGGGGCGCG. Mutations in the TATA sequence were as follows (mutations are underlined): TGCTGGG, GATAAAA, CATAAAA, GAGAAAA, CTCGAGA, or TGTAAAA. Longer DNA fragments used for EMSA (217 bp) were isolated from pB2-MLP carrying a 99-bp EcoRI/SmaI fragment of the AdML promoter (49Kim J. Zwieb C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A TATA to TGTA mutation in this vector (pSO18) was produced with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). EcoRI fragments of both vectors were purified and labeled with [α-32P]dATP. Cell Culture—Suspension cultures of human Jurkat (J6 human leukemia T cell) or HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) enriched with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cell density was kept between 2 and 9 × 105 cells/ml. Cell lysate from Jurkat cells was prepared by washing cells once in phosphate-buffered saline and suspending them in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm benzamidine) using a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysate was centrifuged (7000 × g, 30 min), and the pellet was discarded. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was performed with a rat monoclonal NC2α antibody (4G7) and polyclonal TBP antibody on formaldehyde cross-linked Jurkat cells. In brief, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 9 min at room temperature, sonicated, and run on a CsCl gradient as described previously (46Gilfillan S. Stelzer G. Kremmer E. Meisterernst M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Antibody and extract were incubated overnight, followed by incubation with a mixture of protein A- and G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washing, complexes were eluted from the beads, cross-links were reversed, and DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitated. Quantitative PCR was performed (28 cycles; sequences of primers are available upon request). Mononucleosome Preparation—The chromatin pellet of extracted HeLa nuclei (36Meisterernst M. Roy A.L. Lieu H.M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 66: 981-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was resuspended using a Dounce homogenizer in buffer (15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 3 μg/ml aprotinin). The pellet was collected by centrifugation (200 × g, 5 min) and washed twice with the same buffer. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 0.23 mm. 200 units of micrococcal nuclease (N-5386; Sigma) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 3–20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 5 mm, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 200 × g for 15 min. The presence of mononucleosomes in the supernatant was confirmed by sizing columns, protein gels, and digestion with proteinase K and subsequent analysis of the DNA on agarose gels. Immunoprecipitation—Protein G beads and NC2α monoclonal antibody (4G7) were incubated for at least 4 h. Mononucleosome fraction or nuclear extract was added; adjusted to BC150 supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration, 5 mm), dithiothreitol (final concentration, 1 mm), and IGEPAL CA-630 (final concentration, 0.1%); and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing, followed by four rounds of washes with 1 ml of BC150 each. Beads were recovered by centrifugation for 3 min at 300 × g. NC2 was eluted with SDS loading buffer (4 min at 95 °C). Calculation of Active Protein Concentration—Either NC2 or TBP was kept at limiting concentration while the other protein was in excess, and DNA was titrated until no further increase in complex formation was observed. This was defined as the active concentration, which is always referred to in the text. The active amount of TBP was ∼65% in the specific preparation and ∼60% for NC2 relative to total protein. Calculation of the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant KD—The equation used to determine the binding constant derives from the equilibrium binding constant: 1/KD = KB = [c]/([TBP·NC2] × [DNA]), where [c] is the concentration of NC2·TBP·DNA complex at equilibrium, and [protein] and [DNA] are the equilibrium concentrations of TBP and DNA, respectively. To simplify the equation, TBP·NC2 was treated as a single protein entity. NC2·TBP Is Localized on TATA and TATA-less Promoters in Vivo—ChIP experiments were performed to monitor NC2 and TBP on the promoters of endogenous human genes in Jurkat cells. NC2 was found on all promoters tested. NC2 and TBP levels are high and the NC2/TBP ratio is low at the highly active H2A/H2B locus. The HLAA locus carrying a cryptic TATA displayed the highest level of NC2. The TATA-less eIF4E promoter also binds NC2, whereas on the promoter of interleukin-2, TBP and NC2 levels are low, although it harbors a reasonable TATA box (Fig. 1). The limited set of data does not allow for a statistical correlation of NC2 occupancy relative to the core promoter structure. Presently, the data suggest that NC2 binds to many promoters in human cells. This binding does not require the presence of a TATA box. Finally, NC2/TBP ratios vary significantly from one promoter to another. NC2 and TBP Are Present in Bulk Chromatin—Localization of NC2 on many genes may indicate that the factor resides in chromatin together with TBP. To test this hypothesis, mononucleosomes were prepared from chromatin extracts of HeLa cells and tested for the presence of NC2. Approximately 10–20% of total NC2 was found in the mononucleosome fraction. NC2α was precipitated using a monoclonal antibody described previously (46Gilfillan S. Stelzer G. Kremmer E. Meisterernst M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The precipitated material was analyzed for the presence of NC2β, TBP, TAFs, and BTAF1 (formerly called TAF170/172) using polyclonal antibodies. TBP, but not TAFs or BTAF1 (50Timmers H.T. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1946-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), co-precipitated with NC2 (Fig. 2A). We also could not detect histones in the precipitated material (data not shown). Given the stringency of the immunoprecipitation, this does not exclude interactions of NC2 with BTAF1 and the TFIID complex. Nevertheless, the data argue for a strong preference of NC2 for free TBP. Notably, antibodies did not co-precipitate detectable amounts of TBP with NC2 in HeLa nuclear extracts. We reasoned that co-precipitation from chromatin extracts might be facilitated by DNA (Fig. 2B). To test this hypothesis, the immunoprecipitated material was treated with DNase I. This resulted in a complete loss of TBP in the NC2 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C), arguing for interaction of TBP and NC2 through DNA. It is somewhat puzzling that promoter and coding regions of the H2A/H2B locus seemed underrepresented in NC2 immunoprecipitations compared with the input as analyzed by PCR (data not shown). This could be explained if TBP·NC2 localizes to open chromatin, in which the DNA is readily accessed by micrococcus nuclease. Although the average length of micrococcus nuclease-treated DNA was chosen to be in the range of kilobases in our analysis, hypersensitivity could perhaps lead to trimming of the genomic DNA flanking the TBP·NC2 binding sites, which could render them inaccessible to PCR analysis. This hypothetical model and the ChIP analysis support the notion that NC2 localizes to active promoters. However, at present, the exact nature of the preferred binding sites of chromatin-bound TBP·NC2 remains elusive. Even if these were in part not promoter regions, formation of a TBP·NC2 could make sense in that it could prevent transcription from non-promoter regions. This primarily requires an excess of NC2 over TBP. Western analysis of Jurkat whole cell extracts revealed that NC2 is indeed present in moderate excess over TBP (with TBP comprising ∼0.11 ng/μg and NC2 comprising ∼0.18 ng/μg of the total protein mass; Fig. 2D). In addition, part of TBP is probably engaged in complexes, for example, with the class I and class III TAFs. Another major part is thought to be in a complex with BTAF1. In summary, NC2 is probably present in significant excess over TBP in the extracts of human cells. The NC2·TBP Complex Shows Moderate Preference for TATA—EMSA was used to compare the binding of NC2·TBP to oligonucleotides comprising core regions of the selected promoters studied above in ChIP. Consistent with the in vivo localization, NC2·TBP bound to all promoters tested, irrespective of the presence of a consensus TATA motif. A moderate preference for promoters harboring a consensus TATA sequence (H2B and interleukin-2) as compared with promoters with a poor TATA sequence (HLAA and Vβ; Fig. 3A) was seen. In contrast to NC2·TBP, and as expected from the published data, TFIIA·TBP exhibits a clear preference for TATA (Figs. 3C and 4B). Specific TFIIA·TBP binding to TATA is seen even at high concentrations where NC2·TBP complexes do not show priority for TATA (Fig. 3, B and C). To document the specific influence of TATA, point mutations were analyzed in the context of the AdML promoter. Again, NC2·TBP complexes did not discriminate between wt and mutant oligonucleotides at nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 4A). However, a moderate preference for TATA (∼3-fold) was seen if limiting concentrations of TBP and NC2 were employed (Fig. 4C). Competition experiments further confirmed the limited specificity for TATA (Fig. 4D). To analyze the specificity of the NC2·TBP complex to DNA under more physiological conditions, the binding reaction was conducted at 140 mm potassium glutamate. Also, under these stringent conditions, TBP·NC2 binds DNA with very limited specificity for TATA (Fig. 4E).Fig. 4Specificity of binding by NC2·TBP and TFIIA·TBP to the AdML promoter, depending on different TATA mutations.A, EMSA of NC2·TBP with AdML promoter wt (TATAAAA) and mutants GATAAAA, CATAAAA, GAGAAAA, TGTAAAA, or TGCTGGG, as indicated. All lanes contained 21 nm DNA template and increasing TBP·NC2 with 6.5, 32, and 161 nm TBP and 9.6, 19.3, and 96.3 nm NC2 as indicated (96.3 nm NC2 in lane 2 and161 nm TBP in lane 3 and the last lane).

E, EMSA analysis of TBP·NC2 specificity at low and high salt. Reactions contained 0.25 nm AdML-TATAAA or AdML-CTCGAG oligonucleotides in 60 mm KCl or 2.5 nm AdML-TATAAA or AdML-CTCGAG oligonucleotides in 140 mm potassium glutamate, limiting amounts (0.5 nm) of yeast TBP at four different concentrations of NC2 (0.2, 0.8, 2.5, and 10 nm). F, complex formation on a 217-bp fragment containing a wt AdML TATA versus a mutation to TGTA. Concentrations of protein were as follows: 1.5, 5.3, and 15 nm NC2; 0.7, 2.4, and 7.2 nm TFIIA; and 7.6, 15, and 32 nm TBP. Each lane contained 7.5 nm DNA. The first and last lanes contained 32 nm TBP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reduced specificity of TBP binding in the presence of NC2 was also seen with a 217-bp fragment comprising 80 bp of AdML promoter flanked by polylinker sequences and containing either a wt TATA sequence or a single point mutation (TGTAAAA). The mutation did not influence binding of the (fast) monomeric TBP·NC2 complexes (Fig. 4F). Under comparable conditions, the TFIIA·TBP complex that is seen on the wt fragment was not formed on a TGTA mutant. Further consistent with low specificity for TATA, NC2·TBP complexes usually form a ladder of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric complexes (and so forth) on longer DNA fragments that contain both TBP and NC2 (data not shown). 2G. Stelzer, E. Piaia, and M. Meisterernst, manuscript in preparation. The appearance of higher order complexes in the case of TBP·TFIIA probably results from binding to TATA-like sequences present in the polylinker. This is not seen if limiting concentrations of TBP are used and, contrary to TBP-NC2, is not seen on other DNA fragments. Efficient Recognition of DNA-bound TBP by NC2—Next we wished to determine the binding constant of NC2·TBP·DNA complexes. Initially, the limiting factor for complex formation was identified via titration of TBP and NC2 at constant and limiting (0.1 nm) DNA concentrations (Fig. 5A). At 0.5 nm TBP and high (20 nm) NC2, templates were not yet saturated (note that TBP was present in excess over DNA). If TBP levels are raised to 3 nm, low concentrations of NC2 (0.15 nm) shift more than 50% of the promoter. We conclude that TBP, but not NC2, is limiting for complex formation. Similar results were obtained at somewhat higher (0.5 nm) DNA concentrations (Fig. 5B). This set of experiments allows for a rough estimation of the affinity of NC2 for TBP·DNA (KD 1–2 × 10-10m). As demonstrated below and consistent with the notion that TBP is t"
https://openalex.org/W1979849071,"Plasmepsin II (PM II) is an aspartic protease active in hemoglobin (Hb) degradation in the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum. A fluorescence-quenched octapeptide substrate based on the initial hemoglobin cleavage site is recognized well by PM II. C-terminal extension of this peptide has little effect, but N-terminal extension results in higher maximal velocity and dramatic concentration-dependent substrate inhibition. This inhibition, but not the rate stimulation, depends on the presence of a DABCYL group on the peptide N terminus. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified PM II residues that interact with N-terminal amino acids of peptide substrates. The same residues influence degradation of Hb by PM II. Cathepsin E (CatE), a related mammalian aspartic protease, is also stimulated by N-terminally extended substrates. This suggests that distal substrate interactions as far out as P6 may be a general property of aspartic proteases and may be important in substrate and inhibitor recognition. Although PM II and CatE are similar in their ability to cleave Hb-based peptides and Hb α-chains, CatE is not able to degrade native Hb, which is a substrate for PM II. Based on these results, we propose that PM II may have the special feature of being a Hb denaturase.

Malaria is a large burden on society, causing at least 300 million acute illnesses and 1–3 million deaths annually (1Breman J.G. Alilio M.S. Mills A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004; 71: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Malaria is spread by Anopheles mosquitoes, and the protozoan parasite grows and multiplies within erythrocytes in its asexual cycle. Of the four types of malaria infecting humans, the most severe form is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Increasing drug resistance to P. falciparum has created an urgent need for new drugs. To mature inside erythrocytes, parasites degrade vast amounts of Hb in an enormous catabolic effort (2Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. Rosenthal P.J.

Additionally, Hb degradation may create space for the growing parasite and contribute to osmolar maintenance (7Lew V.L. Tiffert T. Ginsburg H. Blood. 2003; 101: 4189-4194Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, hemoglobinases are considered an important chemotherapeutic target. Aspartic proteases may be especially important for the survival of the parasite because inhibitors specific for this class of enzymes kill parasites early in their erythrocytic life cycle (5Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Oksman A. Knickerbocker A. Mueller R. Bryant M.L. Sherman D.R. Russell D.G. Goldberg D.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Bailly E. Jambou R.

Three aspartic proteases, called plasmepsins (PMs), and one closely related protease (histo-aspartic protease) containing a histidine in place of an active site aspartate, reside in the food vacuole, the site of Hb degradation (9Banerjee R. Liu J. Beatty W. Pelosof L. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Each of the food vacuole PMs cleaves Hb in the α-chain between Phe-33 and Leu-34, (10Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Smith C.E. Duffin K.L. Goldberg D.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Goldberg D.E. Slater A.F. Beavis R. Chait B. Cerami A. Henderson G.B. J. Exp.

Cleavage at this site is speculated to lead to Hb denaturation and, thus, generation of additional protease-accessible sites. To better characterize the molecular mechanism underlying Hb degradation by PMs, we studied the catalytic properties of PM II with peptide substrates and Hb. Using fluorogenic peptide substrates, we discovered that PM II is subject to dramatic substrate inhibition. In addition, peptides extending far into unprimed subsites stimulate protease activity. Neither substrate inhibition nor rate enhancement is unique to PM II, but both are also present in distant relatives and may be common features of aspartic protease catalysis. The ability to degrade native Hb, on the other hand, is not shared by relatives of PM, as CatE cleaves peptides based on the primary Hb cleavage site well but does not act on Hb. Protein Expression and Purification—Mature PM II (m-PM II) was generated by amplifying a construct encoding the proform of PM II (13Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with the primers 5′-GCCATGGGTAGTTCAAATGAT-3′ and 5′-CCAACAATTGGATCTACTGAA-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into pCR4, its sequence was confirmed, and it was digested with XbaI and MunI. The fragment was subcloned into an expression construct containing the C-terminal portion of PM II in the pET-3d vector. A construct containing 46 amino acids of the pro-domain (p77-p122) was amplified with the primers 5′-CCATATGTCCGAACATTTAACTATT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCCTAATAATTTGTTTTAGTAAG-3′ and, using the NdeI and BamHI sites, subcloned as a C-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion protein into a pGEX expression vector. The proform-PM II construct contains an alteration in codon 238, with a change from Lys to Arg (13Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This conservative change does not affect peptide cleavage kinetics (data not shown). m-PM II mutant constructs were prepared using QuikChange with the primers (complement primers are not listed) 5′-GATGTTATCAGATGCCCATTCTTACCTAAATATGTAACTCTTTGTAACAACAGAAAATT-3′ (for m-F244K), 5′-ATGGGTTCAGAGTCCCATTCTGACCTGAATATGTAACTCTTTGTAACAACAGCAAAT-3′ (for m-F244E), 5′-GTTGCAGAATTTAGATGTTATCAAAGTCCCATTCTTACCTTTCTAT-3′ (for m-R238K), and 5′-TTAGATGTTATCAGAGTCCCATTACCTTTCTATGTAACTCTTTGTACC-3′ (for the deletion of Phe-241, m-d241). Expression of recombinant proteins was in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells with 200 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4–6 h in TB media (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA). After cell lysis by sonication, inclusion bodies were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and washed 2 times each in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA). Inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer D (6 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) and applied to a heparin-Sepharose FF column equilibrated in buffer D. The proteins were collected in the flow-through and applied to a Mono Q 10/10 column equilibrated in buffer D. Proteins were eluted from the Mono Q column with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Refolding was achieved by rapid 20–30-fold dilution into buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) at room temperature and stirring for at least 14 h. To autoactivate the proform of PM II, sodium citrate, pH 4.7, at a final concentration of 0.1 m was added. The activated enzyme was then dialyzed into buffer E. Proteins were concentrated on a Mono Q 10/10 column, preequilibrated in buffer E, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Final purification and removal of aggregates were performed with two gel filtrations on Superdex 75. Gel filtration 1 was carried out in buffer F (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.25 m NaCl) on proteins that had been treated with 5 mm dithiothreitol. Gel filtration 2 was done in buffer G (20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.25 m NaCl). To prevent autolysis proteins were stored in buffer G containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 4 °C. To estimate the molecular masses of proteins, the Superdex 75 column was calibrated with low molecular weight standards in buffer G. Enzyme Kinetics—Kinetic assays were performed with internally quenched fluorescent peptide substrates in real time using a Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Varian) with excitation at 336 nm (slit width 5 nm) and emission at 490 nm (slit width 10 nm). The appearance of cleavage products was measured at 37 °C for 40–200s. Progress curves were followed to verify that linear initial rates were being measured, and different enzyme concentrations were used to ensure that activity increased linearly with increasing enzyme. Sequences of synthetic peptides were based on the primary site of cleavage within Hb, and numbering of the peptides corresponds to the residues within the α-chain of Hb. The sequences of synthetic peptides were as follows: 3037a, DABCYL-GABA-ERMFLSFP-EDANS; 2837a, DABCYL-GABA-ALERMFLSFP-EDANS; 3037b, EDANS-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-ERMFLSFP-diaminopimelate-(DABCYL)OH; 2837b, EDANS-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-ALERMFLSFP-diaminopimelate-(DABCYL)OH. Peptides varying in length and/or identity of the residue at position 28 (Figs. 2 and 3) contained N-terminal DABCYL with a GABA linker and C-terminal EDANS groups. Assays were performed in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 10% glycerol (for peptides 3037b and 2837b) or 20% glycerol for all peptides containing N-terminal DABCYL groups. All peptides were determined to be ≥95% pure. They were dissolved in Me2SO, and a constant 2% Me2SO was used in the assays. Protease concentrations ranged between 0.5 and 3 nm. Catalytic parameters were determined only for substrates that were free of substrate inhibition. Averages of three to four measurements were used at each substrate concentration. Km and Vmax values were calculated by direct fitting of initial rates using the Michaelis-Menten equation and Kaleidograph software. Concentrations of enzymes were determined by active-site titration with pepstatin, and the kcat was calculated from kcat = Vmax/[E] (14Copeland R.A. Enzymes: a Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). For all substrates displaying substrate inhibition, rates were measured for equal time periods. In these cases, the reported rates may not represent initial rates, but they are consistent throughout the experiment. Because substrate inhibition depended on protein concentration, the same concentration of PM II was used throughout. Fluorescence units were converted to molarity by measuring fluorescence intensities of complete digests at three peptide concentrations for each peptide.Fig. 3Side chains at P6 contribute to substrate inhibition and rate enhancement. m-PM II was prepared and rates were analyzed as in Fig. 2. A, side chains contribute to substrate inhibition. Altering P6 in the decapeptide from Ala (magenta) to Gly (green) results in a peptide whose properties resemble the P5-P4′ nonapeptide (orange). Changing Ala to the small polar Ser side chain (blue) does not significantly alter the peptide cleavage characteristics. B, bulky side chains enhance substrate inhibition. Changing P6 from Ala to larger hydrophobic groups gives more substantial substrate inhibition. Altering Ala to Trp (dark red) results in a peptide with extreme substrate inhibition. C, Asp at P6 eliminates substrate inhibition (green), whereas the peptide with the longer E side chain (blue) shows substrate inhibition and rate enhancement. D, basic side chains either behave like the 2837a peptide (Arg, green) or decrease the rate enhancement (Lys, blue). Positive charges located at the end of long side chains at P6 may not influence the peptides. Instead, the aliphatic character of the side chains may determine cleavage characteristics.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mapping of Cleavage Sites by Mass Spectrometry—Peptides 3037b and 2837b were dissolved in 30% acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid and diluted to a concentration of 1 μm for use. Digests were set up at pH 5.0 for 30 min to 4 h with either PM II, CatE, cathepsin D (CatD), or pepsin in 0.1 m ammonium acetate. Digested peptides were purified using ZipTips (C18 matrix) and prepared for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. Spectra were acquired on an Applied Bioscience 4700 Explorer Proteomics Analyzer in positive ion mode using the reflector. Sequence information was obtained using peptide fragmentation in tandem mass spectroscopy mode. For 3037b, a product with a mass of 930.4 was assigned to the N-terminal peptide in the cleavage reaction Phe-33–Leu-34, whereas the same cleavage resulted in a mass of 1114.5 with the 2837b peptide. A product with a mass of 967.4 from the parent 2837b peptide was mapped to the M32-F33 cleavage site. Hemoglobin Degradation—Purified Hb and α-chains were gifts of the laboratory of Gary Ackers (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). The chains of Hb were isolated from one another with p-mercuribenzoate (15Bucci E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Purified α-chains contain heme but are not folded as tightly as native Hb (16Hargrove M.S. Whitaker T. Olson J.S. Vali R.J. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17385-17389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Degradation experiments were performed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min to 18 h in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. Reactions were stopped by 2-fold dilution into SDS-PAGE-loading buffer and boiling for 3 min. Hb concentrations were estimated by densitometry using ImageJ software. Typical substrate concentrations were 0.2–10 μm heme, and protease concentrations were 0.1–0.3 μm. The stability of PM II mutants in the reaction mixtures was tested with fluorogenic peptides, and they were not different from the wild-type protease. Reagents—Synthetic peptides were obtained from Anaspec (San Jose, CA). High performance liquid chromatography columns and gel filtration standards were from Amersham Biosciences. Pepstatin A and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were from Roche Applied Science. CatD (bovine), CatE (mouse recombinant), pepsin (porcine), and pET-3d were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). QuikChange mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the pCR4 vector was from Invitrogen. All other reagents were from Sigma. Preparation of Recombinant Mature Plasmepsin II—In the parasite, PM II is translated as an inactive zymogen containing a 124-amino acid-long N-terminal pro-sequence that has a membrane-spanning domain. Within the food vacuole the pro-sequence is removed by a calpain-like maturase, and native PM II is released (17Banerjee R. Francis S.E. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro, a PM II construct with a partial pro-sequence that is missing the transmembrane domain (N terminus at M70p) efficiently inhibits activity by stabilizing an open and catalytically incompetent conformation of the protease active site (18Bernstein N.K. Cherney M.M. Yowell C.A. Dame J.B. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). At acidic pH, this partial pro-PM II auto-activates to form auto-PM II containing 14 N-terminal amino acids that are not present in mature, native PM II (Fig. 1A). Auto-PM II and native PM II have been shown to exhibit similar kinetic parameters with a synthetic peptide substrate (13Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We sought to establish an expression system that bypasses the need for auto-activation. PM II expressed well from a pET3d construct that contained G124p after an initiator Met (Fig. 1A), and inclusion bodies of the protein (referred to as mature or m-PM II) were purified. We thought that the pro-domain of PM II might be required for proper folding of the protease and hoped that providing this domain in trans would suffice. We prepared and purified a soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing residues p77-p122 of the pro-domain and added this glutathione S-transferase-pro-PM II at a molar ratio of 1:1 to m-PM II during refolding. As a control reaction m-PM II was prepared without the addition of glutathione S-transferase-pro-PM II. To judge the success of refolding, we measured the protease activity of both fractions and determined that it was equal (data not shown), indicating that in vitro, the residues encoding m-PM II are sufficient for proper folding. Consequently, m-PM II was purified and refolded similarly to auto-PM II (Fig. 1B). Gel filtration gave an estimated Mr of 37,400 for auto-PM II and an Mr of 36,300 for m-PM II, compared with calculated Mr values of 38,200 for auto-PM II and 37,000 for m-PM II (data not shown), and suggested that both proteins were monomeric under the conditions used. The yield of purified inclusion bodies was ∼2-fold higher, and that of the refolded, active protein was up to 3-fold higher with m-PM II compared with auto-PM II. Using a fluorescence-quenched octapeptide (3037b), auto-PM II and m-PM II showed similar kinetic parameters (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of PM II and CatE with internally quenched fluorescent octapeptide or decapeptide Initial rates of peptide cleavage used 2 nm PM II, 1.6 nm CatE (3037b), or 0.37–0.76 nm CatE (2837b). For PM II, substrate concentrations were 0.1–8 μm with 3037b and 0.1–6 μm with 2837b. For CatE, substrate concentrations were 0.1–10 μm with 3037b and 0.1–8 μm with 2837b.Peptide3037b2837b(kcat/Km2837b)/(kcat/Km3037b)Kmkcatkcat/KmKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1s-1 μm-1μms-1s-1 μm-1auto-PM II3.05 ± 0.411.100.3601.05 ± 0.112.522.406.67m-PM II3.86 ± 0.220.8750.2271.00 ± 0.102.332.3410.3m-F244E3.02 ± 0.230.4310.1431.38 ± 0.110.9520.6704.82m-F244K6.11 ± 0.410.8450.1382.33 ± 0.391.510.6474.70m-F244A4.33 ± 0.641.110.2561.27 ± 0.122.511.987.73m-d2412.94 ± 0.190.5960.2031.00 ± 0.101.051.065.21CatE8.12 ± 0.612.500.3085.01 ± 0.6712.12.427.85 Open table in a new tab N-terminally Extended Substrate Peptides Enhance Plasmepsin II Activity—In attempting to model peptide substrates of PM II in the enzyme active site (co-crystal of PM II with inhibitors; Protein Data Bank codes 1SME, 1LF2, and 1LEE) (19Silva A.M. Lee A.Y. Gulnik S.V. Maier P. Collins J. Bhat T.N. Collins P.J. Cachau R.E. Luker K.E. Gluzman I.Y. Francis S.E. Oksman A. Goldberg D.E. Erickson J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2001-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we observed that only a small portion of the active site is solvent-accessible. Consequently, P′ residues could be accommodated, but extended P residues clashed with the protein. To investigate whether lengthening peptides N-terminally might have an effect on catalysis, we synthesized a series of peptides based on the sequence of the primary cleavage site within Hb. Both P and P′ were extended beyond the original octapeptide (ERMFLSFP) (13Luker K.E. Francis S.E. Gluzman I.Y. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and rates of peptide cleavage were measured (Fig. 2, A and B). As illustrated in Fig. 2A, an extension of two N-terminal amino acids was critical for maximal rate enhancement. Some, but not all of the P-extended peptides, showed strong substrate inhibition. Substrate inhibition without rate stimulation was observed in the nonapeptide P5-P4′, whereas the decapeptide P6-P4′ exhibited rate enhancement as well as substrate inhibition. This suggested that rate enhancement and substrate inhibition are separate phenomena. Peptides that extended beyond the P6 position did not lead to additional rate stimulation. Peptides with a negatively charged N-terminal amino acids (P4-P4′, P4-P6′, P7-P4′) showed attenuation of substrate inhibition. Extending peptides beyond P4′ did not result in either rate stimulation or substrate inhibition (Fig. 2B). Instead, a modest rate decrease for all C-terminally extended peptides was observed. The origin of this rate decrease is unclear. Importantly, C-terminal extension of substrates did not inhibit the rate enhancement of the N-terminal extensions. Thus, rate stimulation is determined by distal P-sites, particularly by P6. Because the substrates were based on the sequence of Hb, extending the peptides not only changed their length but also their character. To analyze the contribution of amino acid side chains in detail, we synthesized a series of modified P6-P4′ substrates in which the P6 residue was changed, whereas all other amino acids remained constant. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, side chains contributed to substrate inhibition and rate enhancement. Truncation of the P6 side chain by altering the residue from Ala to Gly resulted in a peptide with characteristics similar to the P5-P4′ peptide. Replacing P6 with Ser, on the other hand, had little effect. Bulky side chains enhanced substrate inhibition (Fig. 3B), with the most bulky and hydrophobic peptide (P6 = Trp) being the most potent inhibitor. Aspartate at P6 released substrate inhibition (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, an acidic peptide with a longer side chain (P6 = Glu), showed rate enhancement beyond that observed with the ALERMFLSFP peptide. This additional stimulation of the catalysis may result from the longer aliphatic side chain of the glutamate. Basic side chains at P6 had substrate inhibition similar to the ALERMF-LSFP peptide, whereas the extent of rate enhancement was variable and possibly depended on the hydrophobicity and/or orientation of the long side chains (Fig. 3D). To investigate whether the reduction in the rate of product generation at high substrate concentration was due to substrate or product inhibition, we tested whether product peptides could act as inhibitors. Neither the unmodified P1′-P4′ peptide nor unmodified P-peptides of different length or P-peptides containing an N-terminal DABCYL inhibited substrate cleavage under any of the tested conditions. We examined whether the N-terminal DABCYL moiety of the synthetic peptides contributes to substrate inhibition by synthesizing a P4-P4′ octapeptide and a P6-P4′ decapeptide with an N-terminal EDANS and a C-terminal DABCYL group (peptides 3037b and 2837b). These modified substrates showed no substrate inhibition up to a concentration of 10 μm with the octapeptide and only minimal substrate inhibition with the decapeptide (Fig. 4B). The rate stimulation observed previously with the N-terminally extended substrates, however, was still present (Fig. 4 and Table I). This confirmed that rate enhancement and substrate inhibition are independent phenomena and that distal P sites are critical for the stimulation of catalysis. The order of magnitude increase in catalytic efficiency with the longer peptide could be attributed to both better initial binding (decreased Km) and better turnover (higher kcat). Localization of Distal S Sites—To determine which region of PM II interacts with the extended P-sites, we examined the PM II-pepstatin co-crystal structure and introduced a number of site-directed mutations. A loop (residues 240–243 and neighboring amino acids) was of particular interest, since it is highly conserved among PMs and is stabilized by inhibitor binding (see “Discussion”). Replacing the wild-type Phe-244 with Glu or Lys resulted in m-PM II mutant proteins that had reduced catalytic efficiencies with either peptide (Table I). Stimulation by the P-extended peptide was attenuated in the mutant enzymes. However, the reduced catalytic efficiencies of the two mutants were due to different mechanisms; m-F244E had a reduced kcat, whereas m-F244K had an increased Km. Replacing Phe-244 with Ala did not alter the kinetic parameters significantly. This suggests that the Phe-244 side chain does not participate in specific interactions with the peptide but that it is important for the proper formation of the structure and/or flexibility of the extended active site of the enzyme. A deletion of Phe-241 (m-d241) was similar to the m-F244E construct in that primarily the kcat was affected (Table I). Degradation of Hemoglobin by Wild-type and Mutant Plasmepsins—To see whether distal S-sites are only important for peptide cleavage or for protein cleavage as well, we studied the ability of PMs to degrade Hb. As shown in Table II, m-F244E and m-d241 had reduced Hb-cleavage ability, whereas m-F244K and m-F244A degraded Hb as well as the wild-type protein. In the peptide kinetic analysis, m-F244E and m-d241 showed decreased kcat values (Table I). For m-F244E we titrated the concentration of Hb in the assay, and the mutant activity differed from that of wild type only at saturating Hb concentrations above 1 μm (data not shown), thereby demonstrating a kcat effect on protein as well as peptide.Table IIHemoglobin degradation by wild-type and mutant plasmepsin II Hb (heme concentration of 9 μm) was incubated with 0.29 μm PM II in 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 37 °C. Control reactions contained no enzyme. Aliquots were removed after 0–5 h of incubation, and reactions were stopped by diluting with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiling for 3 min. The time course experiment indicated that rates of degradation were linear. Gel electrophoresis was performed on 15% SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining, and Hb degradation was quantified with densitometry. Reactions were performed in quadruplicate and for three time points.Enzymem-PM IIm-F244Am-F244Em-F244Km-d241pmol of Hb degraded/haMean of 12 measurements4.844.963.554.703.63S.E.±0.10±0.17±0.15±0.14±0.54p valuebThe p value is from Student's t test vs. m-PM II0.519<0.00010.771<0.0001a Mean of 12 measurementsb The p value is from Student's t test vs. m-PM II Open table in a new tab Distal Unprimed Sites Are Important Determinants of Aspartic Protease Catalytic Efficiency—We wondered whether the rate stimulation with increased N-terminal peptide length was unique to PM II or a general feature of aspartic proteases and studied the catalytic properties of mammalian enzymes related to PM II (CatD, CatE, and pepsin). With the exception of pepsin all enzymes exhibited a rate enhancement. Substrate inhibition with peptides containing an N-terminal DABCYL was observed with CatD but not with CatE or pepsin (data not shown). Rate enhancement could either be a consequence of increased binding interactions as seen in PM II or the result from additional cleavage sites available in the longer substrate. To distinguish these possibilities, we used mass spectrometry and analyzed peptide fragments after protein digestion.

Intestinal metaplasia in the stomach is defined by the presence of intestine-like cells expressing enterocyte-specific markers, such as villin. In this study, we demonstrate that villin is expressed in intestine-like cells that develop after chronic infection with H. pylori in both human stomach and in a mouse model. Transfection studies were used to identify specific regions of the villin promoter that are inducible by exposure of the cells to H. pylori. We demonstrated that induction of the villin promoter by H. pylori in a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS) required activation of the Erk pathway. Elk-1 and the serum response factor (SRF) are downstream transcriptional targets of the Erk pathway. We observed inducible binding of Elk-1 and the SRF after 3 and 24 h of treatment with H. pylori, suggesting that the bacteria alone are sufficient to initiate a cascade of signaling events responsible for villin expression. Thus, H. pylori induction of villin in the stomach correlates with activation and cooperative binding of Elk-1 and the SRF to the proximal promoter of villin.

We demonstrated that induction of the villin promoter by H. pylori in a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line (AGS) required activation of the Erk pathway. Elk-1 and the serum response factor (SRF) are downstream transcriptional targets of the Erk pathway. We observed inducible binding of Elk-1 and the SRF after 3 and 24 h of treatment with H. pylori, suggesting that the bacteria alone are sufficient to initiate a cascade of signaling events responsible for villin expression. Thus, H. pylori induction of villin in the stomach correlates with activation and cooperative binding of Elk-1 and the SRF to the proximal promoter of villin. Chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa (chronic gastritis) develops in response to Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth in the hypochlorhydric stomach (1Blaser M.J. Parsonnet J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 2Houben G.M. Stockbrugger R.W. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1995; 212: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Over time, the inflammatory process progresses, and alteration of the epithelial cell population occurs, which includes gradual loss of parietal cells coinciding with an increase in the number of mucous cells. Proliferation of mucous cell types with evidence of an intestinal phenotype (intestinal metaplasia) is a major precursor lesion in gastric cancer (3Correa P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6735-6740PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, intestinal metaplasia is a lesion that develops in a variety of cancers derived from organs of the forestomach (4Hampson S.J. Falzon M. Cowie A.G. Br. J. Urol. 1992; 69: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 5Albores-Saavedra J. Nadji M. Henson D.E. Angeles-Angeles A. Pathol. Res.

Interestingly, intestinal metaplasia in different organs all express protein markers commonly found in normal intestinal enterocytes, e.g. TFF3, Cdx2, villin (7Moll R. Robine S. Dudouet B. Louvard D.

The gastric epithelium develops from intestinal endoderm by 16 days postcoitum when the pyloric border is formed. At that time, fetal intestinal markers cease to be expressed in the gastric epithelium. Re-expression of intestine-specific genes in the adult stomach represents a shift to a metaplastic phenotype that correlates with increased gastric proliferation. Villin is expressed in primitive endoderm by embryonic day 5 and coalesces at the apical surface by day 8.5 postcoitum as the microvilli of the gut are being formed (11Ezzell R.M. Chafel M.M. Matsudaira P.T. Development (Camb.). 1989; 106: 407-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Landry C. Huet C. Mangeat P. Sahuquet A. Louvard D. Crine P.

Development (Camb.). 1992; 115: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By 16 days postcoitum, there is a one-cell distinction between villin expression in the duodenum and minimal expression in the antral glands (14Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By postnatal day 1, villin expression in the stomach has completely receded. Thus, there is a complete absence of villin expression in the corpus of the mouse stomach (15Pinto D. Robine S. Jaisser F. El Marjou F.E. Louvard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6476-6482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Villin is a structural protein regulated by increased intracellular calcium that in turn binds to actin and contributes to the formation of microvilli in the small bowel (16Friederich E. Pringault E. Arpin M. Louvard D. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mice deficient for the villin gene are viable (17Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Microvilli develop but do not respond normally to calcium-dependent signals, implicating the protein in the response to cell injury (17Pinson K.I. Dunbar L. Samuelson L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Ferrary E. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Lapillonne A. Athman R. Ruiz T. Boulouha L. Marjou ElF. Doye A. Fontaine J.J. Antony C. Babinet C. Louvard D. Jaisser F. Robine S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, villin is expressed in intestinal metaplasia observed in Barrett's esophagus and in chronic atrophic gastritis (19MacLennan A.J. Orringer M.B. Beer D.G. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 24: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore villin is an important marker of the pre-neoplastic cell type that forms in the gut in response to chronic injury (20Regalado S.P. Nambu Y. Iannettoni M.D. Orringer M.B. Beer D.G. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whether true villin-positive intestinal metaplasia is a feature of the altered pattern of differentiation observed with Helicobacter colonization and inflammation has not been examined. In this report, we established that villin expression emerges in the infected stomachs of human subjects and a mouse model of Helicobacter infection. Further, we showed that the first 554 bp of the villin promoter contain elements capable of responding to H. pylori in culture. Within this proximal promoter region, we found that a serum response element (SRE) 1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor; EBS, Ets binding site; YY1, YingYang1; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection.1The abbreviations used are: SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor; EBS, Ets binding site; YY1, YingYang1; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection. confers inducible regulation of the villin promoter by H. pylori and that Elk-1 and the serum response factor (SRF) form a ternary complex at this element. Bacteria—The mouse-adapted H. pylori SS1 strain was used to inoculate mice for up to 14 months and was a gift from Dr. K. Eaton, University of Michigan. The H. pylori J99 strain (American Type Culture Collection 700824) is a human isolate that was used in the cell culture experiments because of its ability to strongly induce human cell lines. The bacteria were cultivated on blood agar plates containing Campylobacter base agar (Difco) supplemented with 5% horse blood (Colorado Serum, Denver, CO), 5 μg/ml vancomycin, 10 μg/ml trimethoprim lactate, and 2 μg/ml nystatin (Sigma). The plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions (CampyPak Plus, BBL; BD Biosciences) at 37 °C for 1-2 days. Human Tissue—Institutional Review Board approval from the University of Michigan was obtained prior to the acquisition of human tissue by Dr. Nguyen T. Vinh and Dr. Nguyen N. Thanh during endoscopy at Friendship Hospital and Tran Hung Dao Central Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. The biopsies were fixed in formalin and then paraffin-embedded. Plasmids—The -554 Villin P/Intron reporter construct was prepared as described previously (21Madison B.B. Dunbar L. Qiao X.T. Braunstein K. Braunstein E. Gumucio D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33275-33283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and consists of 554 bp of the mouse 5′-flanking sequence, the first exon, and the entire first intron. Dominant negative Erk-1 and Erk-2 constructs were gifts from Dr. Melanie Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX) (22Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the Ets and SRE sites within the villin reporter construct was accomplished using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the following primer: 5′-GGGCCCTATCTAACCTTATAAAGTGAAG-GAAGTAACT-3′. Deletion of the SRE/EBS binding site was created the same way using the following QuikChange primer: 5′-TCTGGGGCCCTATCTGGGGGGGGGGT-GGTGGTGAGGACC-3′. All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. The dominant negative Elk construct in pCMV5 (dnElk-1) was a gift from Dr. Peter E. Shaw (Queen's Medical Center, Nottingham, UK). The Elk-1 coding sequence contains a deleted C-terminal Apa fragment rendering the expressed protein kinase-deficient (23Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 24Gille H. Kortenjann M. Strahl T. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; : 1094-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Animals and Helicobacter Challenge—C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in individual, sterile microisolators for up to 14 months. Five days before infection, all mice were treated for 3 days with streptomycin (5 mg/kg) in their drinking water to reduce the natural bacterial flora. SS1 bacteria were harvested in Brucella broth (BBL), the concentration was adjusted according to the OD at 550 nm, and a 0.2-ml suspension containing 108 viable bacteria was used for oral infection. Each animal was challenged with bacteria three times over 5 days. All mice were fasted overnight with access to water ad libitum before analysis. The study protocol used was approved by the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use Committee, which maintains an American Association of Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care facility. Infection by H. pylori was verified by testing re-isolates for urease (using a drop of urea broth containing 10 g of urea, 0.5% w/v phenol red, 0.22 g of NaH2PO4H2O, 0.51 g of Na2HPO4, 100 mg of NaN3, and 500 ml of distilled water at pH 6.2), catalase (using 3% H2O2 solution) and oxidase activity (DrySlide, BBL), as well as by PCR of the H. pylori-specific 16 S rRNA according to Fox et al. (25Fox J.G. Beck P. Dangler C.A. Whary M.T. Wang T.C. Shi H.N. Nagler-Anderson C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Histology—Paraffin sections of the human biopsies or mouse stomach were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for grading the intensity of inflammation and metaplasia. The presence of metaplasia was confirmed by a periodic acid-Schiff procedure/Alcian blue stain. Immunofluorescence—Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of H. pylori SS1-infected and -non-infected mice were used. Deparaffinized sections were used for citrate buffer retrieval (10 mm citric acid for 10 min at 89-95 °C) and blocked with 15% donkey serum. To document villin expression in the stomach mucosa, primary mouse anti-proton pump IgG antibody (2B6, Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Naka-ku Nagoya, Japan), detecting the β subunit of the mouse H+, K+-ATPase, and goat anti-villin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added in a dilution of 1:500 and 1:100, respectively, and then incubated with the sections at room temperature for 1 h. After rinsing the slides in phosphate-buffered saline, secondary antibodies were applied using Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG from donkey and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG from donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) in a dilution of 1:75 at room temperature for 1 h. DAPI (5 ng/slide, Sigma) was used to counterstain the nuclei. Slides were mounted with an anti-fade aqueous mount (Biomeda Corp, Foster City, CA). The cells were visualized with an Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope and photographed with the digital SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). H. pylori Co-culture with Human Gastric Cell Lines—NCI-N87 cells were cultured to 60% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2, 95% air-humidified atmosphere. The cells were then starved for 48 h in F-12 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Unlike AGS cells, the NCI-N87 cell line expresses a variety of gastric peptides (26Basque J.R. Chenard M. Chailler P. Menard D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Endogenous regulation of villin protein was examined in NCI-N87 cells using 1:100 m.o.i. (ratio of 100 bacteria/eukaryotic cell) of either Campylobacter jejuni, SS1, or J99 H. pylori strains for 24 h. Due to the higher efficiency of transfection, all transfections, co-culture studies, and nuclear extract preparation were performed using AGS cells. Transient Transfections and Reporter Assays—AGS cells were cultured to 60% confluency in medium as described above. The cells were grown on 12-well plates and transfected using calcium phosphate coprecipitation without glycerol shock (5 Prime-3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) or FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium replaced with unsupplemented F-12 containing H. pylori J99 strain at 100 m.o.i. Dominant negative expression constructs were co-transfected and kinase inhibitors were added 1 h before stimulation of the transfected cells. Luciferase assays were performed 36 h after transfection using a Berthold AutoLumat luminometer (LB953; EG & G, Gaithersburg, MD) or Wallac Victor3 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase activity was normalized to the protein concentration determined by the Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). Immunoblots—Whole cell extracts were prepared, lysed in 10 mm HEPES, 0.4% Triton X-100, 30 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The extracts were heat-denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The lysate was electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk or with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for detection of phosphorylated proteins. The blot was exposed to primary antibody for 2 h. After washing in TTBS, horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (1:2000 dilution) was applied for 1 h. The protein-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal, Pierce Biochemicals). Erk-2 (C-14) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); phospho-Erk (p44/42 MAP Kinase) and phospho-38 antibody were from New England Biolabs (Bedford, MA). To detect phospho-Elk-1, nuclear protein extracts were prepared by a two-buffer detergent method (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 mm NaF to inhibit phosphatase activity. The extracts were heat-denatured in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were electroblotted onto a Hybond-C Extra nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was washed three times with NaF-supplemented TTBS (add 50 mm NaF), blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in NaF-supplemented TTBS, and then incubated with phospho-Elk-1 antibody (Santa Cruz) for 2 days at 4 °C. After three rinses with NaF-supplemented TTBS, the membrane was incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Protein-antibody complexes were detected with the LumiGlo reagent and peroxide chemiluminescent detection kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Gel Shift Assays—For nuclear extract preparation, the cells were co-cultured with the bacteria for either 3 or 24 h. They were then washed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline, harvested, and placed on ice. Uninfected cells were starved for 48 h but received no H. pylori. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared by a two-buffer detergent method (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). A double-stranded 28-bp oligonucleotide probe 5′-TCCCTTATATGGTGAAGGAAGTTCCTGG-3′ (sense strand) was hybridized and then end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using polynucleotide kinase. Gel shift reactions were carried out at 25 °C in a total volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 600 ng of poly(dI-dC), 6 μg of nuclear extract, and the corresponding antibody or unlabeled competing oligonucleotides (100× the molar concentration of the probe). After a 10-min preincubation, 30,000 cycles/min of labeled probe (10,000-15,000 cycles/min/0.1 ng) was added to each reaction followed by the loading buffer containing bromphenol blue. Supershifts were performed by adding 2 μg of anti-Elk-1, anti-SRF, anti-YY1, or anti-GATA-4 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 20 min before adding the probe. The reactions were run on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were dried and then used to expose x-ray film. Statistical Analysis—The results were statistically tested by unpaired t test or one-way analysis of variance as appropriate, using commercially available software (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A p < 0.05 was considered significant. Chronic Helicobacter infection in both human subjects and mice induces gastritis, atrophy, and metaplasia. In human stomach, intestinal metaplasia is correlated with the presence of Alcian blue-positive cells and an increase in intestine-specific markers, e.g. villin (29Hagen S.J. Yanaka A. Jansons R. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 275: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The metaplasia appears prior to the development of gastric cancer (3Correa P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6735-6740PubMed Google Scholar). However, the expression of villin as a marker for intestinal metaplasia developing in response to Helicobacter infection has not been studied. Therefore, we examined biopsies from human subjects infected with H. pylori. The gastric mucosa of infected patients showed Alcian blue-positive cells consistent with the presence of intestinal-type acidic mucins and goblet cells (Fig. 1A). Using immunohistochemical staining, we found that these areas of intestinal metaplasia expressed villin protein (Fig. 1B). To examine whether villin also correlated with intestinal metaplastic changes in a H. pylori-infected animal model, mice were infected for 14 months with the mouse-adapted SS1 H. pylori strain. Using immunofluorescence, we showed that the villin-positive cells were located in the corpus (Fig. 2). Small intestine from the same mouse was used as a positive control for the villin antibody (Fig. 2A). Because normal corpus does not express villin (14Braunstein E.M. Qiao X.T. Madison B. Pinson K. Dunbar L. Gumucio D.L. Dev. Dyn. 2002; 224: 90-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), this acid-secreting portion of the stomach was used as a negative control for the immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B). The parietal cells were detected using an antibody to the β subunit of the H+, K+-ATPase. When compared with the age-matched control, there was a decrease in the number of parietal cells in the 14-month-old H. pylori-infected animal coincident with an increase in villin-positive cells (Fig. 2C). We concluded that there was an increase in villin expression with intestinal metaplastic changes in both human and mouse H. pylori--infected stomachs.Fig. 2Expression of villin in mouse stomach after H. pylori infection. Paraffin-embedded sections from a 14-month-old H. pylori SS1-infected mouse. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG was used to detect villin antibody staining (green), and a Texas Red-conjugated IgG was used to detect antibody raised against the β subunit of H+, K+-ATPase (red). DAPI was used to stain nuclei (blue). A, enterocytes of the mouse small intestine used as a positive control stained positive for villin (block arrowhead). Magnification, 100×.

Magnification, 400×. Representative of three uninfected and three H. pylori-infected mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because villin expression directly correlated with the expression of intestinal metaplasia in both human and mouse during chronic atrophic gastritis, we examined whether endogenous villin was regulated by H. pylori in a human gastric cell line, NCI-N87. The NCI-N87 cell line expresses several gastric peptides, e.g. intrinsic factors, pepsinogens (26Basque J.R. Chenard M. Chailler P. Menard D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that these cells also express villin (Fig. 3). These cells were co-cultured with H. pylori strains SS1, J99, and an organism not known to induce gastritis, i.e. C. jejuni (Fig. 3). The results demonstrated that villin protein increased with the J99 H. pylori strain but not with C. jejuni or the mouse-adapted SS1 strain. Because the NCI-N87 cells transfect poorly, the AGS cell line was used in the subsequent transient transfection studies. Prior studies have demonstrated that there are critical tissue-specific regulatory elements in the villin promoter between -1236 and -554 and between -554 and -446 (21Madison B.B. Dunbar L. Qiao X.T. Braunstein K. Braunstein E. Gumucio D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33275-33283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). In addition, the first intron synergizes with the first 554 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence. We used the reporter construct containing 554 bp of the human villin promoter and the first intron to study regulation by H. pylori. We examined induction of the villin promoter for 24 h by three different bacterial species, H. pylori, Acinetobacter lwoffi, and C. jejuni (Fig. 4). The results showed greater induction with the H. pylori J99 strain compared with C. jejuni or A. lwoffi at 100 m.o.i. C. jejuni is a luminal pathogen that does not cause gastritis, whereas, A. lwoffi does induce gastritis (30Zavros Y. Rieder G. Ferguson A. Merchant J.L. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We found that co-culturing the transient transformants with H. pylori stimulated the villin reporter over 6-fold at a bacterial concentration of 200 m.o.i. (Fig. 5A). Maximal stimulation occurred within 24-30 h (data not shown). To assess whether activation of the villin promoter was Mek-1-Erk-dependent, Erk kinase-deficient mutants and the Mek-1 inhibitor PD98059 were used to block villin induction by H. pylori. Dominant negative Erk-1 and -2 constructs were co-transfected with the villin reporter prior to co-culturing with H. pylori (Fig. 5B). Consistent with dominant negative inhibition, PD98059 also blocked villin induction by H. pylori (Fig. 5C). The p38 inhibitor SB203580 did not block villin induction (Fig. 5D). This indicated that the effect of H. pylori on the villin promoter specifically used the Erk pathway (Fig. 5D). To further document the role of the Mek-1-Erk pathway, an immunoblot was performed with phosphorylated Erk antibody and confirmed that co-culturing with H. pylori resulted in an increase in activated Erk protein (Fig. 6). We also found that H. pylori also stimulated p38 phosphorylation as reported previously (31Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar). However, when coupled with the fact that SB203580 did not affect induction by H. pylori, we concluded that the p38 pathway was not upstream of villin activation. These results were consistent with prior studies implicating the Ras-Erk kinase pathway in H. pylori induction of the chemokine interleukin-8 (32Meyer-ter-Vehn T. Covacci A. Kist M. Pahl H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16064-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been confirmed that H. pylori activates both the Erk-1 and p38 Map kinase pathways but that only the Erk-1 pathway regulates the transcription factor Egr-1 and its downstream targets, e.g. ICAM-1 (33Abdel-Latif M.M. Windle H.J. Fitzgerald K.A. Ang Y.S. Eidhin D.N. Li-Weber M. Sabra K. Kelleher D. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3549-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Fig. 6H. pylori stimulates Erk and p38 kinases. AGS cells were co-cultured with H. pylori for up to 24 h without (-) or with (+) 50 μm of the Mek-1 inhibitor PD98059 or 25 μm of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 prior to the preparation of whole cell extracts for immunoblot analysis. Antibodies to either the phosphorylated (p-ERK) or unphosphorylated forms of the ERK (ERK-1/2) and p38 kinases were used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the villin promoter for likely targets of the Mek-1-Erk pathway and identified a cluster of Elk-1 sites adjacent to an SRE at -85 bp upstream from the cap site (Fig. 6A). Two adjacent elements consisting of the CArG box and an Ets binding site (EBS) form the SRE (34Buchwalter G. Gross C. Wasylyk B. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 324: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The constitutive SRF forms a homodimer and binds the CArG box, which in turn stabilizes the binding of inducible Ets proteins, e.g. Elk-1, SAP-1, Net, collectively known as ternary complex factors. One of the Ets proteins will bind the short Ets site and make contact with the constitutively bound SRF homodimer to form the ternary complex (35Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 36Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). To determine whether Elk-1 and SRF binding to the -85 villin SRE was required for H. pylori induction, we introduced point mutations into the element (Fig. 7A). Dominant negative Elk-1 was used to examine the contribution of Elk-1 to H. pylori induction of the promoter. The results showed that point mutations within the -85 SRE/EBS site diminished induction by H. pylori (Fig. 7B). Moreover, co-transfection with dnElk-1 reduced both basal and i"

Numerous pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria utilize a periplasm-to-cytosol ATP-binding cassette transport pathway to transport this essential atom in to the cell. In this study, we investigated the Yersinia enterocolitica (YfuA) and Serratia marcescens (SfuA) iron-binding periplasmic proteins. We have determined the 1.8-Å structures of iron-loaded (YfuA) and iron-free (SfuA) forms of this class of proteins. Although the sequence of these proteins varies considerably from the other members of the transferrin structural superfamily, they adopt the same three-dimensional fold. The iron-loaded YfuA structure illustrates the unique nature of this new class of proteins in that they are able to octahedrally coordinate the ferric ion in the absence of a bound anion. The iron-free SfuA structure contains a bound citrate anion in the iron-binding cleft that tethers the N- and C-terminal domains of the apo protein and stabilizes the partially open structure.

Metal ions are indispensable components of biological systems. Iron is required for the growth and survival of nearly all living organisms (1Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Although iron is the most abundant transition element and the fourth most plentiful element in the Earth's crust, this important atom remains a limiting factor for growth for the vast majority of organisms. Because of the extremely low solubility of Fe3+ (∼10-18m) at neutral pH in aerobic environments most organisms are faced with the problem of obtaining enough iron from their environment (2Braun V. Killmann H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 104-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although iron is not readily available to most organisms, in vivo iron is a key component of a number of essential metabolic enzymes, including ribonucleotide reductase and cytochromes. Its biological function is almost entirely dependent on its incorporation into protein molecules. Through the variation of the coordinating ligands surrounding iron, its redox potential can be altered between -300 and +700 mV, making it ideally suited to participate in a wide range of electron transfer reactions involved in intermediary metabolism (3Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodriguez-Quinones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar). Although the reactivity of iron makes it uniquely suited for numerous biological applications, it also contributes to a variety of undesirable effects. Free iron has the ability to generate toxic derivatives within the body (4Wessling-Resnick M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a product of Fenton chemistry, can damage lipids by inducing the formation of unsaturated bonds, decrease membrane fluidity, and cause cell lysis. Thus, it is vital that biological systems maintain control of the chemical environment of iron. Most organisms have developed specialized systems for retrieval, transport, and storage of this vital element to maintain it in a non-toxic state. In higher organisms such as vertebrates, there is little free iron present in the extracellular compartment because of the presence of the monomeric glycoproteins transferrin (in sera) and lactoferrin (on mucosal surfaces), which are high affinity bilobed iron-binding proteins. Lactoferrin and transferrin are each composed of a single polypeptide chain of ∼650 amino acid residues that are arranged in two homologous globular lobes, the N- and C-lobes, representing the N- and C-terminal halves of the molecules (5Baker E.N. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Peterson N.A. Shewry S.C. Tweedie J.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 443: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Each lobe is further subdivided into two domains with the specific iron binding sites in the intradomain cleft of each lobe. The iron atom is bound by identical iron-binding ligands in each lobe, two tyrosines, a histidine, and an aspartic acid residue (6Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rice D.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 711-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 7Bailey S. Evans R.W. Garrat R.C. Gorinsky B. Hasnain S. Horsburgh C. Jhoti H. Lindley P.F. Mydin A. Sarra R. Watson J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5804-5812Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The ability of transferrin and lactoferrin to bind iron also depends on the presence of a carbonate anion. The presence of these glycoproteins throughout the body of the host organism reduces the levels of free ferric iron below that required to support bacterial growth. In response to the problem of iron scarcity, extracellular Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria have developed a variety of different high affinity iron acquisition systems to survive. One strategy that is effective in a variety of environments involves the synthesis and secretion of small iron chelating molecules, termed siderophores (8Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Siderophores function by complexing and removing iron from the host proteins or by scavenging it from precipitates of ferric hydroxide, as they possess affinity constants in excess of host proteins. An alternate iron uptake system utilized by Gram-negative bacteria has also been discovered in a number of human and veterinary pathogens (9Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 10Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These bacteria possess outer membrane surface receptors that are used for acquiring iron directly from transferrin and/or lactoferrin. The bacteria use this alternative mechanism for iron acquisition as they are unable to produce siderophores. Even though the specific lactoferrin and transferrin outer membrane receptors are distinct complexes, the mechanism of iron removal is thought to occur through similar mechanisms (9Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Following transport across the outer membrane, the ensuing transport of iron into the cell is mediated by an ATP-binding cassette transport system consisting of a periplasmic-binding protein and an inner membrane transport complex (11Koster W. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This transport system belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters that includes a broad and diverse group of import and export systems found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (12Schmitt L. Tampe R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The periplasmic-binding protein is required to transport the complex across the periplasm and release it at the inner membrane permease complex. This inner membrane complex consists of at least two proteins, one to span the membrane and transport the substrate across the inner membrane and another that contains an ATP-binding cassette and that can hydrolyze ATP to provide the energy required for transport (13Higgins C.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The iron uptake pathways from host transferrin in pathogenic Neisseria species and Haemophilus influenzae have received considerable attention because of their predicted importance in vivo, which has been established experimentally for gonococcal infection in humans (14Cornelissen C.N. Kelley M. Hobbs M.M. Anderson J.E. Cannon J.G. Cohen M.S. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This pathway is dependant upon the periplasmic FbpA (ferric-binding protein A) (15Khun H.H. Kirby S.D. Lee B.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2330-2336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kirby S.D. Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). FbpA was shown to possess similar properties to the transferrins (17Nowalk A.J. Tencza S.B. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12769-12775Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Adhikari P. Kirby S.D. Nowalk A.J. Veraldi K.L. Schryvers A.B. Mietzner T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 42: 25142-25149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar) to the extent that they have been called bacterial transferrins (19Taboy C.H. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. Aisen P. Crumbliss A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2719-2724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Structural studies revealed a nearly identical set of amino acid residues involved in iron coordination (20Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) that led to the suggestion that the forces of convergent evolution had selected for an optimal coordination mode. However, sequence and spectral differences observed with a functional homologue from the bovine pathogen Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica (21Kirby S.D. Lainson F.A. Donachie W. Okabe A. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Schryvers A.B. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) suggested that the similarity with transferrin may not be a general property of this class of proteins. Indeed, structural studies with the M. haemolytica protein revealed a novel mode of iron coordination involving three tyrosyl residues and a carbonate anion (22Shouldice S.R. Skene R.J. Dougan D.R. Snell G. McRee D.E. Schryvers A.B. Tari L.W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3903-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). SfuA (Serratia ferric-iron uptake) of Serratia marcescens (23Zimmermann L. Angerer A. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 238-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and YfuA (Yersinia ferric-iron uptake) of Yersinia enterocolitica (24Saken E. Rakin A. Heesemann J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are also functional homologues of FbpA, because they are capable of binding and transporting the Fe3+ ion (25Gong S. Bearden S.W. Geoffroy V.A. Fetherston J.D. Perry R.D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2829-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Angerer A. Klupp B. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence alignments of YfuA and SfuA with the FbpAs from Haemophilus and Neisseria reveal a considerable level of sequence identity and conservation of key iron liganding amino acids. However, the spectral properties of the iron-loaded forms of these proteins differ from transferrins and from the Haemophilus and Neisseria FbpAs, suggesting that they may utilize a novel mode of iron coordination. In this study, we present the 1.8 Å resolution structure of iron-loaded YfuA and the 1.8 Å iron-free SfuA structure. A comparison between the iron-loaded and iron-free structures has allowed us to characterize the precise atomic details of iron binding, and the role of the ferric ion in mediating protein conformation. Our results reveal that YfuA and SfuA coordinate iron in a unique fashion. Surprisingly, YfuA and SfuA do not require a synergistic anion to bind a ferric ion. This new class of bacterial ferric ion-binding proteins is the only characterized member of the transferrin structural superfamily able to bind and transport iron in the absence of a synergistic anion. Cloning and Purification—The intact sfuA gene was amplified from a clinical isolate of S. marcescens obtained from the Foothills Hospital (Calgary, Alberta) with a forward primer introducing an NdeI site at the start codon preceded immediately by a BclI site and with a reverse primer introducing a HindIII site immediately after the stop codon. The resulting PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes BclI and HindIII and ligated into a derivative of the pT7-7 vector digested with BamHI and HindIII. The modified pT7-7 vector has a BamHI site introduced between the ribosomal binding site and start codon. A similar strategy was utilized to clone the yfuA gene from Y. enterocolitica strain 0.9 obtained from Dr. Jessica Boyd, Halifax, Nova Scotia, except that the forward primer included a BamHI site in lieu of a BclI site. The cloned genes were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with the published sequences for YfuA (GenBank™ 619573) and SfuA (GenBank™ 152860). The resulting plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS for expression of SfuA and YfuA. Both sfuA and yfuA were cloned with their native signal sequences so that when the plasmids were introduced into E. coli the functional proteins would be expressed under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction and then exported to the periplasm. The proteins were expressed, and the periplasmic fraction isolated using a previously described modified osmotic shock procedure (27Shouldice S.R. Dougan D.R. Skene R.J. Tari L.W. McRee D.E. Yu R.-H. Schryvers A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11513-11519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein preparations were dialyzed extensively against 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.0, at 4 °C and subjected to anion exchange chromatography as a final purification step. The resulting samples were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4 °C and concentrated using Millipore Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices with a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (final concentrations of 19.6 mg/ml for SfuA and 17.8 mg/ml for YfuA). The purity of the preparations was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Samples were either utilized in crystallization experiments immediately or stored at 4 °C until required. Absorption Spectra—UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Nano-Drop® ND-1000 spectrophotometer. A buffer solution consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, served as the reference for the full-range spectra from 220 to 750 nm. Each sample was done in triplicate. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Crystallization conditions for SfuA and YfuA were initially determined by high throughput screening. A single colorless crystal form was obtained for SfuA, and two colored (purple) crystal forms of YfuA were observed. Crystals used for diffraction analysis were grown at 4 °C for SfuA and at 20 °C for YfuA by the sitting drop vapor-diffusion technique, with 2-μl drops (1 μl of protein sample and 1 μl of reservoir solution) and an 85-μl reservoir. The reservoir for SfuA crystallization was 1.0 m lithium chloride, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4.0, and for YfuA (superior, diffraction quality crystals) was 0.2 m zinc acetate dihydrate, 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Large colorless crystals of SfuA belonging to the monoclinic space group P21 appeared after 1 week, and purple YfuA crystals belonging to the monoclinic space group C2 typically grew in 6 days. The crystals were harvested by scooping them from the drop with a nylon loop. The SfuA crystal was dipped into a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 1.0 m lithium chloride, and 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4.0, for ∼30 s before it was cooled in liquid nitrogen. The YfuA crystal was dipped into crystallization mother liquor supplemented with 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The crystals of both proteins were maintained at 100 K during data collection. All data were collected on a Rigaku HTC image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku FR-E rotating anode generator with a copper target. X-ray data were integrated and scaled using the d*TREK program suite (28Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar).

To solve the YfuA structure, single wavelength anomalous diffraction x-ray data were analyzed using the program SHELXD (29Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) to find the heavy atom substructure, locating the six sulfur atoms from methionine residues, the iron, and five bound zinc atoms. Single wavelength anomalous diffraction phases were calculated to 1.7 Å from these heavy atom positions by use of the SHELXE program (30Sheldrick G.M. Zeitschrift fur Kristallogrphie. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The phases were then improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching with the program DM (31Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The resulting experimental phases were of sufficient quality to allow automated building of almost the entire protein structure in electron density with the program ARP/wARP (32Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The resulting structure and electron density maps were interpreted using the program XtalView/Xfit (33McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Iterative cycles of interactive manual building and refitting of the model using the program XtalView/Xfit (33McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and refinement with Refmac5 (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) were carried out to complete and correct the model. Restrained refinement using a maximum likelihood target function and isotropic temperature factors for individual atoms was carried out followed by TLS refinement. During the later stages of refinement, difference maps (Fo - Fc maps) were used to place the bound iron, zinc, carbonate, ethylene glycol, and water molecules. The high-resolution apo SfuA crystal structure was determined by a molecular replacement procedure using the program Molrep from the CCP4 suite of programs (35Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Because the structure of YfuA was in a closed conformation compared with the SfuA protein, two independent search models comprising the N- and C-terminal domains of the protein had to be positioned independently to solve the structure. Iterative cycles of interactive manual refitting of the model using the program XtalView/Xfit (33McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) made use of maps created with ARP/wARP (32Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and refinement with Refmac5 (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) was carried out to complete and correct the model. Restrained refinement using a maximum likelihood target function and isotropic temperature factors for individual atoms was carried out. During the later stages of refinement, difference maps (Fo - Fc maps) were used to place the bound citrate and water molecules. The final crystallographic refinement statistics for each structure are reported in Table I. Structure Analysis—The refined coordinates of SfuA and YfuA in complex with citrate and iron, respectively, have each been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1XVY and 1XVX). Ramachandran plots of the two structures reveal the satisfactory location of all residues in allowed regions of conformational space. The DALI server was used to find structurally similar proteins in the Fold classification based on structure-structure alignment of the proteins data base (36Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Protein Production, Crystallization, and Structure Solution—The intact genes encoding SfuA and YfuA were amplified from clinical isolates and subcloned into a T7-based expression vector. The sequences of the cloned genes encoded proteins with several amino acid changes relative to YfuA and SfuA sequences in GenBank™ (Fig. 1). The presence of the native leader peptides resulted in efficient production and export of the proteins into the periplasm of E. coli providing yields of up to 100 mg protein/liter of culture. The recombinant SfuA and YfuA proteins were isolated from the periplasm of E. coli and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Following purification and buffer exchange, the protein samples were concentrated to greater than 15 mg/ml prior to crystallization. The protein samples had a distinctive purple color in contrast to iron-loaded transferrins and FbpAs from Neisseria and Haemophilus that are deep red at these concentrations. Spectral analysis of the protein preparations demonstrated that visible absorption maximum at 513 and 510 nm wavelengths for YfuA and SfuA, respectively, contrasting the maximum at 480 nm for the H. influenzae FbpA (HiFbpA). 1The abbreviations used are: HiFbpA, H. influenzae FbpA; MhFbpA, M. haemolytica FbpA. Following purification, an extensive high throughput screen was performed yielding a high quality crystal form of YfuA. The structure of the iron-loaded YfuA sample was solved initially by single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing methods. An additional set of crystallization screens was performed for the SfuA protein but only yielded uncolored crystals. The structure of YfuA successfully served as a search model in molecular replacement to obtain the SfuA structure. General Structural Features—Data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table I. For almost all of the protein side chains, the electron density is clear and unambiguous. In the SfuA structure the first two residues of the N terminus were not visible in the electron density map and were omitted. Similarly, the first residue of the YfuA model was not well defined by electron density and thus was omitted from the final structure. The stereochemical parameters (Table I) and the Ramachandran plots for each structure, which reveal that all of the residues are in allowed regions as defined by the program PROCHECK (35Collaborative Computational Project 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), illustrate that these crystal structures are of high quality. SfuA and YfuA share 86% sequence identity at the amino acid level (Fig. 1) and share identical polypeptide folds (Fig. 2). Crystal structures of all of the periplasmic ferric ion-binding proteins deposited to date in the PDB display an almost identical topology. With approximate dimensions of 60 × 30 × 40 Å, SfuA and YfuA have a similar overall structure to the wild type H. influenzae periplasmic FbpA. A search utilizing the DALI (36Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) server for proteins with three-dimensional folds similar to SfuA and YfuA in the PDB reveals that these proteins possess the highest structural similarity with HiFbpA (PDB code 1MRP, see Ref. 20Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). SfuA and YfuA only share ∼35% sequence identity with HiFbpA. However, the Cα backbones of the HiFbpA and YfuA structures overlay with a positional root mean square deviation of 1.84 Å over 95% of the residues. Similar to most other periplasmic-binding protein structures and other members of the transferrin structural superfamily, the SfuA and YfuA molecules are composed of two domains termed the N- and C-domains. The polypeptide chain of SfuA and YfuA crosses between the N- and C-domains twice. Between these two domains lies the iron-binding cleft. Each domain is composed of a twisted mixed β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. The two domains are connected by two anti-parallel β-strands that serve as a hinge between the two domains. YfuA Structure—YfuA is able to coordinate a single Fe3+ ion in an octahedral fashion, utilizing five amino acid residues and a water molecule (Fig. 3, A and B). The coordination scheme observed in this structure is novel because of the presence of an additional amino-acid-coordinating residue and the absence of a coordinating anion. The square-planar base of the octahedron is composed of a water molecule, Glu-62, Tyr-198, and Tyr-199. To complete the coordination sphere, His-14 and Asp-144 are located at the axial positions. The iron coordination is distorted from ideal octahedral geometry with ligation distances ranging from 2.04 to 2.21 Å (Table II). The YfuA crystal structure represents a novel class of ferric ion-binding periplasmic proteins that do not require a synergistic anion to complete the iron coordination. Overlays involving the iron binding residues of YfuA and HiFbpA (PDB code 1MRP) reveal that Asp-144 in YfuA is able to functionally replace the phosphate anion in iron coordination.Table IIGeometry of the iron binding site in YfuABond lengths (Å)Fe-OH (Tyr-198)2.04Fe-OH (Tyr-199)2.09Fe-Oδ-2 (Asp-144)2.12Fe-Oϵ-1 (Glu-62)2.16Fe-Nϵ-2 (His-14)2.21Fe-(HOH371)2.17Bond angle (°)OH (Tyr-198)-Fe-OH (Tyr-199)101.94OH (Tyr-198)-Fe-Oδ-2 (Asp-144)90.92OH (Tyr-198)-Fe-Oϵ-1 (Glu-62)87.47OH (Tyr-198)-Fe-Nϵ-2 (His-14)95.66OH (Tyr-198)-Fe-(HOH371)170.49OH (Tyr-199)-Fe-Oδ-2 (Asp-144)84.64OH (Tyr-199)-Fe-Oϵ-1 (Glu-62)170.58OH (Tyr-199)-Fe-Nϵ-2 (His-14)96.55OH (Tyr-199)-Fe-(HOH371)86.14Oδ-2 (Asp-144)-Fe-Oϵ-1 (Glu-62)95.72Oδ-2 (Asp-144)-Fe-Nϵ-2 (His-14)172.91Oδ-2 (Asp-144)-Fe-(HOH371)84.79Oϵ-1 (Glu-62)-Fe-Nϵ-2 (His-14)81.97Oϵ-1 (Glu-62)-Fe-(HOH371)84.52Nϵ-2 (His-14)-Fe-(HOH371)88.31 Open table in a new tab As a result of the high zinc concentrations in the crystallization solution used for YfuA, there are five zinc atoms bound to the final structure. Although these ions apparently have no role in the function of the protein, they appear to stabilize some of the mobile portions of the molecule for crystallization. Zincs 314, 317, and 318 utilize amino acid residues from two symmetry-related molecules, which likely aided in the crystallization process. It was previously shown that heavy metals were important for the successful crystallization of the substrate-binding protein HisJ (37Oh B.H. Kang C.H. De Bondt H. Kim S.H. Nikaido K. Joshi A.K.

In addition to three water molecules and an aspartic acid residue, zinc 315 is also coordinated by a bicarbonate anion in the current YfuA structure. The coordination states range from 4 to 6 coordinating ligands surrounding each zinc ion. Similar ligation distances and coordination geometries for zinc ions in proteins have been reported in other protein st"

In rodents, the SHBG gene is also expressed in Sertoli cells giving rise to the testicular androgen-binding protein, which is secreted into the seminiferous tubule where it presumably controls testosterone action. Evidence that the SHBG gene functions in this way in the human testis is lacking, and mice containing a human SHBG transgene (shbg4) under the control of its own promoter sequence are characterized by SHBG gene expression in the liver but not in the testis. A potential cis-element, defined as footprint 4 (FP4) within the human SHBG promoter, is absent in SHBG promoters of mammals that produce the testicular androgen-binding protein, and we have produced mice harboring a shbg4 transgene in which FP4 was deleted to evaluate its functional significance. Remarkably, these mice express the modified human SHBG transgene in the testis as well as the liver. Human SHBG transcripts were found within their Sertoli cells, primary cultures of which secrete human SHBG, and this was increased by treatment with follicle-stimulating hormone, retinoic acid, and estradiol but not testosterone. We have also found that the upstream stimulatory factors (USF-1 and USF-2) bind FP4 in vitro by electromobility shift assay of Sertoli cell nuclear extracts and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and conclude that USF transcription factors repress human SHBG transcription in Sertoli cells through an interaction with FP4 within its proximal promoter.

Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 298-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A protein with similar physiochemical and steroid-binding characteristics as plasma SHBG was originally identified in the testis and epididymis of rats and rabbits (2Westphal U. Steroid-Protein Interactions II: Monographs on Endocrinology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 276-301Google Scholar, 3French F.S. Ritzen E.M. Endocrinology. 1973; 93: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 4Danzo B.J. Eller B.C. Orgebin-Crist M-C. Steroids. 2004; 24: 107-122Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This protein, which is generally referred to as the testicular androgen-binding protein, has since been shown to be the product of the same transcription unit that encodes plasma SHBG (5Joseph D.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 197-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A substantial body of work has established that androgen-binding protein production by Sertoli cells in several animal models is regulated by FSH and retinoids but not testosterone (2Westphal U. Steroid-Protein Interactions II: Monographs on Endocrinology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 276-301Google Scholar, 6Skinner M.K. Schlitz S.M. Anthony C.T. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 3015-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because this protein is secreted preferentially into the seminiferous tubules (7Gunsalus G.L. Musto N.A. Bardin C.W. Science. 1978; 200: 65-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and migrates to the caput epididymis where it is internalized by epithelial cells (8Pelliniemi L.J. Dym M. Gunsalus G.L. Musto N.A. Bardin C.W. Fawcett D.W. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is thought to regulate androgen access to target cells within the male reproductive tract and thereby influence androgen-dependent mechanisms of sperm maturation (5Joseph D.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 49: 197-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar).The identification of a protein in human testis extracts with essentially the same biochemical properties as plasma SHBG (9Hsu A-F. Troen P. J. Clin. Investig. 1978; 61: 1611-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Cheng C.Y. Musto N.A. Gunsalus G.L. Frick J. Bardin C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5631-5640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led to the widely held assumption that SHBG expression and function in the human testis mirrors that in other mammals. However, human testis extracts are invariably contaminated by plasma SHBG, and it has been virtually impossible to determine whether the SHBG in these extracts is really testicular in origin. In fact, although SHBG transcripts can be readily detected in human testis (11Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), conclusive evidence that human Sertoli cells actually produce SHBG is lacking. Moreover, SHBG transcripts in the human testis are distinct from those in rat testis in that the majority of human transcripts comprise an alternative exon 1 sequence (11Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Rykse H.M. Smith C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1869-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 12Gershagen S. Lundwall A. Fernlund P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9245-9258Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These alternative human SHBG transcripts are products of a distinct transcription unit, which appears to be under the control of a promoter whose activity is confined in the testis to germ cells (13Selva D.M. Hogeveen K.N. Seguchi K. Tekpetey F. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45291-45298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and they appear to encode an isoform of SHBG that accumulates in the acrosome of sperm (13Selva D.M. Hogeveen K.N. Seguchi K. Tekpetey F. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45291-45298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).In transgenic mice, a 5.5-kb rat SHBG transgene is expressed appropriately in Sertoli cells during puberty and in sexually mature animals (15Reventos J. Sullivan P.M. Joseph D.R. Gordon J.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 96: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By contrast, the corresponding human SHBG transgene is expressed in mouse hepatocytes throughout development (16Jänne M. Hogeveen K.N. Deol H.K. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but is not expressed at all in the testis (13Selva D.M. Hogeveen K.N. Seguchi K. Tekpetey F. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45291-45298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that the human SHBG promoter must differ in some way from the corresponding promoters in other mammals that produce an SHBG homologue (i.e. androgen-binding protein) in Sertoli cells, and a phylogenetic comparison showed that the human SHBG promoter contains a potential cis-element (footprint 4) identified previously by DNase 1 footprinting (17Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is not present in the SHBG promoters of subprimate species. Removal of this footprint 4 (FP4) from a human SHBG transgene permits its expression in Sertoli cells in vivo, and the modified transgene responds to hormone treatment in a manner consistent with that of the rat SHBG in Sertoli cells. Because we have also found that the upstream stimulatory factors (USF-1 and USF-2) bind to FP4 in the human SHBG promoter we conclude that this likely represses its activity in Sertoli cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Transgenic mice (line shbg 4-a) containing a 4.3-kb region of the human SHBG gene have been characterized previously (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Jänne M. Hogeveen K.N. Deol H.K. Hammond G.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4166-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The FP4 sequence within the SHBG promoter was removed from the 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene construct using the following mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-CTTGACCCCTGCCCAGGGGCTCACCCCTCTGGGGATCAAT) in the Altered Sites® mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) and was introduced into the mouse genome by pronuclear injection. Injected embryos were implanted into pseudo-pregnant recipient mice using a standard protocol (18Hogan B. Beddington R. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Two independent lines were established from founders, and progeny were screened by PCR amplification of human SHBG transgene sequences using primers spanning exon 7 (forward, 5′-GGAAGAATTCGGCCACAGGCAGTAGGC; reverse, 5′-GGTTGAATTCCGCCTCCCTTGAGCTG).Animals were housed under standard conditions and provided with food and water ad libitum.At ∼10 weeks of age, mice were sacrificed for the isolation of Sertoli cells and/or germ cells for RNA analysis and primary cell cultures (see below). All procedures were approved by the Animal Use Subcommittees of the University Council on Animal Care (University of Western Ontario and University of British Columbia).Testicular Cell Isolation and Primary Sertoli Cell Culture—Sertoli cells and germ cells were isolated from the testes of wild-type and transgenic mice using an established method (19Weiss M. Vigier M. Hue D. Perrard-Sapori M.H. Marret C. Avallet O. Durand P. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Selva D.M. Tirado O.M. Toran N. Suarez-Quian C.A. Reventos J. Munell F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and frozen for RNA analysis (see below). For primary Sertoli cell cultures, a mixed population of Sertoli and germ cells was cultured at 33 °C for 10 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and germ cells were removed by washing and aspiration of the adhered Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells isolated in this way were cultured for up to 8 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum. For experiments involving treatments with hormones, cells were treated every 2 days with different concentrations of FSH, retinoic acid, estradiol, and testosterone, and culture medium samples were collected for human SHBG measurements by time-resolved immunoassays (see below).RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver, testes, and isolated testicular cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted using the PolyATtract mRNA isolation system III (Promega). The RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in the presence of formaldehyde and transferred to a Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled human SHBG cDNA (21Hammond G.L. Underhill D.A. Smith C.L. Goping I.S. Harley M.J. Musto N.A. Cheng C.Y. Bardin C.W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 215: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Murine 18 S ribosomal RNA and cyclophilin A cDNAs were also used as an additional control for RNA loading and transfer.To confirm the presence or absence of human SHBG transcripts in separated testicular cell types we also performed a standard reverse transcription-PCR based assay (13Selva D.M. Hogeveen K.N. Seguchi K. Tekpetey F. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45291-45298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using total RNA extracts with human SHBG-specific primer pairs (forward, 5′-GTTGCTACTACTGCGTCACAC; reverse, 5′-AAGAGGTGGAAGAGTCTTCTC) as well as mouse cyclophilin A-specific primer pairs (forward, 5′-CAGATGGGGTAGGGACG; reverse, 5′-ATGGTCAACCCCACCACCGTG) as an internal control. The PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s.Time Resolved Immunofluorometric Assay—Culture medium samples (100 μl) from primary Sertoli cultures were added to the wells of a Nunc MaxiSorp™ (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) plate previously coated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-serum against human SHBG and blocked with a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% casein. After three washes with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20, the wells were incubated with 100 μlof europium-labeled monoclonal antibody against human SHBG (22Niemi S. Mäentausta O. Bolton N.J. Hammond G.L. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) diluted 1/500 in assay buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the wells were incubated with shaking in 100 μl of enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. Time-resolved fluorescence was then measured in a Victor-3 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultures of TM4 (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) and MSC-1 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Griswold) mouse Sertoli cell lines as described (23Tümer N. Scarpace P.J. Baker H.V. Larochelle J.S. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The Sertoli cell nuclear extracts (10 μg) were used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), as described previously (17Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Sierra F. Azzi A. Polak J.M. Saluz H.P. BioMethods: A Laboratory Guide to in Vitro Transcription. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1990: 23-104Google Scholar). Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides used in the EMSAs included overhanging extensions (lowercase letters) to facilitate labeling with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP (24Sierra F. Azzi A. Polak J.M. Saluz H.P. BioMethods: A Laboratory Guide to in Vitro Transcription. Birkhäuser Verlag, Berlin1990: 23-104Google Scholar). The same oligonucleotide pairs were also used as unlabeled competitors in the EMSA reactions. They included a sequence spanning FP4 (5′-tcgacTGATAGCTGAGTCTTGTGACTGGGCCCCTc, 5′-gACTATCGACTCAGAACACT GACCCGGGGAgagct), a similar FP4 sequence in which the core element within the putative USF binding site was mutated (5′-tcgacTGATAGCTGAGTCCCGCGACTGGGCCCCTc, 5′-gACTATCGACTCAGGGCGCTGACCCGGGGAgagct), and a DNA sequence (5′-tcgacGATCTGTAGGCCACGTGACCGGc, 5′-gCTAGACATCCGGTGCACTGGCCgagct) from the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP) containing a known USF binding site (25Potter J.J. Cheneval D. Dang C.V. Resar L.M. Mezey E. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15457-15463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The corresponding end-labeled oligonucleotide probes were added to the nuclear extracts, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. For antibody supershift EMSA experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min before and 15 min after the addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide. Aliquots (1 μg) of antiserum against USF-1 (C-20, catalog number sc-229, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), USF-2 (C-20, catalog number sc-862, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal rabbit serum were then added, and the complexes were further incubated at room temperature for 15 min. In EMSA and supershift EMSA experiments, protein-DNA complexes were separated from free probe by 6% PAGE, and the gel was dried and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) against an intensifying screen at –80 °C.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using a ChIP-IT™ kit (Active Motif, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents, buffers, and supplies were included in the kit. Briefly, Sertoli cells and germ cells from transgenic mice were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing and treatment with glycine Stop-Fix solution, the cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cells were homogenized and nuclei were re-suspended in shearing buffer and subjected to optimized ultrasonic disruption conditions to yield 100–400-bp DNA fragments. The chromatin was precleared with protein G beads and incubated (overnight at 4 °C) with 1 μg of each of the following specific antibodies: negative control mouse IgG and positive control anti-TFIIB (provided in the ChIP-IT™ kit), anti-USF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) anti-USF-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-COUP-TF II (T-19, catalog number sc-6578, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-HNF4γ (C-18, catalog number sc-6558, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein G beads were then added to the antibody/chromatin incubation mixtures and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After extensive washings, the immunoprecipitated DNA was removed from the beads in an elution buffer. To reverse cross-links and remove RNA, 5 m NaCl and RNase were added to the samples and incubated for 4 h at 65 °C. The samples then were treated with proteinase K for 2 h at 42 °C, and the DNA was purified using gel exclusion columns. The purified DNA was subjected to PCR amplification (1 cycle of 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) of the SHBG promoter using specific forward (5′-GATCCCCAGAGGGGTGATAGC) and reverse (5′-GGGTAAAGGAAACAGGGGCAC) primers designed to amplify a region (–130 to –48 nucleotides in relation to the transcription start site) spanning FP3 and FP4 in the human SHBG promoter (17Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As a control, PCR amplification (1 cycle of 95 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s) of the murine GAPDH promoter was performed using speciesspecific forward (5′-AGTGCCAGCCTCGTCCCGTAGACAAAATG) and reverse (5′-AAGTGGGCCCCGGCCTTCTCCAT) primers (26Annicotte J-C.

The PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 6% acrylamide gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining.RESULTSPhylogenetic Comparison of SHBG Promoter Sequences— Alignment of human (NCBI accession code M31651), sheep (NCBI accession code AY838765), rabbit (NCBI accession code AF144711), rat (NCBI accession code M19993), mouse (NCBI accession code AL731687), and chimpanzee (NCBI accession code AADA01179238) SHBG promoter sequences available in the public data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), showed that a footprinted region (FP4) in the human SHBG proximal promoter (17Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) is present in the chimpanzee SHBG promoter but is absent in the SHBG promoters of all the other species. An alignment of the human, chimpanzee, rabbit, sheep, and rat SHBG promoters illustrates this difference (Fig. 1). Analysis of this region using a public data base (wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru) indicated that it contains a potential USF binding site (underlined in Fig. 1). The FP3 region in the human SHBG promoter (Fig. 1) is known to interact with COUP-TF and HNF4 (17Jänne M. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the binding sites for these related transcription factors comprise a consensus GGTCA repeat separated by a variable number of nucleotides (27Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, although there are two nucleotides between the GGTCA repeat within the human SHBG FP3 sequence, these repeats in the rat and rabbit SHBG promoters have one and three nucleotides between them, respectively (Fig. 1).Deletion of FP4 Permits Expression of Human SHBG in Sertoli Cells—As reported previously (14Jänne M. Deol H.K. Power S.G.A. Yee S-P. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), human SHBG transcripts are not present in testis RNA extracts from mice harboring the 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene. However, they are detectable in the testis extracts of mice containing the same region of the human SHBG in which FP4 has been deleted (Fig. 2A). By contrast, deletion of the FP4 sequence within this transgene has essentially no effect on its expression in the liver as measured by Northern blotting of SHBG mRNA (Fig. 2A) or serum SHBG levels (data not shown). The same observations were made using samples from two independent lines of mice containing the modified human SHBG transgene lacking FP4 (data not shown).Fig. 2Removal of the FP4 region from the human SHBG proximal promoter results in expression of a 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene in the testis as well as the liver of transgenic mice. A, human SHBG transcripts were detected by Northern blotting in total RNA extracted from the liver of 4.3-kb human SHBG transgenic mice that contained (FP4+) or lacked (FP4–) the FP4 region within the human SHBG proximal promoter. By contrast, human SHBG transcripts were only detected in poly(A)+ RNA extracts from the testes of mice containing the 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene lacking FP4. No signals were detectable in the liver or testes RNA extracts from wild-type mice (WT). Mouse cDNAs for 18 S RNA and cyclophilin A (CypA) were used as loading and transfer controls of RNA samples from liver and testis, respectively. B, human SHBG transcripts were only detectable by Northern blotting in poly(A)+ RNA extracts of a mixed population of Sertoli and germ cells from mice containing a 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene lacking FP4. By contrast, human SHBG transcripts were undetectable in poly(A)+ RNA extracts of a pure population of testicular germs irrespective of the presence or absence of FP4 within the human SHBG proximal promoter. A mouse CypA cDNA was used to control for RNA loading and transfer to the Northern blots. C, in a reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA extracts from separated testicular cell types, a product was only obtained using human SHBG-specific primers in the extracts of the mixed population of Sertoli and germ cells from mice expressing the modified (FP4–) human SHBG transgene. By contrast, reverse transcription-PCR products were obtained in all extracts for mouse CypA, which was used as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine which cell types in the testis express the modified human SHBG transgene, RNA samples from testicular germ cells and a mixed population of Sertoli cells and germ cells were examined by Northern blotting (Fig. 2B) and reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Fig. 2C). These experiments showed that human SHBG transcripts were present in mixed populations of Sertoli cells and germ cells from mice containing the FP4 deleted human SHBG transgene but were undetectable in pure populations of germ cells from these mice. The presence of human SHBG transcripts in Sertoli cells of transgenic mice that contain the FP4 deleted transgene suggested that they might produce and secrete SHBG. To confirm this, primary cultures of Sertoli cells from the different transgenic mouse lines were established, and culture medium was harvested for SHBG analysis using a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay. This demonstrated that Sertoli cells from mice expressing the FP4 deleted human SHBG transgene secrete SHBG and that it accumulates in the culture medium over a 7-day incubation, whereas immunoreactive human SHBG was undetectable in culture media of Sertoli cells derived from wild-type mice or mice containing the unmodified 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Human SHBG is secreted only by Sertoli cells of mice expressing a 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene that lacks FP4 within the proximal promoter. Primary cultures of highly enriched populations of Sertoli cells (106 cells per well in 24-well plates) from wild-type (WT) mice or mice containing a 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene that either includes (FP4+) or lacks (FP4–) the FP4 region within the proximal promoter were maintained in culture over a period of 7 days. The concentrations of human SHBG in the culture medium were monitored using a time resolved immunofluorimetric assay at the times indicated. Mean + S.D. values are shown for samples from triplicate cultures. Human SHBG was not detectable (ND) in culture medium from WT or mice containing the unmodified 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene (FP4+).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given the substantial amount of information about the hormonal regulation of rat androgen-binding protein production by Sertoli cells, we examined the effect of various hormone treatments on SHBG secretion by primary Sertoli cells from mice expressing the FP4 deleted human SHBG transgene (Fig. 4). In these experiments, both FSH and retinoic acid increased human SHBG secretion by these cells over an 8-day period (Fig. 4, A and B). Estradiol also increased SHBG secretion but only when added at a concentration 100 nm, whereas testosterone at this and lower concentrations had no effect (Fig. 4, C and D).Fig. 4Effects of FSH (A), retinoic acid (B), estradiol (C), and testosterone (D) on the production of human SHBG by Sertoli cells from mice containing a 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene that lacks FP4 within the proximal promoter. Primary cultures of highly enriched populations of Sertoli cells (106 cells per well in 24-well plates) from mice containing a 4.3-kb human SHBG transgene that lacks the FP4 region within the proximal promoter were maintained in culture over a period of 8 days.

The electrophoretic mobilities of the two band shifts obtained using the labeled FP4 oligonucleotide are similar to those obtained using a MLP oligonucleotide, which contains a well characterized USF binding site (25Potter J.J.

https://openalex.org/W1985361810,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) interacts with retinoid X receptor (RXR) on PPAR response elements (PPREs) to regulate transcription of PPAR-responsive genes. To investigate the binding of PPARγ and RXR to PPREs, three mutations were constructed in the DNA-binding domains of PPARγ; two of the mutants maintained the structure of zinc finger I (PPARγ-GS and PPARγ-AA), and a third mutation disrupted the protein structure of zinc finger I (PPARγ-CS). Results indicated that the mutations of PPARγ that maintained intact zinc fingers were capable of binding to a variety of PPREs in the presence of RXR and could activate transcription on several PPREs. In parallel, a mutation was created in the DNA-binding domain of RXRα that maintained the structure of the zinc fingers (RXR-GS) but did not bind DNA and was transcriptionally inactive. Examination of the 3′ half-site of several PPREs revealed that variations from the consensus sequence reduced or abolished transcriptional activity, but conversion to consensus improved transcriptional activity with PPARγ-GS and PPARγ-AA. Examination of the 5′ half-site indicated that the upstream three nucleotides were more important for transcriptional activity than the downstream three nucleotides. Our data demonstrated that stringent binding of RXR to the 3′ half-site of a PPRE is more influential on the binding of the PPARγ/RXR heterodimer than the ability of PPARγ to bind DNA. Thus, unlike RXR, PPARγ exhibits promiscuity in binding on a PPRE, suggesting that the definition of a PPRE for PPARγ may need to be expanded.

Although transcriptional regulation by the glucocorticoid receptor is essential for survival, mice homozygous for a DNA-binding mutation in the glucocorticoid receptor can survive.

In an attempt to elucidate the role of DNA binding in PPARγ gene regulation, three different mutations in the DNA-binding domain of PPARγ were constructed. Work with other nuclear hormone receptors has shown that amino acids in the knuckle region of zinc finger I, referred to as the P-box, are responsible for making direct contacts within the major groove of DNA (38Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 39Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 40Mader S.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, DNA-binding mutants of PPARγ were made by mutating various amino acids in the P-box region of zinc finger I. Here we report that DNA-binding mutants of PPARγ are capable of heterodimerizing with RXR, binding DNA, and activating transcription. A mutation in a homologous region of RXRα, however, completely abolishes PPARγ/RXR heterodimer binding to DNA and transcriptional activation. In addition, there appears to be a much higher stringency for RXR binding to the 3′ half-site of a PPRE, with the requirements for PPARγ binding to the 5′ half-site being somewhat more relaxed. Finally, the ability of PPARγ to bind DNA does not require a full six-base consensus half-site, suggesting that the consensus for a PPARγ response element may need to be expanded. Plasmid Constructions—Full-length murine PPARγ was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pKCR2 (pSG5) expression vector as an MfeI fragment. The PPARγ DNA-binding domain (DBD) forms two zinc finger-like motifs (see Fig. 1a), with amino acids in the P-box region of zinc finger I (EGCKG) being responsible for sequence-specific recognition on DNA (38Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 40Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P.

To disrupt DNA binding, point mutations in PPARγ-pKCR2 were introduced into the P-box region using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (see Fig. 1b). The PPARγ-GS mutant was created by converting amino acids 157 and 158 from glutamate and glycine to glycine and serine, respectively (33Shibusawa N. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol.

The PPARγ-CS mutant was created by converting amino acid 159 from cysteine to serine (45Chatterjee V.K. Lee J.K. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For mammalian two-hybrid assays, PCR was performed on PPARγ-pKCR2 to obtain full-length PPARγ as a SalI/XbaI fragment. The SalI/XbaI PPARγ fragment was then inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pVP16 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Mutations were subsequently made in the PPARγ-pVP16 construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to produce PPARγ-GS-, PPARγ-AA-, and PPARγ-CS-pVP16. The ligand-binding domain of RXRα was placed downstream of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 in the vector pECE, as described previously (46Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1567-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A UAS-TK-luciferase reporter was made by placing five copies of a Gal4-binding site upstream of luciferase driven by a thymidine kinase promoter. Full-length human RXRα was inserted into the pKCR2 (pSG5) expression vector as an EcoRI fragment. Point mutations in the P-box region of RXR-pCKR2 were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The RXR-GS mutant was created by converting amino acids 153 and 154 from glutamate and glycine to glycine and serine, respectively. PPAR-responsive luciferase reporter constructs were created by inserting two copies of the respective PPREs into the Asp-718 and BglII sites of the pGL2-Promoter vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). PPRE-luciferase reporters constructed included: ACO-PPRE (AGGACAAAGGTCA), aP2-PPRE (GGATCAGAGTTCA), PEPCK-PPRE (CGGCCAAAGGTCA), ME-PPRE (GGGTCAAAGTTGA), 3′ Consensus ME-PPRE (GGGTCAAAGGTCA), 3′ mutant ACO-PPRE (AGGACAATTTTCA), 5′ (1) mutant ACO-PPRE (TTTACAAAGGTCA), 5′ (2) mutant ACO-PPRE (AGGTTTAAGGTCA), 5′ (1) PEPACO-PPRE (CGGACAAAGGTCA), and 5′ (2) PEPACO-PPRE (AGGCCAAAGGTCA). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Proteins for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were obtained by in vitro transcription and translation using the T7 TnT®-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Translation using [35S]methionine (Invitrogen) was followed by SDS-PAGE analysis and visualization after autoradiography to assess the size of translated proteins and to verify that they are expressed as full-length proteins (see Fig. 1c). The upper strand oligonucleotides used for EMSAs are as follows: aP2-PPRE (5′-CATACTGGATCAGAGTTCATGTGTC-3′), ACO-PPRE (5′-AGTGGACCAGGACAAAGGTCACGTTCGGGA-3′), ME-PPRE (5′-CATTCTGGGTCAAAGTTGATCCCCT-3′), PEPCK-PPRE (5′-CACCCACGGCCAAAGGTCATGTGTC-3′), 3′ Consensus ME-PPRE (5′-CATTCTGGGTCAAAGGTCATCCCTT-3′), Inverted PEPCK-PPRE (5′-CACCCAAGGTCAACGGCCATGTGTC-3′), 5′ (1) mt PEPCK-PPRE (5′-CACCCATTTCCCAAAGGTCATGTGTC-3′), 5′ (2) mt PEPCK-PPRE (5′-CACCCACGGTTTAAGGTCATGTGTC-3′), and 3′ mt PEPCK-PPRE (5′-CACCCACGGCCAATTTTCATGTGTC-3′). In vitro translated proteins were preincubated with 3 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled probe for 20 min at room temperature in 10 μl of binding buffer containing 20% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50–140 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1 μg of salmon sperm. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× TBE (0.045 m Tris-borate, 0.001 m EDTA) running buffer, and visualized after autoradiography. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—Human embryonic kidney (293T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotic/antimycotic. Transient transfection studies were carried out in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine Plus™ (Invitrogen). 15–18 h after transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either vehicle (Me2SO) or 1 μm troglitazone. After 24 h of treatment with either vehicle or troglitazone, cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using a Lumat LB 9507 Luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). DNA-binding Mutants of PPARγ Are Capable of Binding Native PPREs—Previous work with other nuclear hormone receptors indicates that mutations in the first two amino acids of the P-box region of the DBD will eliminate binding to direct repeat elements on DNA (33Shibusawa N.

To confirm this observation with PPARγ, in vitro binding capabilities of the various PPARγ mutants were assessed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). As seen in Fig. 1C, mutations in the DBD of PPARγ did not affect its ability to be expressed and translated into a full-length protein. The three visible bands represent translation of both the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms, as well as the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states of both of these proteins. The ability of PPARγ, PPARγ-GS, PPARγ-AA, and PPARγ-CS to bind was examined on various DR1 elements, including the acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), adipocyte-specific fatty acid transport protein (aP2), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and malic enzyme (ME) native PPARγ response elements (PPREs) (see Fig. 1D). PPARγ, PPARγ-GS, PPARγ-AA, PPARγ-CS, and RXRα proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated and subsequently incubated with a 32P-labeled DR1 double-stranded oligonucleotide for EMSA. Results indicated that PPARγ, PPARγ-GS, and PPARγ-AA are capable of binding PPREs in the presence of RXR. Significant binding was seen on a consensus PPRE (data not shown), as well as native PPREs for ACO, aP2, PEPCK, and ME. PPARγ-CS was incapable of binding any PPREs in vitro (Fig. 2). The lack of binding seen with PPARγ-CS is likely due to the absence of an intact zinc finger I structure, which is caused by the inability of the protein to coordinate a zinc molecule as a direct result of the mutation in cysteine 159. Although there is visible binding of PPARγ, PPARγ-GS, and PPARγ-AA on PPREs in the presence of RXR, there does appear to be a difference in binding affinities between the proteins on the various response elements. On the ACO-PPRE, PPARγ-GS binding is greater than that of either PPARγ or PPARγ-AA. Binding affinities of PPARγ, PPARγ-GS, and PPARγ-AA appear similar on the aP2-PPRE. For both the PEPCK- and ME-PPREs, binding of PPARγ-GS is significantly less than that of both PPARγ and PPARγ-AA. The variations seen in binding affinities of the PPARγ mutants prompted a thorough examination of their transcriptional capabilities on PPREs. DNA-binding Mutants of PPARγ Are Functional in Transfection Assays—Although the mutations in PPARγ-GS, PPARγ-AA, and PPARγ-CS were limited to the DBD, it is possible that the presence of these mutations may have affected the overall structure of the protein. If an alteration in the tertiary structure of the protein did occur as a result of the mutation in the DBD and subsequently affected its ability to heterodimerize with RXR, transcriptional activity could be altered as a result of a difference in heterodimerization capability rather than the inability of PPARγ to bind DNA. To ensure that PPARγ, PPARγ-GS, PPARγ-AA, and PPARγ-CS can heterodimerize with RXR in a similar manner, a mammalian two-hybrid assay was done with RXR and the PPARγ DNA-binding mutants. For this, full-length PPARγ was inserted into the pVP16 vector, and mutations were made to produce PPARγ-GS-, PPARγ-AA-, and PPARγ-CS-pVP16. RXR was placed downstream of the DBD of Gal4 in the vector pECE, as described previously (46Cohen R.N. Wondisford F.E. Hollenberg A.N. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1567-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays using a UAS-TK-luciferase reporter were done in human embryonic kidney (293T) cells followed by treatment with 1 μm troglitazone for 24 h. Measurement of luciferase activity following troglitazone treatment clearly showed that there is no difference in the ability of PPARγ, PPARγ-GS, PPARγ-AA, and PPARγ-CS to heterodimerize with RXR (Fig. 3A). To assess whether PPARγ DNA-binding mutants can activate transcription, two copies of the ACO, aP2, ME, and PEPCK PPREs were each cloned into the pGL2-vector, and luciferase assays were subsequently done using all of the PPARγ constructs. Transient transfection assays were carried out in human embryonic kidney (293T) cells, followed by treatment with either vehicle or 1 μm troglitazone for 24 h. On the ACO-PPRE, transfection of PPARγ increased luciferase levels ∼10-fold over baseline, and there was no dependence on exogenous RXRα for this effect to occur (Fig. 3B), perhaps due to endogenous RXR in these cells. PPARγ-AA exhibited a transcriptional function similar to that of wild-type PPARγ. PPARγ-GS, however, was dependent on the transfection of exogenous RXRα for transcriptional activity, and then showed an activity that was 15-fold over baseline and 1.5-fold greater than wild-type PPARγ. PPARγ-CS had no transcriptional activity over empty vector alone, confirming its inability to bind DNA as seen in EMSA (Fig. 2) and indicating that transcriptional function of PPARγ requires DNA binding on the ACO-PPRE. The overall pattern of transcriptional function on the aP2-PPRE was similar to that of the ACO-PPRE, with PPARγ-GS being dependent on the transfection of exogenous RXRα, and PPARγ-CS being transcriptionally inactive. With the PEPCK-PPRE and the ME-PPRE, there was a different pattern to the transcriptional function of PPARγ and its mutants. Although wild-type PPARγ exhibited a transcriptional activity on the PEPCK-PPRE that was 9-fold higher than baseline with no dependence on exogenous RXRα, PPARγ-GS and PPARγ-AA had much lower transcriptional activity on the PEPCK-PPRE (5-fold and 4-fold, respectively), with PPARγ-GS still having some dependence on exogenous RXRα. For the ME-PPRE, only the wild-typ"
https://openalex.org/W2009337206,"The potato cDNAs Solanum tuberosum isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (St-IVD1 and St-IVD2) encode proteins that are 84% identical to each other and 65 and 64% identical to human IVD, respectively. St-IVD2 protein was previously partially purified from potato tubers and confirmed to be an IVD. The function of St-IVD1 is unknown. In these experiments, both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as intact homotetramers. The substrate preference profile of the St-IVD2 protein was similar to that of human IVD. However, recombinant St-IVD1 had maximal activity with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, which in humans is dehydrogenated by short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD). Whereas molecular modeling predicts that the 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (2MBCD) and IVD substrate binding pockets are nearly identical, 2MBCD has amino acid substitutions at five residues that are invariant among all of the known and putative IVDs. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to match the human IVD active site with that of potato 2MBCD. The resulting mutant IVD had detectable activity with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA and no activity with isovaleryl-CoA. The 2MBCD active site was compared with that of human SBCAD using molecular modeling. Residues Met-361 and Ala-365 of 2MBCD appear to partially substitute for the function of Tyr-380 in human SBCAD, binding the methyl branch linked to C2 of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, whereas residues Val-88, Val-92, and Val-96 appear to bind the distal C4 methyl group. The presence of a 2MBCD in potato that is highly homologous to IVD is an example of convergent evolution within the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, leading to the independent occurrence of two enzymes (SBCAD and 2MBCD) specific for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA.

Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD 1The abbreviations used are: IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; SBCAD, short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; ETF, electron-transferring flavoprotein; ACD, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; 2MBCD, 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase.; EC 1.3.99.10) and short/branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SBCAD; EC 1.3.99.12) catalyze the α,β-dehydrogenation of isovaleryl-CoA and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, respectively. The reduced enzymes, in complex with substrate/product, transfer electrons to the electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF), which in turn passes them into the electron transport chain.

SBCAD and IVD belong to the evolutionarily conserved acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACD) family of mitochondrial flavoenzymes, which share a 30–35% amino acid sequence homology. There are currently nine known ACD family members with distinct substrate specificity profiles. Short-chain, medium-chain, long-chain, and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases as well as the newest family member, ACD9, are involved in mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids (7Eaton S. Bartlett K. Pourfarzam M. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Zhang J. Zhang W. Zou D. Chen G. Wan T. Zhang M. Cao X. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1033-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition to IVD and SBCAD, two other ACDs are involved in branched-chain amino acid degradation. Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase dehydrogenates an intermediate in valine degradation (9Nguyen T.V. Andresen B.S. Corydon T.J. Abd-El Ghisla S. Razik N. Mohsen A.W. Cederbaum S.D. Roe D.S. Roe C.R. Lench N.J. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 68-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzes both the dehydrogenation and decarboxylation of an intermediate in lysine degradation (10Fu Z. Wang M. Paschke R. Rao K.S. Frerman F.E. Kim J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9674-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ACDs are active in the mitochondrial matrix as homotetramers with the exception of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is a membrane-associated homodimer (11Kim J.J. Miura R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Based on the homology to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, ACD9 is thought to be a membrane-associated homodimer as well. Although mitochondrial ACDs involved in β-oxidation of fatty acids have not been identified in plants, cDNA sequences highly homologous to human IVD have been found in several plant species including Solanum tuberosum (potato), Arabidopsis, barley, corn, pea, rice, soy bean, and wheat. IVDs have been partially purified from potato and Arabidopsis and confirmed to have maximal enzyme activity with isovaleryl-CoA (12Daschner K. Couee I. Binder S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Faivre-Nitschke S.E. Couee I. Vermel M. Grienenberger J.M. Gualberto J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Potato and Arabidopsis IVDs are unusual in that they were reported to be homodimers, and both appeared to have significant enzyme activity with isobutyryl-CoA, which is not used as substrate by either mammalian or Caenorhabditis elegans IVDs. Potato IVD is encoded by the St-IVD2 gene (GenBank™ accession number AJ278988). Another potato cDNA has been reported (St-IVD1, GenBank™ accession AJ278987) that translates into a predicted IVD-like protein that is 84% identical to the St-IVD2 gene product. However, the St-IVD1 gene product differs from >30 known and putative IVD sequences from a diverse range of species at five residues in the substrate binding pocket (14Mohsen A.W. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the St-IVD1 gene product might utilize substrates other than isovaleryl-CoA. To determine the function of St-IVD1, the St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 cDNAs were cloned from potato sprouts and expressed in Escherichia coli. Substrate specificity and biochemical parameters of the purified recombinant enzymes were determined. The importance of residues in the active site in determining substrate specificity was studied by remodeling the acyl binding pocket of human IVD to mimic that of the St-IVD1 gene product. Cloning of St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 cDNAs and Construction of Expression Vectors—A potato sprout weighing ∼300 mg was placed in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pulverized with a pestle. The pulverized tissue was resuspended in 2 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA extraction was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the iScript kit (Bio-Rad) from 1 μg of total potato RNA. The St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 coding regions minus the mitochondrial leader peptide sequences were then amplified with the Advantage High Fidelity-2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences) and TA-cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The 5′-primer for St-IVD1 was designed to add a translation initiation codon just before the mature N terminus as well as an NdeI restriction site. Nucleotides were altered such that the first 17 amino acids reflected E. coli codon bias (15de Boer H.A. Kastelein R.A. Reznikoff W. Gold L. Maximizing Gene Expression. Butterworth Publishers, Stoneham, MA1986: 225-285Google Scholar, 16Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The primer was as follows, with the start codon in boldface and the changed nucleotides underlined:5′-TTC GAT TGT GCC AGA CAT ATG TCT ACT TCT TTA CTG CTG GAT GAT ACT CAG AAA CAG TTC AAA GAA AGT GTA-3′. The 3′-primer for St-IVD1 contained a PstI restriction site (5′-GCT GAC CTG CAG TTA TTG ATG TTT AAA GAG CTC ACG ACC-3′). St-IVD1 was subcloned from pGEM-T Easy into the pLEX prokaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) using NdeI and PstI. The St-IVD2 expression plasmid was generated in a similar fashion. The 5′-primer contained an EcoRI restriction site and changed the first 12 amino acids to reflect E. coli codon bias. This primer was as follows, with the start codon in boldface and changed nucleotides underlined: 5′-GTG CCA GAA TTC ATG TCC ACT TCC CTG CTG TTC GAC GAC ACT CAG AAA CAG-3′. The 3′-primer contained a PstI site (5′-GCT GAC CTG CAG TCA TTG TTC TTT AAA GAG TTC ACG GCC-3′). The St-IVD2 PCR product was subcloned from pGEM-T Easy into the EcoRI and PstI sites of the pKK223–3 expression plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). All of the clones were sequenced in their entirety to confirm the lack of amplification errors. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Potato Enzymes—Expression of the St-IVD1 cDNA was performed with the PL expression system following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 10 liters of minimal medium at 30 °C to an A550 of 0.5. The expression of St-IVD1 was then induced with the addition of tryptophan to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. After 3 h, the cells were harvested. The expression of St-IVD2 was performed as described previously for human IVD (16Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) in E. coli strain XL1Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Both potato proteins were purified following the protocol previously developed for human IVD (16Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. Crude cellular lysate was subjected to chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) followed by chromatography on a 20-μm ceramic hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad). Purity was judged by SDS-PAGE. Both proteins were evaluated for the presence of bound CoA-persulfide, in common with recombinant IVDs, through spectral scans using a Beckman DU7400 spectrophotometer. Bound CoA-persulfide results in a shift of the absorbance peak in the 445-nm region along with an increase in absorbance centered around 550 nm (18Williamson G. Engel P.C. Mizzer J.P. Thorpe C. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4314-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CoA-persulfide was found only in the purified St-IVD2 gene product and was removed by treatment with sodium hydrosulfite (“degreening”) as described previously (14Mohsen A.W. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of the purified samples was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Samples were stored in 20% glycerol at -80 °C until time of use. Construction and Expression of Mutant Human IVDs—PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce five mutations into the human IVD pKK223–3 expression construct that has been described previously (16Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). L95V, A99V, and L103V substitutions were introduced with the following primer (with altered nucleotides underlined): 5′-GAG GAG ATA TCC CGA GCT TCC GGA GCA GTG GGG GTT AGT TAC GGT GTG CAC TCC AAC GTA TGC ATC AAC CAG CTT GTA CGC-3′. Following sequencing to verify the presence of the triple mutation, the L370M and G374A substitutions were introduced using the following primer: 5′-GAC TTT CCC ATG GGC CGC TTT CTT CGA GAT GCC AAG ATG TAT GAG ATA GCT GCT GGT ACC AGC GAG GTG AGG CG-3′. The altered nucleotides are underlined, and the italicized base pair was altered to introduce a KpnI restriction site without changing the amino acid sequence. The resulting quintuple mutant was sequenced to verify the presence of the mutations and the absence of other errors introduced by amplification. The double mutant L370M/G374A was generated from the quintuple mutant by subcloning a C-terminal fragment containing the desired mutations back into the wild-type IVD construct. Wild-type human IVD and the double, triple, and quintuple mutants were expressed in the JM105 strain of E. coli. For each mutant-expressing strain, a 50-ml culture was grown at 37 °C to an A550 of 0.8 and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h. Crude cellular extracts were prepared by sonication and centrifugation and assayed for enzyme activity. Enzyme Assays—Enzyme activity was measured with the anaerobic ETF fluorescence reduction assay using an LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences with a heated cuvette block set to 32 °C as described previously (17Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3922-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Butyryl-CoA, valeryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, isobutyryl-CoA, and isovaleryl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. (S)-2-Methylbutyryl-CoA was synthesized as described previously (20Binzak B. Willard J. Vockley J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One milliunit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to completely reduce 1 nmol of ETF in 1 min. For kinetic analysis, ETF concentration was 1 μm and the substrate concentration was varied from 0.1 to 50 μm. The K m and Vmax values were calculated using the Psi Plot software, version 7.01 (Poly Software International, Pearl River, NY). Estimation of Molecular Mass—The molecular mass of the purified St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 gene products was estimated by gel filtration with a BioSep SEC-S3000 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) on a Waters high pressure liquid chromatography system (Milford, MA). A standard curve for this column was generated using standards purchased from Amersham Biosciences as follows: ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa); ovalbumin (43 kDa); albumin (67 kDa); aldolase (158 kDa); catalase (232 kDa); and ferritin (440 kDa). Running buffer was 20 mm KPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, flowed at a rate of 1.0 ml/min. Approximately 50 μg of St-IVD1 or St-IVD2 gene products were injected onto the column. Approximately 50 μg of human IVD was injected as a control. The elution volume for each protein was determined by following the absorbance at 280 nm using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. The molecular mass of recombinant human IVD, St-IVD2, and Arabidopsis IVD was also estimated from E. coli crude cellular extracts separated with a Superdex™ 200 size-exclusion column on a ÅKTA fast protein liquid chromatography unit (Amersham Biosciences). Crude cellular extracts from 10 ml of E. coli cultures were injected at 1.0 ml/min with 50 mm KPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, as running buffer. Fractions were collected (2 ml) and subjected to Western blotting with anti-human IVD antibody. A standard curve for this column was generated with the molecular mass standards listed above. Arabidopsis IVD in the tryptophan-inducible plasmid pAL-781 was a kind gift of Stefan Binder (12Daschner K. Couee I. Binder S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Twenty-five μg of protein from wild-type and mutant human IVD E. coli crude cellular extracts were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to 0.2 μm of Optitran™ nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a TE Series Transphore electrophoresis unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). IVD protein was detected by incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-IVD antibody followed by a 1:3,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and visualization with a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color development solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Molecular Modeling—Computer modeling of St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 gene products and human SBCAD were performed using a Silicon Graphics O2 work station (Mountain View, CA) and the Insight II software package as described previously (14Mohsen A.W. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of human IVD (Protein Data Bank code 1IVH) and rat short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Protein Data Bank code 1JQI) were used as reference molecules (21Tiffany K.A.

The CoA-persulfide in the human IVD structure and the acetoacetyl-CoA in the rat short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase structure were fixed as part of their respective structures prior to modeling. In each case, several models were generated and inspected manually for violations at the active site region and models with significant violations were rejected. Expression and Purification of Recombinant St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 Gene Products—The gene product of St-IVD2 (potato IVD) was successfully expressed using pKK223-3, the prokaryotic expression vector we previously employed for the production of human and C. elegans IVDs (14Mohsen A.W. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, no St-IVD1 gene product was detectable by immunoblot in crude cellular extract from isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells containing the St-IVD1 cDNA in pKK223-3. Therefore, the tryptophan-inducible PL expression system, which provides tighter control over expression than the pKK223-3 vector, was used to express this protein. Both proteins were purified to greater than 90% homogeneity (Fig. 1A) and thus are the first recombinant plant ACDs to be purified. Spectral assays performed on the purified enzymes showed no indication of bound CoA-persulfide in the St-IVD1 gene product, whereas the St-IVD2 gene product had a red shift of the 445-nm absorbance peak to 432 nm, which is consistent with the presence of a CoA-persulfide molecule (Fig. 1B). The St-IVD2 gene product was “degreened” with sodium hydrosulfite before use in enzyme assays (14Mohsen A.W. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 18Williamson G. Engel P.C. Mizzer J.P. Thorpe C. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4314-4320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular Mass of the St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 Gene Products— Partially purified native potato IVD was previously reported to be a dimer of 85–90 kDa as was recombinant Arabidopsis IVD from an E. coli crude cellular extract (12Daschner K. Couee I. Binder S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Faivre-Nitschke S.E. Couee I. Vermel M. Grienenberger J.M. Gualberto J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, the apparent molecular masses were estimated to be 188 and 146 kDa for the purified St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 gene products, respectively, using high pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration (Fig. 2). Purified human IVD also eluted at a volume corresponding to 146 kDa (data not shown). These data are consistent with the recombinant St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 gene products having a tetrameric quaternary structure. Likewise, the cellular extracts from isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells containing either the St-IVD2 gene product or Arabidopsis IVD were analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superdex 200 size-exclusion column and the fractions were subjected to Western blotting with anti-IVD antibodies. IVD-reactive protein appeared only in fractions in the size range of 160–220 kDa for both proteins (data not shown). Substrate Specificity and Kinetic Constants of Recombinant St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 Gene Products—Enzyme activity was measured for the purified St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 gene products with a variety of acyl-CoA substrates using the anaerobic ETF fluorescence reduction assay. The two proteins had very different patterns of substrate utilization. Despite high homology to IVD, the St-IVD1 gene product had little or no activity with isovaleryl-CoA as substrate with a preference instead for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA (Fig. 3A). The K m was 1.0 μm with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA (Table I). Thus, we designated this enzyme as 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (2MBCD). Potato 2MBCD had no detectable activity with isobutryryl-CoA (data not shown) but had minor activity with the straight-chain substrates, butyryl-CoA, valeryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and octanoyl-CoA, ∼20% or less than that seen with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA (Fig. 3A).Table IKinetic parameters of IVD and 2MBCD with preferred substratesEnzymePreferred substrateKmVmaxKcat per tetramerCatalytic efficiencyμmμmol/mins-1μm-1·s-12MBCD2-Methylbutyryl-CoA1.00.591.771.79IVDIsovaleryl-CoA1.31.250.980.73 Open table in a new tab As previously reported for the native protein, isovaleryl-CoA was the preferred substrate for recombinant St-IVD2 (Fig. 3A). However, purified recombinant potato IVD differed from the partially pure native form in that it showed no activity with isobutyryl-CoA as substrate using either the natural electron acceptor ETF or the chemical electron acceptor ferricenium (data not shown). The activity with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA was 5% of that seen with isovaleryl-CoA. Similar to previous results with recombinant human and C. elegans IVD (14Mohsen A.W. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), potato IVD showed low activity with the straight-chain substrates butyryl-CoA, valeryl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and octanoyl-CoA (Fig. 3A). Kinetic parameters were determined for the preferred substrate, isovaleryl-CoA. The K m was estimated at 1.3 μm (Table I), similar to the K m of human IVD for isovaleryl-CoA (17Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of Human IVD—Five residues in the active site of 2MBCD differ from those found in all of the known IVD sequences (Val-88, Val-92, Val-96, Met-361, and Ala-365). To test whether these five amino acids play a role in determining the specificity toward isovaleryl-CoA versus 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, human IVD was mutated to match the 2MBCD sequence at the homologous residues Leu-95, Aal-99, Leu-103, Leu-370, and Gly-374. The quintuple mutant human IVD L95V/A99V/L103V/L370M/G374A was expressed in E. coli to a similar level as wild-type human IVD (Fig. 4) but was inactive with isovaleryl-CoA as substrate as indicated by assay of crude cellular extract using the ETF fluorescence reduction assay (Table II). Low activity was observed with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA as substrate. The quintuple mutant enzyme was unstable and became inactive during purification because of a loss of the FAD cofactor, hampering further enzymatic characterization.Table IISpecific activities (milliunits/mg) of human IVD substrate pocket mutants All of the data represent the mean ± S.D. for enzyme activity assays performed in triplicate.

A triple mutant L95V/A99V/L103V human IVD and a double mutant L370M/G374A human IVD (matching the homologous St-IVD1 residues) were made and tested for substrate specificity. Both mutants were expressed to similar levels as wild type human IVD in E. coli (Fig. 5). The L95V/A99V/L103V mutations, which line the bottom of the substrate pocket, eliminated activity with isovaleryl-CoA (Table II); however, activity was also undetectable with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA. The L370M and G374A mutations were predicted to accommodate the C2 branch of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA. Mutant L370M/G374A had reduced specific activities for all of the substrates compared with wild-type IVD, but overall, the substrate specificity profile was similar to wild-type human IVD (Table II). These two mutations did not enhance activity with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA as substrate. The two potato cDNA sequences St-IVD1 and St-IVD2 were successfully expressed in E. coli, and the substrate specificity of the corresponding purified recombinant enzymes was determined. Potato 2MBCD, the St-IVD1 gene product, demonstrated highest specificity for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA and no activity toward isovaleryl-CoA despite being 84% identical to potato IVD (the St-IVD2 gene product) and 65% to human IVD at the amino acid level (calculated without the mitochondrial leader sequences). Although structurally homologous to IVD, potato 2MBCD is functionally analogous to the human enzyme SBCAD. Potato 2MBCD and human SBCAD both have maximal activity with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, although human SBCAD also shows high activity with other short straight-chain acyl-CoAs (23Rozen R. Vockley J. Zhou L. Milos R. Willard J. Fu K. Vicanek C. Low-Nang L. Torban E. Fournier B. Genomics. 1994; 24: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24He M. Burghardt T.P. Vockley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37974-37986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). SBCAD and potato 2MBCD, which are only 35% homologous at the amino acid level, represent an example of convergent evolution leading to the independent appearance of two enzymes (SBCAD and 2MBCD) specific for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA. It seems likely that the inappropriately designated St-IVD1 gene diverged from the potato IVD gene (St-IVD2) relatively recently, because data base searches failed to reveal similar gene duplications in other plant species. In 2MBCD, the IVD active site was adapted for efficient use of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA with surprisingly few amino acid substitutions, given the much larger sequence differences between mammalian IVDs and SBCADs. A sequence comparison of 2MBCD to known IVDs suggests that five differences in the active site (Table III) are responsible for the conversion to 2-methylbutyryl-CoA substrate specificity. Molecular modeling was used to compare the active site of 2MBCD to that of human SBCAD. A model of 2MBCD was created using the atomic coordinates of human IVD, and a model of human SBCAD was made using rat short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase as a reference molecule. Fig. 5 shows the five 2MBCD residues in question superimposed upon the homologous residues in human SBCAD. Potato 2MBCD residues Val-88, Val-92, and Val-96 appear to provide binding for the distal C4 methyl of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA. The presence of a valine at 2MBCD position 88 appears to provide the space required for the longer and bulkier side chain of Met-361. The sulfur and distal methyl of Met-361 became juxtaposed to the dimethylbenzene ring of the flavin, partially filling the space where the aromatic ring of Tyr-380 lies in human SBCAD. Together, Met-361 and Ala-365 appear to fill the role of Tyr-380 by creating a binding site for the methyl branch linked to C2 of the 2-methylbutyryl-CoA. The sulfur and distal methyl group of Met-361 also serves to exclude the binding of isovaleryl-CoA by eliminating the space required to fit a substrate with a methyl group linked to C3.Table IIIResidues forming the active site of potato 2MBCD and the equivalent positions in potato IVD, human IVD, and human SBCADPotato 2MBCDaActive site three-dimensional structures with the exception of human IVD are predicted from models extrapolated from other known ACD X-ray crystal structures using the Insight II Modeler software.

Potato 2MBCD residues that vary from known IVDs are in boldfaceb Catalytic base Open table in a new tab Site-directed mutagenesis was also used to study the role of the five 2MBCD active site residues (Table III and Fig. 5) in determining substrate specificity. The L95V/A99V/L103V/L370M/G374A substitutions in human IVD significantly altered the substrate specificity of the recombinant enzyme compared with wild type, leading instead to the pattern observed in potato 2MBCD, albeit with a lower level of activity. This is probably because of subtle conformational effects of amino acid residues at other positions outside the substrate binding pocket, such that, in 2MBCD, the conformation of the flavin moiety of FAD, the catalytic base, and/or other residues relative to the substrate are optimized. Based on molecular modeling of the 2MBCD active site, we predicted that mutating the residues homologous to Met-361 and Ala-365 in human IVD (Leu-370 and Gly-374) would eliminate the binding of isovaleryl-CoA. The specific activity of the L370M/G374A human IVD mutant with isovaleryl-CoA was, in fact, reduced but not eliminated compared with wild type IVD (Table II). In contrast, a triple mutant (L95V/A99V/L103V) of the three residues believed to be responsible for binding the distal end of the substrate in 2MBCD did completely eliminate activity with isovaleryl-CoA. However, activity with 2-methylbutyryl-CoA was also lost. Thus, whereas the residues at positions 370/374 may create the necessary cavity around the catalytic base for the C2 branch, the substitutions at the bottom of the pocket are critical to allow utilization of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA. These results imply that all five residues are needed to provide the proper fit and alignment of 2-methylbutyrl-CoA in the active site. The existence of a potato ACD with high specificity for 2-methylbutyryl-CoA suggests that isoleucine degradation is localized to mitochondria in at least some plants. However, BLAST searches of the DNA databases failed to identify any potential 2MBCD or SBCAD-like enzymes in other plants. To date, little is known regarding either isoleucine or valine degradation in plants. Whereas partially purified potato IVD and Arabidopsis IVD were reported to have activity with isobutyryl-CoA and thus potentially play a role in valine catabolism, our previous studies with native pea plant IVD (25Reinard T. Janke V. Willard J. Buck F. Jacobsen H.J. Vockley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33738-33743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and our current studies with purified recombinant potato ACDs found no detectable enzyme activity with isobutyryl-CoA as substrate. Human and C. elegans IVDs also do not show activity with isobutyryl-CoA (14Mohsen A.W. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 17Mohsen A.W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10146-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We conclude that neither potato IVD nor potato 2MBCD plays a role in valine catabolism. A recent analysis of the mitochondrial proteome of Arabidopsis revealed the presence of all of the enzymes required for leucine catabolism, including ETF, but only the enzymes that catalyze the final step of isoleucine and valine catabolism (26Taylor N.L. Heazlewood J.L. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 838-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Zolman et al. (27Zolman B.K. Monroe-Augustus M. Thompson B. Hawes J.W.

Graham I.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 571: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have provided evidence for the existence of valine-catabolizing enzymes in plant peroxisomes. Thus, valine may be either partially or fully oxidized in peroxisomes, perhaps by an acyl-CoA oxidase. These have not been fully characterized for activity with branched-chain substrates. In this work, we have cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized potato IVD and a new enzyme, which we have designated potato 2MBCD. With its high homology to IVD, potato 2MBCD has provided an opportunity to further our understanding of the amino acids critical for IVD substrate specificity. On another level, 2MBCD provides an interesting example of convergent evolution and raises questions regarding the existence of a mitochondrial isoleucine degradation pathway in plants."

The transmembrane part is linked to a cytoplasmic head piece made up by three domains, denoted A- (actuator), N- (nucleotide-binding), and P- (phosphorylation) domains in the terminology based on the high resolution crystal structure of the closely related Ca2+-ATPase (2Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 5Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). The A-domain consists of the N-terminal portion of the polypeptide chain in addition to the loop between M2 and M3, whereas the N- and P-domains are composed of the loop between M4 and M5 with the N-domain being inserted into the P-domain (11Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). Comparing the atomic structures of the Ca2+-ATPase in Ca2+-bound E1 forms (E1(Ca2)) (11Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) and E1(Ca2)·Mg·AlF4·ADP (12Sorensen T.L.-M. Moller J.V. Nissen P. Science. 2004; 304: 1672-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar)) with those of the Ca2+-free E2 forms stabilized by thapsigargin (E2(TG)) (13Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and E2(TG)·Mg·MgF4 (14Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar)), it appears that the cytoplasmic domains undergo large rearrangements in relation to the E1-E2 conformational changes, and a key event in active transport may be the extensive rotation of the A-domain parallel to the membrane. Because the A-domain is linked to the transmembrane domain through long cytoplasmic extensions of M1, M2, and M3, it is likely that these linker segments play critical roles in rotation of the A-domain and are essential for the interaction of the A-domain with the P-domain, with concomitant positioning of the conserved A-domain motif 214TGES217 in the vicinity of the catalytic site (15Patchornik G.

Long before the appearance of the Ca2+-ATPase crystal structures, proteolytic cleavage experiments with Na+,K+-ATPase had demonstrated that cleavage sites in the cytoplasmic extension linking M3 to the A-domain (“A-M3 linker”) are alternately exposed in relation to the E1-E2 and E1P-E2P conformational transitions. Functional characterization of the chymotrypsin cleaved enzyme showed a block of the translocation of Na+, due to stabilization of the E1P(Na3) intermediate (18Jørgensen P.L. Petersen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 821: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Jørgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage in the corresponding region of the Ca2+-ATPase with excision of a small five amino acids sequence (239MAATE243) likewise seems to affect the conformational changes (20Moller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cleaved enzyme retained the ability to bind Ca2+ and react with ATP, but the transition from E1P to E2P was blocked (20Moller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of mutation in the Na+,K+-ATPase of Gly263 next to the proteolytic cleavage point, or mutation of the homologous counterpart, Gly233, in the Ca2+-ATPase, are consistent with effects on the E1-E2 and E1P-E2P conformational equilibria (21Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore very interesting that the crystal structures of the Ca2+-ATPase show large structural differences in this region. In the E2 forms (13Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 14Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Tsuda T. Nature. 2004; 432: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), the whole region connecting domain A with M3 has moved from a peripheral to a more central position closer to domain P, and the rearrangements include the formation of an α-helix in the E2 form, involving residues immediately C-terminal to Gly233 (Gly263 of Na+,K+-ATPase). In this report we have investigated the functional consequences of mutation in this region further. Ile265, with its bulky hydrophobic side chain, and Thr267 were both replaced with alanine. To examine the role of the conformation of the peptide backbone, we furthermore replaced the two glycines Gly271 and Gly274 with alanine. Neither of the residues selected for the present study, or their equivalents in other P-type ATPases, have previously been studied by mutagenesis. The isoleucine is particularly well conserved, being present in Na+,K+-ATPases, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPases, and H+,K+-ATPases. To examine the functional importance of these residues in Na+,K+-ATPase, we have studied the effects of the mutations on the overall and partial reactions of the enzyme, using steady-state and transient kinetic measurements. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Enzyme Preparation—Site-directed mutagenesis of the ouabain-resistant rat α1-isoform of Na+, K+-ATPase was carried out by the Kunkel method (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 85: 3314-3318Google Scholar) or by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce the desired mutations directly into full-length cDNA. The mutant or wild-type cDNA was expressed in COS-1 cells, using 5 μm ouabain in the growth medium to select stable transfectants, and a crude plasma membrane fraction was isolated from the cells and made leaky by treatment with sodium deoxycholate or alamethicin (8Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Functional Analysis—To eliminate the contribution of the endogenous ouabain-sensitive COS-1 cell enzyme (∼10% of the total Na+,K+-ATPase content of the preparation), 10 μm ouabain was added to all assays except for the one in which the affinity for ouabain was determined by variation of the ouabain concentration. For the phosphorylation assays, the enzyme was moreover preincubated in the presence of ouabain. ATP hydrolysis was measured at 37 °C as described previously (24Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Na+,K+-ATPase activity associated with the expressed exogenous enzyme was calculated by subtracting the background ATPase activity measured at 10 mm ouabain from the ATPase activity measured at 10 μm ouabain. Studies of the Na+ dependence of steady-state phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and the time course of dephosphorylation, as well as the determination of the active site concentration by phosphorylation in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and oligomycin (20 μg/ml) to inhibit dephosphorylation, were carried out at 0 °C (26Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Deocclusion of K+ or Rb+ was studied in phosphorylation experiments at 10 °C, following formation of K+- or Rb+-occluded enzyme at room temperature as described previously (21Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rapid kinetic phosphorylation experiments at 25 °C with enzyme present in the E1Na3 form were performed using a BioLogic quench-flow module according to the previously described “Protocol 1” (21Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38653-38664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In all the above-described phosphorylation experiments, background phosphorylation was determined in the presence of 50 mm KCl without NaCl. To examine the vanadate affinity under equilibrium conditions, 10 μg of deoxycholate-treated plasma membranes was incubated at 20 °C for 30 min in 40 μl of medium containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm ouabain, and the indicated concentration of orthovanadate. To promote accumulation of the enzyme in the E2 form, 8 mm RbCl was added to the medium during the incubation with vanadate. The samples were then cooled to 0 °C to prevent dissociation of bound vanadate (30Smith R.L. Zinn K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9852-9859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the enzyme fraction with no vanadate bound was determined by measuring the amount of phosphoenzyme formed during a 30-s incubation following the addition of 360 μl of ice-cold phosphorylation medium producing final concentrations of 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm choline chloride, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μg/ml oligomycin. The data were fitted by assuming a simple one-site binding model where only the enzyme fraction with no vanadate bound phosphorylates, EP=(EPmax−EP∞)⋅(1−[vanadate]/(K0.5+[vanadate]))+EP∞(Eq. 1) where EPmax is the phosphorylation level obtained in the absence of vanadate, and EP∞ is the phosphorylation level corresponding to infinite vanadate concentration. Data Analysis and Statistics—Data normalization, averaging, and nonlinear regression analysis were carried out as previously (21Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The lines in the figures show the best fit to the complete set of normalized data, and the extracted parameters with standard errors are indicated in the tables. ATP and vanadate dependences of the ATPase activity and the Na+ dependence of phosphorylation were analyzed using the Hill equation. In the analysis of the ouabain dependence of ATPase activity, the ouabain-inhibited enzyme was represented by the sum of two Hill functions, one corresponding to the exogenous rat enzyme and one corresponding to the endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase. The time course of K+ deocclusion was analyzed using the biphasic time function described previously (21Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in which the component corresponding to the rapid phase is at maximum from the beginning. The time dependence of phosphorylation of enzyme in the E1Na3 form was fitted by using a mono-exponential function, and the dephosphorylation time courses following chase with ATP or ADP were fitted by using a bi-exponential function. Expression, Ouabain Sensitivity, and Catalytic Turnover Rate—The amino acid substitutions Ile265 → Ala, Thr267 → Ala, Gly271 → Ala, and Gly274 → Ala were introduced into the ouabain-resistant rat kidney α1-isoform of the Na+,K+-ATPase, and the mutant enzymes were expressed in COS-1 cells as previously (8Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). As in our earlier studies, we used a culture medium containing 5 μm ouabain for selection of the stable COS-1 cell lines expressing the mutant α1 enzymes. This is feasible, provided the mutant enzyme is functional, because the rat kidney Na+,K+-ATPase is less sensitive to ouabain (K0.5 for ouabain inhibition > 100 μm, cf.Table I) than the endogenous COS-1 cell Na+,K+-ATPase (K0.5 0.3–0.8 μm) (24Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 25Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For all mutants the Na+,K+-transport rate was high enough to support cell growth. The mutants were expressed to an active site concentration (determined by phosphorylation with oligomycin included to maximally stabilize the phosphoenzyme) similar to that determined for the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase, ranging between 30 and 60 pmol/mg of total membrane protein. This high expression level enabled us to characterize the functional properties of the mutants by measuring the overall function and by using various phosphorylation and dephosphorylation protocols to provide kinetic information on the individual steps in the catalytic cycle.Table INa+,K+-ATPase turnover rate and apparent affinities determined by measurement of ligand concentration dependences of Na+,K+-ATPase activityMutationK0.5 (ouabain)aDetermined by ouabain titration of Na+,K+-ATPase activity.

A Hill function was fitted to the data points (average values corresponding to at least three experiments), giving the K0.5 and Hill numbers shown. Open table in a new tab The ouabain concentration dependence of Na+,K+-ATPase activity showed that the K0.5 value for ouabain inhibition of mutants Thr267 → Ala, Gly271 → Ala, and Gly274 → Ala was very similar to that of the wild type, whereas mutant Ile265 → Ala displayed a 2.7-fold increased K0.5 value (Table I). To avoid any contribution from the endogenous COS-1 cell enzyme, all measurements of ATPase activity and phosphoenzyme described below were carried out in the presence of 10 μm ouabain. The catalytic turnover rate was calculated as the ratio between the maximum Na+,K+-ATPase activity (determined at 37 °C and saturating substrate concentrations) and the active site concentration. As seen in Table I, the catalytic turnover rate was reduced to 61% in mutant Ile265 → Ala, and to 80 and 86%, relative to wild type, in Thr267 → Ala and Gly271 → Ala, respectively, whereas it was wild type-like in Gly274 → Ala. ATP Dependence of Na+,K+-ATPase Activity—Fig. 1 shows results of experiments in which the ATP dependence of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was studied. The K0.5 value for ATP extracted from the data is listed in Table I. Relative to the wild type, Ile265 → Ala exhibited a 5.3-fold increase of the apparent affinity for ATP (K0.5 reduced), whereas in mutants Thr267 → Ala, Gly271 → Ala, and Gly274 → Ala, the apparent affinity for ATP was reduced (K0.5 increased 1.1- to 1.6-fold). In the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase, ATP binds to E2(K2) with low affinity, accelerating the rate-limiting transition between E2(K2) and E1Na3, cf.Scheme 1, boxed ATP (3Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11104-11115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that mutant Ile265 → Ala exhibits an increased apparent affinity for ATP in the activation of Na+,K+-ATPase activity, relative to wild type, may be explained by an acceleration of E2(K2) → E1Na3 induced by the mutation independently of ATP. Alternatively, the Ile265 → Ala mutation might increase the intrinsic affinity of the low affinity binding site on E2(K2) for ATP. For mutants Thr267 → Ala, Gly271 → Ala, and Gly274 → Ala, on the other hand, the data are consistent with either a stabilization of the K+-occluded intermediate, E2(K2), occurring independently of ATP, or a reduced intrinsic affinity of E2(K2) for ATP. K+Occlusion—From the data in Fig. 1 it can be calculated that an increase of ATP concentration from 10 μm to 3 mm enhances the turnover rate 37-fold in the wild type, whereas the enhancement is only 8.5-fold in Ile265 → Ala. At 10 μm ATP, the turnover rate is 230 and 606 min–1 for the wild type and Ile265 → Ala, respectively. At this low ATP concentration, K+ deocclusion, E2(K2) → E1 + 2K+, is rate-limiting for the overall ATPase reaction. Therefore, the increased turnover rate of Ile265 → Ala, relative to wild type, determined under these conditions suggests that the rate of K+ deocclusion is increased in the mutant. To examine the rate of K+ deocclusion directly, the previously described phosphorylation assay was applied (21Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme is equilibrated with K+ in the absence of Na+ and ATP to form E2(K2). The phosphorylation kinetics is then determined following initiation of the phosphorylation reaction by a 10-fold dilution of the enzyme in a solution containing 100 mm Na+ and 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP. Oligomycin is added just prior to phosphorylation to prevent decay of the phosphoenzyme. This procedure allows estimation of the level of E2(K2) initially present, as well as the rate constant for the K+ deocclusion reaction E2(K2) → E1 + 2K+. The data presented in Fig. 2 were analyzed by fitting a biphasic time function (21Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), in which the ordinate intercept reflects the non-occluded enzyme pool ready to bind Na+ and phosphorylate immediately, whereas the exponential part (shown by the line in Fig. 2) corresponds to deocclusion of K+ from E2(K2). The fraction of enzyme initially present as E2(K2) equals 100% minus the ordinate intercept. The parameters determined by this procedure are listed in Table II for all mutants. As is seen in Fig. 2 (upper panel) and Table II, Ile265 → Ala differed significantly from the other mutants and wild type with respect to both the deocclusion rate (9-fold enhanced, relative to wild type) and the level of the K+-occluded intermediate initially present (65% versus 88% for wild type). Because the latter parameter corresponds to enzyme"
