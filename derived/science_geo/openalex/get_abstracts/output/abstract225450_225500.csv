https://openalex.org/W1991466213,"THE presence of enteramine has already been demonstrated (by means of colour reactions, pharmacological reactions and, quite recently, by the method of chromatography on paper1) in acetone- and alcohol-extracts of posterior salivary glands of Octopus vulgaris and Eledone moschata2,3, of the hypobranchial body of Murex trunculus and Murex brandaris4, of the intestine of Ciona intestinalis and Tethium plicatum5, as well as of mammalian intestinal mucosa and spleen6,7. We now find that the skin of Amphibia should be included in the list of organs and tissues containing enteramine."
https://openalex.org/W1998754999,"STUDIES of the nutritional requirements of soil bacteria isolated on a non-selective basis1 have shown the presence of a well-defined group of organisms dependent upon soil extract for maximum growth. These bacteria show no growth, or at best sub-maximal growth, in media containing sugars and inorganic salts, supplemented by yeast extract or combinations of amino-acids and vitamins (not including B12). Though the relative incidence of this group may vary with the soil type, soil management and the season2, the chief factor affecting the proportion of these organisms is believed to be the growing plant, investigations with a variety of crops3,4 having shown a lowered relative incidence in the rhizosphere, attributable to a preferential stimulation by the plant root of bacteria with simpler nutritional needs. However, in soil beyond the zone of influence of the root, this group has been found to comprise 8–35 per cent of the bacteria in the soils examined."

https://openalex.org/W4232995996,"SINCE the simple salts of optical antipodes d+X′ and l+X′ have equal solubilities, it follows that the activity products are equal, and hence ad+ = al+ in the saturated solutions. Electrolytes such as sodium nitrate change the activities of both enantiomeric ions to the same extent. A number of observations, to be published shortly, have led us to the conclusion that a specific effect can be exerted on one enantiomeric ion by the addition of an electrolyte containing an optically active anion or cation. As a result, in such solutions, ad+ ≠ al+, and a number of interesting consequences follow, such as the possibility of carrying out a resolution without the discrete separation of diastereoisomerides, and the movement of the position of equilibrium in an optically labile system. We have named this phenomenon tentatively ‘configurational activity’."

https://openalex.org/W2066685348,"A TWO-DIMENSIONAL paper chromatogram of an acid hydrolysate of groundnut protein has shown, in addition to the spots due to the amino-acids previously reported present in groundnut protein1, a glycine spot (RF = 0.32, 80 per cent aqueous phenol; RF = 0.22, butanol–acetic acid) and an unidentified spot (RF = 0.78, 80 per cent aqueous phenol; RF = 0.24 butanol–acetic acid mixture). The RF values of the unidentified spot did not correspond with any of the values reported for amino-acids2 or amino-sugars3."

https://openalex.org/W2021865734,"HOLLINSHEAD1 demonstrated with the Severinghaus staining technique the presence of fuchsinophil granules in the cytoplasm of the carotid-body cells in the cat. Later on2, he showed that these granules disappear from the mouse carotid-body cells in cases of lethal anoxia. Hollinshead related this disappearance tentatively with the state of activity of the carotid-body cells, as it is known that anoxia stimulates powerfully the release of nerve impulses in this organ."
https://openalex.org/W2066751529,"IN the course of studies of the barium metabolism of larval Drosophila which it is planned to report in full elsewhere, we have found that larvæ on a medium containing barium-140 showed lanthanum-140 enrichment if the medium had been inoculated with Texas Y-2 strain of yeast1 twenty-four hours before adding the larvæ, but barium-140 enrichment if the larvæ had been placed directly on the sterile food. These enrichments were measured by means of deviations in the shape of the curves of radioactive decay for the chain 140Ba → 140La → 140Ce, as has been clearly described2 for the strontium-90–yttrium-90 chain. The observation appeared explicable on the assumption that the yeast cells were selecting lanthanum from the medium, while the larvæ, though preferring to feed on yeast cells, preferentially absorb barium."

https://openalex.org/W1974281152,"THE ease with which 1-substituted pyrazoles may be converted into the free imino compounds varies with the nature of the 1-substituent and the reacting substance. Thus, 1,3,5-trimethyl pyrazole may be nitrated1 and 1-phenyl pyrazole reduced to the pyrazoline2 without loss of the N-methyl or N-phenyl groups respectively. On the other hand, pyrazoles of the 1-carbamyl or 1-phenylcarbamyl type, (I), derived from the acyl hydrazides, semicarbazide3 and 4-phenylsemicarbazide4, are much less stable and readily give the free imino derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1995466193,"THE natural mineral pollucite is generally formulated as (Cs,Na)2O.Al2O3.4SiO2.H2O. It is isostructural with analcite, Na2O.Al2O3.4SiO2.2H2O, both having cubic unit cells. Values of a reported for analcite range from 13.65 A. to 13.67 A. 1, and for pollucite from 13.65 A. to 13.69 A. 2."
https://openalex.org/W2035282631,"LARGE numbers of elementary bodies were found by Stamp et al.1 in the fœtal membranes from sheep after experimental transmission of enzootic abortion in ewes; these were described as having the morphological and staining properties of a rickettsia or a virus of the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group. The exact nature of the agent remained uncertain, although later studies2 on its development in the chorio-allantoic membrane of fertile eggs suggested that the latter relationship was the more probable. The following experiments were made in order to determine whether the virus of enzootic abortion in ewes has antigenic properties which would define its position from this point of view."

https://openalex.org/W2005381828,"IN a previous communication1, a short description was given of a new virus isolated from a steckling mangold. Further investigation has revealed the interesting fact that this virus seems to be present in a latent condition in a high percentage of the ordinary seed beets and mangolds in the British Isles. Samples of apparently healthy sugar-beet and mangold stecklings collected at random from different farms in Essex, Cambridge, Lincoln and Scotland were all found to contain the virus. The concentration of virus differed considerably in the various lots, and the virus was not detected in every plant of each sample."

Such a unit would certainly be welcome; but was not the name ‘Balmer’ suggested several years ago to denote the reciprocal of the Angstrom unit? I regret that at the moment I am unable to locate the reference."

https://openalex.org/W2046955995,"IT has been shown by Barnett and Miller1 that the relationship between the soluble nitrogen content (Ns) and the total nitrogen content (Nd) of dried samples of grass silage can be represented by the formula : Ns/Nd= 0.854 – 0.100 pH ± 0.012. As the quality of silage is related to its pH, it seemed desirable to estimate the digestibility of the protein in dried silage by the pepsin method of Wedemeyer2. This method has fallen into disuse as it is stated to give results which are too high, but, so far as we are aware, no critical study of the method in connexion with silage exists. A study of the protein digestibility of the samples previously examined (about seventy in number) for their soluble nitrogen content revealed that a direct relationship existed between the soluble nitrogen content and the digestible protein content (Np)/(Nd). This relationship is given by the formula Np/Nd= 33.4 + 0.78 Ns/Nd ± 0.07. It is possible then, with regard to dried grass silage, to portray the nitrogen state, so to speak, as in Fig. 1, the results there being shown on a percentage basis. As the direct determination of Np/Ndinvolves a pepsin digestion which lasts forty-eight hours, whereas the corresponding operation of washing the dried silage to determine Ns/Ndtakes only forty minutes, the time saved by this method of approach is obvious."
https://openalex.org/W2049565385,"IN the course of an experiment on the radiobiology of the liver carcinoma of the rat induced by butter-yellow, an attempt was made to transmit the autogenous tumour by transplantation into the subcutaneous tissues of young animals of the same strain. The strain of albino rat used as hosts was not, however, sufficiently homogeneous, and a high percentage of spontaneous regressions occurred in these animals in spite of repeated passage. A group of resistant rat hosts was thus obtained in which the inoculated tumours had grown for about a fortnight, and then rapidly regressed to small, barely palpable nodules. In view of the known ability of total body radiation1 and trypan blue2 to depress the host's resistance to tumour, these animals were divided into four groups, one of which was treated with total body irradiation (central body dose: 525 r., 240 kV., HVL 1.5 mm. copper); in another, each animal was injected subcutaneously with 2 ml. of a 0.5 per cent aqueous solution of trypan blue; a third group was placed on the standard hepatoma-inducing butter-yellow diet, and a fourth group used as controls."

https://openalex.org/W1996356055,"AMONG the reactions which have proved of value in the investigations of the effects of substituents on reaction-rates in solution is the one between organic chlorides and metallic iodides in acetone. This reaction, which was first investigated kinetically by Conant and Kirner1, is suitably free from complicating side reactions, and the very low solubility of potassium chloride in acetone ensures that it goes almost to completion. It has, therefore, been extensively used in kinetic studies by Conant, Bennett and others."
