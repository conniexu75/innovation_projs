https://openalex.org/W4239029175,"Genome-wide expression analysis was used to identify genes whose expression depends on the functions of key components of the transcription initiation machinery in yeast. Components of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, the general transcription factor TFIID, and the SAGA chromatin modification complex were found to have roles in expression of distinct sets of genes. The results reveal an unanticipated level of regulation which is superimposed on that due to gene-specific transcription factors, a novel mechanism for coordinate regulation of specific sets of genes when cells encounter limiting nutrients, and evidence that the ultimate targets of signal transduction pathways can be identified within the initiation apparatus."

This lineage is specified before implantation into the uterus and is restricted to form the fetal portion of the placenta. A culture of mouse blastocysts or early postimplantation trophoblasts in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) permitted the isolation of permanent trophoblast stem cell lines. These cell lines differentiated to other trophoblast subtypes in vitro in the absence of FGF4 and exclusively contributed to the trophoblast lineage in vivo in chimeras.
https://openalex.org/W1990768206,"An effector of intercellular adhesion, β-catenin also functions in Wnt signaling, associating with Lef-1/Tcf DNA-binding proteins to form a transcription factor. We report that this pathway operates in keratinocytes and that mice expressing a stabilized β-catenin controlled by an epidermal promoter undergo a process resembling de novo hair morphogenesis. The new follicles formed sebaceous glands and dermal papilla, normally established only in embryogenesis. As in embryologically initiated hair germs, transgenic follicles induce Lef-1, but follicles are disoriented and defective in sonic hedgehog polarization. Additionally, proliferation continues unchecked, resulting in two types of tumors also found in humans. Our findings suggest that transient β-catenin stabilization may be a key player in the long-sought epidermal signal leading to hair development and implicate aberrant β-catenin activation in hair tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2095299680,"A new rhythm mutation was isolated based on its elimination of per-controlled luciferase cycling. Levels of period or timeless clock gene products in the mutant are flat in daily light–dark cycles or constant darkness (although PER and TIM oscillate normally in temperature cycles). Consistent with the fact that light normally suppresses TIM, cryb is an apparent null mutation in a gene encoding Drosophila’s version of the blue light receptor cryptochrome. Behaviorally, cryb exhibits poor synchronization to light–dark cycles in genetic backgrounds that cause external blindness or demand several hours of daily rhythm resets, and it shows no response to brief light pulses. cryb flies are rhythmic in constant darkness, correlating with robust PER and TIM cycling in certain pacemaker neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2136757266,"Light is a major environmental signal for circadian rhythms. We have identified and analyzed cry, a novel Drosophila cryptochrome gene. All characterized family members are directly photosensitive and include plant blue light photoreceptors. We show that cry transcription is under circadian regulation, influenced by the Drosophila clock genes period, timeless, Clock, and cycle. We also show that cry protein levels are dramatically affected by light exposure. Importantly, circadian photosensitivity is increased in a cry-overexpressing strain. These physiological and genetic data therefore link a specific photoreceptor molecule to circadian rhythmicity. Taken together with the data in the accompanying paper, we propose that CRY is a major Drosophila photoreceptor dedicated to the resetting of circadian rhythms."

https://openalex.org/W2085115632,"Lymphocyte activation is accompanied by visible changes in chromatin structure. We find that antigen receptor signaling induces the rapid association of the BAF complex with chromatin. PIP2, which is regulated by activation stimuli, is sufficient in vitro to target the BAF complex to chromatin, but it has no effect on related chromatin remodeling complexes containing SNF2L or hISWI. Purification and peptide sequencing of the subunits of the complex revealed beta-actin as well as a novel actin-related protein, BAF53. beta-actin and BAF53 are required for maximal ATPase activity of BRG1 and are also required with BRG1 for association of the complex with chromatin/matrix. This work indicates that membrane signals control the activity of the mammalian SWI/SNF or BAF complex and demonstrates a direct interface between signaling and chromatin regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2021609583,"The mechanism by which the phytochrome (phy) photoreceptor family transduces informational light signals to photoresponsive genes is unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified a phytochrome-interacting factor, PIF3, a basic helix-loop-helix protein containing a PAS domain. PIF3 binds to wild-type C-terminal domains of both phyA and phyB, but less strongly to signaling-defective, missense mutant–containing domains. Expression of sense or antisense PIF3 sequences in transgenic Arabidopsis perturbs photoresponsiveness in a manner indicating that PIF3 functions in both phyA and phyB signaling pathways in vivo. PIF3 localized to the nucleus in transient transfection experiments, indicating a potential role in controlling gene expression. Together, the data suggest that phytochrome signaling to photoregulated genes includes a direct pathway involving physical interaction between the photoreceptor and a transcriptional regulator."

https://openalex.org/W1996412713,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common motor neuron degenerative disease that results from reduced levels of, or mutations in, the Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein. SMN is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus where it is concentrated in gems. SMN interacts with spliceosomal snRNP proteins and is critical for snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm. We show that a dominant-negative mutant SMN (SMNdeltaN27) causes a dramatic reorganization of snRNPs in the nucleus. Furthermore, SMNdeltaN27 inhibits pre-mRNA splicing in vitro, while wild-type SMN stimulates splicing. SMN mutants found in SMA patients cannot stimulate splicing. These findings demonstrate that SMN plays a crucial role in the generation of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery and thus in mRNA biogenesis, and they link the function of SMN in this pathway to SMA."

https://openalex.org/W2044326283,"The HERG voltage-dependent K+ channel plays a role in cardiac electrical excitability, and when defective, it underlies one form of the long QT syndrome. We have determined the crystal structure of the HERG K+ channel N-terminal domain and studied its role as a modifier of gating using electrophysiological methods. The domain is similar in structure to a bacterial light sensor photoactive yellow protein and provides the first three-dimensional model of a eukaryotic PAS domain. Scanning mutagenesis of the domain surface has allowed the identification of a hydrophobic “hot spot” forming a putative interface with the body of the K+ channel to which it tightly binds. The presence of the domain attached to the channel slows the rate of deactivation. Given the roles of PAS domains in biology, we propose that the HERG N-terminal domain has a regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W2043757833,"Meiotic recombination of S. cerevisiae contains two temporally coupled processes, formation and processing of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Mre11 forms a complex with Rad50 and Xrs2, acting as the binding core, and participates in DSB processing. Although these proteins are also involved in DSB formation, Mre11 is not necessarily holding them. The C-terminal region of Mre11 is required only for DSB formation and binds to some meiotic proteins. The N-terminal half specifies nuclease activities that are collectively required for DSB processing. Mre11 has a DNA-binding site for DSB formation and another site for DSB processing. It has two regions to bind to Rad50. Mre11 repairs methyl methanesulfonate-induced DSBs by reactions that require the nuclease activities and those that do not."

https://openalex.org/W2162074446,"An angle resolved photoemission study on Ca2CuO2Cl2, a parent compound of high Tc superconductors is reported. Analysis of the electron occupation probability, n(k) from the spectra shows a steep drop in spectral intensity across a contour that is close to the Fermi surface predicted by the band calculation. This analysis reveals a Fermi surface remnant even though Ca2CuO2Cl2 is a Mott insulator. The lowest energy peak exhibits a dispersion with approximately the |cos(kxa)-cos(kya)| form along this remnant Fermi surface. Together with the data from Dy doped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8 + delta) these results suggest that this d-wave like dispersion of the insulator is the underlying reason for the pseudo gap in the underdoped regime."
https://openalex.org/W2124919065,"Elevations from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) have been used to construct a precise topographic map of the martian north polar region. The northern ice cap has a maximum elevation of 3 kilometers above its surroundings but lies within a 5-kilometer-deep hemispheric depression that is contiguous with the area into which most outflow channels emptied. Polar cap topography displays evidence of modification by ablation, flow, and wind and is consistent with a primarily H2O composition. Correlation of topography with images suggests that the cap was more spatially extensive in the past. The cap volume of 1.2 x 10(6) to 1.7 x 10(6) cubic kilometers is about half that of the Greenland ice cap. Clouds observed over the polar cap are likely composed of CO2 that condensed out of the atmosphere during northern hemisphere winter. Many clouds exhibit dynamical structure likely caused by the interaction of propagating wave fronts with surface topography."

https://openalex.org/W2008741744,"α-Dystroglycan (α-DG) is a component of the dystroglycan complex, which is involved in early development and morphogenesis and in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies. Here, α-DG was shown to serve as a Schwann cell receptor for Mycobacterium leprae , the causative organism of leprosy. Mycobacterium leprae specifically bound to α-DG only in the presence of the G domain of the α2 chain of laminin-2. Native α-DG competitively inhibited the laminin-2–mediated M. leprae binding to primary Schwann cells. Thus, M. leprae may use linkage between the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton through laminin-2 and α-DG for its interaction with Schwann cells."
https://openalex.org/W2086693765,"Post HIV-1 entry, productive HIV-1 infection of primary T cells requires overcoming several cellular blocks to provirus establishment and replication. Activation of unknown host intracellular events overcomes such inhibitory steps and is concomitant with HIV-1 replication. We show that the transcription factor NFATc was sufficient as a cellular factor to induce a highly permissive state for HIV-1 replication in primary CD4+ T cells. NFATc overcame a blockade at reverse transcription and permitted active HIV-1 replication. Pharmacologic blockade of endogenous NFAT activity by FK506 or CsA inhibited synthesis of reverse transcription and also potently blocked HIV-1 replication. T cells therefore can become competent for HIV-1 replication by control of regulated host factors such as the NFATc transcription factor. The host mechanisms regulated by such permissivity factors are potential targets for anti-HIV-1 therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1607759307,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and genetically complex inflammatory disorder that leads to erosive destruction of peripheral joints. The use of animal models mimicking RA, such as pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats, should facilitate its genetic analysis. Pristane is a non-immunogenic synthetic oil that, after a single subcutaneous injection into DA rats, induces arthritis restricted to peripheral joints with a chronic relapsing disease course. To identify genes involved in the control of chronic arthritis, we made crosses between susceptible DA rats and resistant E3 rats and analysed the progeny with microsatellite markers covering the entire rat genome. Our results show that different arthritis phenotypes are associated with different chromosomal loci. Loci on chromosomes 4 and 6 (Pia2 and Pia3) influence arthritis onset, whereas a locus on chromosome 12 (Pia4) is associated with severity and joint erosion. We found that chronicity is associated with a different set of loci, one on chromosome 4 and the other on chromosome 14 (Pia5, Pia6). These findings demonstrate for the first time that different phases of a chronic self-perpetuative disease which mimics RA are associated with distinct sets of genes."
https://openalex.org/W2060371587,"The viral accessory protein Vpx is required for productive in vitro infection of macrophages by simian immunodeficiency virus from sooty mangabey monkeys (SIV(SM)). To evaluate the roles of Vpx and macrophage infection in vivo, we inoculated pigtailed macaques intravenously or intrarectally with the molecularly cloned, macrophage tropic, acutely pathogenic virus SIV(SM) PBj 6.6, or accessory gene deletion mutants (deltaVpr or deltaVpx) of this virus. Both wild-type and SIV(SM) PBj deltaVpx viruses were readily transmitted across the rectal mucosa. A subsequent 'stepwise' process of local amplification of infection and dissemination was observed for wild-type virus, but not for SIV(SM) PBj deltaVpx, which also showed considerable impairment of the overall kinetics and extent of its replication. In animals co-inoculated with equivalent amounts of wild-type and SIV(SM) Pbj deltaVpx intravenously or intrarectally, the deltaVpx mutant was at a strong competitive disadvantage. Vpx-dependent viral amplification at local sites of initial infection, perhaps through a macrophage-dependent mechanism, may be a prerequisite for efficient dissemination of infection and pathogenic consequences after exposure through either mucosal or intravenous routes."

https://openalex.org/W1669455160,"Muscle contraction is driven by a change in shape of the myosin head region that links the actin and myosin filaments. Tilting of the light-chain domain of the head with respect to its actin-bound catalytic domain is thought to be coupled to the ATPase cycle. Here, using X-ray diffraction and mechanical data from isolated muscle fibres, we characterize an elastic bending of the heads that is independent of the presence of ATP. Together, the tilting and bending motions can explain force generation in isometric muscle, when filament sliding is prevented. The elastic strain in the head is 2.0-2.7 nm under these conditions, contributing 40-50% of the compliance of the muscle sarcomere. We present an atomic model for changes in head conformation that accurately reproduces the changes in the X-ray diffraction pattern seen when rapid length changes are applied to muscle fibres both in active contraction and in the absence of ATP. The model predictions are relatively independent of which parts of the head are assumed to bend or tilt, but depend critically on the measured values of filament sliding and elastic strain."
https://openalex.org/W2118859425,"Tricorn protease was previously described as the core enzyme of a modular proteolytic system displaying multicatalytic activity. Here we elucidate the mode of cooperation between Tricorn and its interacting factors, and we identify two additional factors, F2 and F3, closely related aminopeptidases of 89 kDa. In conjunction with these three factors, Tricorn degrades oligopeptides in a sequential manner, yielding free amino acids. We have been able to reconstitute a proteolytic pathway comprising the proteasome, Tricorn, and its interacting factors, F1, F2, and F3, which converts proteins efficiently into amino acids. Therefore, it is quite likely that Tricorn also acts in vivo downstream of the proteasome and, in cooperation with its interacting factors, completes protein catabolic pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2069012550,"Photoreceptor axons arriving in the Drosophila brain organize their postsynaptic target field into a precise array of five neuron “cartridge” ensembles. Here we show that Hedgehog, an initial inductive signal transported along retinal axons from the developing eye, induces postsynaptic precursor cells to express the Drosophila homolog of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The EGFR ligand Spitz, a signal for ommatidial assembly in the compound eye, is transported to retinal axon termini in the brain where it acts as a local cue for the recruitment of five cells into a cartridge ensemble. Hedgehog and Spitz thus bring about the concerted assembly of ommatidial and synaptic cartridge units, imposing the “neurocrystalline” order of the compound eye on the postsynaptic target field."

https://openalex.org/W2040245871,"Enigmatic glassy materials (escorias) and red bricklike materials (tierras cocidas) occur at a restricted stratigraphic level (the top of the Chapadmalal Formation). Materials from one locality near Mar del Plata are attributed to a mid-Pliocene impact event with a radiometric and magnetostratigraphic age of 3.3 million years ago (Ma). An extinction of endemic fauna (including the glyptodonts and flightless cariamid birds) correlates with the unit containing the impact glasses. Moreover, the age of the glasses is coincident within dating uncertainties with a pulselike change in the oxygen isotope marine record in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans just before the late Pliocene deterioration of the climate."

https://openalex.org/W2057263276,The brown dwarf Gliese 229B has an observable atmosphere too warm to contain ice clouds like those on Jupiter and too cool to contain silicate clouds like those on low-mass stars. These unique conditions permit visibility to higher pressures than possible in cool stars or planets. Gliese 229B's 0.85- to 1.0-micrometer spectrum indicates particulates deep in the atmosphere (10 to 50 bars) having optical properties of neither ice nor silicates. Their reddish color suggests an organic composition characteristic of aerosols in planetary stratospheres. The particles' mass fraction (10 −7 ) agrees with a photochemical origin caused by incident radiation from the primary star and suggests the occurrence of processes native to planetary stratospheres.
