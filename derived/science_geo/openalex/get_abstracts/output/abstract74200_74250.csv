https://openalex.org/W2094779077,"Simulium, the vector of onchocerciasis and the cause of considerable nuisance in northern latitudes, is usually controlled by killing its aquatic stages by putting insecticides in a soluble form into the streams where they occur. This kills most of the other insects; the natural predatory suppressors of the Simulium larvae—the larvae of some of the stone flies and caddis flies—are removed, and unrestrained recolonization by Simulium may occur."

https://openalex.org/W2087008993,"PROF. HOLLOWAY has shown effectively that the partial endocast of Homo habilis provides a valid basis for estimating its cranial capacity, and even for a far greater range of angles along the sagittal suture than are anatomically likely. He has increased the maximum (biasterionic) breadth by as much as 10 mm and reduced it by as much as 20 mm and found a minimal effect on the cross-sectional area of the biparietal tunnel. It is of interest that the difference in biasterionic breadth between two reconstructions made in Nairobi and in Johannesburg was scarcely 2 mm. The first was made by Dr. L. S. B. Leakey and myself, with the auxiliary observational judgment of Dr. G. G. Simpson, Mrs. M. Leakey and Mrs. S. Coryndon; the second was made by A. R. Hughes and myself. The tolerance limits of our reconstructions were 2 mm; Prof. Holloway has validated the method for a range of 30 mm between the greatest and smallest biasterionic distances !"
