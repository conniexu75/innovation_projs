https://openalex.org/W1983298714,"Murine and canine narcolepsy can be caused by mutations of the hypocretin (Hcrt) (orexin) precursor or Hcrt receptor genes. In contrast to these animal models, most human narcolepsy is not familial, is discordant in identical twins, and has not been linked to mutations of the Hcrt system. Thus, the cause of human narcolepsy remains unknown. Here we show that human narcoleptics have an 85%-95% reduction in the number of Hcrt neurons. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons, which are intermixed with Hcrt cells in the normal brain, are not reduced in number, indicating that cell loss is relatively specific for Hcrt neurons. The presence of gliosis in the hypocretin cell region is consistent with a degenerative process being the cause of the Hcrt cell loss in narcolepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2010829205,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are hypothesized to play a critical role in olfaction. However, it has not been demonstrated that the cAMP signaling is required for olfactory-based behavioral responses, and the contributions of specific adenylyl cyclases to olfaction have not been defined. Here, we report the presence of adenylyl cyclases 2, 3, and 4 in olfactory cilia. To evaluate the role of AC3 in olfactory responses, we disrupted the gene for AC3 in mice. Interestingly, electroolfactogram (EOG) responses stimulated by either cAMP- or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate- (IP3-) inducing odorants were completely ablated in AC3 mutants, despite the presence of AC2 and AC4 in olfactory cilia. Furthermore, AC3 mutants failed several olfaction-based behavioral tests, indicating that AC3 and cAMP signaling are critical for olfactory-dependent behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2090845949,"We constructed a novel optical indicator for chloride ions by fusing the chloride-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein with the chloride-insensitive cyan fluorescent protein. The ratio of FRET-dependent emission of these fluorophores varied in proportion to the concentration of Cl and was used to measure intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) in cultured hippocampal neurons. [Cl-]i decreased during neuronal development, consistent with the shift from excitation to inhibition during maturation of GABAergic synapses. Focal activation of GABAA receptors caused large changes in [Cl-]i that could underlie use-dependent depression of GABA-dependent synaptic transmission. GABA-induced changes in somatic [Cl-]i spread into dendrites, suggesting that [Cl-]i can signal the location of synaptic activity. This genetically encoded indicator will permit new approaches ranging from high-throughput drug screening to direct recordings of synaptic Cl- signals in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1983587113,"Survival factors suppress apoptosis by activating the serine/threonine kinase Akt. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying activated Akt's ability to protect neurons from hypoxia or nitric oxide (NO) toxicity, we focused on the apoptosis-related functions of p53 and caspases. We eliminated p53 by employing p53-deficient neurons and increased p53 by infection with recombinant adenovirus capable of transducing p53 expression, and we now show that p53 is implicated in the apoptosis induced by hypoxia or NO treatments of primary cultured hippocampal neurons. Although hypoxia and NO induced p53, treatment with insulin-like growth factor-1 significantly inhibited caspase-3-like activation, neuronal death and transcriptional activity of p53. These insulin-like growth factor-1 effects are prevented by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor. Adenovirus-mediated expression of activated-Akt kinase suppressed p53-dependent transcriptional activation of responsive genes such as Bax, suppressed caspase-3-like protease activity and suppressed neuronal cell death with no effect on the cellular accumulation and nuclear translocation of p53. In contrast, overexpression of kinase-defective Akt failed to suppress these same activities. These results suggest a mechanism where Akt kinase activation reduces p53's transcriptional activity that ultimately rescues neurons from hypoxia- or NO-mediated cell death.

El-Deiry W.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hypoxic insult, as well as excitotoxic stimulation, involves excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and has have been shown to increase p53 production with concomitant increases in neuronal apoptosis (2Halterman M.W. Federoff H.J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 159: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In general, p53-mediated apoptosis requires a p53 protein that functions to modulate transcription of certain genes. Important examples of such activated genes include the apoptosis-inducing Bax gene (3Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and the KILLER/DR5 gene (4Wu G.S. Burns T.F. McDonald III, E.R. Jiang W. Meng R. Krantz I.D. Kao G. Gan D.D.

Following exposure to toxic treatments, a number of peptide factors including neurotrophins and growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)1 have been found to enhance neuronal survival (5Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In recent years, considerable advances have been made in understanding the signal transduction pathway activated by these growth factors. Among them, the serine/threonine kinase termed Akt appears to play a central role in the survival of a number of cell types (6Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 7Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

Recently, four Akt substrates were identified that are also components of the cell's intrinsic death machinery: the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member known as Bad (10Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X.

In each case, phosphorylation by Akt kinase inhibits these protein's pro-apoptotic function, thereby accounting for at least part of the survival effect imparted by activated Akt kinase. We now report that activated Akt significantly impairs p53-dependent neuronal apoptosis and impairs induction of Bax in response to treatment with hypoxia, NO, or adenovirus-mediated expression of p53. We further show that activated Akt strongly inhibits p53-dependent transactivation of target genes with no apparent effect on p53-protein accumulation, subcellular localization, and phosphorylation status of p53. These findings suggest a mechanism where activated Akt kinase inhibits p53-mediated transactivation to apparently block subsequent apoptosis of the neuron. Homozygous p53-deficient mice were obtained from the Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Originally on a mixed C57BL6/CBA strain, p53-deficient mice were backcrossed to C57BL6 (five times) so that the majority of their genetic background is C57BL6. Fifth generation heterozygous p53 knockout mice on the C57BL6 background were mated to one another to produce the homozygous p53 knockout mice used in this study. The genotypes of all mice were confirmed by PCR using DNA extracted from the tails according to the protocol described previously (17Tsukada T. Tomooka Y. Takai S. Ueda Y. Nishikawa S. Yagi T. Tokunaga T. Takeda N. Suda Y. Abe S. et al.Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3313-3322PubMed Google Scholar). The primers were mixtures of 1) a genomic sequence in intron 1 and upstream of exon 2 in the p53 gene (5′-AATTGACAAGTTATGCATCCAACAGTACA-3′), 2) a genomic sequence in exon 4 of the p53 gene (5′-ACTCCTCAACATCCTGGGGCAGCAACAGAT-3′), and 3) a sequence from the neomycin resistance gene (5′-GAACCTGCGTGCGTGCAATCCATCCATCTTGTTCAATG-3′). A 500-base pair PCR product represents the wild-type p53 gene and a 800-base pair PCR product represents the disrupted p53 gene. Hippocampal neurons were prepared from postnatal day −1 p53 wild-type and deficient mice and from embryonic day 18 Harlan Sprague Dawley rat embryos, as described previously (18Tamatani M. Ogawa S Niitsu Y. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1588-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,19Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Nunez G. Tohyama M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal hippocampi were dissected and digested with 0.25% trypsin for 20 min at room temperature in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Tissues were further dissociated by repeated trituration. The cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 on plates coated with poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) (Falcon Lab and Maintainware, Lincoln Park, NJ) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum, 30 mm glucose, and 0.5% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% room air. To inhibit growth of glial cells, cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the cultures 48 h after seeding. All experiments were performed in 8–10-day-old cultures (8–10 DIV). The growth medium was replaced with a serum-free medium that consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 30 mm glucose and 0.5% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin. At 24 h after the replacement, cells were treated for 6 h with IGF-1 or vehicle (saline) and exposed to hypoxia or a NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP; Sigma). Human recombinant IGF-1 was purchased from Sigma. Hypoxia treatment was performed using an incubator attached to a hypoxia chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Ann Arbor, MI) that maintained a humidified atmosphere with low oxygen tension (pO2; 12–14 Torr) as described previously (20Ogawa S. Gerlach H. Esposito C. Pasagian-Macaulay A. Brett J. Stern D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In PI 3-kinase inhibition studies, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (Sigma) was added to the cultures 15 min before treatment with IGF-1. The generation of recombinant adenovirus containing constitutively active Akt (AxCALNmyrAkt) or kinase-deficient Akt gene (AxCAKDAK179M) has been described previously (21Matsuzaki H. Tamatani M. Mitsuda N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Miyake S. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2037-2046PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, AxCALNmyrAkt encodes constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt) that lacks a pleckstrin homology domain but contains a Src myristoylation signal sequence fused to its amino-terminal end. The myr-Akt gene is subcloned into the Cre-inducible expression cassette, pAxCALNLw, which is normally not expressed because of the placement of the neomycin resistance gene. Efficient production of a nuclear location signal-tagged Cre recombinase under control of the CAG promoter (22Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar) permits Cre-mediated excision of the neomycin resistance gene from the pAxCALNLw vector allowing expression of the heterologous target gene. The kinase-defective Akt (tagged with hemagglutinin to its NH2 terminus) was prepared by PCR where Akt1 K179M in pBT-701 (kindly provided by Dr. Kikkawa, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan), was used as a template. DNA fragments generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Then, the kinase-defective Akt gene tagged with hemagglutinin was cloned into the pAxCAwt expression vector and was designated as pAxCAAktK179M. The recombinant adenovirus vectors AxCANCre, which expresses Cre recombinase; AxCALNLZ, which expresses LacZ when a sufficient amount of Cre recombinase is expressed; and AxCANLZ, which expresses LacZ under control of the CAG promoter, were generously provided by Dr. Saito (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Another recombinant adenovirus vector Ad5CMVp53, which expresses p53 protein under the control of CMV promoter, was generously provided by Dr. Roth (University of Texas, Houston, TX) (23Zhang W.W. Fang X. Mazur W. French B.A. Georges R.N. Roth J.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 5-13PubMed Google Scholar). All viruses were grown in 293 cells and purified by CsCl2 gradient centrifugation. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay and concentrated virus stored at −80 °C. Infection was carried out by adding recombinant adenovirus to serum-containing medium. The cells were incubated with virus-containing media at the indicated multiplicity of infection at 37 °C for 60 min with constant agitation. The medium was changed, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before exposure to hypoxia or a NO donor, SNP, or were untreated as stated. Neuronal cell viability was assessed by determining the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture medium thereby indicating a loss of membrane integrity and cell death. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a commercial kit (Kyokuto Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) in which a colorimetric assay measures the pyruvate-mediated conversion of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine into a visible hydrazone precipitate. Percent neuronal viability was expressed as (1 − experimental value/maximum release) × 100, where the maximum release was obtained after exposure of untreated control cultures to 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 37 °C. Levels of cytoplasmic, histone-associated DNA fragments were assayed using the Cell Death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacture's protocol. In brief, the cytosolic fraction (13,000 × g supernatant) of ∼500 cultured cells was used as an antigen source in a enzyme-linked immunosorbent sandwich assay with primary anti-histone antibody coated to the microtiter plate and secondary anti-DNA antibody coupled to peroxidase. From the absorbance values, the -fold increase of DNA fragmentation was calculated as (absorbance of treated cells − absorbance of blank)/(absorbance of control cells − absorbance of blank) where nontreated cells were used as controls. Caspase-3-like activity was measured by spectrophotometric assay as described previously (24Tamatani M. Mitsuda N. Matsuzaki H. Okado H. Miyake S. Vitek M.P. Yamaguchi A. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were suspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm EGTA), and then incubated with 10 μm digitonin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 3 min. Protein concentration in the resulting supernatant was measured using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Then, the supernatant containing 30 μg of protein was incubated with 50 μm enzyme substrate, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-DEVD, at 37 °C for 1 h. Levels of released AMC were measured using an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm with a spectrofluorometer (Hitachi F-3000, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 0.22 nmol of AMC/min at 37 °C. Caspase-3-like activity of control neurons was 47.1 ± 2.7 units/mg of protein. Cell extracts for Western blot analysis were prepared by washing the cells three times with PBS and lysing them in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 mm NaCl). The samples were boiled for 5 min before subjecting 20-μg aliquots to electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. After the proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), the membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (1× PBS, 5% nonfat dried milk) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with a primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed four times in PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, probed with the secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Detection of signal was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). The primary antibodies used were anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (P-19: Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-mouse Akt polyclonal antibody (New England Biolabs), anti-mouse phospho-Akt polyclonal antibody that recognizes Akt only when phosphorylated at Ser-473 (9270, New England Biolabs), and anti-mouse β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Total RNA derived from 2 × 107 cells was extracted from primary cultures of rat neurons by the acid guanidium-thiocyanate/phenol chloroform method. For RT-PCR, 5 μg of total RNA was reversed-transcribed using oligo(dT) and reverse transcriptase from Moloney murine leukemia virus (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a volume of 25 μl. For PCR amplification, specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (10 pmol each) were incubated with 1 μl of cDNA template in a 20-μl PCR reaction mixture containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 9.2, 1 μl of deoxynucleotides (1 mm each), and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The sequences of primers used in this study were as follows: Bax sense primer (5′-TGGTTGCCCTTTTCTACTTTG-3′) and Bax antisense primer (5′-GAAGTAGGAAAGGAGGCCATC-3′) and as an internal control, β-actin sense primer (5′-TGCCCATCTATGAGGGTTACG-3′) and β-actin antisense primer (5′-TAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACG-3′). Dilutions of cDNA were amplified for 23–26 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The amplified PCR products at each cycle number were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The product of constitutively expressed β-actin mRNA served as the internal standard. The amplified PCR products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The product of constitutively expressed β-actin mRNA served as the control. All the products were assayed in the linear response range of the RT-PCR amplification process; the cycle number used was determined by finding the midpoint of linear amplification on a sigmoid curve for both amplification products with cycle numbers of 24–30 plotted against band density (25Tamatani M.

The identity of each PCR product was confirmed by subcloning the amplified cDNAs into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared from primary neuronal cultures according to published method (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish and were harvested by scraping and washing in 0.5 ml of cold PBS. The cells were then washed once in 0.1 ml of cold buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The washed pellets were then suspended in 50 μl of buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 1 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin and were incubated on ice for 10 min. After incubation, the pellets were mixed briefly by vortexing and were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of cold buffer C (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin and incubated on ice for another 15 min with intermittent vortexing. The extracts were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was divided into aliquots and frozen at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit. To assay binding activity, a double-strand oligonucleotide containing the sequence corresponding to the p53 consensus site (5′-AGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCTA-3′) (27el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Sephadex G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Binding reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 2–10 μg of nuclear extract, and 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (50,000 cpm). Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Binding reactions were subjected to nondenaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis through 4% gels in a 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer system. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Primary cultured rat neurons were plated in six-well tissue culture dishes at 9 × 104cells/well and used for transient transfection at DIV 7. Cells were then cotransfected with 0.3 pmol of a p53-Luc plasmid that contains a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element and a TATA box, which are joined to a tandem repeat of a p53 binding element (Stratagene), together with 0.3 pmol of pRL-TK plasmid, which contains an herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the Renilla luciferase gene (Promega). As controls, pGL3 basic vector or pGL3 promoter plasmids that contain an SV40 promoter upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (Promega) are cotransfected with pRL-TK plasmid. Transfections are carried out using the modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (28Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h, washed twice with 2 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Firefly luciferase andRenilla (sea pansy) luciferase activities were measured sequentially using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (EG&G, Berthold). After measuring the firefly luciferase signal (LA F) and theRenilla luciferase signal (LA R), the relative luciferase activity (RLA) was calculated as:RLA =LA F/LA R, where relativeRLA was calculated as a percentage, i.e.%RLA =RLA/(RLA)max. To examine the effect of Akt activation on the phosphorylation status of p53, in vivo kinase assays were performed according to the published method (29Ahmad F. Cong L.N. Stenson Holst L. Wang L.M. Rahn Landstrom T. Pierce J.H. Quon M.J. Degerman E. Manganiello V.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4678-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Neurons derived from rat fetal brains were seeded in 35-mm dishes at the density of 1–2 × 106 cells/dish. Cells were incubated in a phosphate-free medium for 30 min and then labeled with32P for 3 h in a medium containing 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. After 32P labeling, they were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4). p53 proteins were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-p53 antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE, which was dried prior to analysis by autoradiography. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Experimental groups were compared by analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe's post hoc test. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. To address the possibility that accumulation of p53 plays a role in cell death following treatment with hypoxia or a NO donor, SNP, we compared viabilities of primary hippocampal neurons derived from wild-type or p53-null mice. Treatment with hypoxia or SNP (50 μm) induced significantly greater degrees of neuronal loss, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3-like activation in neurons derived from wild-type mice as compared with those from p53-null mice (Fig.1 A, a–c). Administration of the Ac-DEVD-CHO, a peptide inhibitor of caspase-3-like protease (1 μm), which completely inhibited casapse-3-like activation (Fig. 1 A, c), reduced the proportion of hypoxia-induced or SNP-induced cell death (Fig. 1 A, b) and DNA fragmentation (Fig.1 A, a), suggesting that increased protease activity is required for cell death. Furthermore, treatment with hypoxia or SNP significantly increased the levels of p53 protein (Fig.1 A, d). These results demonstrated that apoptosis following hypoxia or SNP treatments is prominently associated with increased p53 expression. To further demonstrate that p53 is involved in neuronal apoptosis, we used a strategy of adenovirus infection to transduce the expression of p53 protein in cultures of hippocampal neurons from p53-null mice. Western blot analysis revealed that cultured neurons deficient in p53 gene and infected with Ad5CMVp53, which expresses human wild-type p53 protein under control of the CMV promoter, displayed increased levels of p53 protein at 24 h after infection that was dependent on the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) as compared with uninfected cells or with cells infected with a control virus, AxCANLZ (Fig. 1 B,a). Infection with Ad5CMVp53 (50 and 100 m.o.i.) also increased neuronal death, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3-like activity at 24 h after infection. (Fig. 1 B,b–d). Moreover, pretreatment of neurons with the caspase-protease inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO (1 μm), significantly inhibited neuronal death induced by infection with Ad5CMVp53 (Fig. 1 B, c). DNA fragmentation, neuronal viability, and caspase-3-like proteolytic activity of AxCANLZ-infected cells were similar to those of control, uninfected neurons (data not shown). These results are consistent with the hypothesis where increased levels of p53 expression are proportionally associated with increased apoptotic cell death. Growth factors such as IGF-1 appear to play a neuroprotective role against ischemic or excitotoxic insult (30Guan J. Gunn A.J. Sirimanne E.S. Tuffin J. Gunning M.I. Clark R. Gluckman P.D. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2000; 20: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To assess the role of IGF-1 in the prevention of p53-mediated neuronal death, we examined the effect of IGF-1 on wild-type or p53-null neurons exposed to hypoxia or SNP treatment. Pretreatment with IGF-1 conferred ∼70% protection from hypoxia- or SNP-induced cell death, 60% reduction in DNA fragmentation, and 70% inhibition of caspase-3-like activation in wild-type neurons with these effects being blocked by treatment with wortmannin (20 nm), an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2, A–C). On the other hand, IGF-1 treatment in p53-null neurons did not significantly change the measured parameters of apoptosis observed in non-IGF-1-treated p53-null neurons (Fig. 2, A–C). These results clearly suggest that IGF-1 protects neurons from p53-mediated toxicity through PI 3-kinase activation. The functional status of p53 to activate transcription strongly correlates with its ability to bind specific DNA sequences on target genes (31Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of IGF-1 on p53 accumulation, DNA binding activity, and transcriptional activity, primary rat hippocampal neurons were pretreated with or without IGF-1 in the presence or absence of wortmannin followed by exposure to hypoxia or SNP treatments for up to 24 h. 24 h after exposure to hypoxia or SNP, cells were lysed and the extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-p53 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig.3 A, IGF-1 treatment with or without pretreatment of wortmannin had no effect on p53 accumulation in neurons exposed to hypoxia or SNP treatment. We then examined the effect of IGF-1 on p53's DNA binding activity by EMSAs. Nuclear extract were prepared 8 h after treatment with hypoxia or SNP, and the EMSAs were performed using the p53 consensus response element as a probe (5′-AGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCTA-3′). As shown in Fig.3 B, treatment with IGF-1 inhibits hypoxia- or SNP-induced increases in p53's DNA binding activity. Pretreatment with wortmannin apparently antagonized the IGF-1 effect and allowed increased p53 DNA binding activity. Excess unlabeled probe effectively competed the binding of the labeled probe (Fig. 3 B). To examine whether IGF-1 affects the transactivation potential of p53, we performed reporter gene assays using reporter plasmids containing a tandem repeat of a p53 consensus response element placed upstream of a luciferase cDNA (p53-Luc, Stratagene). 24 h after transient transfection with the reporter plasmid, cells were exposed to hypoxia or SNP treatment for 8 h in the presence or absence of IGF-1. Although we observed 8–9-fold induction of the luciferase activity by hypoxia or SNP treatment, pretreatment with IGF-1 remarkably reduced the increase in the transcriptional activation of p53, which was prevented by wortmannin (Fig. 3 C).

https://openalex.org/W2055804358,"NGF is a target-derived growth factor for developing sympathetic neurons. Here, we show that application of NGF exclusively to distal axons of sympathetic neurons leads to an increase in PI3-K signaling in both distal axons and cell bodies. In addition, there is a more critical dependence on PI3-K for survival of neurons supported by NGF acting exclusively on distal axons as compared to neurons supported by NGF acting directly on cell bodies. Interestingly, PI3-K signaling within both cell bodies and distal axons contributes to survival of neurons. The requirement for PI3-K signaling in distal axons for survival may be explained by the finding that inhibition of PI3-K in the distal axons attenuates retrograde signaling. Therefore, a single TrkA effector, PI3-K, has multiple roles within spatially distinct cellular locales during retrograde NGF signaling."

SA+ displayed 5-fold higher avidity for HeLa cells when compared with SA−, although both strains recognized the same proteinaceous receptor. Increased avidity of SA+ binding was mediated by increased k on. Neuraminidase treatment to remove cell-surface sialic acid decreased thek on of SA+ to that of SA−. Increasedk on of SA+ enhanced an infectious attachment process, since SA+ was 50–100-fold more efficient than SA− at infecting HeLa cells in a kinetic fluorescent focus assay. Sialic acid binding was operant early during SA+ attachment, since the capacity of soluble sialyllactose to inhibit infection decreased rapidly during the first 20 min of adsorption. These results indicate that reovirus binding to sialic acid enhances virus infection through adhesion of virus to the cell surface where access to a proteinaceous receptor is thermodynamically favored.

Instead, attachment strategies employed by these enveloped viruses involve multiple interactions between several viral and cellular molecules, and these interactions are often accompanied by dramatic conformational rearrangements of viral proteins. In addition, many enveloped viruses employ an adhesion-strengthening attachment strategy in which primary virus-cell interactions require low affinity adhesion of the virus to common cell surface molecules that are often carbohydrate in nature (7Haywood A.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Weis W. Brown J.H. Cusack S. Paulson J.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C.

This initial phase of attachment is then followed by higher affinity interactions between the virus and a secondary receptor on permissive cells, an event that often triggers virus entry through direct membrane fusion or receptor-mediated endocytosis (10Trkola A.

In contrast to our developing understanding of mechanisms of enveloped virus attachment, less is known about attachment strategies of nonenveloped viruses, a group that includes several important human pathogens. The mammalian reoviruses offer a useful experimental system to dissect the contributions of discrete steps in the viral replication cycle to pathogenesis in the infected host (14Tyler K.L. Fields B.N. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 1597-1623Google Scholar). Following oral inoculation into newborn mice, serotype 1 (T1)1 reovirus strains spread hematogenously to the central nervous system and replicate within ependymal cells, resulting in hydrocephalus. In contrast, serotype 3 (T3) reovirus strains utilize neural spread pathways to gain access to the central nervous system, where they replicate in a wide variety of neurons and cause encephalitis (15Weiner H.L.

Neurol. 1983; 13: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since reovirus contains a segmented genome, it is possible to link pathogenic phenotypes to individual viral genes using reassortant viruses. Using this approach, it was determined that the mode of spread in the host (17Tyler K.L. McPhee D.A. Fields B.N. Science. 1986; 233: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and cell tropism in the central nervous system (18Weiner H.L. Powers M.L. Fields B.N. J. Infect.

These findings suggest that reovirus tropism and disease outcome are determined by interactions between cell-surface receptors and the ς1 protein. The ς1 oligomer has two structural domains, an amino-terminal fibrous tail, which anchors ς1 at each of the icosahedral vertices of the virion, and a compact globular head located at the carboxyl terminus (22Furlong D.B.

Recognition of sialic acid by the ς1 tail RBD can serve as a tropism determinant for some cell types in culture (38Chappell J.D. Gunn V.L. Wetzel J.D. Baer G.S. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rubin D.H. Wetzel J.D. Williams W.V. Cohen J.A. Dworkin C. Dermody T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2536-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear whether binding to sialic acid is sufficient to permit virus entry or merely facilitates ς1-head receptor interactions. The mechanisms by which sialic acid binding and ς1 head receptor binding cooperate to achieve stable, cell-specific reovirus attachment and entry in cultured cells and in the infected host are unknown. The presence of discrete RBDs in ς1 suggests that reoviruses employ multi-step binding processes analogous to those described for some enveloped viruses. However, attachment mechanisms used by reovirus may be unique, since reoviruses are nonenveloped, and both RBDs exist at a distance of a few hundred angstroms within the same viral protein. Studies to determine mechanisms by which the tail and head RBDs of ς1 cooperate to achieve stable virus-cell association, specific host cell tropism, and modulation of disease in the infected animal have not been possible to date, since isogenic virus strains differing only in the capacity to utilize a distinct receptor have not been available. To address these questions, we selected reovirus mutants that differ in sialic acid-binding capacity, and we used reassortant genetics to place the ς1-encoding S1 genes of these strains into identical genetic backgrounds. Using these strains, we demonstrate that reovirus attachment is a multistep process, with primary sialic acid binding serving as a low affinity adhesion event that accelerates virus attachment but must be followed by ς1-head receptor interactions to permit efficient virus entry and infection. Spinner-adapted murine L929 (L) cells were grown in either suspension or monolayer cultures in Joklik's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml of amphotericin (Irvine Scientific).

Viral titer (expressed as plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml) was determined by plaque assay on L-cell monolayers (43Virgin H.W., IV Bassel-Duby R. Fields B.N. Tyler K.L. J.

Purified virions were prepared by using third-passage L-cell lysate stocks of plaque-purified reovirus as described previously (22Furlong D.B. Nibert M.L. Fields B.N. J.

Viral particle concentrations were determined by measurement ofA 260 using a conversion factor of 2.1 × 1012 viral particles/ml/A 260 (44Smith R.E. Zweerink H.J. Joklik W.K. Virology. 1969; 39: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Particle/pfu ratios of stocks used for viral infectivity assays were ∼250:1. Murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 9BG5 (G5) (45Burstin S.J. Spriggs D.R. Fields B.N.

Virol. 1991; 65: 6772-6781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were purified from hybridoma culture supernatants (Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN), and Fab fragments (Fabs) of each were prepared using the Immunopure Fab Purification system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reassortant viruses were isolated by coinfecting monolayers of L cells with T1L and either T3C44 or T3C44-MA. Coinfections, plaque-purification, amplification of progeny viruses, and genotyping of reassortant viruses were performed as described previously (47Wetzel J.D. Wilson G.J. Baer G.S. Dunnigan L.R. Wright J.P. Tang D.S.H. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1362-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two sequential rounds of reassortment were performed to obtain monoreassortant viruses that retained the S1 gene segment from the T3 parental virus with all other gene segments derived from T1L. These monoreassortant strains were designated T3/C44-SA− and T3/C44-MA-SA+, abbreviated SA− and SA+, respectively, throughout this paper. Electrophoretic mobility of monoreassortant gene segments was verified by purifying genomic dsRNA from CsCl-banded purified virions (5 × 1011 particles) using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Purified gene segments were resolved in 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for 550 (small class gene segments), 930 (medium class gene segments), or 1380 (large class gene segments) mA·h at constant current, stained with EtBr, and visualized by UV transillumination. Following reassortment, the S1 gene segments of both strains were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using primers complementary to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) (48Wilson G.J. Wetzel J.D. Puryear W. Bassel-Duby R. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6598-6606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cloned into the pCR 2.1 vector, and sequenced using T4 DNA polymerase (Sequenase 2.0, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). In addition, the S1 gene UTRs of each strain were sequenced by direct dsRNA sequencing of purified viral genomic RNA as described previously (37Dermody T.S. Nibert M.L. Bassel-Duby R. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5173-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycophorin and asialoglycophorin (1 mg/ml in PBS) (Sigma) were biotinylated by incubation with a 10–100-fold molar excess of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) at room temperature for 2 h. Biotinylated glycophorin or asialoglycophorin was injected at a concentration of 5–50 μg/ml in PBS across duplicate flow cells of a BIAcore streptavidin chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sensor chip flow cells were coated with 1000–2000 resonance units of each protein, followed by rinsing in running buffer (Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS)) to remove unbound protein. Purified virions of strains SA− and SA+ were injected across the conjugated chip surfaces at various concentrations at a flow rate of 25 μl/min. Following virus binding, chip surfaces were regenerated with a 1-min pulse of 1 m NaCl, 20 mm NaOH. Surfaces treated in this manner showed no significant decrease in virus-binding capacity for up to 30 cycles of regeneration. In some experiments, virions were preincubated with α-sialyllactose (SLL) or lactose (Sigma) at room temperature for a minimum of 10 min prior to injection. Since the refractive index of concentrated virus and saccharide solutions caused significant bulk shift effects during injection, specific binding of virions to sialic acid was calculated by subtracting resonance units measured on asialoglycophorin-coated reference surface from binding to the glycophorin-coated surface prior to data analysis. No time-dependent increase in virus binding to asialoglycophorin was detected under any conditions. Affinity constants of strain SA+ binding to sialic acid were determined using simultaneousk on/k off nonlinear regression with BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), assuming either a 1:1 Langmuir binding model or a bivalent analyte binding model (49(1994) in BIAapplications Handbook, pp. 5-1–5-12, Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, SwedenGoogle Scholar, 50Karlsson R.

Gunn V.L. Wetzel J.D. Baer G.S. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed in D-PBS to remove neuraminidase, resuspended in D-PBS, and processed for binding assays. Purified virus particles (2–4 × 1013/ml in D-PBS) were iodinated using the IODO-GEN two-step method (Pierce). Na125I (2.5 mCi) was oxidized for 6 min in IODO-GEN tubes in a total volume of 220 μl of D-PBS and then incubated with 4 ml of purified virus at room temperature for 6 min. Virus was separated from unincorporated125I on 10-ml dextran d-Salt columns (Pierce) followed by dialysis against 4 liters of D-PBS. Labeled virus was stored at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mmNaN3, 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, and 2 mmNaF (Sigma). Specific activity of iodinated virus was 0.5 to 1 × 10−6 cpm/particle. Greater than 85% of cpm was precipitable from iodinated virus preparations using acetone precipitation or immunoprecipitation with anti-reovirus mAbs. Iodinated virion preparations were used for up to 4 weeks after iodination. Iodination of virions did not affect ς1 function as assessed by hemagglutination assay or interaction with conformationally sensitive anti-ς1 mAb G5, and no iodination of ς1 was detected following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of labeled reovirus virions. Radioligand binding assays were designed, and data were analyzed using general guidelines and equations as described (52Limbird L.E. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1996: 61-122Google Scholar). HeLa cells were detached from flasks by incubation in PBS plus 3 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min followed by gentle pipetting. L cells were obtained from suspension cultures. Cells were pelleted at 250 ×g for 5–8 min, resuspended at 2–4 × 106/ml in D-PBS supplemented with metabolic inhibitors (10 mm NaN3, 5 mm 2-deoxyglucose, and 2 mm NaF), and incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min to deplete cellular ATP. This treatment abolishes receptor-mediated endocytosis in HeLa cells (53Schmid S.L. Carter L.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and in L cells. 2E. S. Barton and T. S. Dermody, unpublished observation. For experiments in which neuraminidase-treated cells were used, 40 milliunits/ml neuraminidase were included with metabolic inhibitors, and incubations were extended to 1 h. Iodinated virus was diluted in D-PBS containing metabolic inhibitors and Complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals; final concentration 0.5× in all binding assays). Virus and cells were incubated in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes at room temperature for various intervals with continuous rotation. The viability of cells incubated in this manner was not diminished for up to 8 h as determined by trypan blue exclusion. At the lowest concentrations of virus used in these experiments, equilibrium was reached within 6 h, and cell-bound virus was stable for up to 8 h. Cell-bound virus was captured by vacuum filtration onto Membra-fil MF MB filters (5-μm pore size) (Whatman), followed by rinsing for 4 s with a stream of cold PBS. Filters were air-dried, and bound virus was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in 4 ml of BIOSAFE II fluid (Research Products International, Mt. Prospect, IL) using a Beckman LS6500 counter (Beckman Instruments). Nonspecific binding was determined at several concentrations of labeled virus by incubating duplicate samples in the presence of 0.8–1 × 1013 unlabeled virions, the maximum concentration of virus shown to compete virus without isotopic dilution. Nonspecific binding was found to be a linear function (ranging from 0.5 to 1%) of input cpm under all conditions used and did not increase with time. For competition experiments, iodinated and unlabeled virions were added simultaneously to cells. For experiments assessing the effect of SLL or Fabs on virus attachment, iodinated virions were preincubated with the indicated concentration of each reagent at 37 °C for 30 min. For kinetic assays, virus association (k on) and dissociation (k off) binding constants were derived from the observed rate of virus binding (k obs) over time using the formula,kobs=kon·[virus]+koffEquation 1 and by comparing k obs for each strain at multiple virus concentrations to exclude the contribution ofk off. This method permits the simultaneous determination of k on and indirect inference ofk off (52Limbird L.E. Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, MA1996: 61-122Google Scholar). Purified virions were diluted in gelatin saline or incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in PBS alone, 50 μg/ml G5 or 5C6 Fabs, or 10 mm SLL or lactose. Tissue culture medium was aspirated from cells (1 × 105/well in 24-well plates), and virus inoculum (150 μl) was allowed to adsorb to cells at room temperature. To terminate adsorption, cells were washed with 1 ml of cold PBS, inoculum was aspirated, and 1 ml of complete culture medium was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for various intervals, followed by two cycles of freezing and thawing to release progeny virions. Titers of infectious virus were quantitated by plaque assay on L cells (43Virgin H.W., IV Bassel-Duby R. Fields B.N. Tyler K.L. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4594-4604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlabeled, purified virions were preincubated in PBS alone, 50 μg/ml G5 or 5C6 Fabs, or 10 mm SLL or lactose at 37 °C for various intervals. To directly measure infectivity of treated virions, virus inocula were adsorbed to confluent HeLa cell monolayers (2 × 105 cells/well) as for growth experiments. Following incubation at 37 °C for 18 h to permit completion of a single round of viral replication, cell monolayers were fixed with 1 ml of methanol at −20 °C for a minimum of 30 min. Fixed monolayers were washed twice in PBS, blocked with 5% immunoglobin-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with protein A-affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-reovirus serum (54Wetzel J.D. Chappell J.D. Fogo A.B. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 299-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at a 1:800 dilution in PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100. Monolayers were washed twice in PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit goat Ig conjugated with Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Monolayers were washed twice, and infected cells were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Infected cells were identified by the presence of intense cytoplasmic fluorescence that was excluded from the nucleus. No background stain was noted on uninfected control monolayers. Reovirus antigen-positive cells were quantitated by counting fluorescent cells in three random fields of view per well at 100–400 × magnification. To dissect the contributions of discrete reovirus-receptor interactions to virus attachment and host cell infection, we used reassortant genetics to construct isogenic reovirus strains that differ only in the capacity to bind sialic acid. T3C44 is a T3 reovirus field isolate that does not bind sialic acid. This strain was adapted to sialic acid binding by serial passage in MEL cells, which only support replication of sialic acid-binding strains. The ς1-encoding S1 gene segment of the MEL-adapted variant (T3C44-MA) was sequenced and was found to possess a single coding mutation (Leu204 → Pro) in a region of the ς1 tail previously implicated in carbohydrate binding (38Chappell J.D. Gunn V.L. Wetzel J.D. Baer G.S. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since we thought it possible that additional mutations might have arisen in other gene segments during serial passage in MEL cells, we used reassortant genetics to place the S1 gene segments of T3C44 and T3C44-MA into the genetic background of T1L, a T1 strain that does not bind sialic acid (34Gentsch J.R. Pacitti A.F. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 356-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Chappell J.D. Gunn V.L. Wetzel J.D. Baer G.S. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following two successive rounds of coinfection and genetic screening, two viruses were isolated that contained the S1 gene of either T3C44 (strain SA−) or T3C44-MA (strain SA+), and all other gene segments from T1L (Fig. 1). Following reassortment, the S1 genes of both monoreassortant strains were sequenced and were found to contain no additional mutations (data not shown). To obtain a quantitative assessment of the avidity of SA− and SA+ for sialic acid, we utilized SPR to measure interactions between virions and sialic acid residues in real time in the absence of molecular labeling. The erythrocyte glycoprotein bound by T3 strains in hemagglutination assays is glycophorin A (55Paul R.W. Lee P.W.K. Virology. 1987; 159: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and treatment of glycophorin with neuraminidase to remove terminal sialic acid residues abrogates virus binding to this protein (37Dermody T.S. Nibert M.L. Bassel-Duby R. Fields B.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5173-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Chappell J.D. Duong J. Wright B.W. Dermody T.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8472-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We therefore used biotin/streptavidin chemistry to attach glycophorin and asialoglycophorin to an SPR detector chip and assessed the capacity of SA− and SA+ to bind to these surfaces. The asialoglycophorin-coated chip served as a reference surface to measure nonsialic acid-dependent interactions between virus and either glycophorin or the chip surface (49(1994) in BIAapplications Handbook, pp. 5-1–5-12, Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, SwedenGoogle Scholar, 50Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We found that SA− was incapable of binding to either glycophorin or the asialoglycophorin surface, while"

E, Hogue, M., Laperrière, A., Walker, P., and Bouvier, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 13727–13736). In the present study, we investigated the fate of those receptors that are retained intracellularly. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the disappearance of the receptor precursor form (M r 45,000) and of two smaller species (M r 42,000 and 39,000) is inhibited by the proteasome blocker, lactacystin. The treatment also promoted accumulation of the mature receptor form (M r55,000), indicating that the ER quality control actively routes a significant proportion of rescuable receptors for proteasome degradation. In addition, degradation intermediates that included full-length deglycosylated (M r 39,000) and ubiquitinated forms of the receptor were found to accumulate in the cytosol upon inhibition of proteasome function. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation experiments with the β-subunit of the Sec61 translocon complex revealed that the receptor precursor and its deglycosylated degradation intermediates interact with the translocon. Taken together, these results support a model in which misfolded or incompletely folded receptors are transported to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon, deglycosylated and conjugated with ubiquitin prior to degradation by the cytoplasmic 26 S proteasomes.

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Those that fail to fulfill these criteria are retained in the ER and subsequently degraded. Even minor changes in the protein primary structure can cause retention in the ER. This is exemplified in many diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cases of α1-antitrypsin deficiency and familial hypercholesterolemia, which are characterized by an “ER storage phenotype” (2Kim P.S. Arvan P. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 173-202PubMed Google Scholar). Although less thoroughly characterized, numerous naturally occurring mutations leading to ER retention of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have also been evoked as the cause of inherited diseases. For example, ER-retained mutants of rhodopsin, the luteinizing hormone receptor, and the V2-vasopressin receptor have been implicated in some forms of retinitis pigmentosa, male pseudohermaphroditism, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, respectively (3Sung C.-H.

Emerging evidence indicates that degradation of aberrant ER proteins is mediated by the cytosolic multiprotease complex, the 26 S proteasome. Indeed, an increasing number of misfolded or unassembled yeast and eukaryotic integral membrane and secreted proteins have been shown to be substrates for this disposal mechanism (7–26). However, proteasome-mediated degradation is not restricted to misfolded or unassembled proteins, as evidenced by the observation that some resident ER proteins are substrates for this degradation pathway in response to cellular signals (27McGee T.P.

It can thus be hypothesized that this degradation pathway might have a role in regulating steady state levels of normal wild type proteins traversing the secretory pathway, as has been described for many cytosolic and nuclear regulatory molecules (for review, see Refs. 30Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar and 31Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Reported examples pointing to this phenomenon are, however, scarce, exceptions being apolipoprotein B100 (32Fisher E.A.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 275-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosinase (35Halaban R. Cheng E. Zhang Y. Moellmann G. Hanlon D. Michalak M. Setaluri V. Hebert D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6210-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In a recent report, Schubert and co-workers (36Schubert U. Antón L.C. Gibbs J. Norbury C.C. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Nature. 2000; 404: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) showed that at least 30% of newly synthesized proteins might be degraded by the proteasomes. Whether these degraded proteins represent defective ribosomal products resulting from errors in translation, as suggested, or might also include correctly translated but incompletely folded proteins remains to be determined. Proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins is a well described phenomenon (for review, see Refs. 30Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar and 31Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), but the detailed mechanisms involved in the ER-associated proteasomal degradation remain unclear. Recent findings have led to the emergence of models suggesting that misfolded or incompletely folded ER proteins are retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane through the Sec61 translocon complex and conjugated with ubiquitin before hydrolysis by the 26 S proteasomes (for review, see Refs. 37Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 38Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

We have previously shown that the human δ opioid receptor (hδOR) is an example of integral membrane proteins that are partially retained in the ER, possibly due to difficulties in the folding process (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Another example is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (for review, see Ref. 41Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Only about 40% and 25% of the newly synthesized wild type hδOR and CFTR molecules, respectively, are able to leave the ER and reach the cell surface. We thus set out to determine whether the ER-retained hδORs are targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasomes and, if so, to delineate the mechanisms involved in this process. The results presented here indicate that these receptors are transported back to the cytosol, in a process that involves the Sec61 translocon, and deglycosylated before being degraded by the proteasomes. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasomal pathway led to the accumulation of ubiquitinated receptor forms, pointing to the fact that polyubiquitination may be a targeting signal for disposal of misfolded or incompletely folded hδOR molecules. EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (1175 Ci/mmol) and [9-3H]bremazocine (26.6 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Recombinant peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) of Flavobacterium meningosepticum, purified from Escherichia coli (EC3.5.1.52) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The proteasome inhibitors lactacystin, Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (MG-132) and Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-CHO (PSI) were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell culture reagents were either from Life Technologies Inc. or Wisent. The anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin, and the FLAG peptide were products of Sigma. The anti-calnexin (SPA-860), the anti-heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) (SPA-820), and the anti-ubiquitin (SPA-200) antibodies were from Stressgen BiotechnologiesCorp. and Protein G-Sepharose from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The anti-Sec61β antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Tom A. Rapoport (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). All the other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from various commercial suppliers. Cells were cultured in either 25-cm2 or 75-cm2 culture flasks and grown to 80–90% confluence at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Human embryonic kidney 293S (HEK-293S) cells stably expressing the hδOR tagged at the C terminus with the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J.

A clone expressing 10 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein was chosen for this study. For [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling, cells were first preincubated in methionine and cysteine-free DMEM for 60 min at 37 °C, and the labeling was performed in fresh medium containing 150 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine. After an incubation of 60 min at 37 °C, the pulse was terminated by washing the cells twice with the chase medium (complete DMEM supplemented with 5 mmmethionine) and chased for different periods of time as specified in the figures. When labeling was performed in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors, the reagents were added 3 h before the pulse labeling at a final concentration of 10 μm(lactacystin) or 25 μm (MG-132 and PSI). After the labeling, cells were washed with and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and, unless otherwise indicated, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Total cellular lysates were prepared in buffer A (0.5% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) (w/v), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min, and bovine serum albumin was added to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v). The receptor was immunoprecipitated using the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin as described (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For the Sec61β immunoprecipitation, DDM was replaced by digitonin while NaCl, EDTA, and 1,10-phenanthroline were omitted from the buffer. For the ubiquitin immunoprecipitation,N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was included in all buffers to distinguish the high molecular weight ubiquitinated receptor forms from putative aggregated receptors. Before immunoprecipitation of calnexin, Hsp70, Sec61β, and ubiquitin, samples were precleared for 60 min with 15 μl of Protein G-Sepharose. The appropriate antibody (dilutions: 1:200, 10 μg/ml, 1:100, and 1:100, respectively) and 15 μl of Protein G-Sepharose were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Following washing of the resin as described (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the bound antigens were eluted in SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min. If two or more consecutive immunoprecipitation steps were performed, the antigens were eluted with 1% (w/v) SDS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 95 °C for 5 min and the eluates diluted 10-fold with buffer A prior to the next immunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested and homogenized in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline) with a Dounce homogenizer (Fig. 3,A–C). Alternatively (Figs. 3 (D and E) and 4B), cells were homogenized by freezing and thawing the cell suspension and passing it 10 times through a 26-gauge needle. Fractionation was performed as described (42Wiertz E.J.H.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates were first centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the crude membranes, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to clarify the cytosolic fraction. DDM was added to the soluble fraction to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) to decrease nonspecific binding of proteins to either the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin or Protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were washed with buffer B, solubilized in buffer A, and insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. Immunoprecipitations from the soluble fraction and the solubilized membranes were carried out as described above. The immunoprecipitated receptors were deglycosylated following elution from the anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin with 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Before the enzyme reaction, the eluates were diluted 10-fold with 0.5% (w/v) DDM, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml STI, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. PNGase F was added at a final concentration of 0.01–10 units/ml, samples incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and the reaction terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed as described (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), using 4% stacking gels and 10% separating gels. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol and run on a Bio-Rad Mini-Protein II apparatus. Molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) were used to calibrate the gels. For the detection of radioactivity, the gels were treated with EN3HANCE® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, dried, and exposed at −80 °C for 1–15 days using Biomax MR film and intensifying screens (Eastman Kodak Co.). The relative intensities of the labeled bands on the fluorographs were analyzed by densitometric scanning with an Agfa Arcus II laser scanner, and the data were quantified using the NIH image program, version 1.61, subtracting the local background from each lane. Total protein was measured using the Bio-Rad DC assay kit and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Binding assays were carried out using [3H]bremazocine, essentially as described (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a large fraction of newly synthesized hδORs in HEK-293S cells remains in a pre-Golgi compartment as core-glycosylated M r45,000 precursors that are not transported to the cell surface (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M.

Now we set out to investigate the fate of these intracellularly retained receptors. To determine whether proteasomes are involved in the degradation of these receptor forms, cells were incubated with lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome (44Fenteany G.

HEK-293S cells stably expressing the receptor carrying a C-terminal FLAG epitope (HEK-293S-hδOR-FLAG cells) were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and after a chase in a medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine, cell lysates were prepared and the receptors isolated by immunoprecipitation (Fig.1). A major band ofM r 45,000 and two minor ones ofM r 42,000 and 39,000 were apparent in untreated cells at the end of the pulse (Fig. 1 A). During the subsequent chase, label incorporated into these bands decreased and a slower, more diffusely migrating band of M r55,000 appeared, representing the fully mature receptor (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). When the cells were treated with lactacystin, an increase in labeling of all receptor species was detected (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, proteasome inhibition significantly retarded the disappearance of theM r 45,000, 42,000, and 39,000 receptor species, the half-life of the last one being the most dramatically affected (Table I). Similar findings were obtained using two other proteasome inhibitors, the peptide aldehydes MG-132 and PSI (45Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest an active role of proteasomes in the elimination of newly synthesized hδORs. The fact that lactacystin promoted increase in receptor labeling, even within a shorter pulse period of 15 min, suggests that targeting to degradation begins very early, either cotranslationally or immediately after the receptor synthesis is complete. Inhibition of this rapid degradation is most likely responsible for the increase in the amount of mature receptors observed in pulse-chase labeling experiments (compare lanes 4 and 5 in Fig. 1, A and B). This increase was accompanied by a 38% increase in the number of [3H]bremazocine-binding sites detected. Our findings are not due to the presence of a FLAG-epitope tag at the C terminus of the receptor since the same results were also obtained using a receptor harboring the tag at its N terminus (data not shown). Unfortunately, the lack of a high affinity and selective antibody for the hδOR makes it impossible to carry out these experiments on the native untagged receptor.Table IHalf-lives of the hδOR species in the absence and presence of lactacystinReceptor speciesHalf-lifeUntreatedLactacystinMrmin45,000125 ± 11230 ± 49**42,00097 ± 7184 ± 29***39,00037 ± 2413 ± 88***Relative intensities of the labeled receptor species were quantified from fluorographs of pulse-chase experiments, an example of which is presented in Fig 1, by densitometric scanning.

We therefore assessed whether the smaller molecular weight receptor species of M r 42,000 and 39,000 represent deglycosylated receptors rather than proteolytic fragments. For this purpose, immunoprecipitated [35S]methionine/cysteine pulse-labeled samples were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation using PNGase F to remove the two N-linked glycans from the receptor (40Petäjä-Repo U.E Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 2(lane 5), complete deglycosylation of theM r 45,000 receptor precursor led to the appearance of a single species migrating at M r39,000. The fact that the M r 42,000 species was found to be an intermediate in the stepwise deglycosylation of the receptor precursor suggests that this species represents a receptor carrying one N-linked glycan. The mobility of theM r 39,000 species that was stabilized in lactacystin-treated cells was indistinguishable from that of the PNGase F-digested core-glycosylated M r 45,000 receptor form (Fig. 2, compare lanes 5–7), confirming the fact that this species represents an intact receptor polypeptide with noN-linked glycans. Protein translocation into the ER membrane and core glycosylation are believed to occur cotranslationally in mammalian cells (47Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar). Thus, it is very likely that theM r 39,000 receptor species represents a previously core-glycosylated receptor that has been deglycosylated and is an intermediate in the degradation pathway. To further verify the nature and the subcellular localization of theM r 39,000 hδOR species, fractionation of cellular homogenates was performed after metabolic labeling (Fig.3). Receptors were immunoprecipitated from four fractions: 1000 × g pellet containing cellular debris, nuclei and trapped soluble proteins, 10,000 ×g pellet containing crude membranes, 100,000 ×g pellet containing residual microsomal membranes, and 100,000 × g supernatant containing cytosolic proteins. As a control, the ER membrane protein, calnexin, and the cytosolic protein Hsp70 were immunoprecipitated from aliquots of the same four fractions. Calnexin was detected in the membrane fraction (Fig.3 B, lanes 3 and 4) but not in the cytosolic one (lanes 7 and 8), whereas the opposite was true for Hsp70 (Fig. 3 C). As expected, both proteins were also detected in the 1000 ×g pellet (Fig. 3, B and C,lanes 1 and 2). As can be seen in Fig.3A, in addition to be found in the membrane fraction, theM r 39,000 receptor species was recovered from the cytosolic fraction of lactacystin-treated (lane 8) but not of untreated cells (lane 7). This is in agreement with the notion that it represents an intermediate in the degradation pathway that would normally be broken down by the cytosolic proteasomes. Higher molecular weight bands forming a regularly spaced ladder, of which the smallest had an apparent molecular weight of 45,000, were also found in the cytosolic fraction of lactacystin-treated cells (Fig. 3 A,lane 8). This M r 45,000 species does not represent the core-glycosylated receptor precursor seen in Fig. 3 A (lanes 1–4), because PNGase F was not able to decrease its molecular weight (Fig.3 D, lanes 3 and 4). It is more likely that the ladder and the accompanying high molecular weight smear comprise polyubiquitinated forms of the M r39,000 receptor (see below). The fact that inhibition of proteasomal degradation significantly increased the amount of the M r 39,000 hδOR species in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7 and 8), suggests that this species may dislocate from the ER membrane and accumulate in the cytosol prior to proteasomal degradation. To test this hypothesis, receptors were immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction after pulse-chase labeling of lactacystin-treated cells. As seen in Fig. 3 E, a small amount of the M r 39,000 receptor species was present in the cytosol at the end of the pulse. However, the amount detected clearly increased during the chase, indicating that theM r 39,000 species originates from a pool of newly synthesized receptors that are retained in the ER and not from a failure or inefficiency of the translocation machinery. Thus, this species most likely results from deglycosylation of theM r 45,000 receptor precursor that is destined for degradation and eventually dislocates from the ER membrane. Removal of the N-linked glycans most likely occurs prior to retrotranslocation to the cytosol since the deglycosylated hδOR species was found both in the cytosolic and the membrane fractions (Fig. 3 A, lanes 8 and 4, respectively). To directly test the hypothesis that the hδOR is modified by ubiquitination, cellular lysates from [35S]methionine/cysteine pulse-labeled cells were subjected to sequential immunoprecipitation. First, the hδORs were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG M2 antibody and the purified material was denatured by SDS. Proteins were then reimmunoprecipitated using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. All these immunoprecipitation steps (Fig. 4, A and B) were carried out in the presence of NEM to prevent inappropriate aggregation of proteins. In lactacystin-treated cells, the immunoprecipitated material migrated as a high molecular weight smear that extended upwards toward the top of the gel (Fig. 4 A,lane 4), a feature that is characteristic of ubiquitinated proteins (8Ward C."
https://openalex.org/W2039348210,"Communication between mitochondria and the nucleus is important for a variety of cellular processes such as carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, mating and sporulation, and cell growth and morphogenesis. It has long been known that the functional state of mitochondria can influence nuclear gene expression. For example, in yeast cells lacking the mitochondrial genome, the expression of several nuclear genes, such as CIT2 (citrate synthase), MRP13 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein), and DLD3 (d-lactate dehydrogenase) has been reported to be altered. Here we show by microarray analysis of the genome-wide transcription profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that yeast petite mutants lacking mitochondrial DNA induce genes coding for mitochondrial proteins, enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and of the citric acid cycle, cell wall components, membrane transporters, and genes normally induced by nutrient deprivation and a variety of stresses. Consistent with the observed induction of genes related to cell stress and those encoding membrane transporters, yeast petite cells showed increased resistance to severe heat shock and exhibited a pleiotropic drug resistance phenotype. The observed changes in nuclear gene expression in cells lacking mitochondrial DNA may have implications for the role of mitochondria in processes such as carcinogenesis and aging."
https://openalex.org/W1977021135,"To examine the potential regulatory involvement of retroelements in the human genome, we screened the transcribed sequences of GenBankTM and expressed sequence tag data bases with long terminal repeat (LTR) elements derived from different human endogenous retroviruses. These screenings detected human transcripts containing LTRs belonging to the human endogenous retrovirus-E family fused to the apolipoprotein CI (apoC-I) and the endothelin B receptor (EBR) genes. However, both genes are known to have non-LTR (native) promoters. Initial reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed and authenticated the presence of transcripts from both the native and LTR promoters. Using a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends protocol, we showed that the alternative transcripts of apoC-I and EBR are initiated and promoted by the LTRs. The LTR-apoC-I fusion and native apoC-I transcripts are present in many of the tissues tested. As expected, we found apoC-I preferentially expressed in liver, where about 15% of the transcripts are derived from the LTR promoter. Transient transfections suggest that the expression is not dependent on the LTR itself, but the presence of the LTR increases activity of the apoC-I promoter from both humans and baboons. The native EBR-driven transcripts were also detected in many tissues, whereas the LTR-driven transcripts appear limited to placenta. In contrast to the LTR of apoC-I, the EBR LTR promotes a significant proportion of the total EBR transcripts, and transient transfection results indicate that the LTR acts as a strong promoter and enhancer in a placental cell line. This investigation reports two examples where LTR sequences contribute to increased transcription of human genes and illustrates the impact of mobile elements on gene and genome evolution.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Retroelements are found in most, if not all, species, where they have amplified to high copy numbers during evolution (2Boeke J.D. Stoye J.P. Coffin J. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 343-435Google Scholar). The sheer number of such mobile elements suggests that they affect the host genome, and several observations indicate that retroelements impact on the species in a number of ways by acting as insertional mutagens or contributing regulatory functions to genes (3Kidwell M.G. Lisch D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7704-7711Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). While transposable elements can be harmful to their host, the vast majority of transposable elements present in humans are derived from ancient transpositional events which are fixed in Old World primates. Potential long term effects of the majority of these elements must be either neutral or beneficial; otherwise they would be eliminated by selection. Human DNA contains essentially two classes of retrosequences, (i) the non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR)1 retroposons represented by LINE and Alu sequences, and (ii) the LTR retroelements in which the endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), solitary LTRs derived from ERVs, and other LTR-like sequences fall (4Smit A.F.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Human ERVs (HERVs) are classified into different families based on sequence similarity and monophyletic clustering (5Larsson E. Kato N. Cohen M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 148: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 6Tristem M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3715-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The thousands of ERVs and solitary LTRs that are present in human DNA are the result of infections and transposition events during primate evolution. Solitary LTRs are common features in the human genome, and they probably arose from a recombination event between the 5′ and 3′ LTR of a full-length provirus. Despite their evolutionary age, many ERVs are still transcriptionally active in human cells, where different ERV families show quite different sites and levels of transcription (7Wilkinson D. Mager D.L. Leong J.-A.C. Levy J. The Retroviridae. Plenum Press, New York1994: 465-535Crossref Google Scholar). The LTR and ERV elements are especially interesting in this regard, since they naturally possess enhancer, promoter, and polyadenylation functions within their LTRs, which probably accounts for differences in transcription of the various HERV families. Besides promoting transcription of retroviral genes, several studies have demonstrated that ERVs and LTRs can assume gene regulatory functions (8Britten R.J. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 205: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 9Sverdlov E.D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Brosius J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 115-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). For example, the paratoid-specific expression of amylase in humans is dependent and under control of an HERV-E element (11Ting C.N. Rosenberg M.P. Snow C.M. Samuelson L.C. Meisler M.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1457-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). HERV-E also appears to be involved in the expression of human pleiotrophin in placenta (12Schulte A.M. Lai S. Kurtz A. Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14759-14764Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that a HERV-K LTR encodes the last 67 amino acids of one form of the leptin receptor OBR (13Kapitonov V.V. Jurka J. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that an LTR insertion adjacent to or within a gene could have a variety of effects without destroying gene function. Such new insertions may alter tissue specific gene expression or enhance the general transcription levels of the gene, which could be selectively advantageous. We are using LTR sequences to study the involvement of retroelements in gene regulation. Specifically, we have searched the expressed sequence tag and transcribed subset of GenBankTM for chimeric retroviral gene sequences. Here, we report two human genes that are affected by ERV LTRs, the apolipoprotein C-I (apoC-I) gene and the endothelin B receptor (EBR) gene. We show that these two genes use a HERV-E LTR as an alternative promoter, demonstrate the presence of the chimeric transcripts in human tissues, and test the significance of the LTRs at the genomic loci of apoC-I and EBR. Reverse transcription was done with Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the same reaction conditions as described previously (14Medstrand P. Lindeskog M. Blomberg J. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2463-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using 0.1–0.5 volumes of each cDNA (0.1–0.5 μg of the initial RNA) per reaction. RNA samples were either obtained fromCLONTECH or prepared from different sections of placenta, as described previously (15Wilkinson D.A. Freeman J.D. Goodchild N.L. Kelleher C.A. Mager D.L. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2157-2167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following primers were used to detect the different transcript forms shown in Fig. 2 (see Table I for primer sequences): LTR-apoC-I fusion transcript, primers APO-LTR1/APO-Ex1; native apoC-I transcript, primers APO-N/APO-Ex1; LTR-EBR fusion transcript, primers EBR-L1/EBR-Ex1; native EBR transcript, primers EBR-N/EBR-Ex1. Amplification was done by using 0.5 volumes of cDNA (see above) with the following cycling profile: one initial incubation of 95 °C for 1 min followed by 35 cycles (for the apoC-I amplifications) or 30 cycles (for the EBR amplifications) of 95 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and one final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. In the semiquantitative RT-PCR of different EBR transcript forms (Fig. 5), the following primer combinations were used: LTR-EBR fusion transcript, primers EBR-L1/EBR-Ex2; native EBR transcript, primers EBR-N/EBR-Ex2; total EBR transcript, primers EBR-Ex3/EBR-Ex2. In these experiments, 0.15 volumes cDNA was used in the same PCR profile as described above but with lower cycling (25–28 cycles) to avoid saturation effects during the amplification.

The first PCR amplification was performed using EBR exon-specific primer (Table I) EBR-ex4 and the AP1 primer (provided by the supplier) and with the apoC-I primer APO-ex1 and primer AP1. The nested PCR was performed by EBR primer EBR-ex5 and the AP2 primer (provided by the supplier) and with the apoC-I primer APO-ex2 and AP2. The following temperature profile was used for all amplifications: one initial denaturing at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 68 °C for 4 min. The 5′-RACE products were cloned using the pGEM-T vector system I (Promega). Clones were selected for sequencing after hybridization using retrovirus-specific oligonucleotides APO-LTR1 and EBR-L1 (Table I). The oligonucleotide primer APO-ex3, complementary to exon 3 of apoC-I, was radiolabeled with γ-32P, and 1.2 × 106 dpm of the labeled primer was incubated with 5 μg of total RNA in a 10-μl solution containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 61 °C for 20 min. The samples were then transferred to ice, and 300 units of Superscript II and 15 units of RNase inhibitor were added to the reaction and adjusted to a volume of 20 μl with a final concentration of 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 mm dNTPs. The primer extension reaction was performed by incubating samples at 25 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 50 min, and 95 °C for 10 min. The reaction products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and visualized by exposing to x-ray film at −70 °C. The intensity of the extension products were measured using the ImageQuant software after incubation on PhosphorImager plates (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Locus specific PCR was performed essentially as described previously (16Medstrand P. Mager D.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA prepared from marmoset (New World Monkey), baboon (Old World Monkey), gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, chimpanzee, and human cell lines (17Goodchild N.L. Wilkinson D.A. Mager D.L.

Primers APO-P1 (5′-GGTTTTTACAGTGTCATCCAGCT-3′)/APO-P2 (5′- GATTCAGGTTGGTGCTGAGTG-3′) were used to detect the presence or absence of the solitary LTR in the apoC-I locus of different primates. The LTR upstream of the EBR locus was amplified by primer EBR-F1 (5′-AACATCCTCTGTCTCTCTCC-3′; sequence flanking the LTR integration) and primer EBR-LTR1 (5′-GATCGACCCCTGACCTAACC-3′; sequence from the LTR). The apoC-I and EBR primers were specified from GenBankTMaccession numbers AB012576 and AL139002, respectively. The 5′-flanking regions of apoC-I and EBR were amplified from human genomic DNA and subcloned upstream of the luciferase gene in the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3B (Promega). To facilitate directional cloning into pGL3B, primers were designed with terminal sequences specific for restriction enzyme recognition. The restriction enzyme adaptor is indicated after each primer (see below), where the following suffixes are used: K,KpnI; B, BglII; Ba, BamHI; X,XbaI; Xh, XhoI. The numbers in parenthesis after each primer indicate the start and end positions of the primer upstream in the flanking DNA sequence, relative to the first nucleotide of the initiation codon of the two genes. The primer sequences are available upon request. Because the exact distances of the EBR LTR and the hepatic control region (HCR) to EBR and apoC-I are uncertain, the primer sequences used to amplify the EBR LTR and the HCR are shown below, where primer sequence in lowercase type indicates the restriction enzyme recognition sequence. The following EBR constructs were made. For pEBR-NP, the 5′-flanking region of the native EBR transcription initiation site was isolated using primers EBR-NP1K (−1259/−1239) and EBR-NP2B (−208/−187). Digested and purified amplification products were inserted intoKpnI/BglII-digested pGL3B. For pEBR-LTR, the complete LTR was amplified with primers EBR-LTR1K (5′-ggggtaccTAAGGGAGGATACCACC-3′)/EBR-LTR2B (5′-GCAGCTTCTCCTGCTACAagatcttc-3′) and inserted intoKpnI/BglII-digested pGL3B. pEBR-NP+LTR-S and pEBR-NP+LTR-A were made by introducing the LTR at a distance of the native promoter region of construct pEBR-NP. The full LTR was amplified with LTR-specific primers, EBR-LTR1Ba (5′-cgggatccTAAGGGAGGATACCACC-3′)/EBR-LTR2Ba (5′-GCAGCTTCTCCTGCTACAggatcccg-3′). Purified andBamHI-digested amplification products were introduced into the BamHI site of construct pEBR-NP, which is located 2 kb from the KpnI/BglII site on pGL3B. Constructs introduced either in sense (LTR-S) or antisense (LTR-A) with respect to the native EBR promoter region were isolated. The location of the primers was based on the initiation codon at position 1260 of GenBankTM accession number D13162. The LTR primers were derived from GenBankTM accession number AL139002. The following apoC-I constructs were made. For pAPO-P, the 5′-flanking region of the apoC-I transcription initiation site was isolated using primers APO-P1K (−1271/−1249)/APO-P2B (−165/−145) and inserted intoKpnI/BglII-digested pGL3B. This construct contains both the native and LTR promoter regions. For pAPO-LTR, the complete LTR of the apoC-I locus was amplified with primers APO-LTR1K (−920/−901)/APO-LTR2B (−484/−465) and introduced in theKpnI/BglII site of pGL3B. For pAPO-P-noLTR, the LTR was removed from the apoC-I locus by amplifying the non-LTR parts of pAPO-P with primers APO-P1K (−1271/−1249)/APO-P3X (−941/−924) and APO-P4X (−455/−439)/APO-P2B (−165/−145). The two amplification products were digested with XbaI, ligated together, and introduced after KpnI/BglII digestion into pGL3B. This construct has the same structure as the pAPO-P except that the LTR is absent. pAPO-P-noLTR+LTR-S and pAPO-P-noLTR+LTR-A were made by introducing the LTR at a distance of the native apoC-I promoter region lacking the LTR (construct pAPO-P-noLTR). The full LTR was amplified with LTR-specific primers, APO-LTR1Ba (−920/−901)/APO-LTR2Ba (−484/−465). Purified andBamHI-digested amplification products were introduced into the BamHI site of construct pAPO-P-noLTR. Constructs introduced either in sense (LTR-S) or antisense (LTR-A) with respect to the apoC-I promoter region were isolated. The location of the primers is with respect to the apoC-I initiation codon at position 27457 of GenBankTM accession number AB012576. The following baboon apoC-I constructs were made. For pBAPO-P, the baboon apoC-I locus was amplified from baboon genomic DNA with primers APO-P1K (−782/−760)/APO-P2B (−160/−140) and inserted intoKpnI/BglII-digested pGL3B. For pBAPO-P+LTR, construct pBAPO-P was amplified with primers APO-P1K (−782/−760)/APO-P5Ba (−463/−444) and APO-P6Ba (−435/−414)/APO-P2B (−160/−140). The two amplification products were digested with BamHI and ligated together. This religated fragment was inserted into pGEM-T (construct pBAPO-GEM). The LTR that was amplified with primers APO-LTR1Ba/APO-LTR2Ba (see above) was introduced into the BamHI site of pBAPO-GEM. After selection of LTR-positive clones, the KpnI/BglII cassette (containing the LTR in the baboon apoC-I at the same orthologous site as in humans) was subcloned into pGL3B. Positions of the primers are from GenBankTM accession number L13176 and with respect to the initiation codon of the baboon apoC-I at position 1017. The HCR was isolated from human DNA using PCR and primers HCR1Xh (5′-ccgctcgagTTAGAGAACAGAGCTGCAGGCT-3′) and HCR2Xh (5′-ATGCCCCGACCCCGAAGCctcgagcgg-3′). The primer sequences were derived from positions 36815–36836, and positions 37201–37218 of GenBankTM accession number AF050154, respectively. The PCR product was digested with XhoI, and the purified fragment was introduced into the pGL3B SalI site of all apoC-I constructs, which is 3′ to the luciferase gene. Plasmid DNA was purified by using the Qiagen plasmid midi kit (Qiagen) prior to transfections. HepG2 (human hepatoblastoma cells; ATCC HB-8065) cells were cultured in Dulbeccos's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to transfections in six-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. Transient transfections of HepG2 were done by cotransfecting 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 50 ng of pRL-TK vector (Promega) using calcium phosphate (Cellphect; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in the protocol supplied with the reagent. JEG-3 cells (human choriocarcinoma; ATCC HTB-36) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. JEG-3 cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and cotransfected 24 h later with 1.0 μg of plasmid DNA and 200 ng of pRL-TK using 7 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described in the protocol from the supplier. After 24 h, the cells were lysed, and the luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and normalized to the internal control. Transfections were performed in triplicates and repeated at least twice. Double-stranded plasmid DNAs were sequenced using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit and an ABI 373 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Using the strategy outlined in Fig.1, we searched GenBankTM and the human expressed sequence tag data bases using the LTR and the leader region of published HERV elements (7Wilkinson D. Mager D.L. Leong J.-A.C. Levy J. The Retroviridae. Plenum Press, New York1994: 465-535Crossref Google Scholar). Transcripts with only the U3-R part of the LTR and no other HERV sequence probably represent mRNA polyadenylated by the LTR, whereas transcripts with R-U5 or R-U5-leader probably represent promotion by an LTR. During data base screenings, we encountered two transcripts where HERV-E (18Repaske R. Steele P.E. O'Neill R.R. Rabson A.B. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 764-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) sequences were fused to the EBR gene (accession number D90402) and the apoC-I gene (accession number W79313). The structure of these transcripts suggests that the EBR utilizes the splice donor (SD) in the leader region of the HERV element, which is located downstream of the 5′ LTR (Fig. 1) of an integrated provirus. The same SD is used in subgenomic splicing of HERV-E envelope transcripts, suggesting that this represents the original SD of HERV-E (19Rabson A.B. Hamagishi Y. Steele P.E. Tykocinski M. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 176-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The apoC-I fusion transcript represents another possible LTR-driven transcript type, which is derived from a solitary LTR and reads into the flanking non-HERV region. To authenticate the presence of fusion transcripts, we synthesized primers corresponding to the retroviral and the gene-specific regions of the identified transcripts. By using this primer combination in RT-PCR, it is possible to detect the presence and the relative abundance of the fusion transcripts in human tissues. Both of the genes were previously reported as having a different promoter region, separated from the retroviral LTR (20Lauer S.J. Walker D. Elshourbagy N.A. Reardon C.A. Levy-Wilson B. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7277-7286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Nakamuta M. Takayanagi R. Sakai Y. Sakamoto S. Hagiwara H. Mizuno T. Saito Y. Hirose S. Yamamoto M. Nawata H. Biochem.

We will refer to these two regions as the “native” apoC-I and EBR promoter. To detect any biases of the LTR and native transcripts, we also used a primer unique to transcripts of the native promoters of the two genes. Results of the RT-PCR on a panel of RNAs derived from different human tissues are shown in Fig. 2. The LTR-promoted EBR transcript is restricted to placenta, where its levels appear comparable with that of the widely expressed native transcript (Fig.2 B). In the case of apoC-I, transcripts from the native promoter in liver were high as expected (20Lauer S.J. Walker D. Elshourbagy N.A. Reardon C.A. Levy-Wilson B. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7277-7286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but are also detectable by PCR in many of the other RNAs tested (Fig. 2 A). Transcripts from the solitary LTR were detected in two distinct forms (see Fig.3 A), both of which were also detected in many tissues. The result of this experiment clearly demonstrates the presence of fusion transcripts between LTRs of HERV-E and the genes for EBR and apoC-I. The LTRs at the EBR and apoC-I loci vary in their tissue specificity, with the EBR LTR being much more restricted in activity. Sequencing of the PCR products verified the nature of the fusion transcripts, where the two fusion transcript forms of apoC-I are the result of differential splicing in the 5′ UTR (Fig.3). To confirm that the apoC-I and EBR fusion transcripts initiate within the LTRs and do not represent transcripts from a promoter located upstream of the LTRs, we isolated the 5′-ends of both LTR fusion gene transcripts. Using a 5′-RACE protocol, we established that both the apoC-I and EBR fusion transcript initiate within their LTRs (see below and Fig. 3). Sequencing of several 5′-RACE clones showed that the apoC-I and EBR initiation site is located downstream of a previously reported TATA box of HERV-E (18Repaske R. Steele P.E. O'Neill R.R. Rabson A.B. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 764-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rabson A.B. Hamagishi Y. Steele P.E. Tykocinski M. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 176-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the TATA also used by other HERV-E proviruses because a full-length transcribed HERV-E element (GenBankTM accession number M74509) starts 2 bp downstream of the initiation site of the apoC-I LTR. In the case of the EBR fusion transcript, the sequence representing the longest 5′-UTR also began within the LTR, but at a position 3′ (90 bp) to the apoC-I initiation site. Both the apoC-I and EBR genomic loci were partially characterized at the time of our initial studies. The only retroviral remnant of the original proviral insertion at the apoC-I locus is a solitary LTR, which is located 300 bp upstream of the native apoC-I promoter. The two initiation sites are separated by 390 bp, where the initiation sites of the native and LTR promoters are located 180 and 575 bp upstream of the apoC-I initiation codon, respectively (Fig. 3). The EBR LTR was not present in the reported 2-kb sequence upstream of the EBR native promoter (GenBankTM accession D13162), which is located ∼250 bp upstream of the EBR initiation codon (21Nakamuta M. Takayanagi R. Sakai Y. Sakamoto S. Hagiwara H. Mizuno T. Saito Y. Hirose S. Yamamoto M. Nawata H. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1991; 177: 34-39Google Scholar, 22Ogawa Y. Nakao K. Arai H. Nakagawa O. Hosoda K. Suga S. Nakanishi S. Imura H. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1991; 178: 248-255Google Scholar). A genomic clone containing both the HERV-E proviral element and the EBR genomic locus was recently deposited in GenBankTM (accession numberAL139002). The sequence of this clone is in a preliminary state of annotation and contains unordered pieces of DNA. The parts of the LTR and leader region that were identified in EBR 5′-RACE (see above) are identical to the proviral element of AL139002. It has been previously reported that several other alternative transcripts (named EDNRBΔ) are created by initiation 560 and 940 bp upstream of the ATG codon and alternative splicing of the 5′-UTR (23Tsutsumi M. Liang G. Jones P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 5′ LTR leader of the HERV-E element is located over 20 kb from the EBR gene and is joined by splicing to the same splice acceptor in the 5′-UTR as are the spliced EDNRBΔ transcripts. The genomic organization and the structures of the different transcripts at these two loci are shown in Fig. 3. Due to the retroviral sequence, the fusion transcripts have partially different 5′-UTRs compared with the native forms, but all maintain the same apoC-I and EBR coding regions. Using primers flanking the integration sites of the LTRs in PCR of different primate DNAs, we earlier assigned the time of integration of various HERV-K elements during primate evolution (16Medstrand P. Mager D.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9782-9787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same approach, we were able to determine when the two HERV-E LTRs integrated in the primate lineage. The apoC-I LTR was detected in all hominoids, whereas Old and New World monkeys did not have this LTR integrated in the apoC-I locus,"
https://openalex.org/W1976030780,"Wzc proteins are tyrosine autokinases. They are found in some important bacterial pathogens of humans and livestock as well as plant-associated bacteria, and are often encoded within gene clusters determining synthesis and assembly of capsular and extracellular polysaccharides. Autophosphorylation of Wzc(cps) is essential for assembly of the serotype K30 group 1 capsule in Escherichia coli O9a:K30, although a genetically unlinked Wzc(cps)-homologue (Etk) can also participate with low efficiency. While autophosphorylation of Wzc(cps) is required for assembly of high molecular weight K30 capsular polysaccharide, it is not essential for either the synthesis of the K30 repeat units or for activity of the K30 polymerase enzyme. Paradoxically, the cognate phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase for Wzc(cps), Wzb(cps), is also required for capsule expression. The tyrosine-rich domain at the C terminus of Wzc(cps) was identified as the site of phosphorylation and autophosphorylation of Wzc requires a functional Walker A motif. Intermolecular transphosphorylation of Wzc(cps) was detected in strains expressing a combination of mutant Wzc(cps) derivatives. The N- and C-terminal domains of Wzc(cps) were expressed independently to mimic the situation found naturally in Gram-positive bacteria. In this format, both domains were required for phosphorylation of the Wzc(cps) C terminus, and for capsule assembly. Regulation by a post-translational phosphorylation event represents a new dimension in the assembly of bacterial cell-surface polysaccharides."

In these studies, we focused on the role of caspase activation and mitochondrial disruption in 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) in vitro. The effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on MCF-7 cells was compared with that of tumor necrosis factor α, which induces apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway. Our major findings are that 1α,25(OH)2D3 induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by disruption of mitochondrial function, which is associated with Bax translocation to mitochondria, cytochrome c release, and production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, we show that Bax translocation and mitochondrial disruption do not occur after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment of a MCF-7 cell clone selected for resistance to 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis. These mitochondrial effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 do not require caspase activation, since they are not blocked by the cell-permeable caspase inhibitor z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone. Although caspase inhibition blocks 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated events downstream of mitochondria such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, external display of phosphatidylserine, and DNA fragmentation, MCF-7 cells still execute apoptosis in the presence of z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, indicating that the commitment to 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated cell death is caspase-independent.

Flanagan L. Binderup L. Tenniswood M. Welsh J. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A variety of synthetic vitamin D3 analogs that induce mammary tumor regression in animals are now undergoing clinical trials in human patients (2Gulliford T. English J. Colston K.W. Menday P.

Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 2273-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown that 1α,25(OH)2D3 induces morphological and biochemical markers of apoptosis (chromatin and nuclear matrix condensation, and DNA fragmentation) in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) (4Simboli-Campbell M. Narvaez C.J. Tenniswood M. Welsh J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,5Welsh J. VanWeelden K. Flanagan L. Byrne I. Nolan E. Narvaez C.J. Subcell. Biochem. 1998; 30: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, the precise mechanism by which 1α,25(OH)2D3 and the VDR mediate apoptosis is poorly understood. To characterize the mechanisms of 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells, we compared specific intracellular events in MCF-7 cells after treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). TNFα was chosen as a positive control since this cytokine induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by a well defined pathway triggered by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), a cell surface death receptor. Death receptors contain homologous cytoplasmic regions termed “death domains,” which transmit apoptotic signals through recruitment of adaptor molecules that activate caspases, a family of cysteine proteases involved in cell disassembly. The best characterized death receptors (Fas, TNFR1) use Fas-associated death domain and TNFR1-associated death domain adaptors to recruit and activate caspase-8 (6Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Cleavage of specific substrates by caspases during apoptosis promotes the degradation of key structural proteins, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and lead to external display of phosphatidylserine (PS), DNA fragmentation, and cellular condensation (7Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a central role in commitment of cells to apoptosis via increased permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane, decreased transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome cand apoptosis-inducing factor, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, can block these mitochondrial events, whereas pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bax, can trigger these changes. For example, apoptotic signals induce conformational changes in Bax, which lead to exposure of the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain, and translocation to the mitochondria (10Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The effects of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members are achieved by both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms (11Fitch M.E. Chang C.M. Parslow T.G. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 338-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,12Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Although the role of caspases in apoptosis triggered by cell surface death receptors such as TNFR1 has been well established, it is not clear if apoptosis triggered by nuclear receptors such as the VDR is mediated via similar caspase-dependent pathways. To probe the mechanisms whereby vitamin D3 signaling modulates apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, we studied the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on mitochondrial function and caspase activity using a cell-permeable inhibitor of caspase-related proteases (z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, zVAD.fmk). In addition, the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and TNFα on a vitamin D3-resistant variant of MCF-7 cells (MCF-7D3Res cells) were examined to identify events that contribute to vitamin D3 resistance (13Narvaez C.J. Vanweelden K. Byrne I. Welsh J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Narvaez C.J. Welsh J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4690-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The MCF-7D3Res cells do not undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3; however, these cells retain sensitivity to other inducers of apoptosis such as TNFα and anti-estrogens (13Narvaez C.J. Vanweelden K. Byrne I. Welsh J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that, although caspase inhibition can block some of the late stages of 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, the commitment to cell death is caspase-independent. These data implicate Bax distribution and mitochondrial disruption as critical caspase-independent events in 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis of breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells (originally obtained from ATCC) were used to generate the vitamin D3-resistant variant (MCF-7D3Res) that has been described previously (13Narvaez C.J. Vanweelden K. Byrne I. Welsh J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 25 mm HEPES and 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were routinely plated at 5000 cells/cm2 and passaged every 3–4 days. Stock cultures of MCF-7D3Res cells were routinely grown in medium containing 100 nm1α,25(OH)2D3 (kindly provided by LEO Pharmaceuticals, Ballerup, Denmark). For experiments, MCF-7 and MCF-7D3Res cells were plated in α-minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics, and treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or ethanol vehicle 2 days after plating. Parallel cultures were treated with TNFα (Sigma) 2–3 days before scheduled harvest of 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated dishes. Caspase inhibitors, zVAD.fmk or zDEVD.fmk (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) were added at the same time (1α,25(OH)2D3or TNFα) or 2 days after (1α,25(OH)2D3) initial treatment. For cell growth assays, cells were seeded at 1000 cells/well in 24-well plates, treated for the indicated times, and analyzed by crystal violet assay. Briefly, cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min, incubated with 0.1% crystal violet (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for 30 min, destained with H2O, and solubilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Absorbance at 562 nm (minus background at 630 nm) was determined on a microtiter plate reader. MCF-7 cells were incubated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 for 6 days or TNFα for 1 day in the presence or absence of 25 μm zVAD.fmk. For 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment, medium was replaced every 2 days. After treatments, cells were trypsinized, media and washes were pooled, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh medium. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5, 50, 500, and 2500 cells/well in 24 replicates. After 14 days, the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet as described above, and clonogenic potential was estimated by counting positive wells (15Amarante-Mendes G.P. Finucane D.M.

Cells were trypsinized, pooled together with media and washes containing floating cells, and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended with 3 volumes of Buffer A (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors), lysed with a Dounce homogenizer, and fractionated by differential centrifugation (16Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates were centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in Buffer A, sonicated 2 × 10 s, and stored at −80 °C in multiple aliquots. The supernatants were combined and further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resultant mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in Buffer A, sonicated, and stored at −80 °C in multiple aliquots. The supernatant from the 10,000 × g spin was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was designated S100 (containing cytosol) and stored at −80 °C in multiple aliquots. Protein concentrations were determined by the Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce). Subcellular fractions isolated as described above were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins derived from mitochondria and/or S100 extracts were immunoblotted with Bax rabbit polyclonal (13666E; PharMingen, San Diego, CA) or cytochromec mouse monoclonal antibodies (7H8.2C12; PharMingen) diluted 1:500 or 1:250, respectively, in PBS plus 5% skim milk. S100 extracts were also probed with cytochrome oxidase subunit II mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 12C4-F12; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to exclude mitochondrial contamination. Nuclear extracts were probed with PARP mouse monoclonal antibody (C2.10, Enzyme Systems Products) diluted 1:1000. Specific antibody binding was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:5000 in PBS, 5% skim milk, 0.1% Tween 20 and autoradiography with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). MCF-7 cells grown on Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Fisher Scientific) were treated with ethanol vehicle, 100 nm 1α,25(OH)2D3, or 2.5 ng/ml TNFα for 96 h (ethanol, 1α,25(OH)2D3) or 48 h (TNFα) in the presence or absence of 25 μmzVAD.fmk. The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, permeabilized in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min, and blocked overnight with PBS plus 1% BSA containing 0.02% sodium azide. The slides were then incubated with cytochrome cmouse monoclonal antibody (6H2.B4; PharMingen), diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer, for 3 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Slides were washed three times for 5 min each time with PBS, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-488 (a photostable dye with spectral properties similar to fluorescein; Molecular Probes) diluted 1:50 in blocking buffer. Slides were washed three times for 5 min with PBS, incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma), washed five times for 5 min with PBS, rinsed with distilled H2O, and coverslips were applied with an antifade reagent. Fluorescence was detected using an Olympus AX70 microscope equipped with a Spot RT digital camera. For analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species, cells harvested by trypsinization were pooled with media plus washes and pelleted by centrifugation. Cell suspensions (1 × 106 cells) were incubated with 1 μm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 130 mm KCl to abolish the plasma membrane potential. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, cells were washed once in PBS and then analyzed for TMRE red fluorescence by flow cytometry. Live cells rapidly and reversibly take up TMRE, and accumulation of the dye in mitochondria has been shown to be potential driven (17Ehrenberg B. Montana V. Wei M. Wuskell J. Loew L. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). For analysis of ROS, cell suspensions (5 × 105 cells) were incubated with 4 μmhydroethidine (HE, Molecular Probes) in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C, and conversion of HE to ethidium by superoxide anion was analyzed by flow cytometry. For analysis of DNA fragmentation, MCF-7 cells were harvested by trypsinization, collected by centrifugation, fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized in 70% EtOH at −20 °C. DNA strand breaks in cells undergoing apoptosis were indirectly labeled with bromodeoxyuridine by terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and detected by FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody to bromodeoxyuridine using the APO-BRDU kit according to manufacturer's protocol (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Cells were counterstained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) containing RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for detection of total DNA, and two-color analysis of DNA strand breaks and cell cycle was achieved by flow cytometry. For detection of PS externalization, 1 × 106 cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μg/ml annexin V-FITC (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and 5 μg/ml PI in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in binding buffer, fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min on ice, and then washed two more times in PBS plus 0.2% BSA. Pellets were resuspended in PBS plus 0.2% BSA and analyzed by flow cytometry. There were less than 1% PI+ cells in the population, and they were therefore excluded from analysis. All flow cytometric analyses were performed on an Epics XL Flow Cytometer (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL) equipped with an argon laser. TMRE and HE were analyzed on FL3 using a 620-nm band pass filter. For DNA fragmentation analysis, FITC was analyzed on FL1 using a 520-nm band pass filter and PI was analyzed on FL3 with no color compensation. For PS externalization, annexin V-FITC was analyzed on FL1 and PI was analyzed on FL2 (580-nm band pass filter) using software color compensation. Data was modeled with the Multiplus AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems). Caspase activity was analyzed with the ApoAlert CPP32/caspase-3 assay kit according to manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, after harvesting by trypsinization, 2 × 106 cells were pelleted and stored at −20 °C. For analysis, cell pellets were lysed, re-pelleted to remove cell debris, and supernatants were incubated with 50 μm DEVD-AFC for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation = 380 nm and emission = 508 nm. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance was used to assess statistical significance between means. Differences between means were considered significant if p values less than 0.05 were obtained with the Bonferroni method using GraphPad Instat software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). To identify specific intracellular events involved in 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis, we examined the signaling pathway downstream of the VDR in MCF-7 cells. Since disruption of mitochondrial function is a primary event in apoptosis that can be triggered by translocation of Bax to mitochondrial outer membrane, we first examined the subcellular distribution of Bax after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment of MCF-7 cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, Bax redistribution from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial fraction occurred after treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or TNFα in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1, top). Not only was Bax translocated to mitochondria, but both 1α,25(OH)2D3- and TNFα-treated cells exhibited cleavage of Bax from the intact 21-kDa protein to an 18-kDa fragment, an observation that is consistent with reports of Bax cleavage during drug-induced apoptosis (18Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In both 1α,25(OH)2D3- and TNFα-treated cells, the Bax cleavage product was detected in mitochondrial, but not cytosolic, fractions, and others have proposed that Bax cleavage enhances homodimerization and its pro-apoptotic properties (19Wood D.E. Newcomb E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These are the first data to implicate translocation and cleavage of Bax during 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced apoptosis. To determine the relationship between Bax translocation and sensitivity to 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced apoptosis, we examined the subcellular distribution of Bax in a vitamin D3-resistant variant of MCF-7 cells, which does not undergo apoptosis after treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3but retains sensitivity to other triggers, including TNFα. 2C. J. Narvaez and J. Welsh, unpublished data. In the MCF-7D3Res cells, 1α,25(OH)2D3did not induce translocation or cleavage of Bax (Fig. 1,bottom). However, in these cells, Bax translocation and cleavage was triggered by TNFα, indicating that Bax functions appropriately in MCF-7D3Res cells during apoptosis induced by agents other than 1α,25(OH)2D3. The inability of Bax to redistribute to mitochondria in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 in the vitamin D3-resistant variant suggests that Bax translocation may be a critical initiating event in 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Translocation of Bax to mitochondria has been associated with release of cytochrome c, an event that is considered a commitment point for activation of apoptosis. As expected for viable cultures, no cytochrome c was detected in cytosolic fractions from MCF-7 cells treated with ethanol vehicle for up to 120 h (Fig.2 A). In contrast, redistribution of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol was detected within 48 h of 1α,25(OH)2D3treatment in MCF-7 cells, before any morphological apoptotic features were detected. The absence of cytochrome oxidase in cytosolic fractions confirmed that extracts were free of mitochondrial contamination (data not shown). In MCF-7D3Res cells, 1α,25(OH)2D3 did not trigger release of cytochrome c; however, cytochrome c was detected in cytosolic fractions after TNFα treatment of both MCF-7 and MCF-7D3Res cell lines (Fig. 2 B; see also Fig.7).Figure 7Effects of caspase inhibitor on cytochromec release, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ROS production after treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or TNFα in MCF-7 cells.

S100 extracts prepared from cells treated as described in Fig. 4 were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with cytochrome c (7H8.2C12) mouse monoclonal antibody.B, mitochondrial membrane potential.

The results (A andB) are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Long term exclusion of cytochrome c from the electron transport chain can lead to impairment of proton flow and generation of ROS due to incomplete reduction of molecular oxygen. Hence, mitochondrial generation of ROS in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 and TNFα was examined by flow cytometry. Production of superoxide anion was indirectly assessed as oxidation of hydroethidine to ethidium, which fluoresces red upon DNA intercalation. As presented in Fig. 3, ROS production was enhanced by 1α,25(OH)2D3in MCF-7, but not MCF-7D3Rescells, whereas TNFα increased ROS production comparably in both cell lines. Time-course studies have demonstrated that ROS production is enhanced within 72 h of 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). Cytochrome creleased into the cytosol is thought to trigger caspase activation downstream of mitochondria through binding to Apaf-1 and autoactivation of procaspase-9. Activated caspase-9 can activate additional effector caspases responsible for cell disassembly and events such as PS externalization, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation. To determine the involvement of caspase-dependent proteolysis in 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis, we examined whether a broad spectrum cell-permeable caspase inhibitor (zVAD.fmk) could abrogate the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 cells. Proteolytic activity associated with caspase activation was analyzed by three distinct methods: cleavage of an endogenous caspase substrate (PARP), and flow cytometric analysis of PS exposure and DNA fragmentation, which others have shown are provoked by caspases (7Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6112) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 4 A, PARP was cleaved after treatment of MCF-7 cells with either 1α,25(OH)2D3 or TNFα, and in both cases, cleavage was blocked by zVAD.fmk. Furthermore, both 1α,25OH)2D3 and TNFα induced PS externalization, which was also completely blocked by zVAD.fmk (Fig.4 B). Finally, the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and TNFα on DNA fragmentation was assessed as terminal transferase-mediated incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, detected by FITC-conjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment of MCF-7 cells induced DNA fragmentation primarily in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with only a small population of cells (5%) accumulating in sub-G1. TNFα treatment induced extensive DNA fragmentation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, with accumulation of 29% of the population in sub-G1. Despite the differences in the magnitude and profiles of DNA fragmentation between 1α,25(OH)2D3- and TNFα-treated cells, zVAD.fmk completely blocked DNA fragmentation induced by both agents.Figure 5Effect of caspase inhibitor on DNA fragmentation after treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or TNFα in MCF-7 cells. Cells were plated and treated as described in Fig. 4, and DNA fragmentation was determined by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) DEVDase cleavage activity was measured with the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AFC, which can detect activity of caspases-3 and -7. Since MCF-7 cells do not express functional caspase-3 (data not shown, Ref. 20Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar), any DEVDase activity detected in these cells would most likely correspond to caspase-7. For these experiments, MCF-7 cells were pretreated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 for 2 days before cytosolic extracts were collected for DEVDase activity assays at the indicated time points. As demonstrated in Fig.6, TNFα, but not 1α,25(OH)2D3, induced DEVDase cleavage activity in MCF-7 cells. Even with extended treatment times in additional studies, no DEVDase cleavage activity could be detected after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment of MCF-7 cells (data not shown). This observation indicates that other known or as yet unidentified effector caspases may be activated by 1α,25(OH)2D3, which mediate PARP cleavage, PS exposure, or DNA fragmentation. Since zVAD.fmk blocked 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated caspase-dependent events downstream of mitochondria, we examined the effects of the caspase inhibitor on cytochromec release and mitochondrial function. As shown in Fig.7, zVAD.fmk did not abrogate 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated cytochrome crelease or ROS production under the same conditions where PS exposure, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation were blocked. In contrast, the caspase inhibitor effectively blocked cytochrome c release and ROS generation triggered by TNFα (Fig. 7, A andC). To further probe mitochondrial function, the membrane potential-sensitive probe TMRE was used to detect mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment significantly enhanced the percentage of cells with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and zVAD.fmk did not block the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3. TNFα treatment also enhanced the percentage of cells with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential; however, in contrast to 1α,25(OH)2D3, the effect of TNFα was completely blocked by zVAD.fmk (Fig. 7 B). Subcellular localization of cytochrome c protein was examined by fluorescence microscopy to confirm the finding that cytochrome c release can proceed independently of caspase activation after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment. In Fig. 8, cytochrome cfluorescence (middle panels) is presented alongside phase contrast (top panels) and Hoechst nuclear staining (bottom panels) to compare cytochrome c localization in individual viable and apoptotic cells. In vehicle-treated control cells, apoptotic morphology was not present, and cytochrome c staining was restricted to punctate cytoplasmic regions, consistent with mitochondrial localization (Fig. 8). After treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or TNFα, apoptotic cells identified by phase contrast and Hoechst nuclear staining exhibited chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and cytosolic vacuolization. In these apoptotic cells, diffuse cytoplasmic cytochrome c staining was detected throughout the cell, which obscured the nuclei, consistent with redistribution of cytochromec from mitochondria to cytoplasm (21Rosse T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Consistent with the immunoblotting data (Fig. 7 A), treatment with zVAD.fmk failed to prevent 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated cytochrome c release, as demonstrated by persistence of diffuse cytoplasmic cytochrome c staining in 1α,25(OH)2D3- plus zVAD.fmk-treated cells. However, zVAD.fmk did prevent the morphological signs of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, consistent with its ability to block PS redistribution, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3. Since zVAD.fmk did not block cytochrome c release or mitochondrial dysfunction induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3, but did protect MCF-7 cells from morphological signs of apoptosis, including DNA fragmentation, we examined whether zVAD.fmk-treated cells actually remained viable and/or maintained clonogenic potential. As shown in Fig.9, both zVAD.fmk and zDEVD.fmk caspase inhibitors rescued MCF-7 cells from TNFα-mediated cell death, as demonstrated by total cell numbers, with zVAD.fmk offering the greater protection. However, neither zVAD.fmk nor zDEVD.fmk caspase inhibitors could protect MCF-7 cells from 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis, since the reduction in total cell number was not abrogated by either inhibitor (Fig. 9). Finally, the clonogenic potential was determined after treatment of cells with 1α,25(OH)2D3 or TNFα in the presence or absence of zVAD.fmk followed by re-plating at limiting dilutions in fresh medium. In vehicle control-treated cultures, at least 1 out of 5 cells had the ability to produce clones. In TNFα-treated cultures, clonogenicity was less than 1 out of 500 cells (f < 0.002) but in the presence of zVAD.fmk, the frequency of cells with clonogenic potential was significantly increased (f ≥ 0.2). In 1α,25(OH)2D3 treated cultures, clonogenicity was less than 1 out of 50 cells (f < 0.02), and this was not enhanced in the presence of zVAD.fmk. Here we report for the first time that 1α,25(OH)2D3 induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by disruption of mitochondrial function, which is accomplished by translocation of Bax to mitochondria, and increased permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Of particular interest, neither Bax translocation nor the mitochondrial disruption is induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in a variant line of MCF-7 cells selected for resistance to 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis (13Narvaez C.J. Vanweelden K. Byrne I. Welsh J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data implicate an essential role for mitochondrial signaling in the induction of apoptosis by 1α,25(OH)2D3 and identify the pro-apoptotic protein Bax as an important downstream target of the VDR in MCF-7 cells. In addition to Bax translocation, we report that treatment of MCF-7 cells with 1α,25(OH)2D3 induces cytochromec release and ROS generation, events that have been observed in cells induced to undergo apoptosis by overexpression of Bax (22Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar,23Finucane D.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). These data further support the concept that 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis may be driven by Bax translocation. A role for the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis is consistent with previous studies that support a role for Bcl-2, the anti-apoptotic antagonistic partner of Bax, in mediating the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 on both breast and prostate cancer cells. Thus, 1α,25(OH)2D3down-regulates Bcl-2 (24James S.Y. Mackay A.G. Colston K.W. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Simboli-Campbell M. Narvaez C.J. van Weelden K. Tenniswood M. Welsh J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1997; 42: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced apoptosis (26Blutt S.E. McDonnell T.J. Polek T.C. Weigel N.L. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 27Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jaattela M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar). Since Bcl-2 and Bax act antagonistically in the regulation of apoptosis, these data suggest that down-regulation of Bcl-2 in conjunction with translocation of Bax may be necessary for 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis. Further studies will be necessary to identify the signals generated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 that induce Bax translocation to mitochondria. Since events upstream of Bax translocation to mitochondria in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 are abrogated in the vitamin D3-resistant MCF-7 variant, comparison of early events in VDR signaling in these cells will be an important subject for future studies. Examination of events downstream of mitochondria indicated that 1α,25(OH)2D3 induced features of apoptosis associated with caspase activation, such as PARP cleavage, PS exposure, and DNA fragmentation. To determine whether caspase activation was required for 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis, we used the broad spectrum, cell-permeable caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. We observed that 1α,25(OH)2D3 signaling on mitochondria does not require caspase activation, since zVAD.fmk was unable to block 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced cytochrome c release, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, or ROS production. Again, this is consistent with apoptosis driven by Bax translocation, which promotes cytochrome crelease via caspase-independent pathways (28Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 29Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 30Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Our data also complement that of Mathiasen et al. (27Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jaattela M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that inhibition of caspase activity by overexpression of CrmA, a cowpox-derived caspase inhibitor, or caspase inhibitory peptides (Ac-DEVD-CHO, Ac-IETD-CHO, and zVAD.fmk) did not block vitamin D3-mediated growth arrest or apoptosis. Although caspase inhibition did not block mitochondrial events induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3, zVAD.fmk did block events downstream of mitochondria such as PARP cleavage, external display of PS, and DNA fragmentation. These findings are similar to reports of Bax-induced apoptosis, where caspase inhibitors had no effect on Bax-induced cytochrome c release or mitochondrial disruption, but prevented cleavage of nuclear and cytosolic substrates and DNA degradation (28Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3878-3885Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 29Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 30Jurgensmeier J.M. Xie Z. Deveraux Q. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4997-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 31Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, our data conflict with that of Mathiasen et al. (27Mathiasen I.S. Lademann U. Jaattela M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4848-4856PubMed Google Scholar), who observed that zVAD.fmk did not block 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated DNA fragmentation in MCF-7 cells. This discrepancy may reflect differences in doses (1 μm versus 25 μm) or experimental design between the two studies. The lower dose of zVAD.fmk (1 μm) used by Mathiasen et al. may have been insufficient to block mitochondrial-initiated caspases (caspase-9) (32Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper indicate that 1α,25(OH)2D3 triggers both caspase-independent and caspase-dependent pathways in MCF-7 cells, and suggest that 1α,25(OH)2D3 can activate downstream effector caspases. Since cytochrome crelease has been associated with autoactivation of procaspase-9, 1α,25(OH)2D3 may activate caspase-dependent pathways via cytochrome crelease. However, no DEVDase activity was detected in 1α,25(OH)2D3-treated cytoplasmic extracts, suggesting that other, possibly unidentified, effector caspases may be activated by 1α,25(OH)2D3, or that caspase-dependent events occur at later stages in the apoptotic program. Although blocking caspase activation prevented some of the morphological aspects of 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis, MCF-7 cells were not rescued from death by zVAD.fmk. This finding is consistent with reports that many cell types eventually die by a slower, non-apoptotic cell death if caspases are inactivated (8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data support the concept that mitochondrial damage represents a cell death commitment step in the course of apoptosis induced by many stimuli (33Miyashita T. Nagao K. Krajewski S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Inoue T. Yamada M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), including 1α,25(OH)2D3. In summary, 1α,25(OH)2D3 mediates apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through mitochondrial signaling, which involves ROS generation, and is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators. Caspases act solely as executioners to facilitate 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis, and caspase activation is not required for induction of cell death by 1α,25(OH)2D3. Our data suggest distinct differences in the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3 and TNFα, since inhibition of caspases was able to rescue MCF-7 cells from TNFα-mediated, but not 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated, cell death. Although caspase inhibition blocked biochemical changes associated with caspase activation downstream of mitochondrial perturbations and loss of cytochrome c, the commitment of MCF-7 cells to 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated apoptosis is clearly caspase-independent.

Like RXR, it belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors (NR) (1Laudet V. Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), which are intracellular receptors regulating target gene expression upon binding of small, hydrophobic molecules like steroids, retinoids, thyroid hormones, and vitamin D3. In insects, steroid hormones, the ecdysteroids, control insect development, molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction (2Lezzi M. Bergman T. Mouillet J.-F. Henrich V.C. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 41: 99-106Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Nijhout H.F. Insect Hormones. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1994Google Scholar, 4Thummel C.S. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 306-310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The weak binding of 20-hydroxyecdysone, the biologically active ecdysteroid for most insects, to the ecdysone nuclear receptor (EcR) is dramatically stimulated by addition of USP, resulting in an affinity in the nanomolar range (5Yao T.-P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.-D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In fact, the functional ecdysteroid receptor is formed by the heterodimer EcR/USP, as demonstrated in vitroby DNA binding, ligand binding, and transactivation assays (6Wang S.-F. Miura K. Misiceks R.J. Segraves W.A. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27531-27540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) andin vivo on fly usp mutants (7Hall B.L. Thummel C.S. Development ( Camb. ). 1998; 125: 4709-4717PubMed Google Scholar). Like its vertebrate homolog, USP can heterodimerize with several vertebrate NRs (5Yao T.-P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.-D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M. Nature. 1993; 366: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), and in insects, it forms heterodimeric complexes with EcR and also with at least another NR, DHR38 (8Sutherland J.D. Kozlova T. Tzertzinis G. Kafatos F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7966-7970Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For vertebrates, the heterodimerization of RXR with several NRs allows the modulation of their affinity for genomic response elements (9Chen J.Y. Clifford J. Zusi C. Starrett J. Tortolani D.

Bhattacharyya N. Dey A. Dawid I.B. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 644-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Unlike its vertebrate homolog RXR for which a ligand is known, the 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), no hormone ligand has been identified for USP up to now. Juvenile hormone (JH), an esterified sesquiterpene, has been put forward as the candidate hormone ligand of USP. In fact, it has been known for a long time that JH prevents metamorphosis by modulating the ecdysteroid action at the outset of the ecdysteroid rise for the molt (3Nijhout H.F. Insect Hormones. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1994Google Scholar, 12Hall B.L. Am. Zool. 1999; 39: 714-721Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13Riddiford L.M. Hiruma K. Lan Q. Zhou B. Am. Zool. 1999; 39: 736-746Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Riddiford L.M. Receptor. 2000; 3: 203-209Google Scholar). The hypothesis that JH might act through a NR relies on its chemical analogy with the vertebrate terpenes, represented by the retinoic acid. The idea that USP could be the receptor of JH or any of its derivatives raises the attractive possibility that JH might directly modulate the activity of the EcR/USP complex (15Buszczak M. Segraves W.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R879-R882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, some evidence was given that JH can bind to USP and stimulate oligomerization of USPin vitro and in yeast cells (16Jones G. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13499-13503Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, this is largely debated and still awaits further substantiation (2Lezzi M. Bergman T. Mouillet J.-F. Henrich V.C. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 41: 99-106Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In particular, the dissociation constant for binding of JH to USP was measured to be about 0.5 μm (16Jones G. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13499-13503Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Compared with the typical affinity of hormones for their nuclear receptor (in the nanomolar range), this low affinity questions whether such concentrations might be meaningful at a physiological level, where other cellular molecules might compete with JH for USP binding. NRs are modular proteins possessing a highly conserved DNA-binding domain and a moderately conserved ligand-binding domain (LBD) (17Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The LBD confers specificity to ligand binding and is responsible for ligand-dependent transactivation. Crystallographic investigations of the LBD structures of several NRs indicate a conserved fold described as an antiparallel α-helical sandwich (18Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) composed of 11 α-helices (H1, H3–H12) and two short β-strands (s1–s2). Most importantly, the crystal structures of the LBDs of unliganded (apo) (18Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) and liganded RXR (19Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of other liganded NRs (for a review, see Refs. 20Egea P.F. Klaholz B.P. Moras D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 21Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) have allowed us to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the dramatic structural reorganization that accompanies the ligand binding to the LBD. This conformational rearrangement mostly affects the N-terminal part of H3, H11, and H12, which carries the autonomous activation function (AF-2) (18Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 19Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D.

Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Upon binding of an agonist ligand, the corepressors are released, and the LBD adopts a unique conformation that generates an interaction surface for the coactivators, which then recruit multiprotein complexes and lead to the activation of responsive genes (23Torchia J. Glass C. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In contrast, antagonist ligands induce a transconformation of the LBD that does not allow binding of coactivators. Several antagonist conformations have been observed that can be considered variations around a common theme (24Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L. Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. Nature. 1997; 389: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar, 25Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L.

Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In these cases, the activation helix H12 lies in a groove similar to the binding site of the helical NR-box module of nuclear coactivators (the so called antagonist groove) (25Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar,28Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E.

In the case of partial agonist/antagonist ligands, helix H12 also lies in this groove, even though the ligands do not sterically preclude the agonist position of H12. However, in contrast to the full antagonist ligands, a weak but clear transcriptional AF-2 activity is reported in the presence of the corresponding ligand as would be in the presence of an AF-2 full agonist ligand. Partial agonist/antagonist AF-2 conformations were reported for ERβ/genistein (27Pike A.C.W. Brzozowski A.M. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Thorsell A.-G. Engström O. Ljunggren J. Gustafsson J.-A.

Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) LBD structures. In this paper, we report the crystal structure of the LBD of the orphan nuclear receptor USP of the lepidopteran H. virescens(hvUSP) at 1.65-Å resolution. The ligand-binding domain of hvUSP adopts an antagonist AF-2 conformation that could be driven by the presence of an unexpected ligand in its ligand-binding cavity. Important structural discrepancies with its vertebrate homolog RXR are observed. In particular, the connecting loop between helices H1 and H3 (L1–3) turns out to be a key element of this receptor in its actual conformation. This structural element sterically precludes the agonist AF-2 conformation and stabilizes an unusual antagonist conformation. The nature of the ligand observed in the crystal structure of USP LBD raises fundamental questions about the biological significance of similar molecules for insect endocrinology. The H. virescens USP (hvUSP) LBD (residues Val-205 to Met-466) was cloned as a N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein in a pET-15b expression vector and overproduced in the Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) strain. Cells were grown in 2× LB medium at 37 °C and subsequently induced for 2 h with 0.8 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 24 °C. Purification procedures include an affinity chromatography step on a cobalt chelating column followed by a gel filtration on a Superdex 200 16/60 column. After tag removal by thrombin digestion, protein was further purified by gel filtration. A homogeneous monomeric species was observed in solution. Purity and homogeneity of the protein were assessed by SDS and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, denaturant, and native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and dynamic light scattering. Crystallization experiments were carried out at 4 °C with the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The protein concentration was 3–9 mg/ml. Crystals of 200 × 200 × 400 μm3 were grown in about 10 days from a solution containing 10% polyethylene glycol 4000, 50 mm Tris (pH = 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol equilibrated against a reservoir containing 20% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 100 mm Tris (pH = 7.5). Crystals belong to the tetragonal P4322 space group, with one monomer per asymmetric unit. The unit cell parameters area = 58.21 Å, b = 58.21 Å,c = 144.69 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. The solvent content amounts to 32%, and the estimated B factor by Wilson plot is 27 Å2. Crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after a short dip in a solution containing 10% glycerol as cryoprotectant. The native data set was collected on a single crystal on beamline ID14-EH2 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data were processed (Table I) using HKL programs (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38556) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) using a partial structure of hsRXRα (19Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a search model. The weak solution was obtained with a correlation of 24.8% andR free = 54.5% after rigid-body refinement. The phasing power of the model was low and required numerous manual building cycles using O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar). The wARP method (33Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) was used as a tool for checking the correctness of the partially built structures. Refinement was performed with CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice M.L. Simonson T. Warre G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar) using a maximum likelihood target and bulk solvent correction. Cycles of manual model building and least square minimization followed by simulated annealing and individual isotropic B factor refinement led to the final model. Solvent molecules were located in a F o− F c map contoured at 3ς. The final model, refined to 1.65 Å resolution, comprises 246 residues, 259 water molecules, and one ligand molecule. A large part of the connection loop between helix H5 and the entry of the β-sheet (residues 306–315) as well as the C-terminal extension prolonging H12 (residues 459–466) could not be modeled due to poor electron density in these regions. The quality of the final model (Table I) was monitored with Procheck (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Time-of-flight mass spectrometry was utilized either using the electrospray technique (electrospray ionization) in native and denaturating conditions or the fast atom bombardment technique. Results showed that a heterogeneous mass distribution around 740 ± 50 Da was added to the peak corresponding to the pure protein (30.2 kDa), and the major peak corresponds to a mass of 745 ± 3 Da. The fatty acid content of the phospholipid molecules was obtained by organic solvent extraction. The analysis shows that more than 95% of the fatty acids are composed of C18:1 (40%), C16:0 (34%), C16:1 (22%); and trace amounts of C17:0, C18:0, C18:1, and C18:2 are detected as well. In the case of phosphatidylglycerol molecules, the major species detected by Time-of-flight mass spectrometry (745 ± 3 Da) correspond to a molecule with a tail made of C16:0 and C18:1 esterified fatty acids, fully consistent with the results of the organic solvent extraction and with the electron density maps. The present crystallographic investigations of hvUSP were restricted to the LBD, which comprises 264 residues starting at Val-205. The sequence of the hvUSP LBD is shown in Fig. 1 and is aligned to the sequences of other USP LDBs of the insect orders Lepidoptera and Diptera and to sequences of RXR of isotypes α, β, and γ. The sequences of USP LBDs altogether are rather well conserved with respect to those of RXR LBDs (between 34 and 42% sequence identity). However, while the conservation is highly pronounced within the whole RXR family, the USP sequences are highly conserved only inside the lepidopteran family (83–87% sequence identity), those of the dipteran family being much less conserved when compared with each other (between 46 and 54% sequence identity) and to the sequences of the lepidopteran USP LBDs (between 40 and 49% sequence identity). On the basis of this sequence alignment, the secondary structure elements, 11 helices and a β-sheet can be predicted for USP LBDs using the canonical structure of NR LBDs (17Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of hvUSP LBD supports these predictions, and the secondary structure elements are represented schematically in Fig. 1, together with those of hsRXRα LBD. As readily shown in this figure, the helix H3 of hvUSP LBD is one turn longer compared with its counterpart in the RXRα crystal structure. This figure also indicates that most of the conserved residues between lepidopteran USPs and RXRs are located in the helices, in particular in those forming the core of the LBD as well as within the signature region (17Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Divergence between USPs and RXRs is observed mainly for two loops that connect helix H5 to the β-turn (s1) (H5-s1) and helix H1 to helix H3 (L1–3). The loop H5-s1 is longer for USPs than for RXRs. Its length also varies inside the USP family, and it shows rather poor sequence conservation. On the other hand, the length of L1–3 is rather similar for USPs and RXRs. Its sequence is poorly conserved between the two families. However, it is highly conserved inside the family of lepidopteran USPs to which hvUSP belongs. This is remarkable, because within the whole NR superfamily L1–3 is usually found to be extremely variable in length and in sequence, consistent with its nature of a rather flexible and loosely structured region. In contrast, the crystal structure of hvUSP LBD presented here shows that L1–3 behaves as a rather stiff region due to strong interactions with several key secondary structure elements of the LBD. The overall architecture of USP LBD exhibits the canonical NR fold (18Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) with 11 α-helices (H1, H3–H12) and two short β-strands (s1–s2). In the following, the structure of USP LBD will be compared with two other crystal structures that bear the major features of NRs and are closely related to it: the agonist-bound (holo) RXRα (hsRXRα/9-cis-RA) (19Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A) and the RXRα in an antagonist conformation (msRXRα/oleic acid) (26Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.-M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B) LBDs. The superimposition of the USP LBD to the structure of holo-RXRα LBD was done by a least square fit (using the LSQ options of O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13010) Google Scholar)). Overall, the secondary structure elements of the USP LBD superimpose rather well with those of holo-RXRα LBD. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) is 1.22 Å for 183 matched Cα's atoms out of 246. Seven helices match rather well (r.m.s.d.: 1.13, 0.88, 0.57, 1.18, 0.67, 0.69, 0.75 Å for H4, H5, H7–H11, respectively). The helices H1, H3, H6 and the β-sheet show larger deviations. The activation helix H12 adopts a conformation similar to that observed in RXRα in the antagonist conformation. However, USP harbors at the same time features characteristic of agonist-bound NR LBDs, namely the length of H11 closer to that of agonist-bound RXRα and the positioning of the phenylalanine residues at its C-terminal part. The coexistence of features related to both agonist and antagonist-bound NR LBD structures is a unique and remarkable property of USP, which will be discussed below in more detail. The helices H1 and H3 contribute to the outermost shell of the LBD. They are less coplanar for USP than for RXRα, the angle between their helical axes being 12.1° larger than the corresponding value in RXRα. This is clearly correlated to the path adopted by the loop L1–3 connecting H1 to H3. It induces a considerable difference in the positioning of the N- and C-terminal parts of H3 compared with agonist and antagonist-bound RXRα LBDs, resulting in a more straight helix, as depicted in Fig. 2. The N-terminal region of H3 (Pro-240 to Cys-250) is displaced outwards the protein core in a substantial manner. It is tilted by about 24° with respect to the same region in holo RXRα. This position is intermediary between the positions of the N-terminal region seen in the apo RXRα and the holo RXRα LBD structures (data not shown). The outward bending of the C terminus of H3 (by about 10°) has repercussions on the positioning of the neighboring loops, L3–4 and L8–9. The loop L3–4, which is part of the signature region of NRs (17Wurtz J.-M. Bourguet W. Renaud J.-P. Vivat V. Chambon P. Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), is displaced laterally by about 1.8 Å and bent in the direction of L8–9, which itself is pushed outwards by about 1.5 Å. The conformation adopted by the connecting loop L1–3 is unusual and essential for the stabilization of the actual structure of USP LBD. This contrasts with the observation that this loop usually behaves, in most NRs, as a very flexible region. For hsRXRα, the crystal structures of both apo (18Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar) and holo (19Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) conformations show substantial differences in the region connecting helices H1 and H3. In the holo-RXRα LBD structure, L1–3 consists of an extended loop passing above the β-sheet. The apo form exhibits an additional helix in this region, which unfolds in the holo form. In the apo to holo transition, L1–3 also moves substantially. As suggested from the comparison of the apo-RXR and the holo-RXR and RAR LBD structures, L1–3 might act as a molecular spring accompanying the conformational changes which take place upon ligand binding (19Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). For ligand-bound RARγ LBD, the conformation of L1–3 is similar to that of holo-RXRα, except that it contains a C-terminal region forming a so-called Ω-loop (22Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Interestingly, for ER LBDs, L1–3 follows a different path than in the retinoic acid receptors (24Brzozowski A.M. Pike A.C.W. Dauter Z. Hubbard R.E. Bonn T. Engström O. Öhman L. Greene G.L.

Gustafsson J.-A. Carlquist M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4608-4618Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). It passes between helix H3 and the β-sheet, tightly packed to the protein core. For the USP LBD, L1–3 adopts none of these conformations. Its path (Val-220 to Pro-239) was unambiguously inferred from electron density maps, as demonstrated in Fig.3 A. Only a few residues at the beginning of the loop, Asp-222, Pro-223, and Ser-224, were included as alanines due to the weak electron density of their side chains. Accordingly, the temperature factors of these residues are higher (60–64 Å (2Lezzi M. Bergman T. Mouillet J.-F. Henrich V.C. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 41: 99-106Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) than those of the other amino acids of L1–3 (36 Å (2Lezzi M. Bergman T. Mouillet J.-F. Henrich V.C. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1999; 41: 99-106Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in average over L1–3). The first residues composing L1–3 form a path that crosses the region of H3 comprising Gln-256 to Val-262. The next residues (Glu-226 to Pro-234) delineate an extended loop that runs along H3. Finally, the last five residues of L1–3 (Asp-235 to Pro-239) form a loop rather similar to the Ω-loop observed in the RARγ LBD (22Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). L1–3 adopts a rather tensed conformation, which allows it to establish direct contacts with residues in helices H3, H11, and H12 and stabilize them in their actual position (see Fig. 3 B). This is important, because these helices are the structural elements that are shown to undergo the largest conformational changes upon ligand binding (19Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observed conformation of L1–3 is relevant to the physiological state of the recep"

However, it is unclear how glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored uPAR, which lacks a transmembrane structure, mediates signal transduction. It has been proposed that uPAR forms cis-interactions with integrins as an associated protein and thereby transduces proliferative or migratory signals to cells upon binding of uPA. We provide evidence that soluble uPAR (suPAR) specifically binds to integrins α4β1, α6β1, α9β1, and αvβ3 on Chinese hamster ovary cells in a cation-dependent manner. Anti-integrin and anti-uPAR antibodies effectively block binding of suPAR to these integrins. Binding of suPAR to α4β1 and αvβ3 is blocked by known soluble ligands and by the integrin mutations that inhibit ligand binding. These results suggest that uPAR is an integrin ligand rather than, or in addition to, an integrin-associated protein. In addition, we demonstrate that glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored uPAR on the cell surface specifically binds to integrins on the apposing cells, suggesting that uPAR-integrin interaction may mediate cell-cell interaction (trans-interaction). These previously unrecognized uPAR-integrin interactions may allow uPAR to transduce signals through the engaged integrin without a hypothetical transmembrane adapter and may provide a potential therapeutic target for control of inflammation and cancer.

It is anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage (reviewed in Refs. 1Chapman H. Wei Y. Simon D. Waltz D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar and2Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). uPAR is the cellular receptor for urokinase, a serine protease that is constitutively or inducibly secreted by most uPAR-expressing cells. Receptor-bound uPA can convert plasminogen to plasmin, which mediates pericellular proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins in the path of cellular invasion. uPAR is expressed by activated leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and different types of cancer cells (reviewed in Refs. 2Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar and 3Mazar A. Henkin J. Goldfarb H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and references therein). Expression of uPAR has been shown to correlate with the prognosis of many human cancers (2Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In murine tumor models, expression or administration of uPAR antagonists has a marked inhibitory effect on the metastatic ability of cancer cells (4Crowley C.W. Cohen R.L. Lucas B.K. Liu G. Shuman M.A. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and on the growth of the primary tumor (5Min H.Y. Doyle L.V. Vitt C.R. Zandonella C.L. Stratton-Thomas J.R. Shuman M.A. Rosenberg S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2428-2433PubMed Google Scholar), and the down-regulation of uPAR leads to dormancy of carcinoma cells in vivo (6Kook Y.H. Adamski J. Zelent A. Ossowski L.

Thus, uPAR expression has been implicated in cancer progression. In addition, it appears that uPAR is up-regulated on cells that are in motion. Migratory/chemotaxis-inducing stimuli (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and interleukins) up-regulate uPAR in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and leukocytes in vitro, whereas unstimulated cells do not have detectable expression of uPAR (reviewed in Refs. 2Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar and 3Mazar A. Henkin J. Goldfarb H. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 15-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar and references therein). Thus, uPAR may play a role in leukocyte recruitment, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. uPAR has been reported to associate with many signaling molecules and to mediate signal transduction (8Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 9Yebra M. Goretzki L. Pfeifer M. Mueller B.M. Exp.

In recent reports the binding of uPA to uPAR in tumor or endothelial cells has been shown to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2 (11Konakova M.

However, a major question is how uPAR mediates cellular signaling, because the molecule has no transmembrane structure. The existence of one or more hypothetical “transmembrane adapter molecules” that connects uPAR and signaling molecules inside cells has been proposed (14Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the β1, β2, and β3 integrin receptor families interact with uPAR using immunocoprecipitation, immunocolocalization, and resonance energy transfer approaches (15Xue W. Kindzelskii A.L. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4630-4640PubMed Google Scholar, 16Xue W. Mizukami I. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R.

Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The uPAR-integrin interaction may be significant, because many integrin receptors activate intracellular signals coupled to the pathways used by both receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (18Wary K.K.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Integrin- and receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signals may complement each other to fully activate cell survival and proliferation pathways (21Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 22Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that uPAR forms cis-interactions with integrins on the same cell surface as an integrin-associated protein (reviewed in Ref. 1Chapman H. Wei Y. Simon D. Waltz D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, it has not been established that this is the dominant mode of interaction responsible for signal transduction events. In the present study, we designed experiments to examine the uPAR-integrin interaction in detail using isolated domains derived from recombinant soluble uPAR (suPAR) and cells expressing recombinant β1 or β3 integrins. These studies establish that uPAR binds to integrins in a manner that is very similar to that of known integrin ligands (e.g. vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)). Additionally, we have found that uPAR interacts with integrins on apposing cells (trans-interaction). These unexpected findings may help to clarify the complex role of uPAR in signal transduction, inflammation, and cancer. TS2/16, an activating anti-β1 mAb (23Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. Flotte T.J.

CHO cells expressing the three domain forms of human uPAR (designated HuPAR-CHO) were prepared by transfecting full-length human uPAR cDNA (provided by L. A. Miles, The Scripps Research Institute) into a pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) together with a plasmid containing a neomycin-resistant gene. Cells were selected with G-418 (0.7 mg/ml medium). Approximately 50% of cells stably expressed uPAR after selection with mAb 3B10. CHO cells stably expressing uPAR were sorted by FACStar (Becton-Dickinson) to obtain cells homogeneously expressing uPAR at a high level. cDNAs encoding soluble wild-type uPAR (amino acids 1–277) and soluble domains 2 and 3 (amino acids 88–277) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using pTracer-full-length uPAR as a template. The fragments were digested with Bgl II and Xho and sub-cloned into the expression vector (pMT/BiP/V5, Invitrogen). Soluble suPAR domains were expressed in Drosophila Schneider S2 cells (DES system, Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Small scale preparations of suPAR and variants were purified from the medium using a polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody affinity column. For large scale preparations, S2 cell culture supernatants were filtered, and the medium were loaded onto a 40-g hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0. The column was then eluted with a gradient of 10–200 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0, and the suPAR-containing fractions were identified by Western blotting. Fractions containing monomeric suPAR eluted between 50 and 120 mm K2HPO4. Fractions containing monomeric suPAR were pooled, concentrated, and further purified using C8 reverse-phase HPLC. Crude suPAR (20 mg of total protein) was loaded in a volume of 2 ml onto a semi-preparative (10 × 250 cm) C8 column and eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–70% solvent B, where solvent A was 100% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. suPAR eluted as a single broad peak under these conditions with a retention time of ∼27 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of suPAR purified in this manner demonstrated a single major peak at 35 kDa under nonreducing conditions. Also observed was a slight laddering effect with three to four minor higher molecular weight species. These were determined to be SDS-stable aggregates of suPAR, which disappeared when SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under reducing conditions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry revealed a single broad peak with an average mass of 34,797 Da. The predicted mass based on the amino acid sequence is 30,672 Da, indicating the presence of about 4 kDa in glycosylation. Expression levels of suPAR were typically 30 mg/liter determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Purification yielded about 10–12 mg of pure suPAR protein per liter of culture supernatant. suPAR was digested with chymotrypsin to generate the soluble D1 and D2D3 fragments. Chymotrypsin was added to suPAR (1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) at a final molar ratio of suPAR:chymotrypsin of 1000:1, and the digest was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature. The digest was quenched by addition of Pefablock (100 μm final concentration). The D1 and D2D3 fragments were separated using C8 reverse phase-HPLC. The D1 and D2D3 fragments eluted with a retention time of ∼27 and 25 min, respectively. The purified D1 fragment was sequenced, and a single N terminus was observed beginning with RS (representing the two extra amino acids present in this construct) followed by LR, amino acids 1 and 2 in the mature suPAR sequence. Sequencing of the D2D3 fragment revealed a single N terminus as well, beginning with amino acids SRS, corresponding to amino acids 88–90 in the mature suPAR sequence. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectral analysis revealed a single peak for the D1 fragment (mass = 11,041 Da) and several peaks for the D2D3 fragment (mass = 23,846; 23,691; 22,936; 22,800). These were presumed to be glycosylation isoforms, although additional digestion of the D2D3 fragment from the C terminus could not be excluded. However, no consensus chymotryptic cleavage site that could result in the observed mass differences is present at the C terminus of the D2D3 fragment. A polyclonal antibody against suPAR was prepared as described (38Gum R. Juarez J. Allgayer H. Mazar A. Wang Y. Boyd D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant suPAR was expressed in SP2/0 cells and purified using a single-chain uPA-Sepharose column. Serum was collected from rabbits immunized with purified suPAR, and the IgG was obtained by a 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation. This material was dialyzed (10,000×) against phosphate-buffered saline and further purified using a suPAR-Sepharose column to generate affinity-purified anti-suPAR IgG. Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (34Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells in 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing substrates at a concentration of 0.2–5 μg/ml and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Remaining protein-binding sites were blocked by incubating with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mmNaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.02% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, unless stated otherwise. After nonbound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with the same buffer, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity (39Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used at 250× dilution of ascites (TS2/16, 8C8, P1B5, SG73, KH72, and 135–13C), at 4 μg/ml (AIIB2, 7E3, and Y9A2), and at 3.4 μg/ml (anti-uPAR and rabbit IgG). Data are shown as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Integrin-transfected, mock-transfected (vector only), or parental K562 cells were labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled cells (105 cells/well) were added to the monolayer of parent, mock-transfected, or HuPAR-CHO cells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After the wells were rinsed with medium to remove unbound cells, bound cells were quantified by assaying fluorescence (excitation 485 nm, emission 530 nm) using an FL500 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Antibodies were used at the same concentrations as described above. Data are shown as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis (40Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), flow cytometric analysis (41Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transfection (41Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were performed as described in the cited references. To study whether and how integrins are involved in uPAR-mediated signal transduction, we first asked whether recombinant soluble uPAR fragments interact with β1 and β3 integrins. It has been proposed that the activity of suPAR requires chymotrypsin cleavage between the N-terminal domains 1 and 2 (14Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We used several different suPAR fragments that were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (domain 1, domains 2 and 3, or full-length suPAR containing domains 1, 2, and 3, designated D1, D2D3, D1D2D3, respectively) and domains 2 and 3 expressed in CHO cells. Unexpectedly, these suPAR fragments supported adhesion of both α4- and β3-CHO cells expressing recombinant human α4/hamster β1 (α4β1) and hamster αv/human β3 hybrid (αvβ3), respectively, but not CHO cells (Fig. 1 A). Parental CHO cells express endogenous α5β1, αvβ1, and αvβ5 but not α4β1 or αvβ3 integrins (42Takada Y. Ylanne J. Mandelman D. Puzon W. Ginsberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It appears that suPAR expressed in Drosophila and CHO cells supports adhesion of α4- and β3-CHO cells at comparable levels. We used suPAR D2D3 expressed in CHO cells (43Higazi A.A.R. Mazar A. Wang J. Quan N. Griffin R. Reilly R. Henkin J. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5348-5353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for further characterization of suPAR-integrin interaction throughout this study. The rationale of using D2D3 is that removal of D1 leaves uPAR D2D3 that is capable of signal transduction without uPA (14Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and thus suPAR D2D3-integrin interaction is likely to be biologically relevant. We next studied the specificity of suPAR D2D3 binding to β1 and β3 integrins. We used CHO cells expressing different human α subunits (α2, α3, α6, and α9, designated α2-, α3-, α6-, and α9-CHO cells, respectively) in addition to α4- and β3-CHO cells. These transfectants express human α/hamster β1 hybrids (α2β1, α3β1, α6β1, or α9β1, respectively). We found that β3-, α4-, α9-, and α6-CHO cells adhered to uPAR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B andC). However, other transfectants (α2- and α3-CHO cells), parental CHO cells, CHO B2 variant cells lacking endogenous α5β1 (32Schreiner C.L. Bauer J.S. Danilov Y.N. Hussein S. Sczekan M. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C), and mock-transfected CHO cells (data not shown) adhered only weakly under the conditions used. The adhesion of α4-, α6-, α9-, and β3-CHO cells to uPAR was blocked by specific function-blocking antibodies (SG73 to α4, 135–13C to α6, Y9A2 to α9, and 7E3 to β3) (Fig. 1 D). These results suggest that suPAR D2D3 specifically binds to several integrins (α4β1, α6β1, α9β1, and αvβ3). We further tested the specificity of interaction using antibodies against uPAR. We found that antibodies against uPAR effectively blocked suPAR binding to αvβ3 (Fig. 1 E). We then tested whether α-bungarotoxin, which has a “three-finger protein” structure similar to the uPAR structure (44Tsetlin V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), “nonspecifically” binds to αvβ3. The toxin showed only weak, if any, affinity to αvβ3 (Fig. 1 F). These results suggest that suPAR binding to integrins is specific to the uPAR sequence and structure. Ligand binding to integrins is tightly regulated by activation/inactivation of integrins through inside-out signal transduction (45Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3821) Google Scholar). β3-CHO cells significantly adhere to suPAR D2D3 in the presence of Mg2+ but not in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A). CHO cells do not adhere to suPAR in either condition. These results suggest that αvβ3 requires Mg2+ for binding to suPAR D2D3 under the conditions employed. Although α2-CHO, α3-CHO, and CHO cells do not strongly adhere to suPAR D2D3 under the assay conditions used, it is still possible that binding of α2β1, α3β1, and α5β1 may require more activation. Therefore, we studied whether Mn2+ (0.1 mm), which universally activates integrins, facilitates uPAR binding to these integrins (Fig. 2 A). We found that α5β1-deficient B2 variant CHO cells did not significantly adhere to suPAR D2D3 in the presence of Mn2+, but parental CHO cells did. We found that B2 cells expressing human α3 or α4 (designated α3- or α4-B2 cells, respectively) also adhered to suPAR D2D3 in the presence of Mn2+. α2-B2 cells did not adhere to suPAR D2D3 under any conditions tested. Ca2+ did not significantly support adhesion of these cells. These results suggest that α3β1, α4β1, and α5β1 but not α2β1 bind to suPAR D2D3 in an activation-dependent manner. We then asked whether the activation status of β1 integrins that is required for uPAR binding to natural integrins is similar to the requirements for the recombinant integrins that we studied. To answer this question, we studied uPAR binding to nonrecombinant integrins on Jurkat human T-cell leukemia cells (α4β1+, α5β1+). We can stimulate or suppress β1 integrin-ligand interaction from outside cells using anti-β1 antibodies (e.g. TS2/16, activating; AIIB2, inhibiting) (reviewed in Ref. 46Takada Y. Kamata T. Irie A. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Zhang X.-P. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We found that adhesion of Jurkat cells to suPAR D2D3 is stimulated by TS2/16 and blocked completely by AIIB2 and SG73 (anti-α4 mAb) and partially by KH72 (anti-α5 mAb) (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that nonrecombinant α4β1 and α5β1 in Jurkat cells may interact with suPAR D2D3 in an activation-dependent manner. We then asked whether uPAR competes with VCAM-1, a known α4β1 ligand, for binding to α4β1. To address this question, we examined the adhesion of α4-B2 cells to suPAR D2D3 in the presence of soluble VCAM-1. We used B2 cells to completely eliminate the contribution of α5β1 in uPAR binding. We found that adhesion of α4-B2 cells to suPAR D2D3 was blocked by VCAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 A) but not by irrelevant ligand fibrinogen. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of VCAM-1 is specific to α4β1-suPAR D2D3 interaction, and thus suPAR and VCAM-1 compete for binding to α4β1. We also studied the effect of the GRGDS peptide, a widely distributed integrin-binding motif, on uPAR-αvβ3 interaction (Fig. 3 B). We found that GRGDS peptide completely blocked adhesion of β3-CHO cells to suPAR D2D3, but control GRGES peptide did not, suggesting that uPAR and the ligand-derived RGD motif compete for binding to αvβ3. Thus it is highly likely that the uPAR-binding sites in these integrins may overlap with those of known integrin ligands. We next studied whether uPAR binding is inhibited by mutations in these integrins that block binding of known ligands. We have previously reported that the mutation to Ala of several amino acid residues, Tyr-187, Trp-188, and Gly-190 in α4 (designated Y187A, W188A, and G190A mutations, respectively), blocks VCAM-1 and fibronectin connecting segment-1 (CS-1) peptide binding to α4β1 (47Irie A.

https://openalex.org/W2022166639,"MLN64 is a transmembrane protein that shares homology with the cholesterol binding domain (START domain) of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria, where it facilitates cholesterol import into the mitochondria. Crystallographic analysis showed that the START domain of MLN64 is a cholesterol-binding domain. The present work was undertaken to determine which step of the intracellular cholesterol pathway MLN64 participates in. Using immunocytofluorescence, MLN64 colocalizes with LBPA, a lipid found specifically in late endosomes. Electron microscopy indicates that MLN64 is restricted to the limiting membrane of late endosomes. Microinjection or endocytosis of specific antibodies shows that the START domain of MLN64 is cytoplasmic. Deletion and mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that the amino-terminal part of MLN64 is responsible for its addressing. Although this domain does not contain conventional dileucine- or tyrosine-based targeting signals, we show that a dileucine motif (Leu66-Leu67) and a tyrosine residue (Tyr89) are critical for the targeting or the proper folding of the molecule. Finally, MLN64 colocalizes with cholesterol and Niemann Pick C1 protein in late endosomes. However, complementation assays show that MLN64 is not involved in the Niemann Pick C2 disease which, results in cholesterol lysosomal accumulation. Together, our results show that MLN64 plays a role at the surface of the late endosomes, where it might shuttle cholesterol from the limiting membrane to cytoplasmic acceptor(s).

Animal cells obtain cholesterol by de novo synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum or receptor-mediated uptake of plasma lipoproteins (1Liscum L. Munn N.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Most of cells acquire cholesterol from low density lipoprotein (LDL).1 LDL is endocytosed and transported to early endosomes and then to late endosomes/lysosomes for degradation. Free cholesterol generated from LDL in late endosomes/lysosomes is then redistributed in the cell. Although the regulation of cholesterol content in cells has been extensively studied, little is known about the mechanisms of its intracellular transport. Only a few molecules involved in this pathway have been identified, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), whose expression is tissue-specific, or the recently identified Niemann Pick C1 protein (2Liscum L. Klansek J.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Cruz J.C. Sugii S., Yu, C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

MLN64 cDNA was identified from a breast cancer-derived metastatic lymph node cDNA library by differential hybridization using malignant (metastatic lymph node) versus nonmalignant (breast fibroadenoma and normal lymph node) tissues. Chromosomal mapping showed that the MLN64 gene is located in the q12-q21 region of the long arm of chromosome 17 (4). This region is altered in 20–30% of breast cancers, the most common modification being the amplification of the proto-oncogene c-erb B-2 (5Fukushige S. Matsubara K. Yoshida M. Sasaki M. Suzuki T. Semba K. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 955-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 6Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E. Levin W.J.

Science. 1987; 235: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). The proto-oncogene c-erb B-2 is a marker of poor prognosis and tumor aggressiveness in breast cancers; its overexpression in tumors has been correlated to hormone therapy failure (8Ross J.S. Fletcher J.A. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 413-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In breast cancers, an invariable coamplification and consequent overexpression ofMLN64 and c-erb B-2 in 22.5% of the cases tested (98 cases) was observed, suggesting that overexpression ofMLN64 could be of clinical relevance for breast cancer development and/or progression (9Bieche I. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Moog-Lutz C. Rio M.C. Lidereau R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3886-3890PubMed Google Scholar). MLN64 cDNA encodes for a protein of 445 residues containing four potential transmembrane regions at its amino-terminal part. In addition, MLN64 shares a conserved COOH-terminal region with StAR called the StAR homology domain (SHD) (10Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y. Muller D. Chenard M.P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recently, a larger domain, including the SHD, has been defined as the StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain (20Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). A wide variety of proteins involved in different cell processes possess a START domain, such as the phosphatidylcholine transfer protein, the signal-transducing protein p122-RhoGAP, or a putative acyl-CoA thioesterase. Interestingly, it has been shown that mutations in the StAR gene, which lead to COOH-terminal truncated proteins in which the SHD domain is deleted, are responsible for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a disease characterized by severely impaired steroidogenesis (12Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 13Bose H.S. Sugawara T. Strauss J.F.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The functional relationship between MLN64 and StAR was previously investigated. It was shown that, like StAR, MLN64 can enhance steroidogenesis in an in vitro assay. Removal of the SHD domain resulted in the complete loss of steroidogenic activity, while removal of the NH2-terminal region of MLN64 increased this activity (15Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). StAR is a mitochondrial protein that regulates the acute production of steroids in the adrenal glands and gonads in response to corticotropin and luteinizing hormone, respectively. StAR regulates the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis, which is the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it is converted into pregnenolone (16Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Investigations into the mechanism of action of StAR have shown that StAR is a sterol transfer protein that acts directly on the mitochondria (17King S.R. Ronen-Fuhrmann T. Timberg R. Clark B.J. Orly J. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5165-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Arakane F. Kallen C.B. Watari H. Foster J.A. Sepuri N.B. Pain D. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Gerton G.L. Strauss J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16339-16345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, StAR has been shown to be a sterol transfer protein in vitro (19Kallen C.B. Billheimer J.T. Summers S.A. Stayrook S.E. Lewis M. Strauss J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26285-26288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the START domain of MLN64 was solved, and its ability to bind cholesterol at an equimolar ratio was reported (20Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). MLN64 is likely to be involved in cholesterol transport, and cholesterol is the precursor of all steroid hormones. Since c-erb B-2 and MLN64 are coamplified and overexpressed in breast cancer, a role for MLN64 in facilitating intratumoral biosynthesis of steroid hormones can be postulated, which may relate to the hormonal resistance of part of the c-erb B-2-expressing tumors. This study was aimed at identifying the exact subcellular localization of MLN64 to define where MLN64 is likely to play a key role during cholesterol trafficking. The MCF7 human breast cancer and the SK-OV-3 human ovarian cancer cell lines were provided by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and routinely maintained in our laboratory and cultured as recommended. The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line was a kind gift of Dr. L. Liscum (Tufts University, Boston, MA). The NPC2 fibroblast strain was obtained from case 16 in Vanier et al. (21Vanier M.T. Duthel S. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Pentchev P. Carstea E.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar). Human lipoprotein-deficient serum and human LDL were prepared in the laboratory as described previously (21Vanier M.T. Duthel S. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Pentchev P. Carstea E.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 118-125PubMed Google Scholar). To produce stable cell lines expressing MLN64, a 1.5-kilobase Bam HI fragment corresponding to the open reading frame of the human MLN64 cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number X80198) was cloned into the Bam HI site of the pCMVneo vector (22Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar), thus generating the pCMVneo-MLN64 plasmid. To map the domain responsible for the sorting of MLN64, NH2-terminal deletion mutants of pSG5 MLN64 (10Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y. Muller D. Chenard M.P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were constructed. pSG5 MLN64-(30–445) was obtained in two steps. An intermediate plasmid was constructed by creating two in-frameNhe I sites at amino acid positions 2 and 28 by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the synthetic oligonucleotides 1 (5′-GGGGCCCACC AGGATGGCTA GCCTGCCCAG GGAGCTGA) and 2 (5′-GGGCTCCTCA CTGTCCGCTA GCCAGAGCCT CTCCTCGC). Sequences corresponding to amino acids 2–29 were then excised by a Nhe I digest, and the remaining plasmid was recircularized to produce pSG5 MLN64-(30–445). pSG5 MLN64-(47–445) and pSG5 MLN64-(54–445) were obtained in a similar way. For pSG5 MLN64-(47–445), the two in-frame Nhe I sites at amino acid positions 2 and 45 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the synthetic oligonucleotides 1 and 3 (5′-GCCTGAGAAG CGAAGGGCTA GCTCTGATGT CCGCCGCAC). For pSG5 MLN64-(54–445), the two in-frame Nhe I sites at amino acid positions 2 and 52 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the synthetic oligonucleotides 1 and 4 (5′-CTCTGATGTC CGCCGCGCTA GCTGTCTCTT CGTCACCT). pSG5 MLN64-(1–218) was obtained by insertion of an in-frame stop codon at amino acid position 219 by site-directed mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GCAGGGTCTG ACTAGTAATC AGATGAAG. pSG5 MLN64-(1–171) was obtained by insertion of an in-frame stop codon at amino acid position 172 by site-directed mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GGTTCCTTGA CTTTTAAATC CTACCCCAGG. pSG5 MLN64-(1–145) was obtained by insertion of an in-frame stop codon at amino acid position 146 by site-directed mutagenesis using the following oligonucleotide: 5′-CTCTGAGCTG CTTTAAAAAG GGGCATTTG. pSG5 MLN64 LL1 was constructed by mutating Leu61-Leu62 to Ala61-Ser62 by site-directed mutagenesis using the following synthetic oligonucleotide: 5′-ACTTCGTCACC TTCGACGCTA GCTTCATCTC CCTGCTC. Similarly, pSG5 MLN64 LL2 was constructed by mutating Leu66-Leu67 to Ala66-Ser67 (5′-CCTGCTCTTC ATCTCCGCTA GCTGGATCAT CGAACTG), pSG5 MLN64 LL3 by mutating Leu109-Leu110 to Ala109-Ser110 (5′-CTTCCGCTTC TCTGGAGCTA GCCTAGGCTA TGCCGTGC), pSG5 MLN64 LL4 by mutating Leu144-Leu145 to Ala144-Ser145 (5′-GGTCATCCTC TCTGAGGCTA GCAGCAAAGG GGCATTTG), pSG5 MLN64 LL5 (and Y3) by mutating Tyr152-Leu153 to Ala152-Ser153 (5′-CAAAGGGGCA TTTGGCGCTA GCCTCCCCAT CGTCTCTT), pSG5 MLN64 Y1 by mutating Tyr89 to Val89 (5′-GCAGGAGATC ATCCAGGTTA ACTTTAAAAC TTCC), pSG5 MLN64 Y2 by mutating Gly112-Tyr113 to Ala112-Ser113 (5′-CTCTGGACTG CTCCTAGCTA GCGCCGTGCT GCAGCTCC).

MCF7 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with either the pCMVneo-MLN64 expression vector or the pCMVneo vector, both linearized by Hin dIII. The medium was changed after 20 h, and on the following day, the selection was begun in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/liter G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks of selection, resistant clones were subcloned, and expression of MLN64 was assessed by Western blot as described previously (10Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y.

Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated 1 h with Cy3- and Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400). Cells were washed three times in PBS, and in some cases, nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst-33258 dye. Slides were mounted in Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Observations were made with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS4D; Heidelberg, Germany) or with a fluorescence microscope (Leica DMLB 30T). MCF7 cells were grown on glass coverslips to 70% confluence. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed 45 min at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS followed by a 15-min incubation in 1% sodium borohydrure in PBS. Cells were then permeabilized for 20 min with 0.1% saponin in PBS. After blocking for 30 min in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with mAbMLN64-Ct antibody (1:1000 dilution). After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated 1.5 h with biotin-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody. Cells were then processed for immunoperoxidase labeling using the Vectastain Elite ABC standard kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, which was followed by incubation with 0.0125% diaminobenzidine and 0.005% H2O2 in 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.6. Cells were postfixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS and then with 2% OsO4 for 30 min. They were then dehydrated with graded concentrations of ethanol and conventionally embedded in epoxy resin. Glass coverslips were dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, and ultrathin sections were observed under a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi 7500, Japan). MCF7 cells, on glass coverslips, were washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. For endocytosis of antibodies, cells were incubated for 1 h with either anti-cathepsin D M1G8, mAbMLN64-Ct, or pAbMLN64-Nt antibodies. Antibodies were used at the same concentration as for immunofluorescence. Antibodies were microinjected into the cell cytoplasm together with lysine fixable dextran fluorescein 40000 MW (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described previously (25Dierich A. Gaub M.P. Le Pennec J.P. Astinotti D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Microinjections were followed by an incubation of the cells for 1 h. Antibodies were used 10 times more concentrated than for immunofluorescence. Detection of either internalized or microinjected antibodies was performed by incubating fixed cells with the secondary antibody as described above (see “Immunocytofluorescence”). Niemann-Pick C2 fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips to 70% confluence and were transfected with the expression vector pSG5 MLN64 with FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After transfection, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum for 24 h and then changed to medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum and 50 μg/ml human LDL for an additional 24 h of culture. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence to identify transfected cells with mAbMLN64-Ct anti-MLN64 as described above (see “Immunocytofluorescence”) except that permeabilization with Triton X-100 was omitted. Staining of free cholesterol was performed after fixation using 50 μg/ml filipin (Sigma) for 30 min. To assess the subcellular localization of the MLN64 protein, we performed indirect immunofluorescence experiments using two cancer-derived cell lines. A human ovarian cancer cell line, SK-OV-3, that overexpresses MLN64 at both the RNA and protein levels and a human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, that does not express detectable levels of MLN64 mRNA were chosen (4Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Lidereau R. Basset P. Rio M.C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y. Muller D. Chenard M.P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A punctuate cytoplasmic staining was observed using an anti-MLN64 antibody in the SK-OV-3 cells (Fig.1 A, a), whereas no protein expression could be detected in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1 A,c). MCF7 cells overexpressing MLN64 (MCF7/MLN64) showed a similar punctuate staining as observed for SK-OV-3 cells (Fig.1 A, b). To identify the subcellular structures where the MLN64 protein resides, MCF7/MLN64 cells were colabeled with antibodies directed against known organelle-resident proteins or lipids. Double staining experiments using MLN64 and cathepsin D or LampI, two markers of both endosomes and lysosomes (26Laurent-Matha V. Farnoud M.R. Lucas A. Rougeot C. Garcia M. Rochefort H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2539-2549PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), showed a large overlap of both signals, the relative quantity of both proteins being variable from one vesicle to another (Fig. 1 B,a–c, and data not shown). Double labeling experiments with MLN64 and CD63, a marker for all types of endosomes (27Metzelaar M.J. Wijngaard P.L. Peters P.J. Sixma J.J. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Clevers H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3239-3245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed also a large overlap of both signals, with the relative quantity of both proteins again being variable from one vesicle to another (Fig.1 B, d–f). Colocalization of MLN64 and LBPA, a lipid restricted to late endosomes (24Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), showed that both signals completely overlapped (Fig. 1 B, g–i). Thus, among the endosome/lysosome vesicles, MLN64 appeared to specifically reside in the late endosomes. In addition, we noted that the immunocytofluorescence staining of MLN64 appeared as a ring on most of the endosomes (Fig. 1 B, g–i). When the cells are costained with anti-LBPA, a lipid exclusively located in late endosomes (24Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), MLN64 staining surrounded LBPA-stained spheres (Fig.1 B, i). To identify endosomal addressing signals, we analyzed the MLN64 protein sequence for known motifs. MLN64 possesses four putative transmembrane domains (10Moog-Lutz C. Tomasetto C. Regnier C.H. Wendling C. Lutz Y. Muller D. Chenard M.P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As a control of the functionality of these transmembrane domains, we decided to analyze potential N-glycosylation sites, which have been shown to direct luminal proteins to endosomes/lysosomes (28Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). MLN64 contains two potential sites of N-glycosylation at positions 219 and 311; we performed site-directed mutagenesis of these amino acids (Asn219 → Ala219 and Asn311→ Ser311) (Table I). The localization of mutated proteins was compared with a marker of late endosomes (data not shown). Neither single mutants nor the double mutant have a modified subcellular localization. These data indicate that putative N-glycosylation of MLN64 are not involved in the sorting of MLN64, which strongly suggests that the transmembrane domains of the protein are functional. The contribution of another sorting signal typical of endosomal transmembrane protein was therefore tested. The GYXXZ motif (where Z represents an aliphatic or aromatic residue) is responsible for the sorting of the Lamp proteins to lysosome and endosome membranes (29Hunziker W. Geuze H.J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). MLN64 contains one such motif at positions 112–116. Site-directed mutagenesis of this motif did not alter the endosomal localization of the protein (TableI). Therefore, this motif is not involved in the sorting of MLN64. Since common signals were not responsible for the addressing of MLN64, we decided to map the MLN64 endosomal sorting domain using recurrent deletions in the NH2 and COOH termini of the protein.Table ISequences and positions of the potential N-glycosylation sites and GYXXZ type sorting motif of MLN64MutagenesisLocalization of the mutant proteinAsn219 → AlaEndosomesAsn311 → SerEndosomesAsn219 → Ala, Asn311 → SerEndosomesGY113AVL → ASAVLEndosomesMutagenesis of these sites on the cDNA of MLN64 cloned in the pSG5 expression vector and the subcellular localization of the resulting mutant proteins are indicated. Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis of these sites on the cDNA of MLN64 cloned in the pSG5 expression vector and the subcellular localization of the resulting mutant proteins are indicated. Three NH2-terminal deletions were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis in the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 MLN64 (Fig. 2 A). Subcellular localization was assayed by transient transfection in MCF7 cells followed by immunofluorescence using pAbMLN64-Ct. The localization of mutated proteins was compared with a marker of late endosomes (data not shown). Deletions of the NH2-terminal part to position 29 or 46 (pSG5 MLN64-(30–445) and pSG5 MLN64-(47–445)) showed a localization (Fig. 2 B, b) similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. 2 B, a). Further NH2-terminal deletion (pSG5 MLN64-(54–445)) involving the transmembrane domains of the protein led to a mislocalization of the protein, which then exhibited a reticular pattern characteristic of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2 B, c). Similarly, three COOH-terminal deletions were constructed (Fig. 2 A), and subcellular localization was assayed using pAbMLN64-Nt. The localization of mutated proteins was compared with a marker of late endosomes (data not shown). When the COOH-terminal part of the protein is deleted from amino acids 219 or 172 to 445 (pSG5 MLN64-(1–218), pSG5 MLN64-(1–171)), the protein remained in endosomes (Fig.2 B, d and e). Further deletion (pSG5 MLN64-(1–145)) including the transmembrane helices-containing domain led to a modified localization of the protein, which then resided in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2 B, f). NH2- and COOH-terminal deletions showed that the minimal domain for sorting to the endosome was included within amino acids 47–171 of the MLN64 protein. Further deletions of the protein would include the transmembrane helices-containing domain and could therefore modify the overall structure of MLN64 and its anchorage to the membrane. Thus, we decided to perform point mutations within the sequence located from residue 47 to 172 to identify amino acids involved in the sorting. Most of the membrane proteins located in the endosome/lysosome exhibit dileucine or tyrosine type addressing signals (30Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We therefore decided to systematically mutate tyrosine and dileucine motifs within the minimal region necessary to target the protein to endosomes. Five dileucine motifs (LL) are present in this region of the protein (Fig.3 A, LL1–LL5). Mutations of four of them (LL1 and LL3–LL5) did not change the localization of the protein (Fig. 3 B, a; data not shown) when compared with a marker of late endosomes (data not shown). In contrast, mutation of LL2 located at positions 66 and 67 led to a mislocalization of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3 B,b). Three different tyrosines (Y1–Y3) are present between amino acids 47 and 172. Y2 is included in the previously studied GYXXZ motif (Table I). Mutations of Y2 or Y3 did not change the subcellular localization of MLN64 (Fig. 3 B,c; data not shown) when compared with a marker of late endosomes (data not shown). On the contrary, the mutation of Y1 (residue 89) modified the subcellular localization of the protein, which then resided in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 3 B,d). Thus, two motifs, the dileucine motif 66–67 and the tyrosine 89 are important for proper addressing of MLN64 to late endosomes. The immunocytofluorescence staining of MLN64 (Fig.1 B, g–i) suggested that MLN64 localizes to the limiting membrane of endosomes. To confirm this localization of MLN64, we performed immunoelectron microscopy on MCF7/MLN64 cells using the mAbMLN6"
https://openalex.org/W2038612913,"The integrity of the DNA damage response pathway is essential for prevention of neoplastic transformation. Several proteins involved in this pathway including p53, BRCA1, and ATM are frequently mutated in human cancer. Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) is a DNA damage-activated protein kinase that lies downstream of ATM in this pathway. Recently, heterozygous germline mutations in Chk2 have been identified in a subset of patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype, suggesting that Chk2is a tumor suppressor gene. In this study, we have reported the biochemical characterization of the four tumor-associated Chk2 mutants. Two of the reported Chk2 mutations identified in Li-Fraumeni syndrome result in loss of Chk2 kinase activity. Whereas one mutation within the Chk2 forkhead homology-associated (FHA) domain, R145W, retains some basal kinase activity, this mutant cannot be phosphorylated at an ATM-dependent phosphorylation site (Thr-68) and cannot be activated following gamma radiation. Wild-type Chk2 exists mainly in a protein complex of M r ∼200,000 whereas the R145W mutant forms a larger, presumably inactive complex in the cell. The other FHA domain mutant, I157T, behaves as wild-type Chk2 in all the assays used here. Because the FHA domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, this mutation may affect associations of Chk2 with other proteins. Additionally, we have shown that Chk2 can also be inactivated by down-regulation of its expression in cancer cells. Thus, Chk2 may be inactivated by multiple mechanisms in the cell.

Several mutations of Chk2 were identified in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and in sporadic colon cancer. Although it has been speculated that these Chk2 mutants are defective in their tumor suppressor functions (12Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), this possibility has not been addressed directly. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the four reported Chk2 mutations. Dr. Jann Sarkaria kindly provided plasmid for the expression of HA-tagged Chk2 in mammalian cells (13Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis (Promega) was performed to introduce mutations into theChk2 coding sequence. For expressing wild-type or mutant Chk2 as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in insect cells, wild-type or mutant Chk2 coding sequences were cloned into the pDONR201 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Gateway cloning technology (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to subclone these coding sequences into pDEST20 vector, a vector for baculovirus expression of GST fusion proteins. Recombinant baculoviruses encoding GST-fused wild-type and mutants of Chk2 were generated using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (Life Technologies, Inc.). All cell lines were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection and cultivated in RPMI 1640 (Biofluids) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To establish cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type or mutant Chk2, HCT116 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated HA-tagged sequences. G418 resistant clones were isolated and analyzed by Western blotting using either anti-HA antibody (Babco) or anti-Chk2 antibody. Clones that express HA-tagged Chk2 at levels similar to that of endogenous Chk2 were used in this study. Where indicated, cells were exposed to gamma radiation from a137Cs source at a dose of 6.4 gray/min. Following irradiation, cells were returned to the incubator and harvested 1 h later. Sf9 insect cells were cultivated in Grace's insect media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For protein expression, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding GST-fused wild-type or mutant Chk2. Cells were collected and lysed 48 h after viral infection. Wild-type or mutant Chk2 was purified using glutathione affinity chromatography. Preparation of cell lysates, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (14Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F. Tomlinson G. Couch F.J. Weber B.L. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Scully R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 317-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Antibodies against Chk2 were raised against GST fusion proteins containing full-length Chk2 (mAB no.7) or the C terminus of Chk2 (residues 193–543, anti-Chk2B). Anti-Chk2 Thr-68 phosphospecific antibodies were provided by Dr. Bin-Bing Zhou. Chk2 kinase assays were performed as described previously (13Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). HCT116 and derivative cells were harvested and lysed in NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Whole cell extracts were loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with NETN and run in the same buffer with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For each run, a sample of 500 μl was injected, and 500-μl fractions were collected. For column equilibration, low and high molecular weight gel filtration calibration kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used, and the column was run under identical conditions. Because Chk2 is a DNA damage-activated protein kinase that participates in the phosphorylation of several substrates including Cdc25C, p53, and BRCA1, we first examined the kinase activity of Chk2 mutants. Using site-directed mutagenesis, four Chk2 mutants were generated (Fig. 1) that had been previously reported (12Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant GST·Chk2 proteins were expressed in insect cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads, and kinase activities were assessed using GST·Cdc25C (residues 200–256) as a substrate. As shown in Fig.2, one FHA domain mutant (I157T) exhibited wild-type activity whereas the other FHA domain mutant (R145W) showed reduced catalytic activity, and the two frameshift mutants lacked kinase activity.Figure 2In vitro kinase activities of wild-type or mutant Chk2.

Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Although Chk2 FHA domain mutants (R145W and I157T) retain some kinase activity (Fig. 2), they may not be activated by DNA damage. To explore this possibility, we have established HCT116 derivative cell lines that stably express comparable levels of HA epitope-tagged wild-type or mutant Chk2 (Fig.3 a). The expression levels of HA-tagged Chk2 in these cells are similar to that of endogenous Chk2 (Fig. 3 a). Like wild-type Chk2, the I157T Chk2 mutant was activated following gamma radiation, as demonstrated by its ability to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate Cdc25C (Fig. 3 b). However, the R145W Chk2 mutant was not activated following DNA damage (Fig. 3 b). The increase of Chk2 kinase activity is coincident with its phosphorylation following gamma radiation (1Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Both activation and phosphorylation of Chk2 depend on intact ATM kinase, strongly suggesting that ATM may phosphorylate Chk2 and activate its kinase activity following DNA damage (1Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). In vivo, Thr-68 of Chk2 is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner following gamma radiation (6Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the Chk2 mutants were phosphorylated at Thr-68 following gamma radiation. Cells expressing either wild-type or mutant HA-tagged Chk2 were irradiated. Wild-type and mutant Chk2 were immunoprecipitated using either anti-Chk2 or anti-HA antibody. Phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68 was detected by Western blotting using anti-Thr-68 phosphospecific antibody. In agreement with its activation following gamma radiation, ectopically expressed HA·Chk2 was phosphorylated at Thr-68 (Fig. 3 c). Moreover, consistent with the above findings that HA·Chk2 containing the I157T mutation but not the R145W mutation can be activated by DNA damage (Fig. 3 b), the I157T mutant but not the R145W mutant was phosphorylated at Thr-68 (Fig. 3 c). In addition, expression of the R145W mutant did not affect the phosphorylation of endogenous Chk2 in these cells (Fig. 3 c), suggesting that the mutant protein may not exhibit dominant-negative activity. Chk2 normally localizes to the nuclei. We examined the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutant HA-tagged Chk2 stably expressed in HCT116 derivative cell lines. Immunostaining using anti-HA antibodies revealed that wild-type and the R145W and I157T mutants of Chk2 all localized normally to nuclei (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the localization of wild-type or mutant Chk2 did not change following gamma radiation (data not shown). Because Chk2 R145W and I157T mutants are missense mutations within the FHA domain (involved in protein-protein interaction, Refs. 10Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol.

Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), we speculated that these Chk2 mutations might affect the association of Chk2 with other proteins. To investigate this possibility, we first used size-exclusion chromatography to determine the native size of Chk2 in HeLa and HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, endogenous Chk2 eluted from a Superdex 200 column mainly as a protein complex with an apparent M r ∼200,000, although a smaller portion of Chk2 eluted as a protein complex ofM r ∼600,000. Because only a very small amount of Chk2 eluted where monomeric Chk2 is predicted to elute, we conclude that the majority of Chk2 exists in complex(es) with other proteins. Alternatively, Chk2 may exist as multimers. We then examined the elution profiles of the stably expressed Chk2 mutants in these HCT116 derivative cell lines. As a control, HA-tagged wild-type Chk2 eluted with an apparent molecular weight identical to endogenous Chk2 (Fig. 5). The Chk2 I157T mutant eluted in fractions similar to that of wild-type Chk2. In contrast, the Chk2 R145W mutant eluted as a much larger protein complex (Fig. 5), suggesting that this mutant may affect the association of Chk2 with other proteins. The R145W mutation of Chk2 was identified in a colon cancer cell line HCT15 (12Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Based on sequence analysis, HCT15 carries one mutant allele (R145W) and one wild-type allele of Chk2 (12Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). It is speculated that the Chk2 mutation in HCT15 may contribute to tumorigenesis either as a result of reduced gene dosage or through a dominant-negative effect (12Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C. Shannon K.E. Lubratovich M. Verselis S.J. Isselbacher K.J. Fraumeni J.F. Birch J.M. Li F.P. Garber J.E. Haber D.A. Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Expression of this R145W mutant in HCT116 cells did not affect the phosphorylation (see Fig. 3 c) or the activation (data not shown) of endogenous Chk2, arguing that this mutant may not behave as a dominant-negative mutant. We also observed that, when the same amount of DNA encoding either wild-type or R145W mutant of Chk2 were used in transient transfection experiments, the expression level of R145W mutant was only 10–20% that of wild-type Chk2 (data not shown). These results suggest that the R145W mutation of Chk2 may affect the stability of this mutant Chk2 protein. Thus, it is possible that this mutant contributes to tumorigenesis because of haploid insufficiency. To examine whether mutation in HCT15 cells results in reduced levels of Chk2 protein, we compared Chk2 protein levels in HCT15 cells with that in K562, HCT116, or HeLa cells. If the presumed wild-type allele of Chk2 in HCT15 cells were expressed normally, we would expect to observe at most a 2-fold reduction in Chk2 protein levels. However, as shown in Fig. 6 a, Chk2 protein was barely detectable in the extract of HCT15 cells, whereas Chk2 protein was readily detected in extracts of K562, HeLa, and HCT116 cells. We estimate that the steady-state level of Chk2 in HCT15 cells is only 5–10% of that in other cell lines. Additionally, Chk2 kinase activity was undetectable in HCT15 cells (Fig. 6 b and data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the Chk2 expression from the second Chk2 allele is greatly reduced, if not absent, in HCT15 cells. The mechanism for the down-regulation of Chk2 expression is unknown. Because HCT15 carries inactivating mutations in both hMSH6 alleles, it is also possible that genomic instability in these cells may lead to the mutation in the second Chk2 allele. Such mutation, either at the promoter or in the coding sequence of Chk2, could result in reduced levels of Chk2 protein. In this study, we have characterized the four reported Chk2 mutations. Two mutations identified in Li-Fraumeni patients that lead to frameshifts at the C-terminal kinase domain result in loss of kinase activity. In contrast, the R145W Chk2 mutant still retains some kinase activity in vitro but is incapable of being activated following gamma radiation in vivo, most likely because it is not phosphorylated at Thr-68 by ATM kinase. This mutant also behaves differently from wild-type Chk2 in size-fractionation experiments, suggesting that this mutation may also affect associations of Chk2 with other cellular proteins. The I157T Chk2 mutant behaves similar to wild-type Chk2 in all the assays used in this study. The I157T mutation may be a rare polymorphism that does not affect Chk2 functions. Alternatively, this mutation may affect associations of Chk2 with certain cellular proteins in a way that does not result in apparent changes in the sizes of Chk2-containing protein complexes as revealed by size-exclusion chromatography. Identification of Chk2-associated proteins will provide us with some insights in this regard. It is interesting that the two mutations with the Chk2 FHA domain behave differently in our assays. The FHA domain of Chk2 may have multiple functions. FHA domain is involved in protein-phosphoprotein interaction (10Durocher D. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 15Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science. 1998; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). These interactions may be essential for transmitting DNA damage signals to Chk2. Any alternation of association of Chk2 with upstream signaling proteins could lead to the failure of Chk2 activation following DNA damage, as in the case of R145W mutant. In addition, the FHA domain may also mediate transmitting signals from Chk2 to downstream effectors such as p53, BRCA1, and Cdc25C. It is reasonable to speculate that the I157T mutant may be defective in this aspect of Chk2 function. One could examine whether any Chk2-dependent events, such as stabilization of p53 following gamma radiation (8Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), are defective in cells that carry only the I157T mutant of Chk2. Such experiments will provide insights into the mechanism of this Chk2 mutant. We thank Drs. Scott Kaufmann, Larry Karnitz, and Jann Sarkaria for stimulating conversations and Dr. Bin-Bing Zhou for antibodies against phosphorylated Thr-68 of Chk2."

After initial infection at the periphery, the virus enters sensory neurons and establishes a lifelong latent infection (for review, see Ref. 1Fields, B. N., Knipe, D. M., Howley, P. M., Virology, 3rd Ed., 2, 1996, Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia.Google Scholar). Periodic reactivation from latency usually results in mild illness symptoms such as cold sores. These episodes of reactivation have enabled the virus to evolve optimally in parallel with the host. During lytic infection, the HSV-1 152-kilobase pair double-stranded DNA genome expresses at least 74 temporarily regulated genes. These genes are classified as immediate-early (IE), early, and late, depending on the time course of their synthesis and requirement for prior viral gene expression and DNA replication. During latency, the viral genome undergoes dramatic changes resulting in an almost complete silencing of transcription (for review, see Ref. 2Wagner E.K. Bloom D.C. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 419-443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After successful penetration of the cell and release of viral DNA in the nucleus, the first step of a productive infection is the synthesis of IE proteins. Four of the five IE proteins encoded by HSV-1 regulate gene expression. ICP4 and ICP27 are essential for virus replication (3Preston C.M. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 228-239Crossref Google Scholar, 4Sacks W.R. Greene C.C. Aschman D.P. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 796-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ICP22 is dispensable for virus viability in most cell types (5Post L.E. Roizman B. Cell. 1981; 25: 227-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The requirement for ICP0 (also called Vmw110) for the onset of lytic infection is not absolute. Viruses either deficient for its expression or expressing an inactivated form of the protein, rather than being noninfectious in cultured cells, show a cell type- and multiplicity-dependent growth defect (6Stow N.D. Stow E.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). ICP0 appears to increase the probability of the initiation of productive infection. This feature assumes greater significance during reactivation of the virus from latency, because it has been shown that in the absence of ICP0 the probability for mutant viruses to reactivate is dramatically decreased both in cultured cells and in mouse models (7Clements J.B. Stow N.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 2501-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Leib D.A. Coen D.M. Bogard C.L. Hicks K.A. Yager D.R. Knipe D.M. Tyler K.L. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 759-768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This defect can be overcome in cultured cells by providing exogenous ICP0 (9Harris R.A. Everett R.D. Zhu X. Silverstein S. Preston C.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3513-3515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhu X. Chen J. Young C.S.H. Silverstein S. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4489-4498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Preston C.M. Nicholl M.J. J.

ICP0 is a RING finger zinc-binding protein that was initially studied because of its transactivation activity in transfection assays (reviewed in Ref. 13Everett R.D. Preston C.M. Stow N.D. Wagner E.K. The Control of Herpes Simplex Virus Gene Expression. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 50-76Google Scholar). The RING finger domain has been shown to be essential for the biological activities of ICP0 outlined above (for review, see Ref. 14Everett R.D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). New fields of interests arose after the discovery that ICP0 localizes to, and then disrupts, nuclear domains called ND10, nuclear dots, PML nuclear bodies, or promyelocytic oncogenic domains (15Ascoli C.A. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 16Maul G.G. Guldner H.H. Spivack J.G. J. Gen.

More recently, it was observed that centromeres are also targeted by ICP0 early in infection. Centromeres contain a number of specific proteins (reviewed in Ref. 18Pluta A.F. Mackay A.M. Ainsztein A.M. Goldberg I.G. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), several of which are recognized by anti-centromere autoimmune antibodies in the sera of patients with a variety of conditions (19Earnshaw W.C. Rothfield N. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1985; 91: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). CENP-B (80 kDa) is a sequence-specific α-satellite DNA-binding protein that localizes throughout the centromeric heterochromatin located beneath the kinetochore (20Matsumoto H. Sugimoto K. Okazaki T. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 181-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Cooke C.A. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). CENP-C (140 kDa) is an essential component of the inner kinetochore plate of active centromeres (22Warburton P.E. Cooke C.A. Bourassa S. Vafa O. Sullivan B.A. Stetten G. Gimelli G. Warburton D.

Maurer M. Rothfield N.F. Earnshaw W.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 115-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) that is required for maintaining proper kinetochore size and has been implicated in the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in mitotic cells by stabilizing microtubule attachments (24Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Saitoh H. Bernat R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because the 17-kDa CENP-A protein localizes in centromeres and copurifies with nucleosome core particles, it was suggested to function as a centromere-specific core histone (25Palmer D.K. O'Day K. Wener M.H. Andrews B.S. Margolis R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Indeed, CENP-A contains a histone H3-related histone fold domain and has been described as histone H3-like centromere protein (26Sullivan K.F. Hechenberger M. Masri K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). CENP-A is a homodimer (27Shelby R.D. Vafa O. Sullivan K.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) that localizes in the inner kinetochore plate and associates with α-satellite DNA. These observations suggest that there is a distinct nucleosome structure within the centromere (22Warburton P.E. Cooke C.A. Bourassa S. Vafa O. Sullivan B.A. Stetten G. Gimelli G. Warburton D. Tyler-Smith C. Sullivan K.F. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 901-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 28Vafa O. Sullivan K.F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 897-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that, in contrast to CENP-B (29Kapoor M. Montes de Oca Luna R. Liu G. Lozano G. Cummings C. Mancini M. Ouspenski I. Brinkley B.R. May G.S. Chromosoma. 1998; 107: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) but similarly to CENP-C, mouse CENP-A (termed Cenpa) is essential for the viability of embryos, which show in its absence severe mitotic problems early in their development (30Howman E.V. Fowler K.J. Newson A.J. Redward S. MacDonald A.C. Kalitsis P. Choo K.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that during HSV-1 infection CENP-C is degraded in an ICP0-dependent manner, and infected mitotic cells are arrested with condensed chromosomes distributed in a prometaphase-like arrangement termed pseudoprometaphase (31Bernat R.L. Borisy G.G. Rothchild N.F. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1519-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Findlay J. Lomonte P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 33Lomonte P. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9456-9467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it had been previously reported that anti-CENP-C antiserum was not sufficient to generate this phenotype in microinjected cells, and a pseudoprometaphase arrest was only observed after microinjection of cells with human anti-centromere autoimmune sera (24Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Saitoh H. Bernat R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Therefore we suggested that although degradation of CENP-C would undoubtedly contribute to the mitotic arrest of HSV-1-infected cells, the observed pseudoprometaphase phenotype is an indication of a destabilization of other centromere proteins (33Lomonte P. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9456-9467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we show that the 17-kDa CENP-A protein is degraded in HSV-1-infected cells in an ICP0- and proteasome-dependent manner. The use of cells expressing transiently and constitutively an influenza hemagglutinin (HA1) epitope-tagged derivative version of CENP-A shows that CENP-A is effectively degraded either during infection or as a result of the expression of fully functional ICP0 alone. These data are supported by immunofluorescence experiments that show the disappearance of CENP-A from centromeres in both infected and transfected cells. Because CENP-A is thought to be involved in the assembly of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin, this finding suggests a direct method by which the HSV-1 genome might be silenced during latency and quiescence and how this could be alleviated by ICP0. HSV-1 strain 17 syn+ (17+) was the parental strain used in this study. Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant virus tsK expresses nonfunctional ICP4 at 38.5 °C (3Preston C.M. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 228-239Crossref Google Scholar). Mutant in1330 is a derivative oftsK from which the IE1 gene encoding ICP0 has been deleted. ICP0 mutant viruses dl1403 and FXE (6Stow N.D. Stow E.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 34Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1185-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were also used. All viruses were grown and titrated in baby hamster kidney cells propagated in Glasgow modified Eagle's medium containing 10 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 10% tryptose phosphate broth. Hep2 cells and HeLa tTA-CAHA cells expressing an influenza hemagglutinin (HA1) epitope-tagged derivative version of CENP-A, CENP-A-HA (27Shelby R.D. Vafa O. Sullivan K.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as above. HeLa tTA-CAHA cultures were supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418, 330 ng/ml puromycin, and 1 μg/ml tetracyclin. Human fetal lung (HFL) cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine and 5% new born calf sera, 2% glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and antibiotics as above. Plasmids pCI110 and pCIFXE express ICP0 and its RING finger mutant, respectively (35Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 417-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pcDLCA-HA expresses the protein CENP-A-HA and has been described previously (26Sullivan K.F. Hechenberger M. Masri K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Hep2 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 24-well Linbro multiwell plates containing one coverslip and either infected or transfected the following day. After infection or transfection, cells were fixed for 10 min with formaldehyde (5% v/v of the 30% stock solution in PBS containing 2% sucrose), washed three times with PBS, then permeabilized for 5 min in a PBS solution containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 10% sucrose. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% newborn calf serum. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, coverslips were washed at least three times with PBS plus 1% newborn calf serum, and then treated with appropriate secondary antibodies. After a further 30-min incubation, coverslips were washed three times with PBS plus 1% newborn calf serum and then washed once with water before being mounted using Citifluor. Cell samples were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with three lasers giving excitation lines at 488, 543, and 633 nm. The data from the channels were collected separately to avoid channel overlap, with 8-fold averaging at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels using optical slices of ∼1 μm. The microscope was a Zeiss Axioplan utilizing either × 40 or × 63 oil immersion objective lenses, numerical aperture 1.4. Data sets were processed using the LSM 510 software and then exported for preparation for printing using Adobe Photoshop. Antibodies used for immunofluorescence were as follows: monoclonal antibodies 11060 (dilution 1:1,000) against ICP0 and 58S (dilution 1:50) against ICP4, respectively (see Refs. 36Everett R.D. Cross A. Orr A. Virology. 1993; 197: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar and37Showalter L.D. Zweig M. Hampar B. Infect. Immun. 1981; 34: 684-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human anti-centromere autoimmune (huACA) serum (dilution 1:20,000) (19Earnshaw W.C. Rothfield N. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1985; 91: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), and monospecific rabbit anti-CENP-A (dilution 1:500) (38Valdivia M.M. Figueroa J. Iglesias C. Ortı̀z M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used were fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, 1:100), Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:500) and anti-rabbit (1:5000) IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Cy5-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:500) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HFL cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 24-well Linbro multiwell plates and infected 48 h later. HeLa tTA-CAHA cells were seeded at 0.5 × 105 cells per well in medium not containing tetracycline to induce synthesis of CENP-A-HA. Forty-eight h later the medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 1 μg/ml tetracycline to repress synthesis of CENP-A-HA for 24 h. Cells were then infected and harvested for Western blotting. For the preparation of nuclear fractions, HFL cells were harvested after infection in 100 μl of a hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 6000 ×g for 4 min, supernatants were removed, and pellets containing nuclei were resuspended in 70 μl of Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12.5%) were prepared and run in the Bio-Rad MiniProtean II apparatus, and then proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA85, Schleicher & Schüll) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After blocking in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% dried milk overnight at 4 °C, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody in PBST, 5% dried milk at room temperature and then washed in PBST at least three times before incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in PBST, 2% dried milk at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing, filters were soaked in improved bioluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film. Primary antibodies were as follows: huACA serum (dilution 1:10,000), mAb 11060 (dilution 1:10,000), and mAb 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) against HA-1 epitope (dilution 1 μg/ml). Hep2 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-well Linbro multiwell plates. The following day, plasmid pcDL CA-HA (40 ng) and plasmid pCIneo, pCI110, or pCIFXE (350 ng) were cotransfected according to the manufacturer's recommendations (LipofectAMINE PLUS, Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four h later, cells were harvested for Western blotting. Alternatively, the medium was changed and replaced by fresh complete medium containing the proteasome inhibitor MG132 at a concentration of 5 μm. Cells were then harvested 0, 2, 4, and 8 h post-addition of MG132 for Western blotting. To analyze the putative degradation of centromere proteins other than CENP-C during infection, we performed Western blotting of HSV-1-infected cell extracts using a huACA serum that can recognize centromere proteins CENP-A, -B, and -C having molecular masses of 17, 80, and 140 kDa, respectively (19Earnshaw W.C. Rothfield N. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1985; 91: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). However, it is not unusual that only one or two of these proteins are predominantly detected by Western blotting, with CENP-A seemingly being the most antigenic. A complex signal was detected at the high molecular weight range because of the recognition of multiple viral proteins by anti-herpesvirus protein antibodies often present in human sera (data not shown). We thus restricted the number of viral proteins synthesized in infected cells using the temperature-sensitive virus tsK and its ICP0-deficient derivative in1330, which express nonfunctional ICP4 at 38.5 °C and therefore synthesize only the viral IE proteins (3Preston C.M. J. Virol. 1979; 29: 228-239Crossref Google Scholar). Coupled with the use of nuclear extracts, this approach limited the number of viral antigens detected by the huACA serum. HFL cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 20 plaque-forming units per cell and harvested 1.5, 4, and 6 h post-infection. Analysis by Western blotting demonstrated that a 17-kDa (hereafter referred to as 17K/CENP-A) protein was noticeably diminished by 4 h post-infection in cells infected by tsK (see Fig.1 B). The detection of this protein by the huACA serum and its electrophoretic mobility were consistent with it being CENP-A. 17K/CENP-A was not affected in cells infected by in1330, suggesting that ICP0 was implicated in the effect. The expression of ICP0 in cells infected by tsKbut not in1330 was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the membrane with mAb 11060 anti-ICP0 (data not shown). Parallel analysis demonstrated that, as expected, the ICP0 target proteins CENP-C and PML (32Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Findlay J. Lomonte P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 41Everett R.D. Freemont P. Saitoh H. Dasso M. Orr A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6581-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were also degraded in tsK- but notin1330-infected cells (data not shown). A 15-kDa protein detected beneath 17K/CENP-A by huACA was also detected by rabbit 554 and rabbit-L sera against CENP-C and CENP-B, respectively (21Cooke C.A. Bernat R.L. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 24Tomkiel J. Cooke C.A. Saitoh H. Bernat R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 531-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), making it a protein nonspecifically recognized by at least three different sera directed against centromeric proteins (data not shown). Because we did not expect to detect too many viral antigens at the low molecular weight range that would interfere with the detection of 17K/CENP-A, we then performed Western blotting on HFL cells infected by HSV-1 viruses expressing the wild type (17+) or the RING finger mutant (FXE) version of ICP0 and the ICP0-null mutant dl1403. Although the effect was usually less efficient than that withtsK, wild type HSV-1 still induced the degradation of 17K/CENP-A, whereas dl1403 and FXE did not (Fig.1 A). The efficiency of 17K/CENP-A degradation intsK-infected cells correlates with the large amount of ICP0 synthesized in those cells compared with 17+-infected cells (about 10 times more) at the same time post-infection and at the same multiplicity of infection (data not shown). Given the better efficiency of degradation obtained using the tsK virus, we decided to perform subsequent Western blots using this virus for cell infections. Recently several cellular proteins have been reported to undergo degradation in an ICP0- and proteasome-dependent manner during HSV-1 infection. We thus checked whether 17K/CENP-A was degraded via the same pathway. We performed infections of HFL cells in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 under conditions that do not interfere with viral gene expression (41Everett R.D. Freemont P. Saitoh H. Dasso M. Orr A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6581-6591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 Bshows that, as expected, the 17K/CENP-A degradation was sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor MG132. These results show that a 17-kDa protein recognized by huACA antibodies, which is most likely CENP-A, is degraded in infected cells with an efficiency correlating with the amount of ICP0 synthesized, and this effect is dependent on the presence of ICP0 and its RING finger domain and on an active proteasome pathway. To visualize the effects of infection on the nuclear distribution of CENP-A, immunofluorescence was performed on Hep2 cells infected for 2 or 8 h with viruses 17+,dl1403, or FXE. CENP-A, centromeres, and infected cells were detected using a monospecific rabbit serum, huACA, and monoclonal antibodies against ICP0 or ICP4, respectively. Two h post-infection, CENP-A was still present at centromeres of infected cells (data not shown). Eight h post-infection, CENP-A was no longer detected at centromeres of cells infected by wild type virus (Fig.2 A, panels A–D), whereas those infected by dl1403 (Fig.2 A, panels E–H) or FXE (Fig.2 A, panels I–L) still retained CENP-A in centromeres. Of note is the decrease in centromere labeling by the huACA serum in wild type virus-infected cells, which is probably because CENP-A is one of the major antigens recognized by this serum (19Earnshaw W.C. Rothfield N. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1985; 91: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The addition of MG132 at the start of the infection abrogated the disappearance of CENP-A in 17+-infected cells, which correlates with the absence of degradation of 17K/CENP-A observed by Western blotting under the same experimental conditions (data not shown). Although wild type-infected cells attempting mitosis are highly likely to be blocked at pseudoprometaphase, a very small percentage can still be found in metaphase or anaphase (see Ref. 33Lomonte P. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9456-9467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CENP-A is undoubtedly implicated in some aspects of mitosis (30Howman E.V. Fowler K.J. Newson A.J. Redward S. MacDonald A.C. Kalitsis P. Choo K.H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), we checked the distribution of CENP-A in infected cells at different stages of mitosis. All wild type virus-infected mitotic cells with a pseudoprometaphase phenotype (determined by the distribution of unstained chromosomes in the background staining of infected mitotic cells; for more details see Ref. 32Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Findlay J. Lomonte P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) showed no CENP-A present at centromeres (Fig. 2 B, panel A). Interestingly, the very small number of infected cells found in metaphase still possessed CENP-A at the centromeres (Fig.2 B, panel B). Virus FXE- anddl1403-infected mitotic cells could be found at the same frequency at the different stages of the cell cycle, with no alteration in the CENP-A distribution (see the telophasedl1403-infected cell as an example (Fig. 2 B,panel C)). These data show that the expression of ICP0 in infected cells results in the disappearance of CENP-A from centromeres, an effect that is dependent on the RING finger domain of ICP0. Moreover, it is likely that CENP-A is required at centromeres for a mitotic cell to reach metaphase, because in its absence the phenotype most commonly observed in wild type HSV-1-infected mitotic cells is pseudoprometaphase. ICP0 alone was able to induce the loss of CENP-A from centromeres, because Hep2 cells transfected with plasmids expressing wild type ICP0 or its RING finger mutant FXE gave results similar to those observed in infected cells (Fig.3). These results confirm the essential role played by ICP0 and rule out any requirement for other viral proteins. As expected, the RING finger mutant protein FXE (which does not localize in centromeres) had no effect on the distribution of CENP-A. The results obtained so far have shown that HSV-1 is able to induce the degradation of the 17K/CENP-A protein recognized by huACA serum in an ICP0- and proteasome-dependent manner. These results correlate with the loss of CENP-A from centromeres both in infected and transfected cells. The rabbit anti-CENP-A serum used in the immunofluorescence studies gave poor results in our Western blotting experiments; so to demonstrate unequivocally that CENP-A is degraded during HSV-1 infection and to show that ICP0 alone was responsible for that effect, we used either HeLa tTA-CAHA cells, which constitutively express an influenza hemagglutinin (HA1) epitope-tagged derivative of CENP-A (CENP-A-HA), or cells transfected with plasmid pcDLCA-HA, which expresses the same protein (26Sullivan K.F. Hechenberger M. Masri K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 27Shelby R.D. Vafa O. Sullivan K.F. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Prior to infection, HeLa tTA-CAHA cells were treated as described under “Experimental Procedures” to induce CENP-A-HA expression. Fig.4 A shows a significant reduction of the amount of CENP-A-HA protein in cells infected by thetsK virus expressing wild type ICP0. This effect was abrogated in the presence of MG132 (data not shown) and did not occur in in1330-infected cells. The relatively less efficient degradation of CENP-A-HA compared with 17K/CENP-A could be explained by the somehow exogenous nature of CENP-A-HA, whose synthesis from a constitutive promoter could increase its amount compared with endogenous 17K/CENP-A. Immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the loss of CENP-A-HA from centromeres in tsK- and wild type-infected cells but not in in1330-, dl1403-, or FXE-infected cells, results identical to those observed for endogenous CENP-A (data not shown, but see Fig. 2 A). These results perfectly match those observed for the degradation of 17K/CENP-A and demons"

We have previously shown that triptolide blocks NF-κB activation and sensitizes tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α)-resistant tumor cell lines to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We show here that triptolide enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In triptolide-treated cells, the expression of p53 increased but the transcriptional function of p53 was inhibited, and we observed a down-regulation of p21 waf1/cip1 , a p53-responsive gene. The increase in levels of the p53 protein was mediated by enhanced translation of the p53 protein. Additionally, triptolide induced accumulation of cells in S phase and blocked doxorubicin-mediated accumulation of cells in G2/M and doxorubicin-mediated induction of p21. Our data suggest that triptolide, by blocking p21-mediated growth arrest, enhances apoptosis in tumor cells.

Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Various post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions stabilize the level of the p53 protein (1Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). For example, DNA-dependent protein kinase and mutated in ataxia telangiectasia phosphorylate p53 at serine 15 activating p53 following DNA damage, but Mdm2, through association with p53, negatively regulates p53 by translocating p53 from the nucleus to the cytosol and mediating the ubiquitin/proteosome degradation of p53 (2Freedman D.A. Wu L. Levine A.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 96-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 3Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Levine A.J. Vousden K.H. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 87-92PubMed Google Scholar). A less well characterized mechanism is translational regulation of p53 (4Fu L. Minden M.D. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4392-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Translational regulation of p53 expression is controlled by a negative autoregulatory feedback (4Fu L. Minden M.D. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4392-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5Chu E. Copur S.M. Ju J. Chen T.M. Khleif S. Voeller D.M. Mizunuma N. Patel M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Allegra C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1582-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The p53 protein interacts with its 3′-untranslated region (UTR)1by binding to a 330-nucleotide region at the distal end of the 3′-UTR. For example, following γ-irradiation, there is enhanced translation of p53 mRNA without an increase in p53 stability. This is mediated, at least in part, by the increased binding of p53 mRNAs to polysomes (6Ju J. Pedersen-Lane J. Maley F. Chu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3769-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Fu L. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4117-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The increase in p53 protein in response to various stresses is an important regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis (1Amundson S.A. Myers T.G. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3287-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In transcription-dependent p53 activation, p53 functions as a site-specific transcription factor that induces p53-inducible genes such as p21 cip1/waf1 , bax, gadd45, andmdm2. This in turn initiates the program of growth arrest or apoptosis in a stress-specific and/or cell type-specific manner (reviewed in Ref. 8El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). p53 also acts as a transcriptional repressor by inhibiting the expression of genes such as c-fos, DNA polymerase α, microtubule-associated protein 4, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, presenilin-1, RelA, and bcl-2(reviewed in Refs. 8El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 9Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J.

However, the exact mechanism(s) by which p53 mediates apoptosis is still elusive. Also, recent studies suggest that the transactivation function of p53 is not required for p53-dependent apoptosis and that transrepression may play a role in inducing apoptosis (8El-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 10Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 11Haupt Y. Rowan S.

For example, Bcl-2, adenovirus E1B 19K, and the tumor suppressor WT1 inhibit apoptosis and suppress p53-dependent transcriptional repression but not transactivation (10Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis has been demonstrated through overexpression of MAP4 that supports a potential role for p53-dependent transrepression in mediating apoptosis (9Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The p53 gene is inactivated in ∼50% of tumors. The effect of p53 inactivation on the response of tumors to chemotherapy or radiation is conflicting with some studies showing enhanced sensitivity and others showing increased resistance to the same compounds. Two recent studies have shown that p53-mediated induction of p21 inhibits the apoptotic response by inducing growth arrest (13Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L.

J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), for example, show that p53- or p21-deficient cells are more sensitive to adriamycin (doxorubicin)-induced apoptosis than wild-type cells because they do not induce p21 in response to doxorubicin. Therefore, a compound that blocks chemotherapy-mediated growth arrest may accelerate and enhance apoptosis. A crude extract from the Chinese herb, Tripterygium wilfordii, also called T2, has been used as an immunosuppressant for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. One purified component of T2, the diterpene triepoxide triptolide is immunosuppressive and cytotoxic to tumor cells, and a recent study showed that triptolide inhibits cytokine-mediated activation of NF-κB in immune cells (15Qiu D.

Recently, our laboratory has shown that triptolide sensitizes tumor cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB (18Lee K.Y. Chang W. Qiu D. Kao P.N. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13451-13455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We also found that triptolide, alone, induces apoptosis in solid tumor cells. To elucidate further the mechanism of triptolide-induced apoptosis, we investigated a potential role for the p53 pathway. In this study, we show that triptolide and doxorubicin act in synergy to kill tumor cells. Interestingly, we find that triptolide induces translation and phosphorylation of p53, but triptolide-modified p53 is transcriptionally inactive. Tritpolide also blocks doxorubicin-mediated induction of p21 and doxorubicin-mediated growth arrest. Our results suggest that triptolide enhances doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis, at least in part, by blocking p21-mediated growth arrest. PG490 (triptolide, MW 360) was obtained from Pharmagenesis (Palo Alto, CA). A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) and HT1080 (fibrosarcoma) cell lines were from ATCC. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (p53 +/+ and p53 −/−) cell lines were provided by Dr. Amato J. Giaccia (Stanford University). Doxorubicin, cycloheximide, and the anti-FLAG (M2) antibody were obtained from Sigma. Antibodies for p53, p21 waf1/cip1 and protein phosphatase-1 were from Calbiochem. A549 and HT1080 cells were cultured in the appropriate media with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. p53 wild-type (+/+) and null (−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transfected with the E1A/Ras were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The full-length coding region of human p21 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from HT1080 cells with oligo primers 5′-GGATCCGCCACCATGTCAGAACCGGCTGGGG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTCGAGGGGCTTCCTCTTGGAGAAGATCAG-3′. The 3′ primer was manipulated to add an in-frame FLAG-tag sequence before the stop codon. Subsequently, the cDNA fragments were cloned into the pIND, ecdysone-inducible vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The full-length sequence of human p21 coding region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNA of β-galactosidase (LacZ) was cloned into the same vector as a control. Transfection into HT1080 cells was performed with the LipofectAMINE Plus kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HT-1080 cells at 70% confluence were cotransfected with 1 μg of pINDp21FLAG or pINDLacZ-FLAG plus 1 μg of pVgRXR (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA) in 6-well plates. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with fresh media. Then 48 h after transfection, cells from each well were transferred into three 10-cm culture dishes. After overnight culture, stable transfectants were selected by adding 600 μg/ml of zeocin (Invitrogen) and 800 μg/ml G-418 (Life Technologies). The selection was carried on for 2 weeks. Individual clones were isolated and tested for protein expression induced by the addition of 5 μm ponasterone A (Invitrogen). HT-1080 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 2 × 105 per well the day before the treatment. For the inducible expression of exogenous p21 and LacZ, the stable transfectants were cultured in the presence of 5 μm ponasterone A for 16 h. Three fields from each well were carefully selected, marked, and counted to ensure a similar cell number greater than 300 cells per field before the treatment. The cells were untreated or treated with doxorubicin, triptolide, or the combination of both at indicated dosages for 8 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with new media plus 5 μm ponasterone A. After 16 h incubation at 37 °C, the number of viable cells within the same fields were determined by trypan blue exclusion with a 2% trypan blue solution. Cell death was confirmed as apoptotic by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by FACS analysis as described previously (19Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J.

Cells were harvested at the conditions and times indicated and lysed using HNET buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 100 μg of protein was loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously using a p53 mouse monoclonal antibody from Oncogene Research Products (19Wen L.P. Fahrni J.A. Troie S. Guan J.L. Orth K. Rosen G.D. J. Biol.

To measure p53 half-life, cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) was added to HT1080 cells 30 min after the addition of triptolide and harvested at the times shown for immunoblot analysis of p53. Immunoblot analysis using other antibodies was performed as described above. The band intensity was measured by NIH Image 1.62. HT1080 cells (2 × 106) were treated with triptolide (20 ng/ml) and/or doxorubicin (100 nm) for 16 h. Cells were then harvested and washed with cold PBS. The cells were resuspended gently in 5 ml of 100% ethanol and fixed at 25 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with DNase-free RNase A (200 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS. Propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were separated by sonicating at 20% output level for 15 s using a VirSonic 50 sonicator (Vitis Inc., NY). The samples were then sorted by FACS, and cell cycle analysis was done with FlowJo (version 3.0.3) (Tree Start, Inc, San Carlos, CA). Cells were grown to 80% confluence followed by pretreatment with triptolide (20 ng/ml) for 6 h in the appropriate medium. Cells were washed twice with short term labeling medium (RPMI with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin). To deplete intracellular pools of methionine, short term labeling medium was added for 15 min at 37 °C and then replaced by short term labeling medium containing 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were labeled for 30 min at 37 °C and washed with ice-cold PBS before harvesting for immunoprecipitation. The cells were lysed using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and immunoprecipitated using an agarose-conjugated p53 mAb (Ab-6, Oncogene Research Products) followed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The intensity of labeled p53 protein was measured by NIH Image 1.62. Subconfluent HT1080 cells were pretreated with 20 ng/ml triptolide for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. These cells were washed twice with 37 °C labeling medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum dialyzed against phosphate-free) lacking sodium phosphate. Cells were then labeled for an additional 1 h with the labeling medium containing 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate and 20 ng/ml triptolide. The labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The cells were scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15m NaCl, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and 100 units/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 10 min. Lysates were passed through 27-gauge needles and spun at 11,000 × g for 10 min, and 100 μg of the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with p53 mAb (Ab-6) conjugated with agarose for 4 h. Samples were then spun at 2500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min and washed three times with the lysis buffer. The pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. The bands were visualized and quantified by Optiquant PhosphorImager. Triptolide is a diterpene triepoxide extracted from a Chinese herb with potent immunosuppressive effects (15Qiu D. Zhao G.

We have recently shown that triptolide sensitizes several solid tumor cell lines to TNF-α-induced apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB. To examine if triptolide also sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy, we examined if triptolide enhances cell death induced by doxorubicin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor. After 24 h of treatment, doxorubicin (100 nm) or triptolide (5 ng/ml) alone did not reduce HT1080 cell viability (Fig. 1). The combination of triptolide (5 ng/ml) plus doxorubicin reduced cell viability by 65% (Fig. 1). Triptolide alone at 20 ng/ml reduced HT1080 cell viability by 84% (Fig. 1). Cytotoxic synergy between triptolide and doxorubicin was also observed in A549 lung cancer cells, and triptolide also enhanced cell death by carboplatinum, another topoisomerase II inhibitor, in A549 and HT1080 cells (data not shown). Doxorubicin did not induce NF-κB transcriptional activity in HT1080 cells so that triptolide is not enhancing doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis through inhibition of NF-κB (data not shown). p53 mediates cell death responses to cytotoxic stimuli such as hypoxia, irradiation, and DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Since triptolide alone is cytotoxic and it cooperates with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents, we hypothesized that triptolide-induced apoptosis may be mediated by p53. In HT1080 cells that contain wild-type p53, triptolide (20 ng/ml) increased p53 steady-state protein levels 4-fold for 9 h, and triptolide (5 ng/ml) induced a 2.4-fold increase in p53 (Fig.2 A). Doxorubicin induced a 4.9-fold increase in p53, and the combination of doxorubicin plus triptolide induced a 4-fold increase in p53 protein (Fig.2 A). In A549 cells, the combination of triptolide (20 ng/ml) plus doxorubicin (100 nm) at 24 h showed greater than 5-fold increase in p53 (data not shown). We next examined if the increase in the p53 protein level was due to an increase in the p53 mRNA. The level of p53 mRNA was not affected by triptolide (data not shown). These data suggest, therefore, that triptolide induces post-transcriptional accumulation of p53. A current model of p53-mediated apoptosis is that upon cellular stresses (such as DNA damage), p53 is stabilized, and this increases expression of genes such as mdm2, bax, p21 cip1/waf1 , and gadd45. Recent studies show that doxorubicin and γ-irradiation-mediated activation of p53 in p53 wild-type cells induces p21 and causes growth arrest which inhibits apoptosis (13Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar,14Wang Y.A. Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14590-14595Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). To determine whether triptolide enhances doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis by blocking p21-mediated growth arrest, we examined the effect of triptolide on p21 expression. Triptolide (20 ng/ml) reduced basal p21 levels by 50% despite inducing p53 (Fig. 2 A). Doxorubicin induced a 14.5-fold increase in p21 that was completely blocked by triptolide (20 ng/ml), and triptolide (5 ng/ml) reduced doxorubicin-mediated induction of p53 by 58%. We planned to examine the effect of triptolide on p21 expression in p53 wild-type and null MEFs, but p21 basal expression is almost absent in p53 −/− MEFs, and it is not inducible by doxorubicin (Fig.2 B and data not shown). Triptolide (20 ng/ml) also completely blocked doxorubicin-mediated induction of p21 mRNA (Fig. 3 A). Triptolide or doxorubicin did not affect p21 expression in the p53 mutant HT29 colon cancer cell line (data not shown). Triptolide also blocked doxorubicin-mediated induction of mdm2 mRNA, but it did not affect gadd45 or map4 mRNA expression (Fig. 3 B). These data show that triptolide alone inhibits transcription of p21, and it blocks doxorubicin-mediated transcriptional induction of p21 despite increasing p53 levels. Triptolide induces p53 but inhibits p21 expression. Also, triptolide blocks doxorubicin-mediated induction of p21. We then performed EMSA to determine whether triptolide, alone or in combination with doxorubicin, inhibits DNA binding of p53 to a p53 consensus binding site in the p21 promoter. Triptolide alone slightly enhanced DNA binding of p53, and it did not block doxorubicin-mediated induction of DNA binding (Fig.4). These data suggest triptolide represses expression of p21 by blocking transactivation but not DNA binding of p53. We then evaluated the effect of triptolide alone and in combination with chemotherapy on cell cycle progression. Triptolide (20 ng/ml) alone increased the number of cells in S phase from 23.7% in unstimulated cells to 46% in triptolide-treated cells (Fig.5). Doxorubicin induced accumulation of cells in G2/M from 11 to 49.8%, but triptolide inhibited doxorubicin-mediated G2/M accumulation from 49.8 to 22.6% (Fig. 5). A recent study showed that potent inhibition of tumor survival is achieved by combining drugs with different cell cycle checkpoints (20Li C.J. Li Y.Z. Pinto A.V. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Li et al. (20Li C.J. Li Y.Z. Pinto A.V. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) show that β-lapachone inhibits taxol-mediated G2/M arrest which leads to enhanced apoptosis through generation of conflicting signals regarding cell cycle progression versus arrest. Since p21 mediates G2/M arrest in p53 wild-type cells in response to chemotherapy, our data suggest that triptolide inhibits doxorubicin-mediated G2/M arrest by blocking induction of p21. To determine whether triptolide-mediated inhibition of p21 is involved in the cytotoxic synergy between triptolide and doxorubicin, we overexpressed p21 in HT1080 cells using a ponasterone-inducible p21 vector (pIND-p21). The addition of ponasterone A (5 μm) strongly induced exogenous p21 expression that was slightly reduced by triptolide plus doxorubicin (Fig. 6 A). The combination of triptolide (5 ng/ml) and doxorubicin (100 nm) reduced cell viability to 30% in the induced vector control, and viability increased to 58% following the induction of exogenous p21 (Fig.6 B). To determine the mechanism by which triptolide induces p53, we examined the effect of triptolide on p53 protein stability and translation. To examine the effect on stability, we examined levels of p53 in the presence of cycloheximide (30 μg/ml) in HT1080 cells, a dose that blocks translation. In cells that were pretreated with triptolide (20 ng/ml) for 0.5 h prior to the addition of cycloheximide, there was a slight increase in p53 stability at 30 min, but there was no difference from untreated cells at 60 min (Fig.7 A). These data suggested that the increased steady-state level of the p53 protein in response to triptolide did not result from an increase in the half-life of the p53 protein. We then examined if triptolide induces translation of p53 byin vivo [35S]methionine metabolic labeling of HT1080 cells. We found, interestingly, that triptolide induced a 4.9-fold increase in p53 translation (Fig. 7 B). Thus, triptolide-induced p53 accumulation is mediated by an increase in p53 translation. Many studies have shown that phosphorylation of p53 in response to DNA damage regulates p53-mediated apoptosis and transcriptional activity (21Meek D.W. Campbell L.E. Jardine L.J. Knippschild U.

A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined if p53 undergoes hyperphosphorylation upon triptolide treatment in HT1080 cells. There was a 2–3-fold increase in phosphorylated p53 in triptolide-treated cells compared with p53 from the untreated cells (Fig. 8). Western blot analyses of the samples show equivalent levels of immunoprecipitated p53 in both samples (Fig. 8). These data show that triptolide induces phosphorylation of p53 at 3 h that is prior to the triptolide-mediated induction of p53 protein expression. We have recently shown that triptolide cooperates with TNF-α to enhance apoptosis in solid tumor cells (18Lee K.Y. Chang W. Qiu D. Kao P.N. Rosen G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13451-13455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We found that triptolide sensitizes tumor cells to TNF-α by blocking TNF-α-mediated activation of NF-κB. Triptolide, however, blocked transactivation but not DNA binding of NF-κB. Triptolide is an oxygenated diterpene purified from the Chinese herb T. wilfordii with anti-inflammatory and tumoricidal properties in vitro andin vivo (15Qiu D. Zhao G. Aoki Y. Shi L. Uyei A.

Triptolide with its three expoxides may act as an electrophile possibly inactivating target molecules through alkylation and reaction with exposed cysteines. We are presently looking for targets of triptolide in tumor cells. Here we show that triptolide enhances chemotherapy-induced cell death in p53 wild-type cells. Triptolide induced p53 protein expression but inhibits basal p21 expression and doxorubicin-mediated induction of p21. We observed that p21 levels are almost undetectable in p53 −/− cells suggesting that p53 is also required for basal p21 (Fig. 2 B). These data likely reflect the inhibitory effect of triptolide on transcriptional activity but not DNA binding of p53 which is analogous to triptolide blocking transactivation and not DNA binding of NF-κB. Triptolide, however, is not a general transcriptional inhibitor because it does not inhibit growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible (gadd45) elongation factor-α (EF-1α) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression (GAPDH) (Fig.3 B). 2J. J. Kang and G. D. Rosen, unpublished results. Additionally, we observed that triptolide induces phosphorylation of p53, but this is the first example of a modification of p53 that inhibits p21 expression. We are presently mapping the site(s) of p53 that is phosphorylated by triptolide and that may provide insight into the mechanism of triptolide-mediated transcriptional repression of p21. A recent study showed that doxorubicin-mediated activation of p53 induces p21 in tumor cells which inhibits apoptosis by inducing growth arrest. Bunz et al. (13Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C.

Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) show that inhibition of p21-mediated growth arrest sensitizes these tumor cells to doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis (13Bunz F.

Elson A. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14590-14595Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We show here that triptolide inhibits p21-mediated accumulation of cells in G2/M and induces accumulation of cells in S phase. Also, in combination with doxorubicin triptolide enhances apoptosis in p53 wild-type tumor cells, and overexpression of p21 inhibits the cytotoxic synergy between triptolide and doxorubicin. Triptolide, however, does not repress p21 expression in p53 mutant tumor cells, but it does induce accumulation of p53 mutant cells in S phase.2 A possible explanation for the triptolide-mediated accumulation of cells in late G1/S would be inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (cdk-2) activity, but triptolide does not affect cdk-2 activity in HT1080 cells. 3C. Chung and G. D. Rosen, unpublished results. Therefore, triptolide may directly inhibit cyclins required for G1/S transition such as cyclin A, cyclin D, and cyclin E or block cdk-4 or cdk-6 activity. Li et al. (20Li C.J. Li Y.Z. Pinto A.V. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), for example, recently showed that cells treated with drugs that activate different cell cycle checkpoints, β-lapachone and taxol, produce conflicting signals that enhance tumor cell apoptosis (20Li C.J. Li Y.Z. Pinto A.V. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We show here that not only do triptolide and doxorubicin affect different cell cycle checkpoints but triptolide blocks p21-mediated G2/M arrest which likely enhances apoptosis by blocking growth arrest. Topoisomerase I inhibitors such as β-lapachone and CPT-1I also induce accumulation of cells in S phase in a p53-independent manner. Triptolide, however, does not affect topoisomerase I activity. 4M. Gao and G. D. Rosen, unpublished results. Our data presented here suggest that triptolide enhances doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis, at least in part, by blocking p21-mediated G2/M arrest. We observed that triptolide induces translation of p53. A recent study demonstrated that p53 translation is inhibited in the presence of increased levels of p53 protein by binding of p53 protein to its corresponding mRNA in the 5′-untranslated region which inhibits further translation of p53 (24Mosner J. Mummenbrauer T. Bauer C. Sczakiel G. Grosse F. Deppert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4442-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Also, there are unidentified 3′-UTR binding factor(s) that are essential for regulating translation of p53 (24Mosner J. Mummenbrauer T. Bauer C. Sczakiel G. Grosse F. Deppert W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4442-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, we are examining if triptolide directly binds to p53 or modifies factors that regulate translation of p53. We are also in the process of determining if triptolide enhances the redistribution of p53 messages to polysomes as seen in DNA damage induced by γ-irradiation. In addition, a recent study showed that N-acetylcysteine induces apoptosis in tumor cells via a p53-translational-dependent mechanism involving the cellular redox potential (25Liu M. Pelling J.C. Ju J. Chu E. Brash D.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1723-1729PubMed Google Scholar). Since triptolide shows enhanced cytotoxicity in combination with DNA-damaging agents, it may also interfere with DNA repair. It has been reported (26Hall S.R. Campbell L.E. Meek D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) that casein kinase II phosphorylates p53 at serine 386 which causes p53-mediated repression. The proline-rich region of the p53 protein has been shown to be important in chromatin remodeling and is required to overcome p53-mediated transcriptional repression (27Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic activity of triptolide alone and its ability to cooperate with other cytotoxic agents may represent a novel method to enhance cytolysis of solid tumor cells in vivo. In support of this observation, we have found that PG490-88, a water-soluble derivative of triptolide, cooperates with chemotherapy to cause tumor regression in a tumor xenograft model. 5J. M. Fidler and G. D. Rosen, unpublished results. We thank Amato Giaccia and Rudy Alarcon (Stanford University) for p53 −/− cells and for helpful discussions; James Ford (Stanford University) for helpful discussions; and E. S.

https://openalex.org/W1972798612,"The precerebellar system provides the principal input to the cerebellum and is essential for coordinated motor activity. Using a FLP recombinase–based fate mapping approach, we provide direct evidence in the mouse that this ventral brainstem system derives from dorsally located rhombic neuroepithelium. Moreover, by fate mapping at the resolution of a gene expression pattern, we have uncovered an unexpected subdivision within the precerebellar primordium: embryonic expression of Wnt1 appears to identify the class of precerebellar progenitors that will later project mossy fibers from the brainstem to the cerebellum, as opposed to the class of precerebellar neurons that project climbing fibers. Differential gene expression therefore appears to demarcate two populations within the precerebellar primordium, grouping progenitors by their future type of axonal projection and synaptic partner rather than by final topographical position."

Many Bcl-2 family proteins are capable of physically interacting with each other, forming a complex network of homo- and heterodimers, and these physical interactions sometimes play important roles in the opposing effects of pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the family. The pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family can be broadly classified into two groups. One group, including Bax, Bak, and Bok in humans, shares structural similarity with the pore-forming domains of certain bacterial toxins and is capable of forming pores in synthetic membranesin vitro (9Schendel S.

These proteins exhibit cytotoxic effects independently of their ability to bind other Bcl-2 family proteins including Bcl-2 and other cytoprotective members of the family such as Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1. The second group of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins varies widely in their amino acid sequences, often containing only a single region of similarity, specifically, the BH3 domain. These “BH3-only” proteins appear to possess no intrinsic or autonomous cytodestructive activity and instead operate as trans-dominant inhibitors of the survival proteins. Their antagonism of proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL depends on binding via their BH3 domains to a hydrophobic pocket on target anti-apoptotic proteins (13Kelekar A. Thompson C.B.

Thus, it is important to identify all members of the Bcl-2 family and to delineate the cellular contexts in which they contribute to apoptosis regulation. In this report, we have described the cloning and initial characterization of a new member of the Bcl-2 family, Bcl-G. TBLAST searches of the public databases using human Bcl-2 as a query sequence revealed a short EST (GenBankTM/EBI no. AW000827) from colonic mucosa of 3 patients with Crohn's disease, which contains an open reading frame (ORF) encoding sequences similar to the BH2 domain of Bcl-2 family proteins. An oligonucleotide primer (5′-GTACTTGGTGCCAAAGCCCAGG-3′) was designed complementary to the EST sequence and used for 5′-RACE, employing the SMARTTMRACE cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) and human placental total RNA as template. The 5′-RACE products were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector using the TOPOTM TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence was determined revealing a complete ORF with start codon within a favorable Kozak sequence context preceded by a 5′-UTR containing stop codons in all three reading frames (GenBankTM/EBI accession nos. AF281254 andAF281255). Two additional EST clones, AI478889 and AI240211, were identified by BLAST searches and correspond to overlapping partial Bcl-G cDNAs that contain the 3′-UTR. BLAST searches of GenBankTM/EBI also revealed a 190,858 base pair human BAC clone (RPCI11–267J23) in the genomic database derived from chromosome 12p12 (GenBankTM/EBI no. AC007537), which contains theBCL-G gene in its entirety. cDNAs containing the ORFs of Bcl-GL and Bcl-Gs without additional flanking sequences were generated by PCR using human placental cDNA as a template and the following primers: 5′-GGCTCGAGCGATGTGTAGCACCAGTGGGTGTGACC-3′, sense for both Bcl-GL and Bcl-Gs; 5′-CCAAGCTTTAAGTCTACTTCTTCATGTGATATCCC-3′, antisense for Bcl-GL; 5′-CCAAGCTTTAAAATGCAGGCCATCAAACC-3′, antisense for Bl-GS. The resulting PCR products were digested with restriction endonucleases and subcloned into theXhoI and HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). A mutant of Bcl-GS lacking the BH3 domain was created by a two-step PCR method, using the following primers: primer1, 5′-GGCTCGAGCGATGTGTAGCACCAGTGGGTGTGACC-3′; primer2, 5′-CCGGATCCGGCTAGTATTTGTTCTTCTTCATCTTTC-3′; primer3, 5′-CCGGATCCGACACTGCCTTCATCCCCATTCCC-3′; and primer4, 5′-CCAAGCTTTAAAATGCAGGCCATCAAACC-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with Xhol/BamHI or withBamHI/Hindlll respectively and ligated into pEGFP-C1. Site-directed mutagenesis of Bcl-Gs was performed to generate a L216E substitution mutation using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol, with pEGFP-C1/Bcl-Gs plasmid as DNA template and the mutagenic primers: 5′-GCCAAAATTGTTGAGCTGGAGAAATATTCAGGAGATCAGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CCAACTGATCTCCTGAATATTTCTCCAGCTCAACAATTTTGGC-3′. A mutant of Bcl-GL lacking the BH2 domain was created by PCR using the same forward primer for Bcl-GL and 5′-GGAAGCTTCAGAAGTTCTCTTTCAGGTACTTGG as the reverse primer. Bcl-G mRNAs were detected by either Northern blotting or RT-PCR. For RT-PCR, we employed multiple tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH) containing first-strand cDNA generated from 16 different tissues. PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following primers: (a) 5′-primer for both Bcl-Gsand Bcl-GL, corresponding to exon 3, 5′-CTGAGGGTCTCTCCTTCCAGCTCCAAGG-3′; (b) 3′-primer for Bcl-GL, corresponding to exon 5, 5′-GGCCGTGACGTCTATTACAAGGGCAGCC-3′; 3′-primer for Bcl-Gs, corresponding to an alternatively spliced segment of exon 5, 5′-CAAGGGAATGGGGATGAAGGCAGTGTC-3′. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression was examined by PCR with the following primers: sense, 5′-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT-3′; antisense, 5′-CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′. 293T and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. PC-3 cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfection of cells was performed using SuperFect (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Both floating and adherent cells (after trypsinization) were collected 24 h after transfection, fixed, and stained using 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for assessing apoptosis based on nuclear fragmentation and chromatin condensation (19Xu Q.

For coimmunoprecipitations, cells were cultured in 50 mmbenzocarbonyl-Val-Ala- Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) to prevent apoptosis. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates (0.2 ml diluted into 1-ml final volume of lysis buffer) were cleared by incubation with 15 ml of protein G-Sepharose 4B (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and then incubated with 15 μl of polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 15 μl of protein G at 4 °C overnight. Beads were then washed four times with 1.5 ml of lysis buffer before boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and performing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. GFP-expressing cells were incubated with 50 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C in culture medium. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and imaged by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 instrument (19Xu Q. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 337-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 21Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A short EST was identified during searches of the public databases, which when conceptually translated revealed a polypeptide sequence with similarity to the BH2 domain of Bcl-2 family proteins. Full-length cDNAs were obtained revealing two potential transcripts containing ORFs for proteins of 327 and 252 amino acids, respectively, which we have termed Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS (Fig. 1 A). The predicted Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS proteins are identical for the first 226 amino acids and then diverge thereafter. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of Bcl-GLand Bcl-GS with Bcl-2 family proteins revealed the presence of a candidate BH3 domain in both Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS (Fig. 1, A and B) and the presence of a BH2 domain in Bcl-GL but not in Bcl-GS (Fig. 1, A and C). Using the Bcl-G cDNA sequences, the human genomic database was searched, revealing a BAC clone from chromosome 12p12 containing theBCL-G gene. Comparison with the cDNA sequences suggests a 6-exon structure for the BCL-G gene. The Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS cDNAs can be accounted for by an alternative mRNA splicing mechanism in which different splice acceptor sites associated with exon 5 are employed, resulting in a change in the distal reading frame (Fig. 1 D). Northern blotting demonstrated the presence of Bcl-G transcripts of ∼1.5–2.5 kilobase pairs in length in several adult human tissues (Fig.2 A), but the highest levels of Bcl-G mRNA by far were found in male gonad (testis), thus prompting the moniker “Bcl-Gonad” (Bcl-G). Because Northern blotting failed to resolve the mRNAs encoding Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS, we designed RT-PCR assays using primers specific for Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS sequences associated with exon 5. The amplified bands corresponding to Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS were excised and sequenced, confirming the validity of the RT-PCR strategy (not shown). Bcl-GL mRNA was clearly detected in lung, pancreas, prostate, and testis, with lower levels present in some other tissues (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, Bcl-GS mRNA was uniquely expressed in testis. RT-PCR amplification of a control mRNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, demonstrated loading of nearly equivalent amounts of mRNA from each tissue. To assess the effects of Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS on apoptosis, various cell lines, including COS-7, HEK293T, and PC3, were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Bcl-GL or Bcl-GS. For most experiments, Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS were expressed as GFP fusion proteins so that successfully transfected cells could be conveniently identified (Fig.3 A), but similar results were obtained when FLAG-epitope tags were employed instead (not shown). Overexpression of the shorter Bcl-GS protein reproducibly induced striking increases in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis, as determined by DAPI staining (Fig. 3 A) and other methods (not shown). In contrast, Bcl-GL was more variable and less efficient at inducing apoptosis in these transient transfection assays. Immunoblot analysis of lysates from transfected cells demonstrated that the less potent effects of Bcl-GLcould not be accounted for by lower levels of protein production (Fig.3 A). Indeed, Bcl-GL protein accumulated to levels ∼10-fold higher in cells compared with Bcl-GS, suggesting that Bcl-GS is a far more potent apoptosis inducer. Analysis of the same blots with an anti-tubulin antibody confirmed loading of essentially equivalent amounts of total protein for each sample, thus validating the results. In additional transfection experiments, Bcl-GL failed to demonstrate cytoprotective activity in side by side comparisons with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (data not presented). Also, when Bcl-GLwas coexpressed with Bcl-GS in cells, no synergy with or nullification of Bcl-GS-induced apoptosis was observed. The Bcl-GS protein contains a BH3 domain but lacks other regions of homology with Bcl-2 family proteins. Structural studies indicate that BH3 domains represent amphipathic α-helices in which the hydrophobic surface of the α-helices of apoptosis-inducing BH3 peptides bind to a pocket on survival proteins such as Bcl-XL (22Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). We, therefore, compared the apoptosis-inducing activity of the wild-type Bcl-GS protein with mutants lacking the BH3 domain (ΔBH3) or in which leucine 216 within the BH3 domain of Bcl-GS was chosen for mutation to the charged glutamic acid, based on comparisons with previously described BH3 mutagenesis experiments demonstrating a critical requirement for the analogous leucine in other pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (23Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 24Kelekar A. Chang B. Harlan J. Fesik S. Thompson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7040-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Wild-type Bcl-GS potently induced apoptosis when overexpressed in COS-7, PC3, HEK293T, and other cell lines, whereas Bcl-GS-ΔBH3 and Bcl-GS-L216E did not (Fig.3 B and data not shown). Immunoblot analysis confirmed production of the Bcl-GS-ΔBH3 and Bcl-GS-L216E proteins at levels exceeding the amounts of wild-type Bcl-GS protein. We conclude, therefore, that the BH3 domain of Bcl-GS is critical for its pro-apoptotic activity. Compared with Bcl-GS, Bcl-GL only weakly induces apoptosis. Bcl-GLcontains a BH2 domain not found in Bcl-GS. A mutant of Bcl-GL lacking the BH2 domain was created. Bcl-GL-(ΔBH2) induced apoptosis in COS-7 cells as potently as Bcl-GS (Fig. 3 C). Thus the BH2 domain negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic activity of Bcl-GL. The pro-apoptotic activity of BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family depends on their ability to dimerize with and suppress the activity of survival proteins such as Bcl-XL (reviewed in Ref. 13Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). We, therefore, explored whether Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS are capable of associating with other Bcl-2 family proteins by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Bcl-GS association with the survival proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 was readily detected by coimmunoprecipitation using lysates from transiently transfected cells, whereas no association with pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bak, Bid, or Bad was observed (Fig. 4 A and not shown). Interaction of Bcl-GS with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, but not with Bax or Bak, was also confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays (not shown). Yeast two-hybrid assays also suggested that no homo- or hetero-dimerization occurred among the Bcl-GS and Bcl-GL proteins. In contrast, association of the longer Bcl-GL protein with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL was not easily detected by coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4 A). With much longer x-ray film exposure times, however, small amounts of Bcl-XL were observed in association with Bcl-GL immunocomplexes, suggesting either low affinity binding of Bcl-GL to Bcl-XL or implying that only a small portion of total Bcl-GL proteins are competent to bind Bcl-XL (not shown). The interaction of Bcl-GS with Bcl-XL was BH3-dependent, as determined by comparisons of wild-type Bcl-GS with the Bcl-GS-ΔBH3 and Bcl-GS-L216E proteins (Fig. 4, B andC). Thus, the pro-apoptotic activity of Bcl-GScorrelates with it ability to bind Bcl-XL. When the BH2 domain of Bcl-GL was deleted, this mutant Bcl-GL associated with Bcl-XL (Fig.4 D), thus providing further evidence that the BH2 domain autorepresses this protein. Many Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bak, contain a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids near their carboxyl terminus that anchors them in intracellular membranes of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or nuclear envelope (reviewed in Refs. 1Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 2Adams J. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 3Gross A. McDonnell J. Korsmeyer S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar). However, some pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bax, Bid, and Bim are found in the cytosol and must be induced to translocate to mitochondria and other organelles where the Bcl-2-family proteins to which they dimerize reside (25Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 26Puthalakath H. Huang D. O'Reilly L. King S. Strasser A.

Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). We explored the intracellular locations of the Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS protein by two-color confocal microscopy analysis of cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins. GFP·Bcl-GL protein was located diffusely throughout cells, similar to GFP control protein (Fig. 5). In contrast, Bcl-GSwas found in a punctate cytosolic pattern (Fig. 5), and partially colocalized with a mitochondria-specific dye (Mitotracker). Surprisingly, deletion of the BH3 domain from Bcl-GS did not disrupt the punctate distribution (Fig. 5), indicating that other regions of the Bcl-GS protein are sufficient for subcellular targeting. Subcellular fractionation experiments confirmed these observations, demonstrating association of Bcl-GS and Bcl-GS-ΔBH3 predominantly with organelle-containing heavy membrane fractions, with scant amounts in the soluble cytosolic compartment (not shown). We describe here a new member of the BCL-2 gene family in humans, BCL-G. The BCL-G gene potentially encodes two protein products, Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS. Bcl-2 family proteins contain up to four conserved BH domains. The shorter Bcl-GS protein contains only the BH3 domains, similar to several other pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bad, Hrk, Bik, Bim, Blk, Noxa(APR), and Egl1 (reviewed in Refs. 13Kelekar A. Thompson C.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 324-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 29Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T.

In contrast, the longer Bcl-GL protein contains BH2 and BH3 domains. No other examples of Bcl-2 family proteins are known that combine BH2 and BH3 domains in the absence of BH1. Though the Bad protein was originally suggested to contain a BH2 domain (31Yang E. Jockel J. Zha J. Korsmeyer S. Blood. 1994; 84: 373a-380aGoogle Scholar) and has been shown to possess the BH3 domain, inspection of the BH2 region reveals very little similarity of amino acid sequence with other BH2 domains (32Ottilie S. Diaz J. Horne W. Chang J. Wang Y. Wilson G. Chang S. Weeks S. Fritz L. Oltersdorf T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30866-30872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In contrast, the BH2 of Bcl-GL contains a stretch of 8 of 8 residues showing identity or conservative amino acid substitutions with the BH2 domains of other family members. By comparison, the Bad sequence reveals only 3 of 8 identical or similar amino acids in the same region. Thus, Bcl-GL defines a novel structural variant within the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulating proteins. The production of different protein isoforms by alternative mRNA splicing is a common feature of BCL-2 family genes, including BCL-2, Bcl-X, MCL-1, BAX, and BIM(33Tsujimoto Y. Croce C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 34O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22136-22146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Unlike BCL-X, which encodes a long and short protein, Bcl-XL and Bcl-XS, possessing anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic functions, respectively, the longer isoform of Bcl-G did not display anti-apoptotic activity. When overexpressed, Bcl-GL induced modest and variable increases in apoptosis, whereas the shorter Bcl-GS protein consistently exhibited potent cytotoxic activity. This behavior is reminiscent of the proteins encoded by the BIM gene, which include Bim-short (BimS), Bim-long (BimL), and Bim-Extra-Long (BimEL) (34O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The longer proteins, BimL and BimEL, are sequestered in complexes with dynein light-chain (DLC) in association with microtubules, thus preventing them from interacting with target proteins such as Bcl-XL on the surface of mitochondria and other organelles (26Puthalakath H. Huang D. O'Reilly L. King S. Strasser A. Mol Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In contrast, because the shortest isoform, BimS, does not associate with DLC, it is free to interact with Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and other survival proteins and hence displays far more potent apoptotic activity when overexpressed in cells. By analogy, the longer Bcl-GL protein could be sequestered in an inactive complex with an unidentified protein. Besides interactions with sequestering proteins, the activity of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins can be suppressed by other mechanisms, including post-translational modifications. For example, the Bad protein is inactivated by phosphorylation. This protein can be directly or indirectly phosphorylated by several protein kinases, including PKA, PKB (Akt), Raf1, and Pak1, thus preventing it from dimerizing with target proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL(reviewed in Refs. 30Reed J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 38Datta S. Brunet A. Greenberg M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). The intracellular location of Bad varies, depending on its phosphorylation state, with phosphorylated Bad residing in the cytosol and unphosphorylated Bad associated with mitochondria and other intracellular organelles where Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are located. In this regard, the Bcl-GLprotein contains candidate phosphorylation sites for PKA and PKC, including some not found in Bcl-GS. However, we have been unable to demonstrate in vivo phosphorylation of Bcl-GL in pilot experiments (unpublished observations). Another post-translational modification shown previously to active latent pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is proteolysis. Specifically, the Bid protein contains a N-terminal domain of ∼58 amino acids that masks its BH3 domain, reducing its ability to dimerize with other Bcl-2 family proteins. Upon cleavage by caspases, however, removal of the N-terminal domain exposes the BH3 domain and is associated with translocation of Bid from the cytosol to mitochondria, where it induces cytochrome c release and apoptosis (27Li H. Zhu H. Xu C. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar,28Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). Whereas Bcl-GL contains candidate caspase recognition sites, we have been unable to demonstrate significant cleavage of Bcl-GL in vitro using purified active caspases or in cells during apoptosis (unpublished observations). We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that a specific caspase not yet tested is capable of cleaving and activating Bcl-GL. Though possessing no hydrophobic region that might anchor it in membranes, the Bcl-GS protein was constitutively associated with intracellular organelles. Interestingly, removal of the BH3 domain did not interfere with organellar-targeting of Bcl-GS but did abolish dimerization with Bcl-XL. Thus, the BH3 domain apparently is not responsible for association of Bcl-GSwith intracellular organelles. This BH3-independent targeting of Bcl-GS differs from some other BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bad, where it has been observed that removal of the BH3 domain abrogates binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins as well as association with mitochondria (39Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) The BCL-G gene resides on chromosome 12p12, a region deleted in ∼50% of prostate cancers, ∼30% of ovarian cancers, and ∼30% of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemias (ALLs) (40Kibel A.S. Faith D.A. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. J. Urol. 2000; 1: 192-196Google Scholar, 41Aissani B. Bonan C. Baccichet A. Sinnett D. Leuk.

Given that at least one of the protein products of the BCL-G gene exhibits pro-apoptotic function, it is possible that BCL-G represents a tumor suppressor gene. However, thus far, we have detected neither somatic mutations in the exons of BCL-G nor evidence of deletion of both BCL-G alleles in tumor cell lines or primary tumor specimens (data not shown). Further studies are required therefore to determine whether loss of BCL-G expression occurs in tumors by means other than somatic alterations in gene structure and DNA sequence such as changes in gene methylation or aberrant transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. Investigation of the tissue distribution of Bcl-GL and Bcl-GS mRNAs by RT-PCR revealed that Bcl-GLmRNA is found in several normal adult tissues, whereas Bcl-GS was detected only in testis. This finding indicates tissue-specific regulation of Bcl-GS mRNA splicing. Tissue-specific splicing of other Bcl-2 family mRNAs has been observed previously. For example, Bcl-X mRNA splicing events, which generate the pro-apoptotic Bcl-XS protein occur in the thymus during T-cell ontogeny and in the mammary gland during postlactation involution, in association with extensive apoptosis induction (35Boise L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 6Heermeier K. Benedict M. Li M. Furth P. Nunez G. Hennighausen L. Mech. Dev. 1996; 56: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Future studies therefore should include analysis of the differential mRNA splicing patterns of Bcl-G transcripts during fetal development and following various scenarios in the adult where apoptosis occurs as part of a normal physiological response or an abnormal pathological reaction to environmental insults."

To address the role of mammalian Sprouty homologues in angiogenesis, another form of branching morphogenesis, a recombinant adenovirus engineered to express murine Sprouty-4 selectively in endothelial cells, was injected into the sinus venosus of embryonic day 9.0 cultured mouse embryos. Sprouty-4 expression inhibited branching and sprouting of small vessels, resulting in abnormal embryonic development. In vitro, Sprouty-4 inhibited fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial cell growth factor-mediated cell proliferation and migration and prevented basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced MAPK phosphorylation in endothelial cells, indicating inhibition of tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways. The ability of constitutively activated mutant RasL61 to rescue Sprouty-4 inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation suggests that Sprouty inhibits receptor tyrosine kinase signaling upstream of Ras. Thus, Sprouty may regulate angiogenesis in normal and disease processes by modulating signaling by endothelial tyrosine kinases. Sprouty negatively modulates branching morphogenesis in the Drosophila tracheal system. To address the role of mammalian Sprouty homologues in angiogenesis, another form of branching morphogenesis, a recombinant adenovirus engineered to express murine Sprouty-4 selectively in endothelial cells, was injected into the sinus venosus of embryonic day 9.0 cultured mouse embryos. Sprouty-4 expression inhibited branching and sprouting of small vessels, resulting in abnormal embryonic development. In vitro, Sprouty-4 inhibited fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial cell growth factor-mediated cell proliferation and migration and prevented basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced MAPK phosphorylation in endothelial cells, indicating inhibition of tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways.

Replication-deficient adenovirus with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) enhancer/promoter driving expression of either the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene (AdCMV/lacZ, provided by the Institute of Human Gene Therapy, University of Pennsylvania), the Ras mutants RasN17 and RasL61 (gift of Dr. Joseph Nevins, Duke University), or murine Spry4 (AdCMV/mSpry4) were used. The AdCMV/mSpry4 virus was generated using methods described previously (22Mizuguchi H. Kay M.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol.

Briefly, a cDNA encoding mSpry4 tagged with an HA epitope at its N terminus was subcloned into an E1-, E3-deleted type 5 adenoviral vector. The recombinant adenovirus was identified by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the identity of the virus was confirmed by DNA sequencing of selected regions. The recombinant adenovirus was transfected into 293 cells and purified as described (22Mizuguchi H. Kay M.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 2577-2583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Whole mouse embryo culture was performed as described previously (24Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos (embryonic day 8.0 to 8.25; 1–5 somites) were cultured in medium consisting of 70% heat inactivated rat serum and 30% sterile Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures were equilibrated with a mixture of 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 and rotated during incubation at 37 °C for 12–16 h. Adenovirus (AdCMV/lacZ and AdCMV/mSpry4) was injected into the sinus venosus of the embryo as described previously (24Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Following injection, embryos were cultured in medium equilibrated with 20% O2, 5% CO2, and 75% N2 for an additional 24 h (AdCMV/lacZ, n = 38; AdCMV/mSpry4, n = 45). The embryos were subgrouped with respect to the following properties: presence of beating heart, extent of neural tube closure, development of functioning extra-embryonic circulation, and progression of embryonic development as assessed by degree of turning of the embryos. Microangiography was performed in a subset of the embryos (AdCMV/lacZ, n = 20; AdCMV/mSpry4, n = 37) by injection of phenol red dye into the vitelline artery. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated as described (26Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6019) Google Scholar), infected with 5.0 × 103 particles/cell of either AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/mSpry4 for 12 h, and were then cultured an additional 24 h before being fixed and subjected to RNase treatment and staining with propidium iodide. Cells were subjected to FACS analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Cells were gated to AdCMV/lacZ-infected cells and analyzed using the FLOWJO analysis program. HUVECs were infected with recombinant adenovirus for 16 h and harvested using cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% Tris-glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Transgene expression was detected by incubating the membrane with a monoclonal antibody to HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Antibodies against Rb (G3–245, Pharmingen) and p21 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were used to detect phosphorylation of RB and to detect p21 expression. To determine the level of active MAPK, a monoclonal antibody against diphosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK (Sigma) was used. To control for loading and transfer efficiency, blots were probed with a monoclonal antibody against β-actin (Sigma). Modified Boyden chambers (Transwell; Costar Corp, Cambridge, MA) were utilized for cell migration assays. The underside of the membrane of the upper chamber was coated with 10 μg/ml of collagen type I (Vitrogen 100, Cohesion, Palo Alto, CA) and placed into the lower chamber containing medium (EBM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin) plus either 10% serum, 30 ng/ml bFGF, 30 ng/ml VEGF, 30 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or no additional factor. HUVECs infected as described previously were cultured in serum-free medium for 5–6 h, trypsinized, and resuspended in EBM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin at 5.0 × 105cells/ml. Cells were plated in the upper chamber and allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C before counting cells on the membrane. Cultured embryos injected with either AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/mSpry4 were collected and embedded in OCT and fixed in cold acetone. The sections were incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody to detect transgene expression. To detect coexpression of PECAM and β-galactosidase, anti-PECAM antibody (Pharmingen) and anti-β-galactosidase antibody (Sigma) were used. Primary HUVECs were cultured on glass coverslips and subsequently infected with recombinant adenovirus for 16 h. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Positive controls were obtained by incubation with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). TUNEL staining was performed in situ (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To test the effect of a Sprouty protein on angiogenesisin vivo, mSpry4 was expressed in the developing endothelium of the 9.0-day mouse embryo using an adenoviral vector. Previous studies show that expression of transgenes in this manner is restricted to endothelium (24Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Indeed, in sections of embryos injected with AdCMV/lacZ, β-galactosidase was expressed in PECAM-expressing endothelial cells of the dorsal aorta (Fig.1, A and B). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed that expression of the HA-tagged Sprouty protein was restricted to the developing vascular endothelium, endocardium, and extra-embryonic vascular endothelium (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). No HA immunoreactivity was observed in sections of AdCMV/lacZ-injected control embryos (Fig. 1 D). These results confirm that the Spry4 transgene was expressed exclusively in the endothelium of the embryonic and extra-embryonic vasculature. To examine the effects of Spry4 expression on yolk sac vascular development, microangiography was performed (Fig. 2,A and B). Phenol red dye injected into the vitelline artery of control (AdCMV/lacZ) embryos circulated throughout the yolk sac and embryo, demonstrating that extensive vascular branching and network formation occurred in the control embryos. In contrast, in the AdCMV/Spry4 embryos, although large vessels with circulating blood cells were observed, there was no evidence of organized sprouting of smaller vessels from large vessels. Microangiography demonstrated that dye was pooled in the yolk sac at the site of injection. Thus, Spry4 expression inhibits sprouting and branch formation of small yolk sac vessels. To examine the effect of Spry4 expression on the development of the vasculature of the embryo proper, whole mount staining with an antibody against PECAM was performed (Fig. 2, C–H). The control embryos injected with AdCMV/lacZ formed a highly organized vascular network in head, heart, and somatic vessels (Fig. 2,C, E, and G). In contrast, embryos injected with AdCMV/mSpry4 exhibited a primitive vasculature with poor branching and minimal sprouting of vessels (Fig. 2,D, F, and H). Vascular development was arrested at the primary plexus stage, with no formation of the highly branched vascular network normally observed in the brain. The AdCMV/mSpry4-injected embryos exhibited a less extensive endocardium, intermittent disruption of the endothelial lining of the heart, and decreased branching of the intersomatic vessels (Fig. 2,F and H). The injected embryos were cultured for an additional 24 h, and their gross morphology was evaluated. At the time of examination, the development of the head, eyes, heart, and limb buds of AdCMV/lacZ-injected control embryos expressing β-galactosidase had progressed normally, and the embryos had completed turning within the yolk sac. The circulation of blood cells through the yolk sac was clearly visible. In the control embryos, 36 of 38 developed normally, with complete turning of the embryos observed (Table I). In contrast, in 45 embryos injected with AdCMV/mSpry4, 41 showed delayed embryonic development and did not complete turning within the yolk sac. The hearts of the embryos were beating but were incompletely developed. The neural folds were not fused, and the development of the limb bud was incomplete. Additionally, the same 41 embryos demonstrated abnormal formation of the yolk sac vasculature. Since expression of theSpry4 transgene was restricted to the endothelium, the abnormal embryonic development observed was probably secondary to abnormal vascular development in the embryo proper.Table IPhenotype of embryos injected with AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/mSpry4Adenovirus injectedAdCMV/lacZAdCMV/mSpry4Total embryos38 (100%)45 (100%)Embryos with Beating heart38 (100%)41 (91%) Normal turning36 (95%)4 (9%) Normal vasculature36 (95%)4 (9%) Open table in a new tab To determine the effect of Spry4 expression on endothelial cell function, a series of studies utilizing HUVECs was performed. To determine the effects of Spry4 on HUVEC proliferation, cells were infected with either AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/mSpry4. The number of Spry4-infected HUVECs was less than that of the lacZ-infected (control) cells at all time points following infection (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether Spry4 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation mediated by bFGF or VEGF, cells were cultured in EBM containing 2% FBS and either bFGF or VEGF at 25 ng/ml and harvested at various time points. Expression of Spry4 inhibited both bFGF- and VEGF-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 3, B andC). To determine whether the reduction in cell number inSpry4-expressing HUVECs results from cell death, TdT-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL analysis; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed. No TUNEL-positive cells were observed in either AdCMV/mSpry4- or AdCMV/lacZ-infected cells (data not shown). In addition, microscopic observation of cells infected with AdCMV/mSpry4 did not reveal cells that were shrunken or detached from the culture dishes, even after infection for 48 h. These data suggest that cell cycle arrest, and not cell death, is the primary consequence of overexpression of mSpry4 in HUVECs. To examine the effects ofSpry4 expression on the cell cycle, flow cytometric analysis was performed. In the AdCMV/mSpry4-infected cells, an increased percentage of the analyzed populations was detected in G1 and G2, with a corresponding decrease in the proportion in S phase, when compared with both AdCMV/lacZ-infected and uninfected control cells (Fig.4 A). These results demonstrate an inhibitory effect of Spry4 on progression through the cell cycle. Cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Rb protein is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner during the normal cell cycle. In addition, induction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 can arrest progression from G1 to S. The expression of p21 and the phosphorylation of Rb were examined in Spry4-expressing cells and control β-galactosidase-expressing cells (Fig.4 B). In the control cells, Rb phosphorylation was maximally increased by 24 h and decreased thereafter. In contrast, in cells overexpressing Spry4, decreased phosphorylation of Rb and increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 was observed. These changes may be responsible, at least in part, for the G1 to S arrest observed in endothelial cells expressingSpry4. To determine whether the Sprouty protein inhibits endothelial cell migration, studies were performed using a modified Boyden chamber. HUVECs were cultured in mitogen-poor medium, with or without the addition of bFGF or VEGF. Both bFGF and VEGF stimulated cell migration in control (lacZ)-infected cells (Fig. 5,open bars). In contrast, in HUVECs expressing mSpry4, bFGF and VEGF stimulated significantly less migration (Fig. 5, solid bars). Thus, Spry4 is capable of inhibiting migration induced by bFGF and VEGF. To determine whether Spry4 interferes with signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase pathways and Ras/MAPK, we analyzed the effect of mSpry4 on phosphorylated (activated) p42/p44 MAPK (Fig.6). Treatment of the control AdCMV/lacZ-infected HUVECs with either bFGF or VEGF for 10 min increased the level of phosphorylated MAPK above the basal level. In contrast, in AdCMV/mSpry4-infected HUVECs, there was a substantial reduction in both basal and bFGF- or VEGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation. Expression of Spry4 did not inhibit MAPK phosphorylation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, indicating that the block in MAPK activation by Sprouty is selective for activation via receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. To determine where in the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway Spry4 protein acts, HUVECs were infected with AdCMV/lacZ or AdCMV/Spry4 with or without concomitant infection of an adenovirus expressing constitutively active RasL61 or dominant negative RasN17. RasL61 expression resulted in constitutive activation of MAPK, regardless of whether or not cells were expressing Spry4 (Fig.7). In contrast, in cells infected with dominant negative mutant RasN17, stimulation of MAPK phosphorylation by FGF and VEGF was inhibited, and mSpry4 had no effect on MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 7). These data suggest that Spry4 interferes with the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway upstream of Ras. The Sprouty protein is a novel receptor tyrosine kinase pathway antagonist that regulates the formation of tracheal branches duringDrosophila development. The tracheal system undergoes extensive branching morphogenesis, which is similar to the formation of a mature vascular system through angiogenesis (1Metzger R.J. Krasnow M.A. Science. 1999; 284: 1635-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). SinceDrosophila Sprouty can antagonize signaling through at least two receptor tyrosine kinases, we hypothesized that mammalian Sprouty homologs might inhibit sprouting and branching of blood vessels during angiogenesis by a similar mechanism. In this study, we examined the effects of overexpression ofSprouty on angiogenesis in vivo. Previous studies indicate that a replication-defective adenovirus carrying a CMV promoter/enhancer can drive the expression of transgenes in the developing endothelium (24Baldwin H.S. Mickanin C. Buck C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1142-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 25LeConte L. Fox J.C. Baldwin S. Buck C.A. Swain J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 421-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, an adenovirus encoding murine Spry4 was constructed and delivered in this manner, and the phenotype was examined. In cultured embryos overexpressing murine Spry4, formation of a network of small and large vessels and sprouting from existing vessels are disrupted. Further, the vasculature of the yolk sac in the Spry4-expressing embryos contained fewer branches and more similarly sized vessels rather than exhibiting a complex vascular network. In addition, whole mount PECAM staining demonstrated a disorganized and primitive vascular network in the head, heart, and intersomatic vessels. These data indicate that Sprouty inhibits branching and sprouting of the vasculature during angiogenesis. Receptor tyrosine kinase activation triggers numerous cellular responses. The activation of MAPK throughout the G1 phase of the cell cycle is required for cells to enter S phase (27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar, 28LeVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggest that MAPK signaling can regulate important processes in angiogenesis such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation (29Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 30Eliceriri B.P. Klemke R. Stromblad S. Cherish D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1255-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In this study, overexpression ofSpry4 inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and migrationin vitro. Spry4 arrested endothelial cell cycle progression without inducing apoptosis. In addition, overexpression ofSpry4 inhibited MAPK activation induced by bFGF or VEGF but did not inhibit that induced by other pathways, such as the one stimulated by phorbol esters. Drosophila Sprouty has been shown to antagonize at least two different receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, FGF and epidermal growth factor pathways. Our work demonstrates that a vertebrate Sprouty protein can inhibit FGF as well as VEGF pathways, a third receptor tyrosine kinase pathway. Our data begin to address the location in the signaling pathway where inhibition by the vertebrate Sprouty occurs. The expression of a constitutively active RasL61 resulted in constitutive activation of MAPK, a downstream effector of Ras signaling, even in the presence of mSpry4 expression. These data suggest that Spry4 inhibits the signaling pathway upstream of Ras. Since neither the FGF or VEGF ligands nor the extracellular domain of their cognate receptors share any significant structural similarities, the data suggest that Spry4 protein inhibits receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling pathways at or downstream of the intracellular domain of the receptor, but upstream of or at Ras. The ability of Spry4 to inhibit tyrosine kinase-stimulated MAP kinase activation probably results in the cell cycle arrest observed with overexpression of Spry4. In addition, overexpression ofSpry4 in the vasculature of the murine embryo inhibited branching and sprouting during in vivo angiogenesis. These data suggest that Spry4 negatively modulates the MAPK signaling pathway stimulated by receptor tyrosine kinase activation and that activation of this pathway is required for angiogenesis. Although the present study indicates that Spry4 protein is a potent regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and angiogenesis when expressed in endothelial cells, elucidation of the roles of Sprouty proteins in developmental and pathological angiogenesis awaits the generation of further mouse Sprouty mutants.

Here, we show that BAF60a, a subunit of the SWI·SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is a determinant of the transactivation potential of Fos/Jun dimers. BAF60a binds to a specific subset of Fos/Jun heterodimers using two different interfaces for c-Fos and c-Jun, respectively. Only when the functional SWI·SNF complex is present, can c-Fos/c-Jun (high affinity to BAF60a) but not Fra-2/JunD (no affinity to BAF60a) induce the endogenous AP-1-regulated genes such as collagenase and c-met. These results indicate that a specific subset of Fos/Jun dimers recruits SWI·SNF complex via BAF60a to initiate transcription.

The members of both families form dimers through a leucine zipper structure; Jun family members can form low-affinity homodimers and high affinity heterodimers with the Fos family (1Curran T. Franza B.R. Cell. 1988; 5: 395-397Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1311) Google Scholar, 2Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). However, members of the Fos family do not form stable homodimers. Although these hetero- and homodimers bind to similar sites on DNA (TGAC/GTCA, AP-1 binding sites) through the basic domains of both proteins, each dimer has a distinct transcriptional regulatory function that can be modulated either positively or negatively (3Suzuki T. Okuno H. Yoshida T. Endo T. Nishina H. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5537-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For example, transcriptional activity of the c-Fos/c-Jun dimer is much higher than the Fra-2/c-Jun dimer. Although functional interactions between some members of the Fos/Jun family of proteins and adaptor proteins such as CREB-binding protein (CBP) or TATA-binding protein (TBP) have been reported (4Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kuroiuwa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K.

Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar), crucial proteins that recognize the dimer specificity and/or facilitate the induction of transcriptional initiation were largely unknown. Therefore, we proposed here to isolate such a crucial protein using a yeast two-hybrid system and have demonstrated that BAF60a (6Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), a component of the SWI·SNF chromatin remodeling complex, can select specific Fos/Jun dimers and function as a determinant of transcriptional activation via AP-1 binding sites. The Gal4DBD-c-Jun () fusion construct (pDBLeu-cJ(25–187)) was generated by inserting the 0.49 kilobase pair EheI fragment of the rat c-jun gene into the MscI restriction endonuclease cleavage site within the open reading frame of Gal4DBD. For the construction of template DNA for in vitro translation, we first generated a starter plasmid from pGEM2–475/Jun-D, the translation initiation site of which has a Kozak consensus sequence with a unique NcoI site that is preceded by a fragment 475 sequence for an efficient translational initiation (2Nakabeppu Y. Ryder K. Nathans D. Cell. 1988; 55: 907-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The 1.0-kilobase pair NcoI-BamHI fragment of pGEM2–475/Jun-D encoding JunD was excised and substituted with a synthetic DNA fragment carrying multiple cloning sites to generate pGEM2–475/Met. A series of c-jun or c-fosdeletions was inserted in-frame into pGEM2-475/Met. Full-length BAF60a cDNA was constructed by inserting a PCR1-generated DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal region into the original partial BAF60a clone, which encodes BAF60a, amino acids 139–475, and was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-BAF60a was constructed by inserting the full-length DNA into the pGEX4T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the construction of a retrovirus vector expressing HA-tagged proteins, a synthetic oligo DNA fragment coding the HA sequence was inserted into the unique BamHI site of pBabe-IRES puro (7Ui M.

The yeast strain MaV203 (MATα, leu2–3Δ112, trp1–901,his3Δ200, ade2–101, gal4Δ,gal80Δ, SPAL10:: URA3,GAL1::lacZ, HIS3uasGAL1::HIS[email protected]Lys2,can1R, cyh2R) harboring pDBLeu-cJ () (Fig. 1 A) was transformed by the lithium acetate method with a mouse brain cDNA fusion library inserted into the activation domain vector, pPC86 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transformants were selected with a HIS3 reporter containing the Gal4 DNA binding sites by seeding onto SC/−Leu/−Trp/−His/+3AT (50 mm) plates. After incubation for 60 h at 30 °C, the plates were replica-cleaned for the reduction of false-positive clones according to the manufacturer's protocol and further incubated at 30 °C for 44 h. The positive clones were confirmed by another promoter system that induces β-galactosidase expression through the same DNA binding domain. β-Galactosidase activity in yeast was assayed according to the manufacturer' s protocol. Virus-packaging cell line BOSC23 and the adenocarcinoma cell line SW13 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. BOSC23 cells were transfected with pBabeHA-BAF60a-IRES puro, and NIH3T3 cells were infected with the resulting ecotropic retrovirus as described previously (8Ito T. Kabuyama Y. Okazaki S. Kameda T. Murakami M. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The GST pull-down assay, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (9Murakami M. Sonobe M.H. Ui M. Kabuyama Y. Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. Iba H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using anti-Brm (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-HA (Santa Cruz Laboratories, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz), anti-c-Fos (Oncogene Science, San Diego, CA), and anti-INI1 (Santa Cruz) antibodies. A gel shift assay was performed as described previously (3Suzuki T. Okuno H. Yoshida T. Endo T. Nishina H. Iba H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5537-5542Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from SW13 cells transfected with expression plasmids using an Isogen RNA isolation reagent (Wako) and reverse-transcribed for 30 min at 50 °C. Each PCR regime involved an initial denaturation step at 94 °C, 3 min followed by 30 cycles (for collagenase and c-met) and 25 cycles (for GAPDH) at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. RT-PCR was performed within the linear range with Superscript one-step RT-PCR with PlatinumTaq kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primer sets and amplified fragment size for RT-PCR were as follows: collagenase, 570 base pairs; forward 5′-atcttttgtcaggggagatcatcg-3′, reverse 5′-acagcccagtacttattccctttg-3′, c-met, 701 base pairs; forward 5′-atgagcactgctttaataggacac-3′, reverse 5′-accaactgtgcatttcaatgtattc-3′, GAPDH, 431 base pairs; forward 5′-tcattgacctcaactacatggtttac-3′, reverse 5′-ggcatggactgtggtcatgagtc-3′. To identify the molecules involved in the transactivation of AP-1, we first proposed to isolate proteins that specifically bind with rat c-Jun N-terminal amino acids 25–187 (Fig.1 A), which reportedly contain transactivation domains (10Alani R. Binetruy B. Dosaka H. Rosenberg R.K. Angle P. Karin M. Birrer M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 6286-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid system, 23 positive clones were obtained upon screening 5 × 105clones of a mouse brain cDNA library. DNA sequence analysis revealed a single cDNA clone encoding the C-terminal half of mouse BAF60a, which is a subunit of the mouse SWI·SNF complex. The SWI·SNF complex is a 2-MDa, multi-subunit, DNA-dependent ATPase that is thought to disrupt repressive chromatin structure (11Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Because interaction of c-Jun with the SWI·SNF complex seemed likely to be important for regulation of transcription in vivo, we isolated a cDNA containing the entire open reading frame of BAF60a, which had the same nucleotide sequence as a clone reported previously (6Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli-produced, histidine-tagged c-Jun amino acids 1–225 (9Murakami M. Sonobe M.H. Ui M. Kabuyama Y. Watanabe H. Wada T. Handa H. Iba H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) bound with GST-BAF60a fusion protein but not with GST (data not shown), demonstrating that BAF60a interacts directly with c-Jun. By synthesizing truncation mutants of c-Jun in reticulocyte lysates, we showed that N-terminal amino acids 25–187 of c-Jun were sufficient for binding, but further truncation at either the N-terminal or C-terminal regions totally abolished binding (Fig.1 A). To examine whether BAF60a binds with other members of the Jun family, JunB and JunD proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysates and assayed for binding with a recombinant GST-BAF60a fusion protein. In comparison with BAF60a binding with c-Jun, BAF60a displayed weaker binding with JunB and no binding with JunD (Fig. 1 C). This result was somewhat surprising because the BAF60a binding domain of c-Jun includes regions conserved in both JunB and JunD (conserved regions 1–3; Fig. 1 A). Even more surprising was the finding that GST-BAF60a fusion protein bound with in vitrotranslated, full-length c-Fos (Fig. 1 D); c-Fos and c-Jun share little sequence similarity outside of their leucine zipper domains. Among the Fos family proteins, this binding is specific for c-Fos (Fig. 1 D). Analysis of c-Fos truncation mutants indicated that C-terminal amino acids 237–380 are sufficient for BAF60a binding (Fig. 1 B). Binding of BAF60a with v-Fos, which is derived from FBJ-MuSV (12Curran T. Teich N. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not detected (Fig.1 B). The C-terminal amino acids of v-Fos and c-Fos are divergent because of a frameshift mutation starting at c-Fos amino acid 333 (13Curran T. Miller A.D. Zokas L. Verma I.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, c-Fos C-terminal amino acids 333–380 are likely to be critical for binding with BAF60a. Fos/Jun heterodimers composed of c-Fos and c-Jun, c-Fos and JunD, Fra-2 and c-Jun, or Fra-2 and JunD were assayed for binding with GST-BAF60a by precipitation with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads. GST-BAF60a precipitated 4% of c-Fos alone. Precipitation of c-Fos with BAF60a increased to 7.5% of the total c-Fos when preincubated with an equimolar amount of c-Jun (Fig.2 A), Because the molar amount of c-Jun recovered in the precipitate was nearly equal to the amount of c-Fos, it seems that binding of BAF60a with the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer would be preferential to binding with c-Fos alone. Fra-2 alone, JunD alone, and the Fra-2/JunD heterodimer displayed only marginal binding with BAF60a (Fig. 2 D). JunD alone displayed marginal binding with GST-BAF60a, whereas precipitation of the c-Fos/JunD heterodimer with GST-BAF60a resulted in the recovery of 1.5% of the total JunD added to the reaction mixture. These results suggest that BAF60a can simultaneously bind restricted members of Fos family proteins (c-Fos alone) and Jun family proteins (c-Jun, and probably to a lesser extent JunB but not JunD) using different interfaces present in the BAF60a molecule. These results also suggest that the Fos/Jun dimer formation via the leucine zipper region is compatible with formation of a ternary complex composed of Fos, Jun, and BAF60a. A c-Fos/JunD heterodimer bound with GST-BAF60a, but the binding was less than that observed with c-Fos alone (Fig.2 B), suggesting that dimerization of c-Fos and JunD did not appreciably contribute to BAF60a binding. Similarly, dimerization of Fra-2 and c-Jun did not seem to contribute to BAF60a binding (Fig.2 C). The binding affinity of each heterodimer examined here correlated positively with their transactivating activity when determined in F9 cells by transient expression with a reporter gene containing a single AP-1 binding site derived from the human collagenase gene (Table I). c-Fos/c-Jun had the highest transactivating activity, and other dimers consisting of either c-Fos or c-Jun had lower activity. Dimers that contained neither c-Fos nor c-Jun had only marginal activity.Table ITransactivating potential of each Fos/Jun dimer in F9 cells determined by CAT analysisFosJunc-JunJunBJunDc-Fos9.77.03.6Fra-12.01.11.2Fra-22.71.11.4F9 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding a member of the fos family and a member of the jun family (2 μg each) together with 1× TRECAT (Res. 3, 4 μg). CAT activity was normalized to that in cells transfected with the empty vector (4 μg) and 1× TRECAT (4 μg, Res. 3). Open table in a new tab F9 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding a member of the fos family and a member of the jun family (2 μg each) together with 1× TRECAT (Res. 3, 4 μg). CAT activity was normalized to that in cells transfected with the empty vector (4 μg) and 1× TRECAT (4 μg, Res. 3). To examine whether BAF60a affects the specific DNA binding activity of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with 32P-labeled probe containing the AP-1 DNA binding site of the human collagenase gene. Gel mobility shift was not affected upon addition of GST alone, but a dramatic enhancement of the shifted band was detected upon the addition of GST-BAF60a (Fig.3 A). These results indicate that BAF60a stimulates the specific DNA binding activity of the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer. When the Fra-2/JunD dimer was assayed, the addition of GST-BAF60a caused only a slight enhancement of the shifted band (data not shown). To study whether c-Fos/c-Jun dimer associates with BAF60a in vivo, NIH3T3 cells expressing HA-tagged BAF60a were growth-stimulated (G1) to induce endogeneous c-Fos and c-Jun. Cell lysates were mixed with a Ni2+ beads bound with histidine-tagged c-Jun. Proteins that bound with histidine-tagged-c-Jun were recovered and analyzed by Western blotting. They contained not only HA-tagged BAF60a but also Brm (14Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begeman M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), the catalytic subunit (DNA-dependent ATPase) of the SWI·SNF complex (Fig. 3 B). When cell lysates of growth-stimulated (G1) NIH3T3 cells were precipitated with anti-c-Jun antiserum and analyzed by Western blotting, the immunoprecipitates contained Brm and SWI·SNF complex subunit INI1 (Fig. 3 C) (14Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begeman M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Both proteins disappeared when the anti-c-Jun antiserum was preabsorbed by the antigen. Similar results were obtained when immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-c-Fos antiserum. No Brm or INI1 proteins were detected when experiments were performed in growth-arrested (Go) cells, which express no Fos protein (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, it was shown that c-Fos and c-Jun associate with the SWI·SNF complex through BAF60a in vivo. These results indicate that BAF60a has a versatile protein interface for c-Fos, c-Jun, and the other SWI·SNF complex subunits. Mutational analysis (Fig. 4) of GST-BAF60a revealed the location of a large domain spanning amino acids 129–366, which is responsible for binding with either c-Fos or c-Jun synthesized in reticulocyte lysate. Next, we located domains within the primary structure of BAF60a that bind with other SWI·SNF complex subunits. GST-BAF60a truncation mutants were mixed with cellular lysates prepared from NIH3T3 cells, subsequently precipitated with GSH-Sepharose, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Brm antiserum. As expected, Brm was precipitated with the full-length BAF60a. Moreover, the same centrally located domain of BAF60a that binds with c-Fos or c-Jun also binds with the other subunits of the SWI·SNF complex. We speculate that these 238 amino acids form a versatile pocket structure and that any truncation of this region perturbs the three-dimensional structure of the domain, which leads to a simultaneous loss of binding with the c-Fos, c-Jun, and SWI·SNF subunits that associate directly with BAF60a. We next asked whether the transactivating activity of c-Fos/c-Jun, the dimer that binds BAF60a with the highest affinity, is modulated by the functional SWI·SNF complex in vivo. Assays were performed with human adenocarcinoma cell line SW13 because it expresses undetectable levels of Brm and BRG1 (14Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begeman M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), which are critical catalytic (DNA-dependent ATPase) subunits of the SWI·SNF complex. In mammalian cells, each SWI·SNF complex contains either Brm or BRG1 but not both (6Wang W. Xue Y. Zhou S. Kuo A. Cairns B.R. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Therefore, the introduction of Brm or BRG1 into SW13 would enable the formation of functional SWI·SNF complex. Transfection of an expression plasmid encoding either c-Fos, BRG1, or Brm into SW13 cells did not transactivate a CAT reporter gene coupled to the AP-1 binding site of the human collagenase gene promoter (Fig.5 A). Transfection of c-jun alone or c-fos plus c-junelevated the CAT activity slightly. Most importantly, transactivation by c-Fos/c-Jun was strongly potentiated by the addition of Brm. However, potentiation by BRG1 was marginal. These results suggest that, in normal cells, transactivation by the c-Fos/c-Jun dimer is strongly dependent upon the recruitment of the SWI·SNF complex containing Brm protein. We next compared the transactivating potential of Fra-2/JunD, which binds with marginal affinity to BAF60a, with that of c-Fos/c-Jun. Introduction of Fra-2 alone, JunD alone, or Fra2/JunD into SW13 cells did not transactivate the CAT reporter. Moreover, the low CAT activity observed in SW13 cells expressing Fra-2 and JunD was not elevated by the introduction of either Brm or BRG1 (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that a significant portion of the transactivating potential of each Fos/Jun dimer is determined by its binding affinity to BAF60a protein. Without this interaction, the Fos/Jun dimer does not seem to recruit SWI·SNF complex to the AP-1 binding sites. However, the c-Fos/c-Jun dimer retains some transactivating potential even in SW13 cells that lack functional SWI·SNF complex (Fig. 5 A). Therefore, there must be some other molecular mechanism that mediates transactivation by the c-Fos/c-Jun dimer. Considering the possible differences between promoters in transiently introduced plasmids and native promoters in chromatin, we next examined the mRNA levels of endogenous collagenase (15Gutman A. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2241-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and c-met(16Seol D.W. Chen Q. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) genes, which were expected to be inducible through AP-1 binding sites in cells originating from adrenal cortex. Total RNA was isolated from SW13 cells transfected with the same set of expression vectors but not with the CAT reporter plasmid. Although each RNA contained similar amount of GAPDH mRNA as judged by RT-PCR, semiquantitative RT-PCR indicated that the collagenase gene was inducible, dependent on transfection of expression vectors for c-Fos, c-Jun, and Brm (or BRG1) (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that unlike the results of CAT analysis, BRG1 is equally efficient for the induction of native collagenase gene expression. As for the c-met gene, induction is dependent upon the expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and BRG1 (Fig. 5 B). Brm has only marginal effects on transactivation of this gene, suggesting that the Brm or BRG1 subunit has distinct target specificity to facilitate gene activation. Brm- or BRG1-dependent transactivation was marginally detected when fra-2 andjunD were transfected instead of c-fos and c-jun (Fig. 5 B). We demonstrated here that SWI·SNF complex subunit BAF60a binds with distinct affinities to different Fos/Jun dimers by interacting with the N-terminal region of c-Jun and the C-terminal region of c-Fos (Fig. 1). BAF60a binds the c-Fos/c-Jun dimer with the highest affinity and the other dimers containing either c-Fos or c-Jun with lower affinity. Fos/Jun dimers that contain neither c-Fos nor c-Jun have no binding activity (Fig. 2). The binding affinity of each Fos/Jun heterodimer to BAF60a is correlated strongly with the respective transactivating activity as determined by transient expression of each heterodimer in F9 cells (Table I). These observations indicate that the SWI·SNF complex is a major determinant of transactivation potential of Fos/Jun dimers. Indeed, in SW13 cells, which lack functional SWI·SNF complex, the transactivating activity of Fos/Jun dimers is kept at basal levels. However, transactivation by c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer but not by Fra-2/JunD was strongly enhanced by supplying Brm or BRG1 into SW13 to recover the functional SWI·SNF complex (Fig.5). Although we did not address the biological function of BAF60a intensively, NIH3T3 cells expressing HA-BAF60a at high levels by retrovirus transduction showed no clear effects on cellular growth. These cells did not acquire anchorage-independent growth at all, indicating that simply a high level expression of BAF60a is not sufficient to induce cellular transformation in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Although several functional models have been presented for the yeast or mammalian SWI·SNF complex (11Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), our observations on AP-1 and recent reports on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (17Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H.

Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) support a model in which transcription factors recruit the SWI·SNF complex to target genes (24Yudkovsky N. Logie C. Hahn S. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2369-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In these previous works, INI1 (associates with c-Myc), Brm (associates with C/EBPβ), and Brm or BRG1 (associates with GR) but not BAF60a were identified as the SWI·SNF complex subunits that bind directly to transcription factors. These results indicate that the 2-MDa, multi-subunit SWI·SNF complex has many different interfaces that interact with various transcription factors and thereby function as a global transcriptional regulator. Because the transactivating function of GR in yeast is known to require Swp73p (18Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Kornberg R.D.

Bultman S.J. Magnuson T. Genesis. 2000; 26: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) for their transactivating activity. Therefore, competition between AP-1 and glucocorticoid receptor transcription factors for SWI·SNF complex would support in part the molecular mechanisms for the mutual repression of transcription frequently observed between these two factors (26Jonat C.

It is quite interesting that c-Fos and c-Jun are recognized specifically by BAF60a among Fos family proteins and Jun family proteins, respectively. Both c-fos and c-junwere isolated originally as cellular counterparts of oncogenes carried by natural RNA tumor viruses (FBJ-MuSV (12Curran T. Teich N. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ASV17 (29Maki Y. Bos T.J. Davis C. Starbuck M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2848-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), respectively), and their products are known to be the strong transactivators among the family of proteins. Because c-fosand, to a lesser extent, c-jun are immediate early genes, the c-Fos/c-Jun dimer would be formed most promptly after extracellular stimuli and would start to interact with the AP-1 binding site (30Nishina H. Sato H. Suzuki T. Sato M. Iba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3619-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,31Lallemand D. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. Pfarr C.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Initially, the chromatin structure would be in an inactive context for transactivation of AP-1-regulated genes. High affinity binding of c-Fos/c-Jun with BAF60a efficiently recruits SWI·SNF complex and thereby induces remodeling of the adjacent chromatin. Subsequently, basal transcriptional machinery and transactivator proteins such as CBP and p300 (4Bannister A.J. Oehler T. Wilhelm D. Angel P. Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kuroiuwa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Because the SWI/SNF-remodeled conformation of the nucleosome in some experimental systems has been shown to persist after detachment of the SWI·SNF complex (32Cote J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4947-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), it is possible that the promoters within the modified chromatin remain accessible to regulation by other Fos/Jun dimers that are induced in later stages, even if these dimers cannot recruit SWI·SNF complex. In summary, the mechanistic link between heterodimeric Fos/Jun transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes provided here is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms that explain the astonishing diversity of AP-1 transcription factor functions in growth, differentiation, development, and tumor formation.

MIC4 was previously described as a protein secreted by Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites upon stimulation of micronemes exocytosis. We have microsequenced the mature protein, purified after discharge from micronemes and cloned the corresponding gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of MIC4 predicts a 61-kDa protein that contains 6 conserved apple domains. Apple domains are composed of six spacely conserved cysteine residues which form disulfide bridges and are also present in micronemal proteins from two closely related apicomplexan parasites, Sarcocystis muris and Eimeria species, and several mammalian serum proteins, including kallikrein. Here we show that MIC4 localizes in the micronemes of all the invasive forms of T. gondii, tachyzoites, bradyzoites, sporozoites, and merozoites. The protein is proteolytically processed both at the N and the C terminus only upon release from the organelle. MIC4 binds efficiently to host cells, and the adhesive motif maps in the most C-terminal apple domain.

Like other members of the phylum of Apicomplexa, this parasite possesses an elaborate apical apparatus dedicated to host cell invasion. The successive exocytosis of secretory compartments, including rhoptries and micronemes, plays a key role in the invasion process. Micronemal proteins are apparently used for host cell recognition, binding, and motility, whereas the content of the rhoptries likely contributes to the formation of a functional parasitophorous vacuole. T. gondii is remarkable for its ability to invade almost any nucleated cell within its mammalian hosts. This broad host cell specificity suggests that adhesion involves the recognition of ubiquitous surface-exposed host molecules or, alternatively, the presence of various parasite attachment molecules able to recognize multiple host cell receptors. Micronemal proteins identified in several Apicomplexa share common structural features (1Tomley, F. M., and Soldati, D. (2001) Parasitol. Today, in pressGoogle Scholar) and, in select cases, can even sustain functional complementation across species (2Kappe S. Bruderer T. Gantt S. Fujioka H. Nussenzweig V. Menard R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For example, a family of adhesive proteins containing thrombospondin (thrombospondin-like) and integrin A domains have been described in the micronemes of Plasmodium,Eimeria, Toxoplasma, andCryptosporidium (3Coppel R.L. Brown G.V. Nussenzweig V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Naitza S. Spano F. Robson K.J.H. Crisanti A. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This family is named from the original member described in Plasmodium as thrombospondin-related anonymous protein or TRAP (1Tomley, F. M., and Soldati, D. (2001) Parasitol. Today, in pressGoogle Scholar). In T. gondii, three major micronemal proteins have been characterized so far. 1) MIC1 contains only two degenerate thrombospondin-1-like domains (6Fourmaux M.N. Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Biderre C. Briche I. Loyens A. Odberg-Ferragut C. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), MIC2 is the homologue of TRAP (5Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and MIC3 contains epidermal growth factor-like domains and forms dimers (7Garcia-Réguet, N., Lebrun, M., Fourmaux, M-N., Mercereau-Puijalon, O., Mann, T., Beckers, C. J. M., Samyn, B., Van Beeumen, J., Bout, D., and Dubremetz, J. F. (2001)Mol. Microbiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). MIC4 was previously identified as a component of the micronemes (8Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In this study, we present the complete characterization of MIC4, a novel type of micronemal adhesin in T. gondii for which homologues exist in two other Apicomplexa; MIC5 in Eimeria tenella (9Brown P.J. Billington K.J. Bumstead J.M. Clark J.D. Tomley F.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and the lectin (SML) in Sarcocystis muris (10Klein H. Loschner B. Zyto N. Portner M. Montag T. Glycoconj J. 1998; 15: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Mouse hybridomas were obtained by immunization with excretory-secretory antigens (ESA)1 as previously described (11Wan K.L. Blackwell J.M. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 75: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and mAbs were screened by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting. Polyclonal rabbit serum reacting toToxoplasma actin (anti-ACT1) was described previously (12Dobrowolski J.M. Niesman I.R. Sibley L.D. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1997; 37: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mAb Tg17–43, which reacts to the dense granule protein GRA1, was provided by Dr. Marie-France Cesbron-Delauw (Lille, France). The monoclonal anti-MIC2 (T34A11) was provided by Dr. Jean-François Dubremetz, and the hybridome BB2, producing mAbs against Ty1 tag, was provided by Dr. Keith Gull (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). Tachyzoites of the RH strain T. gondii were propagated in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) monolayers grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 10 mmHEPES, 1 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (referred to as D-10). Parasites were harvested from freshly lysed cultures in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES and 0.1 mm EGTA (HHE) as previously described (8Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Bradyzoites were obtained from mouse brains chronically infected with the ME49 strain ofT. gondii (kindly provided by Dr. Steve Parmley, Palo Alto Medical Research Foundation). Oocysts, including nonsporulated, partially sporulated, and fully sporulated preparations, were obtained from cats infected with the VEG strain of T. gondii(kindly provided by Dr. Michael White, Montana State University). A clonal isolate of the RH hxgprt− of T. gondii was used as the recipient strain for all the transfection experiments. The cosmid library used the SuperCos vector modified with SAG1/ble Toxoplasma selection cassette inserted into its Hin dIII site. The library was prepared from aSau 3AI partial digestion of RH genomic DNA ligated into theBam HI cloning site (kindly provided by D. Howe). Inserts from TgEST phage clones were amplified using T3 and T7 primers and cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing was conducted by cycle-sequencing using ABI Prism Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing reaction kits (ABI, Foster City, CA) and resolved on ABI 377 DNA sequencers. Sequence analysis was conducted with the Genetics Computer Group programs (13Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar), programs available through the National Center for Biotechnology, and programs at the ExPasy site. The vector pGEXMIC4A1 was constructed by cloning a PCR product corresponding to the N-terminal region of MIC4 and encompassing the first apple domain A1 into pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The sense and antisense primers used for PCR amplification are 5′-cgcggatcctggtttggagtggctaaagccc-3′ and 5′-ggttaattaagtggatcccaacacccctcgttccttaa-3′, respectively. In parallel, the same A1 fragment was cloned into a pET vector, and the nonfusion protein could also be produced in native soluble form inEscherichia coli BL21. The expression vector for T. gondii pTMIC4mycHXGPRT was obtained by cloning a PCR product corresponding to the complete coding sequence of MIC4 between the Eco RI andPac I sites of the pTmycHXGPRT vector previously described (14Hettmann C. Herm A. Geiter A. Frank B. Schwarz E. Soldati T. Soldati D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1385-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The primers for PCR were 5′-cggaattccctttttcgacaaaatgagagcgtcgctccc-3′ and 5′-ccttaattaaaatgcatcttctgtgtctttcgcttc-3′. An additional epitope tag was introduced at the N terminus of MIC4 to generate pTty1MIC4mycHXGPRT. The 11 amino acid Ty-1 tag coding sequence (LEVHTNQDPLD) was inserted as double-stranded oligonulcleotides into the unique Pst I site at amino acid 47 of MIC4: 5′-gaggtccacacgaaccaggacccgctcgaccatgca-3′ and 5′-tggtcgagcgggtcctggttcgtgtggacctctgca-3′ (15Bastin P. Bagherzadeh Z. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A vector expressing MIC4 with a stretch of eight histidine residues at the C terminus was obtained by inserting double-strand oligonucleotides 5′-gggcaccaccatcaccaccatcaccattaat-3′ and 5′-taatggtgatggtggtgatggtggtgccctgca-3′ into the unique Pst I and Pac I sites of the expression vector pT-HXGPRT. The vector pTMIC4ΔC12 corresponds to a deletion mutant at the C terminus of MIC4 lacking the last 12 amino acids, which was generated by PCR using the antisense primer 5′-ccttaattaatcaggatccattgtcacagaaagtatagggtc-3′. The preparation of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was obtained by cloning a fragment encompassing the first apple domain of the predicted MIC4 protein. The DNA sequence coding for the amino acids 19–205 was cloned into the pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for production as a fusion protein in E. coli. Expression of the recombinant MIC4 fragment fused to GST was achieved in the E. coli strain BL21 after a 4-h induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The protein was purified under native conditions according to the manufacturer. Rabbit polyclonal sera were made against the purified GST-A1-2 fusion. The initial immunization was performed with 500 μg of protein with complete Freund's adjuvant, whereas 300 μg of protein in Gerbu adjuvant (LQ) were used for the subsequent boosts. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207180) Google Scholar). Freshly released tachyzoites were harvested and washed in PBS. Samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer with (reduced) or without (nonreduced) 144 mm β-mercaptoethanol and separated on 8.5 or 10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting and to polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membranes for N-terminal sequencing. Western blots were probed with antibodies to Toxoplasma proteins followed by goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase and developed by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or SuperSignal (Pierce). Western blots were quantified by exposure of blots to GS-250 imaging screen CH using a model 363 Molecular Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the Molecular Analyst software. To generate stable transformants, 5 × 107 extracellular RHhxgprt −parasites were transfected and selected as previously described (17Donald R. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Parasites were transfected with 80–100 μg of linearized plasmid. Twenty-four hours later, parasites were subjected to mycophenolic acid/xanthine exposure and cloned 3 to 5 days later by limiting dilution in 96-well microtiter plates containing HFF cells in the presence of mycophenolic acid/xanthine. Stable transformants were analyzed for the presence of the recombinant protein by IFA. All manipulations were carried out at room temperature. Tachyzoite-infected HFF cells on glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde or 4% paraformaldehyde only for 20 min followed by a 3-min incubation with 0.1 mglycine in PBS. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min and blocked in 2% fetal calf serum or BSA in PBS for 20 min. The cells were then stained with the primary antibodies followed by Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Bio-Rad). Confocal images were collected with a Leica laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS-NT DM/IRB) using a 100 × Plan-Apo objective with a numerical aperture of 1.30. Single optical sections were recorded with an optimal pinhole of 1.0 (according to Leica instructions) and 16× averaging. All other micrographs were obtained with a Zeiss Axiophot equiped with a camera (Photometrics Type CH-250). Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA) was used for image processing. Thin sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed, LR White-embedded materials were mounted on nickel grids. The grids with sections of enteric forms, tachyzoites, or tissue cysts were floated on drops of 1% BSA in Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, to reduce nonspecific staining followed by the rabbit anti-MIC4 antibodies appropriately diluted in Tris buffer. After washing, the grids were floated on secondary antibody conjugated to either 5- or 10-nm colloidal gold particles. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate before examination in the electron microscope. For large scale preparation of excretory-secretory antigens (ESA), ∼5 × 109 tachyzoites were resuspended in 1 ml of HHE and stimulated to discharge micronemes by the addition of ethanol to a final concentration of 1.0% and warming to 37 °C for 30 min (8Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Cells were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g, and the supernatant was kept for binding experiments. To purify the contents of micronemes, ∼5 × 109 tachyzoites were harvested in HHE as above and subjected to sonication and cell fractionation as described previously (8Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, parasites were resuspended in cold HHE at ∼109/ml and sonicated while on ice (3 × 30-s pulses at setting 35 on a BioSonik III microprobe sonicator (Bronwill Scientific, Rochester, NY). After sonication, large cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C, and the supernatant was further clarified by spinning at 8,000 × g for 20 min, 4 °C. The micronemes were recovered from the supernatant by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The 30,000 × g pellet was resuspended in PBS, pH 6.0, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml E64, 10 μg/ml (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF), 10 μg/ml TLCK, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and subjected to three rapid freeze/thaw cycles. The suspension was then sonicated 3 × 15 s using the maximum setting for the microprobe sonicator (550 Sonic Dismembrator, Fisher). The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to remove unbroken micronemes and membranes, and the supernatant containing soluble micronemal proteins was kept for cell binding experiments. Confluent monolayers of HFF cells grown in 6-well plates were rinsed in PBS and blocked for 30 min at 12 °C with 1% BSA in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (CM-PBS). Excess BSA was removed by rinsing in CM-PBS, and micronemal proteins (20 μg/ml total) were added in a volume of 1 ml of CM-PBS and incubated at 12 °C for 1 h. The unbound fraction (referred to as supernatant) was removed, and the monolayers were rinsed four times in cold CM-PBS (referred to as W1, W2, W3, and W4). The cell-bound fraction (CBF) was collected by lysing the monolayer in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA). Fractions were acetone-precipitated and resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Dilution standards of the micronemal protein preparations were loaded in parallel to simulate the contents of 1, 5, and 10% of the total input material. ESA treated with 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA, Sigma) was preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 50 mm MESNA and then diluted 50 times in CM-PBS for the binding assay. To characterize secretory proteins of Toxoplasma, we generated mAbs to the ESA fraction released by extracellular tachyzoites. When the mAb 5B1 was used to probe Western blots, it recognized a sharp band that migrated at 72 kDa in tachyzoite cell lysates and 70 kDa in ESA resolved under reducing conditions. Both bands migrated more rapidly and diffusely in the absence of reduction, suggesting the presence of internal disulfide bonds (Fig.1 A). To identify the gene corresponding to the protein recognized by mAb 5B1, we isolated ESA on a large scale and resolved the proteins by SDS-PAGE. Parallel strips were transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting to identify the band recognized by mAb 5B1 (Fig. 1 B) and to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for microsequencing. N-terminal sequencing of the band corresponding to the 72-kDa form yielded a partially degenerate sequence of 12 residues (X(G/S)E(P/N)(D/A)(K/P)LDLA(P/L)V). Comparison of the N-terminal sequence against the Toxoplasma dbEST data base using BLAST identified one hit that matched at 9 of 12 residues to the clone TgESTzy06c08.r1. The sequence of this clone was used to identify other overlapping ESTs. A radioactive probe derived from the TgESTzy26b09.r1 clone was used to screen a cosmid library, and an extended genomic sequence of the locus was determined by primer walking across 5000 base pairs on a positive clone (GenBankTM accession number AF143487). The sequence of the gene codes for a protein of 580 amino acids with a predicted mass of 61 kDa. The short hydrophobic stretch that follows the start codon has the hallmark of a putative signal peptide (Fig.1 C). Hydropathy analysis indicates no other hydrophobic stretch on the protein. Comparison of the complete coding sequence against the nonredundant GenBankTM data base using BLAST revealed that the gene was homologous to several micronemal antigens previously described fromS. muris (18Eschenbacher K.H. Klein H. Sommer I. Meyer H.E. Entzeroth R. Mehlhorn H. Ruger W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 62: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Klein H. Mehlhorn H. Ruger W. Parasitol. Res. 1996; 82: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and to the recently reported E. tenella micronemal protein EtMIC5 (9Brown P.J. Billington K.J. Bumstead J.M. Clark J.D. Tomley F.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These proteins share the feature of containing conserved, cysteine-rich domains known as apple motifs, which were detected using Prosite (ExPasy). Such a domain contains six half-cystine residues at highly conserved positions that form a structure resembling an apple (20McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The consensus for the internal four cysteine residues of this sequence is CX 3CX 5CX 11C. The six apple domains of MIC4 are arranged as follows A1 (amino acids 67–139), A2 (amino acids 140–230), A3 (amino acids 231–303), A4 (amino acids 304–417), A5 (amino acids 418–490), and A6 (amino acids 491–580) (for alignment of the six apple domains, see Ref. 9Brown P.J. Billington K.J. Bumstead J.M. Clark J.D. Tomley F.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the case of human plasma prekallikrein, it has been shown that three highly conserved disulfide bonds are linking the first and sixth, second and fifth, and third and fourth half-cystine residues in each domain (14Hettmann C. Herm A. Geiter A. Frank B. Schwarz E. Soldati T. Soldati D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1385-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since these cysteine residues are conserved in MIC4, it is likely that disulfide bond formation in MIC4 is similar to prekallikrein. The sequence analysis of MIC4 predicts a signal peptide cleavage site between residues Ala25 and His26(ExPasy). Although we have not been able to verify the N-terminal sequence of the 72-kDa form of the protein found in cells, it likely corresponds to the mature N terminus generated within the secretory pathway, with removal of an additional 32 residues occurring at the time of secretion into the medium. The 1743-base pair open reading frame of MIC4 contains no introns. The putative transcription start site of MIC4 was determined by sequencing several clones obtained by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR. A sequence analysis of the promoter region revealed the lack of TATA box and no element resembling an initiator element (Inr) (22Nakaar V. Bermudes D. Peck K.R. Joiner K.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 92: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, a consensus sequence (heptamer motif) found multiple times in the 5′-flanking sequences of several T. gondii genes (23Mercier C. Lefebvre-van Hende S. Graber G. Lecordier L. Beauchamps P. Capron A. Cesbron-Delauw M.-F. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is present in the promoter region of MIC4 (Fig. 1 C). Two heptamer motifs are positioned at −716 (AGAGACG) and −496 (TGAGACG) from the transcription start site. These elements have been previously mapped and shown to be critical for transcription of the family of GRA genes (23Mercier C. Lefebvre-van Hende S. Graber G. Lecordier L. Beauchamps P. Capron A. Cesbron-Delauw M.-F. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and are also included in the 27-base pair repeat element of SAG1 gene (24Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A single in-frame ATG lies 58 residues upstream of the N-terminal sequence that was obtained from the purified protein. This ATG probably serves as the translational initiation codon based on the facts that 1) it is the first in-frame ATG, 2) the six nucleotides preceding the ATG (CACAAA) are consistent with the consensus sequence for translational initiation in T. gondii (GNCAAA) (25Seeber F. Boothroyd J.C. Gene. 1996; 169: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and 3) the ATG immediately precedes a sequence predicted to encode a hydrophobic signal peptide. Northern blot and Southern blot analyses confirmed that MIC4 is present as a single copy gene in T. gondii genome that produces a single transcript of the expected size in tachyzoites (data not shown). We previously reported that the antigen recognized by mAb 5B1 is secreted from Toxoplasma in a manner consistent with it originating from micronemes (8Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 26Carruthers V.B. Moreno S.N. Sibley L.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To confirm that the gene described here corresponds to a micronemal protein, we produced a bacterial recombinant GST-A1 fusion of the N-terminal 186 amino acids of MIC4 encompassing the first apple domain (A1) and raised polyclonal antibodies against the purified protein. The rabbit antisera obtained were tested on immunoblots loaded with the recombinant nonfusion A1 and GST-A1 fusion expressed in E. coli, T. gondii tachyzoites, and Vero cell lysates (Fig.2 A). The sera recognized specifically a 72-kDa protein in tachyzoites. Neither anti-GST antibodies nor the preimmune rabbit sera reacted with T. gondii proteins on Western blots (data not shown). To determine the pattern of expression of MIC4 in the different life stages of the parasite, cell lysates of tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and oocysts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed by Western blotting (Fig.2 B). MIC4 was not detected in unsporulated or partially sporulated oocysts but was present at approximately equal levels in fully sporulated oocysts (sporozoites), bradyzoites, and tachyzoites. As anticipated, the mAb 5B1 specifically recognized micronemes by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy (data not shown). IFA studies with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against GST-A1 confirmed a typical staining pattern for proteins located in the apical microneme organelles of the parasites (punctate fluorescence pattern at the apical pole). MIC4 colocalized perfectly with the other micronemal protein MIC2 (27Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Autheman J.M. Fortier B. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). IFA performed on extracellular parasites only stained parasites permeabilized with Triton X-100 before incubation with the first antibody (data not shown). This observation suggests that MIC4 is predominantly localized in the micronemes and absent from the cell surface. Ultrastructural examination confirmed that the polyclonal antibodies recognized a protein located within the micronemes of tachyzoites (Fig. 2 C, a) and bradyzoites (Fig.2 C, b). The few micronemes in the merozoite of mature schizonts were also labeled (Fig. 2 C, c). In keeping with the nomenclature of previously establishedToxoplasma proteins (27Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Autheman J.M. Fortier B. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we named this antigen MIC4. The T. gondii micronemal proteins characterized so far are subjected to extensive proteolytic remodeling during their transport and/or secretion (27Achbarou A. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Autheman J.M. Fortier B. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 47: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acids sequence deduced from the MIC4 gene with the information obtained from N-terminal sequencing of the mature protein is indicative of proteolytic cleavage. To determine whether MIC4 is proteolytically cleaved during its transport to the micronemes, we generated recombinant parasites expressing MIC4 tagged at both ends with epitopes. The construct pTMIC4mycHXGPRT produced MIC4 with epitope tags at the N terminus and/or the C terminus. An additional Ty-1 epitope tag was introduced 10 amino acids upstream of the cleavage site mapped previously by the N-terminal sequencing of secreted form to generate pTty1MIC4mycHXGPRT. Both constructs were stably integrated into T. gondii tachyzoites, and expression of MIC4myc or Ty-1MIC4myc was examined by Western blot and by IFA. The mAbs anti-Myc and anti-Ty-1 recognized the 72-kDa form of MIC4 on Western blot (Fig. 3 A) and gave a typical microneme staining on IFA (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that the form of MIC4 stored in the micronemes is not proteolytically cleaved beside the cotranslational removal of the signal peptide and, as for MIC2, the processing on MIC4 occurred uniquely post-exocytosis. Immunoblot analysis of tachyzoite lysates and ESA material using mAb 5B1 and the rabbit polyclonal antisera revealed the existence of an additional proteolytic processing at the C terminus that generates the two products of ∼50 and 15 kDa (Fig.3 C, lanes 1 and 2, upper and lower panels). The 72-kDa precursor form of MIC4 is present in the micronemes, whereas the processed forms are uniquely detectable in ESA. The polyclonal antibodies were raised against the apple domains A1 and A2 and recognized the 50-kDa form only, whereas the 15-kDa product was detected exclusively by the mAb 5B1. Together, these results document that processing occurs at the surface of the parasite only after release by the micronemes and allowed the mapping of the epitope recognized by the mAb 5B1 within the A6 at the C terminus of MIC4. Recently, distinct protease activities for MIC2 have been described using a variety of pro"

The CLN2 gene product was first identified as a normally abundant 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphorylated glycoprotein that was absent in brain autopsy specimens from LINCL patients, leading to the molecular characterization of the disease gene (2Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lackland H. Liu C.G. Sohar I. Pullarkat R.K. Lobel P. Science. 1997; 277: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The encoded protein has significant sequence similarities to two previously characterized bacterial endoproteases fromXanthomonas and Pseudomonas (3Oda K. Takahashi T. Tokuda Y. Shibano Y.

(Tokyo). 1996; 120: 564-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These prokaryotic enzymes have been named bacterial pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl peptidases (BPICPs) based on a series of studies that suggest that, like classic aspartyl proteases, their catalytic mechanism involves a pair of amino acids with carboxyl side chains that catalyze peptide bond hydrolysis at acidic pH but, unlike the classic aspartyl proteases, they are not inhibited by pepstatin. Based on these sequence relationships, we demonstrated that the CLN2 protein was a lysosomal protease that could degrade hemoglobin at acidic pH in the presence of aspartyl and cysteine protease inhibitors (2Sleat D.E.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 700-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). More recently, the CLN2 protein has been shown to have tripeptidyl exopeptidase activity. Peptide sequencing of tripeptidyl-peptidase I (TPP-I) purified from rat spleen demonstrated that it is the rodent ortholog of human CLN2p (6Vines D. Warburton M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and TPPI-I activity is absent in LINCL specimens (7Vines D.J. Warburton M.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, Ezaki and colleagues (8Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Oda K. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have shown that purified CLN2p has both TPP-I and endopeptidase activity. Mechanistic studies on purified CLN2p/TPP-I by a number of groups indicate that enzymatic activity is not inhibited by standard serine, cysteine, metallo, or aspartyl protease inhibitors (6Vines D. Warburton M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Oda K. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Based on this, it has been proposed that the CLN2p/TPP-I is a pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl peptidase. However, Rawlings and Barrett (10Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 496-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) critically reviewed existing evidence for classification of the BPICPs and concluded that the catalytic mechanism for these enzymes has not been rigorously established. These investigators alertly pointed out that a conserved Gly-Xaa-Ser sequence in CLN2p/TPP-I and the BPICPs is characteristic of the active site motif of many serine peptidases. Interestingly, data base searches using the CLN2p/TPP-I sequence with different BLAST tools (CD-Search and PSI-BLAST) retrieve members of the S8 subtilisin family of serine peptidases (data not shown). A thorough understanding of the biochemical properties of the CLN2 gene product may provide valuable clues toward understanding and developing therapies for LINCL. In this study, we have characterized the enzymatic properties of CLN2p/TPP-I. We find that the protein is synthesized as an inactive zymogen that is autocatalytically converted to an active serine protease at acidic pH. Two different human CLN2 cDNAs encoding the His175 and Arg175variants (GenBankTM accession number AF017456) were subcloned into pBACgus-1 (Novagen). The constructs encode full-length CLN2p/TPP-I (residues 1–563) with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (residues 564–569). Both constructs were expressed at Kemp Biotechnologies (Fredrick, MD) using the Sf9 cell baculovirus system. Although the Arg175 variant has only been observed in one of several cDNAs sequenced to date, it was used for large scale production purposes because it gave significantly higher yield. Aliquots of conditioned medium (1 liter) were stored at −80 °C until use. All purification steps were conducted at 4 °C, and TPP-I activity was monitored after preincubating samples at pH 3.5 to activate the proenzyme (see below). Thawed medium was adjusted to contain 2 m NaCl/20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was applied to a 53-cm3 butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and the CLN2p/TPP-I precursor peak was applied to a 10-cm3 TALON immobilized cobalt column (CLONTECH Laboratories). The column was washed with 50 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The hexahistidine-tagged CLN2p/TPP-I precursor was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on either a Mono Q HR 5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or an UNO Q-12 (Bio-Rad) column using a 50–500 mm sodium chloride gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The purified protein eluted at ∼170 mm sodium chloride and appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein (1–2 mg/ml) was divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use. The total yield of purified protein was typically 6 mg/liter of culture medium. Mature CLN2p/TPP-I was purified from frozen human brain autopsy specimens obtained from National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). Brain mannose 6-phosphorylated glycoproteins were isolated by chromatography on immobilized cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor as described previously (11Sleat D.E. Sohar I. Lackland H. Majercak J. Lobel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19191-19198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) except that the column was sequentially eluted with 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate and then with 100 mmglycine, pH 2.5. The glycine eluate contained the bulk of the mannose 6-phosphorylated CLN2p/TPP-I and was applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted using a 0–1m sodium chloride gradient in 0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5. Fractions containing TPP-I activity eluted at ∼0.5 m sodium chloride and were further purified by gel filtration on a 1.0 × 30-cm Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column eluted using 0.1% Tween 20, 50 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm sodium formate, pH 4.0. The purified 46-kDa protein appeared homogeneous by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Total yield of purified protein was typically 20 μg/100 g of human brain. Production of untagged human CLN2p/TPP-I precursor in CHO cells will be described elsewhere. 2L. Lin and P. Lobel, manuscript in preparation. Standard conditions were as follows unless otherwise noted. All incubation steps contained 150 mm sodium chloride and 0.1% Triton X-100 (saline/Triton) buffered to the indicated pH as stated in the figure legends. The proenzyme was activated by dilution into 50 mm formate, pH 3.5, buffered saline/Triton and incubation at 22–37 °C for at least 10 min. For incubations with inhibitors, the concentration of the enzyme was typically ∼50 nm, and the final concentration of solvent used to prepare the inhibitor stock was <1%. TPP-I activity was assayed using the kinetic assay described previously (12Sohar I. Lin L. Lobel P. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) except that the temperature of the fluorescent plate reader was adjusted so that the input samples were at thermal equilibrium to eliminate the initial lag period. The final concentration of enzyme was typically ∼5 nm, and the Ala-Ala-Phe-aminomethylcoumarin (AAF-AMC) substrate concentration was 200 μm. For peptide mapping, the activation and DFP reaction conditions were as described above except that volatile buffers (150 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.0) were used to facilitate downstream processing. Samples (typically 100 μg) were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 100 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 2 mm EDTA, 375 mm Tris, pH 8.1, and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. Samples were reduced by adding 4 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol (incubation, 1.5 h at 50 °C) and alkylated by adding 16 μl of 0.5 m iodoacetamide (incubation in the dark for 30 min at 25 °C). The mixtures were desalted on a Superdex Peptide column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peak fractions were pooled, evaporated to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge, resuspended in 100 μl of 150 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h after adding 2.5 μg of trypsin (Worthington, TRSEQZ grade). The reactions were stopped by addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of ∼0.1%. Digests were analyzed on a PE Biosystems Voyager Pro mass spectrometer using sinapinic acid matrix before and after fractionation by HPLC on a C18 Vydac protein/peptide column eluted using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides of interest were further analyzed by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer. Polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis was used to introduce the S475A (TCG to GCG), D360A (GAC to GCC), D517A (GAT to GCT), and H236A (CAT to GCT) mutations into the human CLN2p/TPP-I cDNA sequence. Briefly, for each construct, two complementary oligonucleotide primers that contained the appropriate nucleotide changes were used separately with outside primers flanking either the 5′ or 3′ coding sequence to generate two polymerase chain reaction products. These were then gel purified, mixed, and used with the outside primers in a second round of polymerase chain reaction. The resulting product containing the full-length CLN2 coding sequence was subcloned into the expression vector pSFFV-neo (13Fuhlbrigge R.C. Sheehan K.C. Schreiber R.D. Chaplin D.D. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2643-2650PubMed Google Scholar), and the entire insert was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and absence of unwanted changes. DNA was introduced into CHO cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and resistant clones were selected using G418. For activity assays and Western blotting, cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum until monolayers reached confluence. Cells were washed and cultured in 2 ml of serum-free medium for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with a solution (0.5 ml) of 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min (medium) or 20 min (lysates) and analyzed for TPP-I activity using the end point assay (12Sohar I. Lin L. Lobel P. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 1005-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) after preactivation at pH 3.5 for 30 min at 37 °C. Clarified lysates contained between 1.2 and 1.5 mg/ml protein as determined by the Lowry assay (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (lysates, 8 μg/lane; medium, 15.6 μl/lane) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Novex). CLN2p/TPP-I was visualized by Western blotting using a rabbit antiserum prepared against hexahistidine-tagged CLN2p/TPP-I (antiserum R72–5, contract production by Cocalico Biologicals) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). We purified a C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged version of the CLN2p/TPP-I secreted by an insect cell production system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” When maintained at nearly neutral pH, the protein had an apparent size of 66 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). Edman degradation revealed that the N terminus of the 66-kDa species (SYSPE … ) corresponds to residue 20 of the predicted CLN2p precursor. Differences in the predicted and actual molecular mass of the His-tagged CLN2p/TPP-I (residue 20–569; 60,118 Da) are probably due to N-linked glycosylation (2Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lackland H. Liu C.G. Sohar I. Pullarkat R.K. Lobel P. Science. 1997; 277: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar,9Junaid M.A. Wu G. Pullarkat R.K. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In acidic conditions (pH <4.5), the protein is converted to lower molecular mass forms (Fig. 1). Note that in addition to the major species of ∼46 kDa, faster migrating bands also appear (∼20 kDa), suggesting that the processing occurs through an endoproteolytic mechanism. More detailed analysis of the conversion at pH 4.0 indicates that the 66-kDa species is rapidly (t 12 = 7 min) converted to a 46-kDa species that is stable upon prolonged (24 h) incubation (Fig. 2). Note the transient appearance of lower molecular mass species near the bottom of the gel that appear to decrease in size and eventually disappear at long time points (Fig.2, lane 14), consistent with endoproteolytic liberation and eventual degradation of the propeptide. Also, at early time points there appears to be a ∼49-kDa species that transiently appears (Fig.2, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that the initial endoproteolytic cleavage may be upstream of the terminally processed 46-kDa mature form. Edman degradation revealed that the N terminus of the 46-kDa species (LHLGV) corresponds to residue 196 of the predicted CLN2p precursor, identical to that of human brain CLN2p (2Sleat D.E. Donnelly R.J. Lackland H. Liu C.G. Sohar I. Pullarkat R.K. Lobel P. Science. 1997; 277: 1802-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity measurements indicate that the 66-kDa form has very low TPP-I activity and that the time course for acquisition of activity (t 12 = 6 min) is nearly identical to that of proteolytic processing (Fig. 2). Similar findings were obtained using untagged proenzyme purified from CHO cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the CLN2 protein is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme that upon acidification undergoes autocatalytic conversion to an enzymatically active species. To investigate the catalytic properties of the CLN2 protein, we incubated the processed protein at pH 4.25 in the presence of different group-specific protease inhibitors and then measured TPP-I activity. Essentially identical results were obtained using purified His-tagged CLN2p/TPP-I produced in insect cells, untagged CLN2p/TPP-I purified from a CHO cell expression system, mature CLN2p/TPP-I purified from human brain, and crude human brain homogenates (Table I). Consistent with previous studies, there was essentially no effect on activity by the metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA, by the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64, by the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin, or by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A relatively minor effect was seen with the metalloproteinase inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline. Also, confirming the results of others (6Vines D. Warburton M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Unexpectedly, TPP-I activity was inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor DFP (Table I). Similar results were obtained when activity was assayed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-hemoglobin substrate (data not shown). In addition, the serine protease inhibitor 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) partially inhibited activity (Table I). Note that at the acidic pH used for these experiments, DCI formed an insoluble precipitate at millimolar or higher concentrations, thus complicating analysis of the concentration dependence of this inhibitor.Table IRelative TPP-I activity of different preparations in the presence of inhibitorsInhibitor 1-aActivated enzyme was preincubated with 2.5 times the indicated concentration of inhibitor for 1 h at 22 °C, diluted 2.5-fold into substrate solution to give the indicated concentration of inhibitor, and then assayed for TPP-I activity.

Open table in a new tab We conducted a series of dilution experiments to ascertain the stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Activated enzyme was preincubated with inhibitor for 1 h, and then the initial TPP-I activity was measured immediately after diluting the preparation into a substrate solution adjusted to contain the same or a 10-fold lower final concentration of inhibitor (TableII). This was compared with the activity of a parallel sample where low concentration of inhibitor was present in both the preincubation and assay mixture. These experiments revealed that the inhibition by AAF-CMK was readily reversible, indicating that the enzyme-inhibitor complex was in rapid equilibrium (Table II, compare treatments 2 and 4). The inhibition of activity by high concentrations of DCI was partially reversed following rapid dilution (Table II, compare treatments 5 and 7), and the reversal was nearly complete after 3 h (data not shown). In contrast, the inhibition by DFP was essentially irreversible (Table II, compare treatments 8 and 10), even when measured 24 h after dilution (data not shown). The DFP inhibition could be prevented by preincubating the enzyme with the competitive inhibitor AAF-CMK (Table II, compare treatment 9 with treatments 11 and 4) or by the AAF-AMC substrate (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that a serine in the active site of CLN2p/TPP-I plays a key role in catalysis.Table IIReversibility of inhibitorsTreatmentInhibitor concentrationRelative TPP-I activityDuring preincubationDuring TPP-I assayAAF-CMKDCIDFPAAF-CMKDCIDFPnmμmmmnmμmmm1100230306330343433395300300376300304973030778221920.22100.20.2581130230.238The hexahistidine-tagged CLN2p/TPP-I was activated and then preincubated with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 70 min at 25 °C in saline/Trition, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5.

Open table in a new tab The hexahistidine-tagged CLN2p/TPP-I was activated and then preincubated with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 70 min at 25 °C in saline/Trition, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The samples were diluted 10-fold into buffer containing 200 μm AAF-AMC substrate supplemented with or without inhibitor to give the final indicated concentration and assayed immediately for TPP-I activity. We investigated different parameters that affected inactivation of CLN2p/TPP-I by DFP. Inactivation was dependent on time and DFP concentration (Fig. 3, top panel). Plots of the log of the residual activityversus time yielded a series of straight lines for different DFP concentrations, indicating that the inactivation reaction followed pseudo-first order kinetics (Fig. 3, middle panel). A double reciprocal plot of the inverse apparent first order rate constantversus inverse DFP concentration yielded a straight line passing near the origin, suggesting that DFP does not form a Michaelis complex with CLN2p/TPP-I (Fig. 3, bottom panel), and the second order rate constant (k app/[DFP]) was ∼30 m−1 min−1 at 25 °C and pH 4.25 (Fig. 3, bottom panel, inset). Note that this analysis ignores hydrolysis of DFP during the reaction period and is likely to slightly underestimate the true second order rate constant (see Fig. 3 legend). The rate of TPP-I/CLN2p inactivation by DFP was most rapid at pH ∼4.5 (Fig. 4, top panel). This pH dependence was similar to that of enzymatic activity assayed using the AAF-AMC TPP-I substrate (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Experiments using nonactivated precursor and preactivated enzyme indicated that the proenzyme reacted very slowly if at all with DFP (data not shown). Given that the DFP reaction occurs by nucleophilic attack of an activated serine (18Powers J.C. Harper J.W. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Amsterdam, Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 55-152Google Scholar), these data indicate that both proteolytic processing and acidic pH are required for activation and/or accessibility of the catalytic serine to external substrates. To determine the site and stoichiometry of labeling, we compared tryptic digests of unmodified and DFP-inactivated CLN2p/TPP-I. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed that the patterns were essentially identical except that a 2835.1 m/z fragment disappeared and a new 3000.6 m/z peak appeared after DFP treatment (Fig. 5, upper panel). The masses of these peaks indicate that they represent the same tryptic fragment Val466–Lys492 with or without the diisopropyl phosphate modification (theoreticalm/z, 3000.4 and 2836.2, respectively). Therefore, modification of CLN2p/TPP-I on a single residue within Val466–Lys492 is responsible for inhibition. HPLC analysis of tryptic digests also demonstrates that one residue within fragment Val466–Lys492 is stoichiometrically labeled by DFP. For instance, in Fig. 5 (lower panel), the two peaks labeled A and A′present in a tryptic digest of unmodified CLN2p/TPP-I disappear after DFP inactivation with the concomitant appearance of the two peaks B and B′. Chemical sequencing and MALDI-TOF analysis reveal that peak A represents tryptic fragment Val466–Lys492, and A′ represents an incompletely digested tryptic fragment encompassing Ala448–Lys492, whereas B and B′ represent the corresponding diisopropyl phosphate-labeled fragments. The lack of any other discernable differences in the modified and unmodified digests also supports our conclusion that DFP-labeling of a single residue within Val466–Lys492 is responsible for inhibition. The Val466–Lys492 CLN2p/TPP-I peptide and the corresponding regions of the BPICPs align to the active site serine of subtilisin (Fig. 6). Edman degradation of the purified DFP-modified tryptic peptide was complicated by poor retention of the peptide on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane during sequencing (data not shown). However, in analysis of three different preparations, for cycles 1–16 we could clearly assign all residues to that predicted from the cDNA sequence except for cycle 10, which was predicted to be Ser475. Inspection of the repetitive yield of serine showed that serine clearly was present at cycles 7, 12, and 21 but absent at cycle 10. In contrast, serine was clearly present at cycle 10 in sequencing of the corresponding unmodified tryptic peptide. Finally, Ser475 represents the only conserved serine among CLN2p/TPP-I and the BPICPs in the tryptic peptide. Taken together, these data indicate that Ser475represents the active site nucleophile of CLN2p/TPP-I and, by extension, the BPICPs. To directly investigate the function of Ser475 we expressed wild type CLN2p/TPP-I and a S475A mutant in CHO cells. The cells expressing wild type human CLN2p/TPP-I had elevated TPP-I activity and Western blotting revealed elevated levels of both precursor and processed protein (Fig.7). The cells expressing the S475A mutant had activity similar to the neo-transfected control, indicating that the mutant was inactive compared with the wild type CLN2p/TPP-I protein. Western blotting indicated that the majority of the protein was in the precursor form, suggesting that processing was impaired (Fig. 7). However, the increased amount of ∼46-kDa protein compare with the neo-transfected control indicates that other proteases, possibly including endogenous CHO cell CLN2p/TPP-I, are capable of cleaving the catalytically inactive mutant. We also analyzed two constructs that had alanine substitutions at Asp360 and Asp517, which align to residues important for function of the bacterial pepstatin-insensitive proteases (19Ito M. Narutaki S. Uchida K. Oda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Oyama H. Abe S. Ushiyama S. Takahashi S. Oda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27815-27822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The two aspartate mutants were similar to the S475A mutation in terms of lack of enzyme activity and processing (Fig. 7). Finally, in a preliminary attempt to find other catalytically important residues, we also analyzed a H236A mutant and found that it resembled the wild type construct in regard to processing and activity (Fig. 7). In this study, we find that CLN2p/TPP-I is synthesized as a catalytically inactive protein that upon acidification is autocatalytically processed to an active protease. More detailed kinetic studies indicate that activation can occur both by intermolecular and intramolecular events, with the latter route predominating at low proenzyme concentrations. 3I. Sohar and P. Lobel, manuscript in preparation. Based on the sequence of the precursor and mature protein, residues 20–195 (M r = 19,523) are removed following acidification. Processing is likely to entail an endoproteolytic cleavage of the CLN2p/TPP-I as shown by the appearance of small (<20 kDa) fragments that transiently appear after acidification. Consistent with this, CLN2p/TPP-I has recently been shown to have intrinsic endoproteolytic as well as tripeptidyl exopeptidase activity (8Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Oda K. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The appearance of a transient 49-kDa species suggests that the initial endoproteolytic cleavage may occur upstream of the Leu196 N terminus of the mature form. However, identification of processing intermediates is hindered by the appearance of TPP-I activity that can further trim various species including the remaining proenzyme, liberated propeptide, and the processing intermediates themselves. Although the precise details remain to be elucidated, our in vitro studies indicate that the CLN2p/TPP-I can undergo autocatalytic processing at conditions that mimic the acidic environment of the lysosome. This property should be useful when considering possible enzyme replacement therapy for LINCL patients, where the recombinant proenzyme could be administered as an inactive prodrug that is converted to active enzyme after proper delivery to its site of action. Proteases are typically classified by catalytic type based on their susceptibility to different types of inhibitors, with DCI and DFP being diagnostic for serine proteases (21Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We find that DCI inhibits CLN2p/TPP-I in a reversible manner. Although DCI is generally thought to be an irreversible inhibitor, some bona fide serine proteases do regain activity following DCI inactivation (22Harper J.W. Hemmi K. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Our clear finding that DFP inactivates CLN2p/TPP-I is somewhat unexpected given the reported insensitivity of TPP-I (6Vines D. Warburton M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Ezaki J. Takeda-Ezaki M. Oda K. Kominami E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Int. 1992; 27: 869-877PubMed Google Scholar) and a bacterial pepstatin-insensitive protease (23Oda K. Sugitani M. Fukuhara K. Murao S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 923: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to this inhibitor. However, other studies have reported partial to complete inhibition of TPP-I activity with high concentrations of DFP (15McDonald J.K. Hoisington A.R. Eisenhauer D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 126: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Page A.E. Fuller K. Chambers T.J. Warburton M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These discrepancies may reflect the kinetics and pH dependence of the DFP reaction. Even at its optimal pH, DFP inhibition of CLN2p/TPP-I is slow compared with that of other serine esterases (24Cohen J.A. Oosterbaan R.A. Berends F. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 686-702Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), so it is possible that the experimental conditions were not optimized to detect the reaction. Serine proteases typically contain a catalytic triad of aspartate, histidine, and serine residues, with the serine hydroxyl group being activated by the histidine, and the aspartate stabilizing the histidine imidazole ring as it gains and loses a proton (25Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman, New York1999Google Scholar). Although most serine proteases are inactive at acidic pH, this is not true for carboxypeptidase II and cathepsin A. In both of these enzymes, the environment of the active site includes a cluster of acid groups that may lower the histidine pK a (26Liao D.I. Breddam K. Sweet R.M. Bullock T. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9796-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Rudenko G. Bonten E. d'Azzo A. Hol W.G. Structure. 1995; 3: 1249-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and thus allow it to participate in both general acid and base catalysis at acidic pH (25Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman, New York1999Google Scholar). There are also examples of serine proteases that lack the classic catalytic triad such as members of the SF and SG clan, which have a catalytic dyad consisting of a lysine and serine (28Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The results presented in this study, as well as our previous detection of a S475L mutation in a LINCL patient (29Sleat D.E. Gin R.M. Sohar I. Wisniewski K. Sklower-Brooks S. Pullarkat R.K. Palmer D.N. Lerner T.J. Boustany R.M. Uldall P. Siakotos A.N. Donnelly R.J. Lobel P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1511-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), demonstrate that Ser475 represents the active site nucleophile of CLN2p/TPP-I. Previous studies reported that diethlypyrocarbonate inhibited TPP-I activity (6Vines D. Warburton M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1384: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Page A.E. Fuller K. Chambers T.J. Warburton M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that a histidine may be involved in catalysis. Although His236 is excluded from the catalytic triad based on our mutagenesis data, it is possible that some other histidine activates the serine. If so, the alignments among CLN2p/TPP-I, the BPICPs, and other apparently related proteins (29Sleat D.E. Gin R.M. Sohar I. Wisniewski K. Sklower-Brooks S. Pullarkat R.K. Palmer D.N. Lerner T.J.

Genet. 1999; 64: 1511-1523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) do not reveal an obvious candidate histidine. The lack of activity of the Asp360 and Asp517mutants are consistent with a role for these residues in catalysis. One possibility is that one aspartate participates in a classical catalytic triad and the other helps decrease the pK a of the histidine. Alternatively, if a histidine is not important for catalysis, one or both of the aspartates may assume a novel role in directly activating the catalytic serine. Protein engineering combined with structural approaches will be required for detailed insights into the catalytic process.

Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 121-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). ECM is a complex and dynamic meshwork of several proteoglycans and proteins, and its degradation is inhibited by TGF-β. TGF-β stabilizes ECM by down-regulating the expression of the ECM proteases and by stimulating the expression of some ECM protease inhibitors, including the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is the primary inhibitor of both tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The induction of PAI-1 mRNA and protein by TGF-β has been observed in several types of cultured cells (3Westerhausen Jr., D.R. Hopkins W.E. Billadello J.J. J. Biol.

Information about the mechanism of TGF-β-mediated activation of transcription of target genes is increasing rapidly (6Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 745-754Crossref Google Scholar). Although several studies demonstrate that Smad3-Smad4 binding sites are required for TGF-β-mediated promoter regulation, they do not completely explain the broad spectrum of TGF-β responsiveness in activating target genes. Biochemical studies, under conditions of overexpression, have suggested that a Smad3-Smad4 complex and an AP-1 complex synergize in the transcriptional activation from the c-Jun promoter (7Wong C.

Cooperation between Smad2- or Smad3-Smad4 complexes and other sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as FAST1 and FAST2 has been demonstrated to regulate TGF-β-responsive promoters (8- 10). Although no physical association between the basic helix-loop-helix protein TFE3 and Smad3/Smad4 has been shown, all three proteins interact with a segment of PAI-1 promoter to induce transcription in response to TGF-β (11Hua X.

Functional analysis of the promoters of some TGF-β target genes has led to the identification of putative cis-acting TGF-β response elements and transacting factors associated with those elements.

Some of these studies have provided convincing evidence that Sp1 consensus sites in several promoters are required to support TGF-β-mediated activation. However, it is not known how Sp1 binding sites in those promoters mediate the TGF-β transactivating signal or how TGF-β signaling and the transcription factor Sp1 is linked to the TGF-β-regulated expression of various genes. In the present study, we elucidate a novel mechanism by which TGF-β up-regulates gene expression through Sp1 binding sites. We have identified a 38-base pair element containing two Sp1 binding sites in the proximal region of PAI-1 promoter, which is required, in part, for TGF-β-mediated induction of this promoter. Mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1-DNA binding, blocks TGF-β stimulation of PAI-1 and p21 proteins. Here, we show that Sp1 interacts with Smad3 and Smad4 in vivo and that the association between endogenous Smad3 and Sp1 proteins is induced by TGF-β in several cell lines. Our results indicate that TGF-β-induced physical and functional interactions between Sp1 and Smads may explain how TGF-β induces gene expression through Sp1 binding sites.

To better understand how TGF-β activates target genes through Sp1 binding sites, we first examined the effect of TGF-β and Smads on a promoter containing three Sp1 consensus sites placed upstream of a luciferase gene (Fig. 1 A). Transient transfection of this reporter into HepG2 cells resulted in a low basal level of transcription, which was increased in response to TGF-β. Overexpression of Smad3 strongly induced the promoter activity both in the presence (8-fold) and absence (5-fold) of TGF-β (Fig. 1 B). Transfection of either Smad2 or Smad4 had little effect on the Sp1-luc promoter activity, either in the absence or presence of TGF-β. Coexpression of Smad2 or Smad4 with Smad3 did not potentiate Smad3-dependent transcriptional activation. TGF-β induces phosphorylation of serine residues at the carboxyl terminus of Smad3, which is essential for signaling (22Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Smad3(S-A), a receptor-mediated phosphorylation incompetent mutant, was less effective than the wild type version in inducing promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). We observed similar effects of TGF-β and Smads on other heterologous promoters containing one or two Sp1 sites (data not shown). These data suggest that Smad3 is required for TGF-β-mediated activation of Sp1 sites independent of Smad DNA binding activity. To determine whether Sp1-dependent transactivation is involved in the TGF-β stimulation of PAI-1 gene expression, we carried out mutational analyses of the PAI-1 promoter. A schematic diagram of the PAI-1 promoter 5′-flanking region and a detailed picture of major regulatory elements in the proximal promoter is shown in Fig. 1 A. Previous analyses have shown that the sequence between −791 and −187 contains three Smad binding CAGA box elements involved in the induction of PAI-1 promoter in response to TGF-β (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 5Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). There are four recognized regulatory elements in the proximal region (between −82 and −40), including a P-box (cAMP response element), ad-box (weak affinity AP-1 site), and two Sp1 sites (21Chen Y.-Q.

Four base substitutions in either Sp1-A or Sp1-B abolish binding of Sp1 (data not shown and Ref. 21Chen Y.-Q. Su M. Walia R.R. Hao Q. Covington J.W. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8225-8231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) to those respective sites. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with these deleted/mutated promoter constructs and Smad3 expression vector and assayed for responses to TGF-β and Smad3. Two promoter constructs pGL 1.3k and pGL 884, which contain three CAGA box elements, exhibited strong induction by TGF-β and/or Smad3 as expected (Fig. 1 C). Deletion of the promoter sequences from −1.3 kilobases to −85 bases resulted in a 46% decrease in basal promoter activity, and importantly this deleted promoter was still strongly activated by TGF-β and Smad3 (22-fold), suggesting the presence of TGF-β-responsive elements within this proximal region. The mutant pGL 85 mSp1-A, which contains a four-base substitution in the first Sp1 site (Sp1-A), showed little decrease in promoter activity in the absence of TGF-β and retained partially (5-fold) the ability to be induced by TGF-β and Smad3. A substitution mutation in the second Sp1 site (Sp1-B) resulted in significant loss of promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). However, this mutant was significantly activated by TGF-β and Smad3 (12-fold). Mutations in both Sp1 sites resulted in a complete loss of promoter activity both in the absence and presence of TGF-β and Smad3. Taken together, these data suggest that both Sp1 sites in the proximal region (−77 to −40) are required, in part, for full induction of the PAI-1 promoter in response to TGF-β. The wild type human PAI-1 promoter contains three Smad binding CAGA box elements in the distal region (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). To confirm the importance of the Sp1 consensus sites in the proximal region in conferring transcription inducibility of the PAI-1 promoter by TGF-β, we used wild type PAI-1 promoter construct (806 PAI Luc) and a mutant promoter construct (806 PAI Δb1+Δb2+Δb3 Luc), where all three Smad binding sites are mutated. The wild type promoter, containing intact distal and proximal regions, was induced by TGF-β both in absence (8.7-fold) and presence of Smad3 (18-fold) (Fig. 1 D). When all three Smad sites were mutated, the mutant promoter was still capable of being induced by TGF-β in the absence (3-fold) and presence of Smad3 (6.5-fold). Together with the promoter deletion analysis, these data demonstrate that in addition to the Smad binding sites, Sp1 consensus sites in the proximal region are also important for the mediation of TGF-β induction of the PAI-1 gene. To further investigate the involvement of Smad proteins in the TGF-β-induced regulation of PAI-1 promoter through Sp1 sites in the proximal region, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with the reporter pGL 85 along with expression vectors for Smad proteins and the dominant negative type II receptor (DNIIR). TGF-β induced the promoter activity by 3.6-fold. Coexpression of Smad3 alone resulted in a dramatic increase in the luciferase activity, both in the presence and absence of TGF-β (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, only a slight induction of the promoter activity by either Smad2 or Smad4 was observed. Cotransfection of Smad2 and/or Smad4 with Smad3 did not have any significant effect on Smad3-induced promoter activity. Activation of Smad3 through TGF-β-induced phosphorylation was required in the induction of the minimal PAI-1 promoter, because mutations in the COOH-terminal serine residues (Smad3(S-A)) blocked the ability of Smad3 to transactivate the promoter in presence or absence of TGF-β. Smad7 or DNIIR, which inhibits TGF-β signaling, abrogated TGF-β-mediated induction of transcription from the minimal (pGL 85) promoter. These data, in combination with the results discussed above, indicate that Smad3 is essential in the transactivation of PAI-1 promoter by TGF-β through Sp1 binding sites. Moreover, our results strongly support the notion that within this context, TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation of the reporters does not depend on the DNA binding function of Smads, but rather on the ability of Smads to act through Sp1 sites as transcriptional coactivators.Figure 2Transactivation of the proximal PAI-1 promoter by Smads and TGF-β requires Sp1 binding to the promoter. A , pGL 85 was cotransfected into HepG2 cells with the indicated expression plasmids for Smads and dominant negative type II receptor (DNIIR). Luciferase assays and TGF-β treatment were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1 B. B , pGL 85 or Sp1-luc was cotransfected with or without Smad3 as indicated. Twenty-three hours prior to analysis, TGF-β (200 pm), trichostatin A (400 nm), and mithramycin (150 nm) were added as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether Sp1 binding to its DNA element was required for TGF-β and Smad-dependent activation of PAI-1 promoter, pGL 85 or Sp1-luc was cotransfected into HepG2 cells with Smad3. Cells were then treated with TGF-β and mithramycin, which inhibits Sp1-DNA binding by modifying GC-rich sites (16Greenwel P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Mithramycin blocked the activation of both reporters by TGF-β and Smad3 (Fig. 2 B). Sp1 is known to repress transcription through its binding site by recruiting HDAC1 (23Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It is tempting to hypothesize that TGF-β might induce Sp1-dependent transcription by dissociating the complex between Sp1 and HDAC1. But this does not appear to be the case, because: (a) TGF-β and Smad-mediated induction of the promoter activities were not enhanced by trichostatin A (TSA), a HDAC inhibitor (Fig. 2B); (b) the association between Sp1 and HDAC1 in vivo was not affected by TGF-β in HepG2, Mv1Lu, and 293 cells (Fig. 4 D, third panel). Our findings demonstrate that Smad proteins transactivate the PAI-1 promoter by functionally interacting with Sp1 via the proximal −77/−40 region that contains two Sp1 binding sites. Previous studies showed that Sp1 binding sites are required for TGF-β activation of the p21 promoter (13Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 14Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). To pinpoint the importance of Sp1-dependent transcription through binding to its consensus sites in inducing endogenous PAI-1 and p21 expression by TGF-β, we performed immunoblotting experiments with lysates from RIE cells after treating with TGF-β and mithramycin as indicated. TGF-β induced the expression of PAI-1 and p21 proteins as reported previously (3Westerhausen Jr., D.R. Hopkins W.E. Billadello J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1092-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The induction of PAI-1 protein was partially inhibited by mithramycin (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 4). The lack of complete inhibition is likely because PAI-1 promoter is induced by TGF-β not only through Sp1 sites in the proximal region (our data) but also through the distal region where Smads can bind to the CAGA box elements directly (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 5Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In contrast, induction of p21 by TGF-β was completely blocked by mithramycin (Fig. 3 B). We did not observe any change in Sp1 level under the same conditions (Fig. 3 A). Thus, Sp1 can mediate TGF-β-induced transcription through binding to G/C-rich sites in the promoter.Figure 3Effect of Sp1 inhibitor on TGF-β-induced expression of the endogenous PAI-1 and p21 proteins. A , RIE cells were treated with or without mithramycin (75 or 150 nm) and/or TGF-β (200 pm). Total cell lysates were subjected to anti-PAI-1 antibody immunoblotting. Expression levels of Sp1 were assessed by anti-Sp1 antibody immunoblotting. B, RIE cells were treated as above except that one concentration of mithramycin (150 nm) was used, and cell lysates were used for anti-p21 antibody immunoblotting. C, Mv1Lu cells were transfected with (CAGA)9 MLP Luc, β-gal reporter, Smad3, Smad4, and increasing amounts of Sp1 as indicated. Cells were treated with 100 pm TGF-β. Normalized luciferase activity is expressed as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate values.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sp1 is known to interact physically and functionally with several nuclear proteins and transcription factors to regulate the transcription of genes (24Lania L. Majello B. Luca P.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether Sp1 has an effect on Smad3/Smad4-dependent transcription through Smad binding sites in response to TGF-β, Mv1Lu cells were cotransfected with a TGF-β-responsive reporter (CAGA)9 MLP-Luc (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar), which contains multiple copies of a Smad3- and Smad4-binding CAGA box element upstream of a minimal adenovirus major late promoter, along with expression vectors for Smad3, Smad4, and Sp1. Overexpression of Smad3 and/or Smad4 strongly induced the promoter activity both in the presence and absence of TGF-β (Fig. 3 C). Expression of Sp1 alone, or in combination with Smad3 and/or Smad4, did not reveal any significant change in Smad-dependent transcription, both either in the presence or absence of TGF-β. We observed similar results in HepG2 cells using another TGF-β-responsive reporter p3TP-Lux (26Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results suggest that Sp1 does not regulate Smad3/Smad4-dependent transcription through Smad binding elements in response to TGF-β. Our combined data demonstrated a functional interaction between Smads and Sp1 to induce TGF-β-mediated transcription through Sp1 sites. To test whether Sp1 and Smads physically interact in mammalian cells, FLAG- or HA-tagged versions of Smad proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells with Sp1. Cell lysates were subjected to either anti-FLAG or anti-HA immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with anti-Sp1 antibodies. Sp1 was detected specifically in an immune complex with either Smad3 or Smad4 (Fig. 4A,first panel, lanes 8 and 9). In a reciprocal experiment, we observed that Smad3 or Smad4 coimmunoprecipitated with Sp1, demonstrating the association of Sp1 with Smad3 or Smad4 (second panel, lanes 8 and9). We were unable to detect any physical association between Sp1 and other Smads (lanes 3–6) except for Smad2, which showed a barely detectable interaction. To examine which part of the Sp1 protein was involved in the interaction with Smads, we coexpressed FLAG-Sp1(1–778) (wild type, W) or FLAG-Sp1(1–612) (mutant, M) with HA-Smad3 or HA-Smad4 in COS-1 cells. In these experiments, Smad3 or Smad4 was coimmunoprecipitated with wild type Sp1 (lanes 3 and 6), but not with mutant Sp1, Sp1(1–612) (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 7), suggesting the involvement of the carboxyl terminus of Sp1 in binding with Smad3 and Smad4. We also tested for interaction between endogenous Sp1 and Smad3 or Smad4. For this, Smad3 and Smad4 were immunoprecipitated with their corresponding antibodies from 293 and NIH 3T3 cell lysates (Fig. 4 C, first panel). Sp1 was detected by immunoblotting anti-Sp1, anti-Smad3, and anti-Smad4 immunoprecipitates. In reciprocal experiments, Smad4 was detected in the anti-Sp1 antibody immune complex precipitated from 293 cell lysate using an anti-Smad4 antibody (Fig. 4 C, second panel). Under similar conditions, no Smad4 was detected when the anti-Sp1 antibody was preincubated with the immunizing peptide. In an attempt to determine whether the association between endogenous Sp1 and Smads is regulated by TGF-β, Smad3 or Smad4 was immunoprecipitated from Mv1Lu, 293, or HepG2 cells treated with or without TGF-β. Coprecipitated Sp1 was increased significantly in the Smad3 immune complexes from TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. 4 D, first left panel, lanes 1–6), although the levels of Sp1 and Smad3 were not changed in response to TGF-β (fourth andfifth panels from top). In contrast, coprecipitation of Sp1 with Smad4 was not affected following TGF-β treatment (first right panel, lanes 7–10). TGF-β treatment of the cells increased the association of Smad3 with Smad4 as described previously (second left panel) (6Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 745-754Crossref Google Scholar). Since Sp1 has been shown to function as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting HDAC1 (23Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), we investigated whether TGF-β could increase Sp1-dependent transcription by dissociating the complex between Sp1 and HDAC1. We did not observe any change in the coprecipitation of HDAC1 with Sp1 under these conditions (Fig. 4 D, third panel). Thus, the association between Sp1 and Smad3, but not between Sp1 and Smad4, is induced by TGF-β. These results suggest a mechanism for TGF-β-induced transcription of several genes through the Sp1 binding sites in their promoters. The ability of Smads to induce specific transcriptional programs in response to TGF-β results from a functional cooperativity with other transcription factors in multiprotein complexes in the nucleus (6Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 745-754Crossref Google Scholar). TGF-β modulates extracellular proteolytic activity, which may be linked to the regulation of matrix formation by the coordinated regulation of plasminogen activators and their inhibitors, including PAI-1. For induction of the PAI-1 promoter by TGF-β, several promoter elements in the distal region have been identified, which require direct Smad3 and Smad4 binding (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 5Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a promoter element in the proximal region (−77 to −40), which contains two Sp1 binding sites that are required for TGF-β-induced and Smad-dependent transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 promoter. The requirement of Sp1-dependent transcription in TGF-β-induced gene expression is confirmed by the fact that the expression of endogenous PAI-1 and p21 is decreased dramatically by mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1-DNA binding. We demonstrate that Smads function as transcriptional coactivators for TGF-β-mediated induction of PAI-1 promoter through Sp1 sites. Sp1 consensus sites are required in the regulation of numerous genes, including many inducible genes, housekeeping genes, and cellular proto-oncogenes (13Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 14Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the gene regulation by Sp1 is most probably determined by cofactors or activators that interact with Sp1 or by the combinatorial effects of Sp1 sites and other regulatory elements within the promoter. Although Sp1 is thought to be necessary for the basal transcription of many genes, this work supports the hypothesis that Sp1 can also play a key role in the regulation of certain genes in response to specific signals. There could be several possible mechanisms by which TGF-β activates gene expression through the transcription factor Sp1: 1) Sp1 might activate Smad3/Smad4-dependent transcription through Smad binding sites in the TGF-β-responsive promoters by interacting with Smads and by functioning as coactivator, 2) the DNA binding activities of Sp1 might be altered by TGF-β, 3) the repressive effect of Sp1 through the recruitment of HDAC1 might be relieved by TGF-β, or 4) the transactivating activity of Sp1 through its own binding to the G/C-rich elements in the promoter might be regulated by TGF-β signal through specific interaction between Sp1 and Smads. The first possibility of TGF-β-mediated activation through Sp1 was not supported by our data. We did not see any significant regulation of Smad3/Smad4-dependent transcription through Smad binding to the promoter by Sp1 in response to TGF-β, as measured by the p3TP-Lux (data not shown) and (CAGA)9 MLP-Luc reporters (Fig. 3 C). Our data indicate that both Sp1 sites in the proximal PAI-1 promoter are required, in part, for TGF-β- and Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. Mutation of both Sp1 sites in the proximal promoter abrogated TGF-β responsiveness. Our work (data not shown) and previous work (21Chen Y.-Q. Su M. Walia R.R. Hao Q. Covington J.W. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8225-8231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) indicated that Sp1 does not bind to these mutated sites. Although both Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitously expressed and bind to the same GC boxes, the possibility of Sp3 being involved in this TGF-β-mediated induction is ruled out by previous reports (15Li J.-M. Datto M.B. Shen X. Hu P.P., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Lania L. Majello B. Luca P.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), demonstrating that Sp3 is generally a transcriptional repressor, and that Sp1, but not Sp3, mediates the responsiveness to TGF-β. We have shown that mithramycin blocks TGF-β- and Smad-induced Sp1 site containing promoter activity, including PAI-1 promoter (Fig. 2 B), and partially inhibits TGF-β stimulation of endogenous PAI-1 (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, TGF-β induction of p21 is almost completely inhibited by mithramycin (Fig. 3 B). This differential inhibition by mithramycin is likely because the PAI-1 promoter is induced by TGF-β significantly through Smad binding sites in the distal region (4Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 5Song C.-Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and partially through proximal region containing Sp1 sites (our data and 18), whereas p21 promoter is induced by TGF-β through the Sp1 sites (13Datto M.B., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 14Moustakas A. Kardassis D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6733-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Since mithramycin inhibits Sp1-DNA binding by modifying GC-rich sites, it could be argued that Sp1 binding to its consensus sequence in several promoters is required for TGF-β-mediated transcriptional activation through Sp1 binding sites. Previous studies demonstrated that TGF-β treatment of cells did not change either the DNA binding activities of Sp1 or overall phosphorylation of Sp1 (15Li J.-M. Datto M.B. Shen X. Hu P.P., Yu, Y. Wang X.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2449-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our findings that the association between Sp1 and HDAC1 is not affected by TGF-β, and that the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A has no effect on Sp1-dependent transcription in response to TGF-β, suggest that relieving HDAC1-mediated repression is not involved in TGF-β-induced Sp1-dependent transcription. We demonstrate that Smad3 and Smad4 bind Sp1 in vivo and that the association between endogenous Smad3 and Sp1 is induced by TGF-β in several cell lines. Smad3 strongly induces the minimal PAI-1 promoter, pGL 85, and the heterologous promoter containing three Sp1 sites in the presence or absence of TGF-β, but the phosphorylation incompetent mutant of Smad3, Smad3(S-A), was unable to induce transcription. Thus, the PAI-1 promoter is induced by TGF-β primarily by two mechanisms: 1) this promoter is strongly activated by TGF-β-induced binding of a Smad3/Smad4 containing nuclear complex to CAGA boxes in the distal region; 2) the proximal promoter, containing two Sp1 sites, mediates moderate induction through TGF-β-induced interaction between Smad3 and Sp1, independent of Smad/DNA interactions, but dependent upon Sp1/DNA interactions. Both these mechanisms are required for full induction of the PAI-1 promoter. In conclusion, our results suggest a model for how Smads mediate TGF-β-induced transcription at Sp1 binding sites in mammalian promoters through physical and functional interaction with Sp1, and this represents a novel mechanism of gene regulation by TGF-β.

Because RANTES is a potent agonist for the chemokine receptor CCR1, we examined whether the CCR1 receptor antagonist BX471 is efficacious in a rat heterotopic heart transplant rejection model. Treatment of animals with BX471 and a subtherapeutic dose of cyclosporin (2.5 mg/kg), which is by itself ineffective in prolonging transplant rejection, is much more efficacious in prolonging transplantation rejection than animals treated with either cyclosporin or BX471 alone.

Plasma triglyceride and apo C-III protein concentrations instaggerer (sg/sg) mice, homozygous for a deletion in the RORα gene, were significantly lower than in wild type littermates.

Transient transfection experiments in human hepatoma HepG2, human colonic CaCO2, and rabbit kidney RK13 cells demonstrated that overexpression of the human RORα1 isoform specifically increases human apo C-III promoter activity, indicating that RORα1 enhances human apo C-III gene transcription. RORα1 response elements were mapped by promoter deletion analysis and gel shift experiments to two AGGTCA half-sites located at positions −83/−78 (within the C3P site) and −23/−18 (downstream of the TATA box) in the human apo C-III promoter, with the −23/−18 site exhibiting the highest binding affinity. Transfection of site-directed mutated constructs in HepG2 cells indicated that the RORα1 effect is predominantly mediated by the −23/−18 site. This site is conserved in the mouse apo C-III gene promoter. Moreover, RORα binds to the equivalent mouse site and activates constructs containing three copies of the mouse site cloned in front of an heterologous promoter. Taken together, our data identify RORα as a transcriptional regulator of apo C-III gene expression, providing a novel, physiological role for RORα1 in the regulation of genes controlling triglyceride metabolism. Triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins are considered as major risk factors contributing to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Because apolipoprotein (apo) C-III is a major determinant of plasma triglyceride and remnant lipoprotein metabolism, it is important to understand how the expression of this gene is regulated. In the present study, we identified the orphan nuclear receptor RORα1 as a regulator of human and mouse apo C-III gene expression. Plasma triglyceride and apo C-III protein concentrations instaggerer (sg/sg) mice, homozygous for a deletion in the RORα gene, were significantly lower than in wild type littermates. The lowered plasma apo C-III levels were associated with reduced apo C-III mRNA levels in liver and intestine of sg/sg mice. Transient transfection experiments in human hepatoma HepG2, human colonic CaCO2, and rabbit kidney RK13 cells demonstrated that overexpression of the human RORα1 isoform specifically increases human apo C-III promoter activity, indicating that RORα1 enhances human apo C-III gene transcription.

Their phenotype is similar to the one ofstaggerer mice, which carry a natural deletion in the RORα gene that prevents the translation of its putative ligand-binding domain, thereby presumably disrupting the normal function of this transcription factor (61Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N.

Moreover, when maintained on a high fat atherogenic diet staggerer (sg/sg) mice develop a severe hypo-alphalipoproteinemia and atherosclerosis, suggesting an important role for RORα in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (63Mamontova A.

In the present study, we investigated the regulation of apo C-III expression and triglyceride metabolism by the orphan nuclear receptor RORα in vivo using the staggerer mouse model. We observed a striking reduction in both triglyceride and apo C-III plasma levels in mutant compared with wild type mice. Next, we studiedin vitro the molecular mechanisms regulating apo C-III gene transcription by RORα. Our results indicate that RORα enhances the activity of the human −1415/+24 apo C-III promoter. Furthermore, a RORα response element was identified at position −23/−18 that confers RORα responsiveness to the human apo C-III promoter. This response element is preserved in both the human and the mouse apo C-III gene promoters and confers RORα responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Taken together, our results identify RORα as a positive regulator of apo C-III gene transcription and support a role of RORα as a regulator of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. staggerer mutant mice were obtained by crossing heterozygote (+/sg) mice maintained in a C57BL/6 genetic background and identifying homozygous offspring by polymerase chain reaction genotyping and by their clinical ataxia. Mice were maintained on chow diet purchased from UAR (France) as described previously (62Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Grötzinger T. De Vos P. Schoonjans K. Fruchart J.-C. Auwerx J. Mariani J. Tedgui A.

Wild type littermates of the same age as the homozygous mutants were used as control. 10-week-old mice fasted overnight were killed by ether overdose.

Plasma triglyceride concentrations were determined by enzymatic assays using commercially available reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), whereas plasma levels of apo C-III were measured by an immunonephelometric assay using a specific polyclonal antibody as described previously (65Schoonjans K.

The plasmid containing the −1415/+24 sequence of the human apo C-III gene promoter cloned in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene (−1415/+24WT-CAT) has been described previously (9Vu-Dac N. Gervois P. Pineda-Torra I. Fruchart J.-C. Kosykh V. Kooistra T. Princen H.M.G. Dallongeville J. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 103: 625-632Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The luciferase gene from the plasmid pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI) (SacI-BamHI) was subcloned between the corresponding sites of the vector pBKCMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (pBKCMV-Luc+). The CAT reporter gene of the plasmid −1415/+24WT-CAT was then excised by digestion with KpnI and BamHI and replaced by the luciferase-containingKpnI-BglII fragment of the plasmid pBKCMV-Luc+ plasmid. The −1415/+24 fragment of the apo C-III promoter was excised from the resulting construct by HindIII digestion and cloned in the corresponding site of the vectors pGL3 (construct −1415/+24WTpGL3) and pSL301 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (construct PSL301−1415/+24hCIII). The pSL301−1415/+24hCIII construct was partially digested with EcoO109I and religated. The resulting construct was digested with XbaI and HindIII. The insert was cloned in the corresponding sites of pGL3 to create the construct −108/+24WTpGL3. The plasmid −1415/+24WTpGL3 was then used as template to polymerase chain reaction amplify fragments of different length of the human apo C-III promoter using forward primers annealing to specific parts of the promoter sequence and containing aNheI restriction site and a reverse primer annealing downstream of the pGL3 polylinker. The polymerase chain reaction products were cut with NheI and HindIII and cloned in the corresponding sites of the pGL3 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of the construct −1415/+24WTpGL3 was performed using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The constructs (−58/−27)8sTkpGL3 and (−47/−79)1sTkpGL3 were obtained following the described previously strategy (66Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B.

To date, four mammalian Sprouty genes have been identified; the primary sequences of the gene products share a well conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain with theirDrosophila counterpart. The N-terminal regions do not, however, exhibit a large degree of homology. This study was aimed at identifying proteins with which human SPRY2 (hSPRY2) interacts in an attempt to understand the mechanism by which Sprouty proteins exert their down-regulatory effects. Here, we demonstrate that hSPRY2 associates directly with c-Cbl, a known down-regulator of RTK signaling. A short sequence in the N terminus of hSPRY2 was found to bind directly to the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl. Parallel binding was apparent between the Drosophila homologs of Sprouty and Cbl, with cross-species associations occurring at least in vitro. Coexpression of hSPRY2 abrogated an increase in the rate of epidermal growth factor receptor internalization induced by c-Cbl, whereas a mutant hSPRY2 protein unable to bind c-Cbl showed no such effect. Our results suggest that one function of hSPRY2 in signaling processes downstream of RTKs may be to modulate c-Cbl physiological function such as that seen with receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar), oncogenic transformation (2Porter A.C. Vaillancourt R.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: R1343-R1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and axonal guidance (3Tan P.B. Kim S.K. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains, which become rapidly phosphorylated following ligand engagement, orchestrate the intrinsic properties of RTKs. The activated RTK (or in some cases, an associated phosphotyrosine-bearing docker protein) thus serves as a docking site that attracts various signaling molecules to the membrane vicinity. The assembly of such signaling complexes allows the RTKs to initiate the transmission of signals from the membrane to the nucleus via the MAPK cascade (4Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This pathway uses a set of highly conserved signal transduction molecules to link the activated receptors to the MAPK cascade activator, the GTP-binding protein Ras (5Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: R1395-R1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The increasing number and complexity of proteins discovered to be involved in modulating the MAPK cascade indicate that the transmission of signals originating from the RTKs is under exquisite homeostatic control (6Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar).In the last decade, a number of major RTK/MAPK regulators have been isolated from genetic screens in developmental models, allowing for the delineation of many key mammalian signaling pathways. Fibroblast growth factor receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are subsets of RTKs that are coupled to Ras via one or more adaptor proteins that contain specific protein-protein interaction domains (7Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,8Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In the EGFR signaling system, one such protein that serves as a direct link between the receptor and Ras is Grb2 (9Stern M.J. Marengere L.E. Daly R.J. Lowenstein E.J. Kokel M. Batzer A. Olivier P. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which binds constitutively to and recruits the Ras-activating guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos (10Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1993; 363: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Ras is subsequently activated by Sos via GDP/GTP exchange. Ras has an inherent, weak GTPase activity. Auxiliary proteins with GTPase-activating properties interact with and enhance the GTPase activity of Ras and hence are down-regulators of MAPK signaling pathways (11Scita G. Tenca P. Frittoli E. Tocchetti A. Innocenti M. Giardina G. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor receptors activate the MAPK cascade by essentially a similar mechanism as EGFR, except they make use of a surrogate receptor cytosolic domain in the form of the constitutively associated FRS2 docker protein (12Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 13Rabin S.J. Cleghon V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29892-29898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), where tyrosine residues on FRS2 serve as substrates of fibroblast growth factor receptor and attract the SH2 domains of Grb2 and Shp2.A common component of many signaling modules is the multi-adaptor protein Cbl, first identified as a retroviral transforming gene product that induces pre-B cell lymphoma and myeloid leukemia (15Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The product of the mammalian c-cbl gene (p120Cbl) is a widely expressed cytoplasmic protein with several distinctive domains, including an SH2 domain, a Ring finger motif, and a large proline-rich stretch at its C terminus (16Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have implicated c-Cbl in the attenuation of RTK-mediated signaling cascades; partial loss-of-function mutations of Caenorhabditis elegansLET-23 (an EGFR equivalent) result in developmental defects that are reversed by mutation of the c-Cbl ortholog SLI-1, which acts early at the level of LET-23, and the Grb2 homolog Sem5 (15Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 17Jongeward G.D. Clandinin T.R. Sternberg P.W. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1553-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The engagement of a variety of transmembrane receptors, including growth factor, antigen, and integrin receptors, results in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and its association with numerous cytoplasmic signaling proteins (18Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Liu Y.C. Altman A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, c-Cbl has been demonstrated to elevate the rate of ligand-induced endocytosis (termed “down-regulation”) of EGFR by tagging the receptors with ubiquitin and targeting them for destruction by the lysosomal/proteasomal system (20Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar).In Drosophila, Sprouty (dSPRY) was first identified as a down-regulator of the “Breathless” (the Drosophilaequivalent of fibroblast growth factor receptor) signaling cascade that governs proper tracheal branching (21Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The removal or loss-of-function mutations of dSPRY gave rise to a morphological “sprouting” effect. dSPRY was also isolated in a separate genetic screen for inhibiting DER (the Drosophila equivalent of EGFR)-dependent cell recruitment during eye development (22Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be expressed in the developing eye imaginal disc and other tissues where EGFR signaling is known to exert its control (23Kramer S. Okabe M. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Hiromi Y. Development. 1999; 126: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal half of dSPRY was shown to localize the protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane of Drosophila S2 cells, whereas the N-terminal portion interacted, at least in vitro, with DRK (the Drosophila homolog of Grb2) and Gap1, a Ras GTPase-activating protein (22Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M. Cell. 1999; 96: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Sequestration of a docking protein like DRK would constitute a plausible mechanism for inhibition of the early phase of RTK signaling. Gap1 has been shown previously to be a negative regulator of signaling for the Drosophila Sevenless RTK (24Gaul U. Mardon G. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It is possible that dSPRY might interact with and augment the GTPase activity of Gap1, thus acting as an attenuator of Ras activity. More recent genetic evidence led to the postulation that dSPRY intercepts the Ras/MAPK cascade downstream of Ras, at the level of Raf or MEK (25Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Composite studies thus suggest that dSPRY acts as a general antagonist of the RTK signaling pathways (23Kramer S. Okabe M. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Hiromi Y. Development. 1999; 126: 2515-2525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Reich A. Sapir A. Shilo B. Development. 1999; 126: 4139-4147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To date, four mammalian Sprouty homologs have been cloned, with no known binding motifs or physiological functions (21Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 26de Maximy A.A. Nakatake Y. Moncada S. Itoh N. Thiery J.P. Bellusci S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 81: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The Sprouty proteins are classified under the same gene family by virtue of their characteristic cysteine-rich residues located in their carboxyl termini. Parallel investigations on the role of murine SPRY2 (mSPRY2) in the development of the embryonic mouse lung suggest a conservation of function between dSPRY and mSPRY2 with respect to their negative modulation of respiratory organogenesis (27Tefft J.D. Lee M. Smith S. Leinwand M. Zhao J.S. Bringas Jr., P. Crowe D.L. Warburton D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Sprouty constitutes a reduction in fibroblast growth factor-induced limb bud outgrowth (28Minowada G. Jarvis L.A. Chi C.L. Neubuser A. Sun X. Hacohen N. Krasnow M.A. Martin G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also recently identified a novel translocation domain that is responsible for the general targeting of Sprouty proteins to membrane ruffles upon fibroblast growth factor/EGF stimulation (29Lim J.M. Wong E.S.M. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We were interested in further characterizing hSPRY2 and its possible involvement in RTK signal down-regulation by identifying cellular proteins that interact with hSPRY2. We demonstrate in this study that hSPRY2 and dSPRY interact directly with c-Cbl and dCbl and that the hSPRY2-c-Cbl association leads to an inhibition of the role of c-Cbl in enhancing the rate of internalization and possibly the down-regulation of EGFR.DISCUSSIONRecently, the Cbl family proteins have attracted a considerable amount of attention as down-regulators of both RTK and non-RTK signaling (34Ota Y. Samelson L.E. Science. 1997; 276: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 39Smit L. Borst J. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 359-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis implicated the orthologs of Cbl inC. elegans and Drosophila in down-regulating the EGFR growth-promoting function (17Jongeward G.D. Clandinin T.R. Sternberg P.W. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1553-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Human c-Cbl has been reported in a number of cell systems to be tyrosine-phosphorylated upon receptor stimulation and was found to exert a negative regulatory role in tyrosine kinase signaling, albeit by an as yet undefined mechanism (31Galisteo M.L. Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Langdon W.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20242-20245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 32Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Band V. Band H. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14347-14351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The N-terminal fragment of c-Cbl essentially consists of two functional domains: an unconventional SH2-like domain (which incorporates the four-helix bundle and EF-hand) and a Ring finger motif. Structure-based mutation studies in the four-helix bundle, EF, and SH2 domains revealed that the three domains together form an integrated phosphoprotein recognition module (16Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a critical role of the SH2 domain in c-Cbl function is demonstrated by the localization of a loss-of-function mutation in SLI-1 (C. elegans homolog of Cbl) within a 17-amino acid deletion N-terminal to the Ring finger (18Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); this structural alteration renders the 70Z-Cbl mutant oncogenic and causes it to exhibit an enhanced level of tyrosine phosphorylation as well as to abrogate the negative regulatory function of wild-type c-Cbl. In our binding domain analysis, we showed that neither disruption nor lack of the SH2 domain (Cbl-NSand Cbl-NE, respectively) or deletion of the 70Z region in the c-Cbl C terminus (Cbl-CR) was accountable for any lack of association with hSPRY2. We have delineated the hSPRY2-binding region specifically to the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl.Various groups have reported evidence that c-Cbl down-regulates growth factor receptors by helping to ubiquitinate them, thereby marking them for destruction by the lysosomal/proteasomal route (40Levkowitz G.

A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). More recently, the Ring finger domain of Cbl, an evolutionarily conserved structure present in >200 proteins, was found to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (35Barinaga M. Science. 1999; 286: 223-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 43Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Conjugation of ubiquitin proceeds via a three-step mechanism (44Hershko A. Ciechanover A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). Initially, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) activates the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin to a high energy thiol ester with an internal E1 cysteine residue. One of several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) transfers the activated ubiquitin to the substrate that is specifically bound to a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family. E3 ligases catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate. In one case, tyrosine residues on activated EGFR become phosphorylated upon growth factor stimulation and bind to the SH2 domain of c-Cbl; c-Cbl functions as an E3 to mediate endocytic sorting of the target substrate by relaying activated ubiquitin molecules to EGFR via its Ring finger. Although all three members of the Cbl family (c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3) can enhance ubiquitination (40Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The oncogenic viral counterpart (v-Cbl), which lacks a functional Ring finger, inhibits down-regulation by shunting endocytosed receptors to the recycling pathway. This has exciting implications because, in relation to our findings, binding of hSPRY2 to the catalytic site of c-Cbl would suggest an important modulatory role of hSPRY2 in the fate and signaling potency of growth factor receptors. Additionally, we found that hSPRY2 binding to the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl abrogates the latter's ability to induce down-regulation of EGFR.Our studies have demonstrated that hSPRY2 binds directly to the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl (and possibly also Cbl-b) via a small N-terminal region. A similar observation was made for dSPRY and dCbl, the binding of which encompasses similar regions. This is indicative of a conservation of the interaction domains throughout evolution. In this respect, it is interesting to note that there is no Sprouty ortholog found in C. elegans. Taken together, the constitutive nature of the hSPRY2-c-Cbl association may highlight the requirement for some extrinsic factors to displace hSPRY2 from the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl and, by so doing, uplifts its suppressive effect on the latter.A number of questions are posed by the data presented. First of all, do the other mammalian Sprouty proteins also bind to the Ring finger of c-Cbl? Preliminary analysis revealed that murine SPRY1 binds c-Cbl, but not murine SPRY4 (data not shown). Hence, one might infer that mSPRY4 plays a different functional role from mSPRY1 and mSPRY2. We have recently presented evidence that the conserved cysteine-rich C-terminal domain in various Sprouty proteins is responsible for directing the proteins to membrane ruffles when cells are stimulated with growth factors (29Lim J.M. Wong E.S.M. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Given the high degree of conservation among the C-terminal regions, this would suggest that Sprouty proteins have a common target for membrane ruffle association. We further demonstrated that c-Cbl colocalizes with hSPRY2 in coexpressing cells, but not with the non-binding hSPRY2ΔN11 mutant. It becomes interesting then to question the roles of hSPRY2 and c-Cbl in each of the two localities. Does hSPRY2 translocate to ruffles to assume a different function by virtue of different or additional binding partners, or does the hSPRY2-mediated translocation serve to target c-Cbl in near proximity to the membrane-anchored receptors? If the latter case is true, one would expect hSPRY2 to synergistically promote the action of c-Cbl in the ligand-induced down-regulation of EGFR, which differs from our experimental observation. Although we do not know the proportion of endogenous c-Cbl that is bound by hSPRY2 (and therefore “nonfunctional” in terms of EGFR down-regulation), our results suggest that the inhibition of EGFR internalization that we observed in c-Cbl- and hSPRY2-coexpressing cells may be due to an exclusion of prospective E2·ubiquitin complexes from the Ring finger domain of c-Cbl, thereby preventing downstream ubiquitination events. Alternatively, hSPRY2 may have a direct involvement in receptor endocytosis.On the other hand, we cannot rule out the possibility that a fraction of the c-Cbl population that hSPRY2 binds to is tyrosine-phosphorylated or not or that, upon growth factor stimulation, hSPRY2 initiates a stronger preference for binding to other protein partners that might mediate translocation of the hSPRY2·c-Cbl complex to ruffles. It is interesting to note from the immunofluorescence studies on hSPRY2- and c-Cbl-coexpressing cells that a significant pool of c-Cbl still retains an association with microtubules in the cytosol, although a major portion has been shown to colocalize with hSPRY2 at the membrane ruffles in EGF-treated cells. Given the previously reported function of dSPRY and mSPRY2 in the attenuation of RTK activation (21Hacohen N. Kramer S. Sutherland D. Hiromi Y. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 22Casci T. Vinos J. Freeman M.

Biol. 1999; 9: 219-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), it is also possible that hSPRY2 associates with other signaling proteins to down-regulate the MAPK cascade. It will be interesting to pursue any substantial attenuation of MAPK signaling in hSPRY2- and c-Cbl-coexpressing cells. It is noteworthy that other studies done by overexpressing two forms of c-Cbl mutants (namely C381A and 70Z-Cbl) showed an inhibitory effect on EGFR down-regulation, but no effect on ERK activity was detectable (18Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

Despite the increasing number of proteins known to be ubiquitinated, the identification of the corresponding ubiquitin ligases (E3) has been lagging. E3 ligases for which the amino acid sequences are known include the N-end rule E3 ligases of yeast and mammals (45Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar); members of the HECT (homologous to E6-APCterminus) family (46Schwarz S.E. Rosa J.L. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12148-12154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar); Mdm2 (47Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar); APC, theanaphase-promoting complex (48Page A.M. Hieter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 583-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); and other F-box- and cullin-containing complexes (49Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). In the last few years, the once discrete Ring finger motifs intrinsic to a large number of proteins have surfaced as instrumental components that confer on E3 proteins a capacity for E2-dependent ubiquitination (50Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar,51Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S.Y. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In view of this, the mode of action of Sprouty as a general RTK inhibitor certainly encompasses several layers of complexity.With the above possibilities and taking current evidence into account, it is difficult to envisage a simplistic model to explain how the interaction between Sprouty and Cbl manifests itself in the down-regulation of RTK signaling. In addition to the observed binding between hSPRY2 and Cbl-b, which has been shown to play other distinct roles in EGF-mediated signaling (52Ettenberg S.A. Keane M.M. Nau M.M. Frankel M. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1855-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), there are likely to be other candidate proteins that interact with Sprouty and Cbl. We are screening and characterizing those proteins that bind to the various Sprouty family members in an effort to better understand their physiological function. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)1 have been implicated in numerous cellular processes such as cell fate specification and differentiation (1Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar), oncogenic transformation (2Porter A.C. Vaillancourt R.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: R1343-R1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and axonal guidance (3Tan P.B. Kim S.K. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 145-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domains, which become rapidly phosphorylated following ligand engagement, orchestrate the intrinsic properties of RTKs. The activated RTK (or in some cases, an associated phosphotyrosine-bearing docker protein) thus serves as a docking site that attracts various signaling molecules to the membrane vicinity. The assembly of such signaling complexes allows the RTKs to initiate the transmission of signals from the membrane to the nucleus via the MAPK cascade (4Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This pathway uses a set of highly conserved signal transduction molecules to link the activated receptors to the MAPK cascade activator, the GTP-binding protein Ras (5Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: R1395-R1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The increasing number and complexity of proteins discovered to be involved in modulating the MAPK cascade indicate that the transmission of signals originating from the RTKs is under exquisite homeostatic control (6Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). In the last decade, a number of major RTK/MAPK regulators have been isolated from genetic screens in developmental models, allowing for the delineation of many key mammalian signaling pathways. Fibroblast growth factor receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) are subsets of RTKs that are coupled to Ras via one or more adaptor proteins that contain specific protein-protein interaction domains (7Plotnikov A.N.

The hormone acts by binding to the Mpl receptor, the product of the cellular proto-oncogene c-mpl. Although many downstream signaling targets of TPO have been identified in cell lines, primary MKs, and platelets, the molecular mechanism(s) by which many of these molecules are activated remains uncertain. In this report we demonstrate that the TPO-induced activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a signaling intermediate vital for cellular survival and proliferation, occurs through its association with inducible signaling complexes in both BaF3 cells engineered to express Mpl (BaF3/Mpl) and in primary murine MKs. Although a direct association between PI3K and Mpl could not be demonstrated, we found that several proteins, including SHP2, Gab2, and IRS2, undergo phosphorylation and association in BaF3/Mpl cells in response to TPO stimulation, complexes that recruit and enhance the enzymatic activity of PI3K. To verify the physiological relevance of the complex, SHP2-Gab2 association was disrupted by overexpressing a dominant negative SHP2 construct. TPO-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly decreased in transfected cells suggesting an important role of SHP2 in the complex to enhance PI3K activity. In primary murine MKs, TPO also induced phosphorylation of SHP2, its association with p85 and enhanced PI3K activity, but in contrast to the results in cell lines, neither Gab2 nor IRS2 are phosphorylated in MKs. Instead, a 100-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (pp100) co-immunoprecipitated with the regulatory subunit of PI3K. These findings support a model where PI3K activity is dependent on its recruitment into TPO-induced multiphosphoprotein complexes, implicate the existence of a scaffolding protein in primary MKs distinct from the known Gab and IRS proteins, and suggest that, in contrast to erythroid progenitor cells that employ Gab1 in PI3K signaling complexes, utilization of an alternate member of the Gab/IRS family could be responsible for specificity in TPO signaling.

Maintained within relatively normal limits, both reduced and excessive platelet production leads to pathologic bleeding or thrombosis. Much is known of the cell biology of this process. Bone marrow megakaryocytes (MKs)1 are the immediate cellular precursors of blood platelets, and a hierarchy of stem cells, multipotent progenitors, and progenitors committed to the MK lineage are responsible for continuously renewing the marrow pool of MKs (1Long M.W.

In a number of cell culture systems TPO has been shown to affect all aspects of MK development, supporting the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of cells from the hematopoietic stem cell to the mature MK (3Ku H.

The intracellular signaling pathways utilized by c-Mpl have been extensively studied by many groups of investigators. After stimulation with TPO the Mpl receptor is believed to change conformation resulting in a homodimeric receptor complex capable of supporting the transphosphorylation and activation of two tethered Janus kinases, JAK2 and TYK2 (11Drachman J.

In contrast to these reports, one series of experiments has called the importance of JAK2 activation into question (16Dorsch M. Fan P.D. Danial N.N. Rothman P.B. Goff S.P. J. Exp.

Nevertheless, once activated, Janus kinases phosphorylate a number of substrates, including the Mpl receptor itself (providing a docking site for SH2-containing proteins), the latent transcription factors signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 and STAT5, and a number of adapter proteins including Shc and SHP2. Other signaling intermediates have also been found to be activated by TPO in various cell lines including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; see Refs. 17Rouyez M.C. Boucheron C. Gisselbrecht S.

Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a characteristic feature of MK development, and that the protein kinase Cα isoform is essential for proplatelet formation (23Rojnuckarin, P., and Kaushansky, K. (2001) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar), the process by which platelets develop from MK cytoplasm. Notably, TPO-induced MAPK activation has been shown to be both Shc-dependent and Shc-independent in both cell lines and platelets (24Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Much recent work has focused on the role of PI3K in supporting cell survival. One of the best studied mechanisms by which PI3K prevents programmed cell death is mediated by its activation of Akt, leading to phosphorylation and sequestration of the apoptosis-promoting Bcl family member Bad (26del Peso L.

However, PI3K has also been shown to mediate several other cellular events, including proliferation (31Craddock B.L. Orchiston E.A. Hinton H.J. Welham M.J. J. Biol.

In addition to its effects on Akt, PI3K can affect other signaling events, including the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK and GSK-3β/β-catenin/LEF pathways, both of which can play roles in cellular proliferation. The mechanism of PI3K activation has been extensively studied in several cytokine-responsive cell lines. For some receptors that induce PI3K activation, such as the EPO, platelet-derived growth factor, or Flt3 receptors, a 4-residue site of the form pYXXM or pYVAC (where pY is phosphotyrosine) has been described to bind directly the regulatory subunit of PI3K (33Rottapel R.

However, in other receptors, complexes of p85 with scaffolding/adapter proteins have been identified to induce PI3K activation by conformational changes in p85 and by bringing the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110, to the cell membrane in close proximity to its phospholipid substrates (36Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This adapter mechanism has also been studied in normal erythroid progenitor cells, in which Gab1 has been identified to play a scaffolding role in PI3K activation (37Wickrema A. Uddin S. Sharma A.

Therefore, in the present study the role of scaffolding/adapter molecules in the TPO-induced activation of PI3K has been explored using both BaF3/Mpl cells and primary murine MKs. Insulin receptor substrates (IRS) and their related proteins,Grb2-associated binders (Gabs), are involved in many cytokine-signaling events (37Wickrema A. Uddin S. Sharma A. Chen F. Alsayed Y.

Gab/IRS proteins have a pleckstrin homology domain responsible for recruitment to the plasma membrane and several protein-protein docking motifs that when phosphorylated allow the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes. At least five IRS and three Gab adapters have been reported, but additional members are likely to be identified. Included among the signaling intermediates that associate with Gab/IRS proteins are the p85 subunits of PI3K, SHP2, Grb-2, and Crk. However, the role(s) of Gab/IRS proteins in megakaryopoiesis have not yet been described. As engagement of TPO by its receptor has been shown to activate a wide variety of signaling pathways, we tested whether one or more of these proteins is involved in TPO signaling in MKs. We found that several proteins, including SHP2, Gab2, and IRS2, undergo phosphorylation and association in BaF3/Mpl cells following exposure to TPO, complexes that recruit and enhance the enzymatic activity of PI3K. Furthermore, SHP2 was found to be important for full PI3K activation suggesting the role of Gab/IRS proteins in recruiting SHP2 and PI3K into the same complex. In primary murine MKs, TPO also induced phosphorylation of SHP2, its association with p85, and enhanced associated PI3K activity, but in contrast to the results in cell lines or in erythroid progenitor cells, none of the known Gab or IRS proteins were phosphorylated in MKs. Instead, a 100-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (pp100) co-immunoprecipitated with the regulatory subunit of PI3K. These data provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms of megakaryopoiesis by identifying several molecules upstream of PI3K employed during TPO signaling.

Anti-IRS1 and anti-Grb2 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-IRS2, anti-SHIP, anti-PI3K (p85 subunit), and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). A rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Mpl antiserum was the generous gift of Dr. Donald Foster (ZymoGenetics), and the rat AMM2 monoclonal antibody against murine c-Mpl was the kind gift of Dr. Takashi Kato (Kirin).

Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Western blot chemiluminescence reagents were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The murine IL-3-dependent cell line BaF3 was engineered to express the murine Mpl receptor (BaF3/Mpl; see Ref. 40Kaushansky K. Lok S. Holly R.D. Broudy V.C. Lin N. Bailey M.C. Forstrom J.W. Buddle M.

The human leukemic cell line UT-7/TPO (kindly provided by Dr. Norio Komatsu) was maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM, Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 ng/ml human TPO. These cell lines were serum- and growth factor-deprived by incubation overnight in culture medium supplemented only with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). To obtain primary murine MKs, BDF-1 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were subcutaneously injected with 2 μg of human TPO daily for 5 days, and bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing and were cultured for 3 days in IMDM supplemented with 1% Nutridoma SP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 250 ng/ml human TPO. The cultured mature MKs were purified by unit gravity sedimentation on a discontinuous BSA density gradient as described previously (41Drachman J.D. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the collected cells was greater than 90% MKs, which were identified by acetylcholinesterase staining. MKs were starved in IMDM with 1% Nutridoma without cytokines for 7 h prior to signaling studies. Serum- and cytokine-starved BaF3/Mpl cells and MKs were stimulated with 25 ng/ml murine TPO for 10 min, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in a buffer composed of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The protein concentration of lysates was measured by Protein/DC assay (Bio-Rad). Specific proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by overnight incubation at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies. Protein A/G-conjugated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added and incubated for 2 additional hours at 4 °C. The pelleted beads were then washed 3 times with lysis buffer, resuspended in gel electrophoresis loading buffer, and heated to 90 °C for 5 min. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, as described previously (11Drachman J. Griffin J.D. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4979-4982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). BaF3/Mpl cells were incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium with 0.5% BSA and purified MKs in 1% Nutridoma in IMDM for 7 h. The starved cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml murine TPO for 10 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated as detailed above. Two hours after adding protein A or protein A/G-agarose beads, the immune complexes were washed three times with the lysis buffer, three times with 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm LiCl, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). After the final wash, 50 μl of TNE, 10 μl of 2 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidylinositol in 10 mm Tris-HCl with 1 mm EGTA, 10 μl of 0.1m MgCl2, and 5 μl of ATP mix (0.88 mm ATP containing 30 μCi of [32P]ATP and 20 mm MgCl2) were added sequentially. The kinase reaction mix was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before stopping the reaction by adding 20 μl of 6 n HCl. The radiolabeled lipid was then extracted with 160 μl of 1:1 CHCl3:methanol and centrifuged for 10 min. Fifty μl of the lower organic phase was spotted on a silicon TLC plate (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate and separated by chromatography in CHCl3:methanol:H2O:NH4OH (120:94:22.6:4) for 3 h. The plates were dried and visualized by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnydale, CA). We obtained a dominant negative SHP2 (DN SHP2) construct consisting of the pair of SH2 domains of SHP2 (residues 1–216) in a eukaryotic expression vector, pCAGGS (a generous gift from Dr. Hiroshi Maegawa, Shiga, Japan). Ten μg of DN SHP2 plasmid was co-transfected with 1 μg of the pMX-puro plasmid (a gift from Dr. Toshio Kitamura) into BaF3/Mpl cells by electroporation. A control culture was transfected with pMX-puro plasmid alone. Puromycin at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml was added 24 h after transfection. Expression of the dominant negative protein was determined by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates probed with a monoclonal antibody to the N terminus of SHP2 (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). The experiments were performed in 2 pools of cells from two separate transfections. Cells from the first co-transfection were also plated at limiting dilution, and clones that do and do not express DN SHP2 by Western blot analysis were obtained to assess the effects of DN SHP2 on PI3K activation and complex formation. Previous studies (18Rojnuckarin P. Drachman J.G. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1999; 94: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in our laboratory revealed that TPO is a potent stimulus of MAPK activation. As part of that work we found that the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and Ly294002 decreased MAPK activation significantly, suggesting that PI3K was also activated in cells exposed to TPO and that one of the downstream targets of PI3K was MAPK. To explore more formally the activation of PI3K in response to TPO, we conducted Western blot analyses to detect phosphorylation of Akt, a known downstream target of PI3K activation, and we performed direct PI3K functional assays on BaF3/Mpl cells and purified murine MKs. We found that TPO induced the activation of Akt in both cell types (Fig. 1) but not in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002, suggesting that PI3K is activated and acts on PDK2, one of the immediate activating kinases for Akt. We also found that total cellular PI3K activity was higher in TPO-stimulated BaF3/Mpl cells than in control cells. The average PI3K activity of TPO-stimulated cells was modestly increased, 120 ± 5.0% that of unstimulated cells, as determined by PhosphorImager analysis of four separate experiments and was higher than unstimulated cells in each experiment performed. However, the amount of PI3K activity present in membrane-localized signaling complexes was markedly increased by TPO (see below). To begin to identify the molecular mechanism(s) of TPO-induced PI3K activation, BaF3/Mpl cells were starved overnight and stimulated with TPO for 10 min, and p85 PI3K immunoprecipitates were prepared and size-fractionated, blotted, and probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody. Prior to stimulation with TPO, two phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of ∼100 kDa were detected (Fig.2). In the presence of TPO tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of ∼170, 145, 116, 110, 100, and 70 kDa were detected in BaF3/Mpl cells, although the ∼100-kDa protein was dominant. Since the molecular mass of members of the Gab family of adapters is ∼95–110 kDa, proteins known to associate with PI3K following stimulation of the T cell and B cell receptors, IL-6 and EPO, we studied the expression of Gab proteins in BaF3/Mpl cells and primary murine MKs. We found that Gab1, Gab2, and Gab3 were all expressed in BaF3/Mpl cells, but only Gab1 and Gab3 were present in MKs (Fig.3, A and C). In addition to Gab proteins, members of the IRS family also play a scaffolding role in many cell types. For example, IRS2 has been shown to modulate PI3K activation following stimulation of erythroid cells infected with Friend spleen focus-forming virus, which engages the EPO receptor (42Nishigaki K. Hanson C. Ohashi T. Thompson D. Muszynski K. Ruscetti S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3037-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and in a hematopoietic cell line expressing the EPO receptor (43Verdier F. Chretien S. Billat C. Gisselbrecht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26173-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, the molecular weight of the largest phosphotyrosine-containing proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with p85 PI3K (∼170 kDa) matches that reported for IRS1 and IRS2. Thus, although IRS proteins have not been described as mediating TPO signaling, we also investigated the expression of IRS1 and IRS2 in BaF3/Mpl cells and MKs. BaF3/Mpl cells were found to express IRS2 but not IRS1, and MKs displayed neither IRS1 nor IRS2 (Fig. 3, Dand E). The formation of multiprotein signaling complexes in response to hematopoietic cytokine receptor stimulation is dependent on the phosphorylation of many of the constituent proteins. Thus, we next assessed whether TPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several adapters and signaling mediators and whether they associated with PI3K. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Gab2 is prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated in BaF3/Mpl cells stimulated with TPO. Although BaF3/Mpl cells express small amounts of Gab1 and Gab3, they were not tyrosine-phosphorylated following exposure to TPO (data not shown). In addition, a 70-kDa phosphoprotein co-immunoprecipitated with Gab2 in these cells when stimulated with TPO; reprobing of the same immunoblot revealed it to be SHP2 (Fig. 4 B). The reciprocal experiment, immunoprecipitation with anti-SHP2, and probing for Gab2 confirmed the strong association of the two phosphoproteins (Fig. 4, E and F). Gab2 was also found to be associated with p85 (Fig. 4 C). Although there are several reports describing the association of JAK2, Grb2, and SHIP with SHP2 and Gab proteins, none of these proteins were detected in our immunoprecipitates of SHP2 and Gab2 (data not shown). As noted above, we found that BaF3/Mpl cells express IRS-2 but not IRS-1 (Fig. 3, D and E). Like Gab2, phosphorylation of IRS2 was induced by TPO stimulation of BaF3/Mpl cells (Fig. 5 A). In addition, IRS2 associated with p85 PI3K (Fig. 5 B) upon exposure of cells to TPO but not with SHP2 (data not shown). Moreover, IRS2 was found to associate constitutively with the Mpl receptor (Fig.5 D). Similar results were found in the human megakaryocytic cell lines, UT-7/TPO, following stimulation with TPO (data not shown). Thus, TPO induces the assembly of at least two multiphosphoprotein complexes in Mpl-bearing cell lines, one composed of Mpl, IRS2, and p85 PI3K and the other containing SHP2, Gab2, and p85 PI3K. We failed to detect reproducibly an association of p85 PI3K and Mpl by immunoprecipitation analysis. Previous work has shown that binding of the SH2 domain of p85 PI3K with a phosphotyrosine-containing scaffolding protein can activate PI3K. Two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms for this event have been proposed; one hypothesizes a Gab/IRS-induced conformational change in p85 allowing its activation of"

In the present study, we observed that α-naphthoflavone (α-NF) exhibited a differential effect on CYP3A4-mediated product formation as shown by an increase and decrease, respectively, of the carboxylic acid (P2) and ω-3-hydroxylated (P1) metabolites of losartan, while losartan was found to be an inhibitor of the formation of the 5,6-epoxide of α-NF. Thus, to address this problem, a kinetic model was developed on the assumption that CYP3A4 can accommodate two distinct and independent binding domains for the substrates within the active site, and the resulting velocity equations were employed to predict the kinetic parameters for all possible enzyme-substrate species. Our results indicate that the predicted values had a good fit with the experimental observations. Therefore, the kinetic constants can be used to adequately describe the nature of the metabolic interaction between the two substrates. Applications of the model provide some new insights into the mechanism of drug-drug interactions at the level of CYP3A4.

Stewart R.B. Cluff L.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 67-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, drug-drug interactions have become an important clinical issue due to the effects of one drug on the efficacy, toxicity, or disposition of another drug. The estimated incidence of clinically significant drug-drug interactions is as high as 20% in patients receiving multiple drugs (2Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. Goodman L.S. Gilman A.G. The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). The consequences of drug-drug interactions often are detrimental to clinical therapeutics and frequently result in an alteration of blood drug levels, leading in severe cases to life-threatening adverse reactions. For example, terfenadine cardiotoxicity has been observed when the drug is coadministered with certain agents such as ketoconazole (3Honig P.K. Wortham D.C. Zamani K. Conner D.P. Mullin J.C. Cantilena L.R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1993; 269: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) and erythromycin (4Honig P.K. Woosley R.L. Zamani K. Conner D.P. Cantilena L.R. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 52: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mortality has occurred in patients who were dosed concurrently with sorivudine and fluoropyrimidines (5Okuda H. Nishiyama T. Ogura K. Nagayama S. Ikeda K. Yamagouchi S. Nakamura Y. Watabe T. Xenobiotic Metab. Dispos. 1995; 10 (suppl.): S166-S169Google Scholar). Oral contraceptive failures have been noted in several populations of women taking rifampin, griseofulvin, and anticonvulsants (6Bolt H.M. Bolt M. Kappus H. Acta Endocrinol. 1977; 85: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Miller D.M. Helms S.E. Brodell R.T. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1994; 30: 1008-1011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, coadministration of multiple drugs also can be clinically useful. For instance, phenobarbital, which induces enzyme expression, has been beneficial in treating patients with unconjugated and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (8Hunter J. Chasseaud L.F. Prog. Drug Metab. 1976; 1: 129-191Google Scholar). The majority of cases of drug-drug interactions are a result of pharmacokinetic (metabolic clearance of one or more drugs) or pharmacodynamic (antagonistic or additive drug effects) alterations. Although interacting agents can affect all aspects of drug disposition, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion through a variety of mechanisms (9Rowland M. Tozer T.N. Clinical Pharmacokinetics: Concepts and Applications. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1995: 267-284Google Scholar), the most common drug interactions can be understood in terms of alterations in metabolism, which are associated primarily with changes in the activities of cytochromes P450, a gene superfamily consisting of at least 40 human isoenzymes (10Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). Currently, only families CYP1, -2, and -3 are thought to be important in drug metabolism (11Gonzalez F.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 243-288PubMed Google Scholar, 12Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1995: 1259-1313Google Scholar). Of the individual isozymes, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9 appear to be responsible for the metabolism of the greatest number of drugs. Metabolism-based drug interactions are primarily mediated by the enhancement or inhibition of enzyme systems that govern the biotransformation of xenobiotics. The kinetic parameters that describe enzyme-based drug interactions,e.g. K i , K A,K m , and V max, can be estimated by in vitro techniques and appropriate kinetic models. These estimates then may be used to predict the in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences associated with exposure to multiple drugs. Although the kinetic expressions for many types of drug interaction, such as competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive inhibition, and direct activation, have been described in detail (13Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar), no kinetic model has yet been reported for a P450 enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism of two substrates coexisting at the active site and that differentiates the fate of one another through mutual inhibition or activation. Due to the complexity of such interactions, the resulting kinetics are not straightforward and hamper mechanistic interpretation of the interaction in question. Thus, kinetic models that adequately describe the interaction between multiple drugs that bind simultaneously to a single enzyme active site are needed to aid in the understanding of clinically observed drug-drug interactions and in an assessment of their clinical significance. To better understand multiple substrate/effector enzyme kinetics, the present study investigated the metabolic interaction between losartan and α-naphthoflavone (α-NF)1 modulated by CYP3A4. These results of investigations, in turn, were employed to conduct a kinetic model that was used to define the nature of the losartan-α-NF interaction and that may be applied to other metabolic interactions occurring at the active site of CYP3A4. α-NF was purchased from Sigma. Losartan and its metabolites, namely the ω-3-hydroxy (P1) and carboxylic acid derivatives (P2), were obtained from Merck. The purified human P450 oxidoreductase (OR) was kindly provided from Dr. James P. Hardwick (Northeastern Ohio University College of Medicine). The full-length cDNAs encoding human CYP3A4 and CYP OR were provided by Dr. Frank J. Gonzalez (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). The entire coding region of each cDNA was inserted into baculovirus shuttle vectors, pBlueBac (XbaI/KpnI for CYP3A4 and EcoRI for OR) and then recombined separately into baculoviruses according to the manufacturer's procedure (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). CYP3A4 and OR proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells coinfected with the two separate recombinant viruses at a ratio (CYP3A4:OR = 5) of multiplicity of infection of virus in the presence of hemin (1 μg/ml) (14Shou M. Mei Q. Ettore JR., M.W. Dai R. Baillie T.A. Rushmore T.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 3 days, and microsomes were prepared by two different centrifugations (15Wang P.P. Beaune P. Kaminsky L.S. Dannan G.A. Kadlubar F.F. Larrey D. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The CYP3A4 content was determined by the CO difference spectrum, and ∼150 nmol of CYP3A4 in 500 ml cell culture was obtained. The specific activity of the CYP3A4 was measured by the testosterone 6β-hydroxylase assay and found to be 42 nmol of product formed/min/nmol of CYP3A4. The activity and content of OR present in the microsomal preparations were determined by assaying cytochrome c reduction and normalized according to the standard curve measured with purified human OR proteins (16Yasukochi Y. Masters B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5337-5344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molar ratio of CYP3A4 to OR was 1:2.8. The incubation mixture (usually 1-ml final volume) consisted of 50–100 pmol of microsomal P450 3A4 protein, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 7.45), and substrate in the presence or absence of the second substrate/effector (losartan or α-NF). The concentrations of losartan and α-NF when employed as substrates were varied from 11.1 to 150 μm and from 6.25 to 200 μm, respectively, and when used as effectors, ranged from 0 to 150 μm. The incubation mixture was pre-incubated for 2 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath, and the reaction was initiated with the addition of 1 mm NADPH and further incubated for 20 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 8 volumes of methylene chloride. The metabolites were extracted, and the organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The residue was dissolved in 50% acetonitrile in water and analyzed immediately by HPLC. Standard curves for the metabolites of interest were prepared using the corresponding authentic reference materials. The consumption of each substrate at all concentrations studied was limited to less than 10%, and the rates of product formation from losartan (20 μm) or α-NF (20 μm) were established to be linear over at least 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. HPLC analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 1100 liquid chromatograph equipped with both a diode array detector and an HP 1046 programmable fluorescence detector. Losartan and its metabolites were separated on a 20/20 ODS column (4.6 mm x 20 cm, 5 μm; TLC, Springfield, VA) and eluted with a 22-min linear gradient from 30 to 45% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The retention times of P1, P2, and losartan were 9.1, 17.2, and 18.9 min, respectively. Fluorescence of metabolites was detected at wavelengths of 250 nm for excitation and 370 nm for emission. The quantities of metabolites formed were determined from the appropriate standard curves. α-NF and its metabolites were separated on a 20/20 ODS column eluted with a 40-min linear gradient from 50 to 100% methanol in water and were detected by UV absorbance at 260 nm. The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the retention times of the 5,6-epoxide metabolite and α-NF itself were 21 and 30 min, respectively. For liquid chromatography-MS/MS studies, chromatography was conducted on a Hewlett-Packard HP1050 gradient system. Separation was carried out on a Phenomenex LunaTMC18 column (2.0 mm x 25 cm, 5 μm) using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) and a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The HPLC system was interfaced to a Finnigan TSQ 7000 tandem mass spectrometer, which was operated using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. The capillary temperature was 200 °C, and the electrospray ionization ionizing voltage was maintained at 5.0 kV. MS/MS was based on collision-induced dissociation of ions entering the rf-only octapole region, where argon was used as the collision gas at a pressure of 1.7 millitorr. A combination of collision offset voltages ranging from −35 eV to −55 eV were used for all MS/MS analyses. Based on the experimental findings of this study (see below), we observed that (i) α-NF modulated CYP3A4 activity by increasing the formation of the carboxylic acid derivative (P2) and decreasing the formation of ω-3 hydroxylated derivative (P1), (ii) losartan was an inhibitor of CYP3A4-mediated formation of the 5,6-epoxide (Q) metabolite of α-NF (Fig. 1), and (iii) the apparent kinetic constants, e.g. K m and V max, describing the metabolism of the coexisting substrates as altered significantly by drug interaction in a manner that could not be explained simply by any of the Michaelis-Menten kinetic models (inhibition or activation) by an assumption of the one-binding domain at the active site. Thus, a kinetic model was proposed to address the complexity of metabolism exhibited in this study. The model postulates that CYP3A4 contains two distinct and independent binding sites at the active site that can be occupied simultaneously by two substrate molecules (either the same or different molecular species). The binding orientations of substrate with enzyme are defined on the basis of the metabolic fates of each substrate as presented in Scheme FSI. The two occupied binding sites interact kinetically such that occupancy of the two sites results in changes in the rates of turnover of the two substrates and in the apparent K m andV max values. Thus, velocity equations for the formation of each major product are derived according to the expressions shown below, and kinetic estimates that can truly reflect the relationship between substrate(s) and enzyme in any of substrate/effector-enzyme combinations are resolved. The model is based on the assumption of rapid equilibrium. Thus, all species in the reaction described by Scheme FSI equilibrate rapidly, meaning that the dissociation of each enzyme-substrate complex is much faster than its breakdown to product(s).vP1=Vmax P11KS1+α[S]KS1KA1[S]+1KS1+1KS2+[F]KF[S]+[S]KS1KA+[F]KS2KSFEquation 1 vP2=Vmax P21KS2+β[S]KS1KA+δ[F]KS2KSF1[S]+1KS1+1KS2+[F]KF[S]+[S]KS1KA+[F]KS2KSFEquation 2 vQ=VmaxQ[F]KF[S]+γ[F]KFKFS1[S]+1KS1+1KS2+[F]KF[S]+[S]KS2KB+[F]KFKFSEquation 3 where [S] and [F] are the concentrations of losartan and α-NF, and V maxP1,V maxP2, and V maxQ are expressed by [Et ]k 1, [Et ]k 2, and [Et ]k q , respectively, referring to the maximum velocity of the formation of each metabolite at a singly occupied site. K values are dissociation constants for individual enzyme-substrate complexes, whereas α, β, δ, and γ represent a factor that determines the change of theV max at one site when the second site is occupied by the substrate molecule. Since the enzyme reaction forms two closed circles as indicated in Scheme FSI, the terms ofK S1 K A andK S2 K SF in the equations can be substituted by K S2KB andK FKFS, respectively, and vise versa. Thus, the velocity equation for each product formation may be expressed in different ways.Figure FSIProposed kinetic model for metabolic interaction of simultaneous-existing dual substrates in the active site of CYP3A4.

J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting equations were simplified by the program Mathematica 4 (Wolfram Research, Inc., Champain, IL). The experimental data were fitted with the equations to generate the surface plots. Statistics of the data was performed using both the residual sum of squares (RSS) and R2. All kinetic constant statistics were determined by either SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) or Mathmatica 4. Incubation of losartan with cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 in the presence of NADPH led to the formation of two major metabolites, namely P1(ω-3-hydroxy losartan) and P2 (the carboxylic acid metabolite), which were identified by comparing the HPLC retention times and MS/MS spectra with authentic standards (Fig.1). Time-dependent formation of products in the metabolism of losartan (20 μm) was shown to be linear up to at least 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, whereas less than 10% of the substrate was consumed during the experiment. The ratio of the concentration of substrate to that of CYP3A4 in the incubation usually was between 250 and 2,000. Thus, the enzyme-mediated reaction was considered to meet the requirements of both steady state and rapid equilibrium. The addition of α-NF (11–100 μm) enhanced significantly the rate of formation of P2 in the metabolism of losartan by 6–11-fold (Fig. 3). However, α-NF proved to be a potent inhibitor of the ω-3 hydroxylation of losartan (P1). When the α-NF concentration was increased to ≥25 μm, the P1 metabolite was no longer detected (Fig.2). Surface plots that indicate the effect of α-NF on the concomitant inhibition and activation of losartan metabolism are shown in Figs. 2 and3, respectively.Figure 2Effect of α-NF on the CYP3A4-catalyzed formation of ω-3 hydroxylated losartan (P1).

Upon collision-induced dissociation, major fragment ions were observed atm/z 103, 131, 143, and 187, respectively (Fig.4). Although ion atm/z 103 indicated that the isolated phenyl ring of the molecule was intact. The ions at m/z 143, 187, and 131 suggested that the oxygen atom had been incorporated into the naphthalene moiety of the molecule. By comparing the HPLC profile and mass spectral information with previous reports (18Andries M.J. Lucier G.W. Goldstein J. Thompson C.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 990-995PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shou M. Grogan J. Mancewicz J.A. Krausz K.W. Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin H.V. Korzekwa K.R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), the metabolite was identified tentatively as α-NF 5,6-epoxide. In the metabolism of α-NF by CYP3A4, the inclusion of losartan (6.25–150 μm) was found to inhibit the formation of α-NF 5,6-epoxide by up to 64%. In these experiments, inhibition of α-NF metabolism increased in parallel with increases in losartan concentration, as shown in Fig. 5. Full kinetic analyses were performed on the effect of α-NF on losartan metabolism. The apparent kinetic parameters and statistics are given in TableI. In the absence of α-NF, two apparentK m values were determined by monitoring the formation of P1 (K mP1(app)) and P2 (K mP2(app)); these were 82 and 40.3 μm, respectively. The effect of α-NF on losartan metabolism indicated that α-NF at 1–150 μm stimulated dramatically the formation of P2 with a marked increase inV maxP2(app) (up to 4.6-fold) and a rapid decrease in K mP2(app) (up to 4-fold). However, when the formation of metabolite P1 was quantified, α-NF exhibited the opposite effect, showing an increase inK mP1(app) (4.2-fold) but a decrease inV maxP1(app). At α-NF concentrations >25 μm, formation of P1 was inhibited completely (ν P1 → 0). In the metabolism of α-NF by CYP3A4, incorporation of losartan resulted in a considerable decrease in V maxQ(app) (35.7% ofV maxQ(app) in the absence of losartan) and a slight increase in K mQ(app) (TableII).Table IEffect of α-NF on the kinetics of losartan metabolism by cDNA-expressed CYP3A4α-NFP1formationP2 formationK mP1(app)V maxP1(app)V/KK mP2(app)V maxP2(app)V/Kμm×10 −3×10 −3082.0 (5.7)0.132 (0.006)1.6040.3 (4.9)0.0059 (0.0005)0.151104.7 (20.8)0.112 (0.014)1.0736.5 (4.7)0.0089 (0.0005)0.242.575.0 (19.1)0.070 (0.011)0.9342.2 (12.9)0.0122 (0.0018)0.295180.3 (20.5)0.061 (0.005)0.3425.3 (3.4)0.0142 (0.0008)0.5610260.1 (30.8)0.044 (0.004)0.1717.4 (1.7)0.0143 (0.0005)0.8225341.3 (51.7)0.039 (0.005)0.1111.6 (0.9)0.0144 (0.0003)1.245017.9 (3.2)0.0192 (0.0012)1.077512.7 (1.4)0.0220 (0.001)1.7310011.1 (1.9)0.0251 (0.0012)2.2612511.0 (1.9)0.0265 (0.0013)2.4115010.2 (2.0)0.0273 (0.0015)2.68Apparent K m (μm) andV max (nmol/min/nmol of P450) values with S.E. were calculated by determining the formation of Losartan metabolites in the absence or presence of α-NF.

Apparent K m (μm) andV max (nmol/min/nmol of P450) values with S.E. were calculated by determining α-NF-5,6-epoxide formation in the absence or presence of losartan. These observed kinetic changes associated with the interaction of two substrates with the enzyme cannot be explained by simple Michaelis-Menton kinetics, in which all equations are based on the assumption of the one binding domain in the catalytic portion of the enzyme. Hence, introduction of a second binding domain in the active site is needed to explain the observed kinetics. Of the two proposed binding sites in CYP3A4, the model hypothesizes that the first site can be occupied by either losartan (S1) or α-NF (F). The binding of losartan forms S1E and S1ES2 complexes for the breakdown to P1, whereas the binding of α-NF forms FE and FES2 for the production of Q (Scheme FSI). Two substrates for the binding site are competitive, resulting in an inhibition, as reflected in part by an increase in K mP1(app)) or K mQ(app) and decrease inV maxP1(app) orV maxQ(app). Meanwhile, the second site is occupied by losartan (S2) to form ES2, FES2, and S1ES2 species for generating P2 exclusively. Thus, the activation of losartan oxidation to P2 by α-NF clearly is attributed to FES2, one of the three P2-forming species, suggesting that the binding of α-NF to this site changes the kinetic nature for the other site for losartan (S2), allowing losartan to be metabolized readily to P2 (probably an allosteric effect). Since the two binding sites are involved in the enzyme reaction and numerous substrate-enzyme complexes are formed, each complex possesses its own dissociation constant(s) and product-forming rate(s). In fact, the observed rate of formation of a particular metabolite represents the sum of the rates of all associated enzyme-substrate complexes generating that metabolite. For example, the net rate of P2 production is accounted for by the rates of product formation from ES2, S1ES2, and FES2. Therefore, the resulting apparentK m and V max determined by the total rate of product formation (Table I and II) do not truly represent the kinetic characteristics of each individual substrate-enzyme complex. The model that describes the observed metabolic interaction leads to the solution of kinetic parameters in equilibria and provides a prediction of the potential in vitro drug-drug interaction via the enzyme-mediated reaction. As seen in Table III, all kinetic parameters in the model were determined by the equations.K S1, K S2, andK F are the estimates of dissociation constants for three single-substrate-bound species, S1E, ES2, and FE, respectively, whereasV maxP1, V maxP2, andV maxQ are the maximum velocities for individual products formed at their specific sites. In contrast, the two binding sites had different K and V max for losartan, namely K S1 andV maxP1 for S1E, andK S2 and V maxP2 for ES2. Thus, K S1 (67–107 μm), K S2 (25–41 μm), and K F (158–203 μm) were calculated by the three individual equations (Table III), and V maxP1,V maxP2, and V maxQ were determined to be 0.16, 0.007, and 4.1 min−1, respectively. When both sites were occupied with losartan,V max values were changed by factors α (0.38) for S1ES2 → P1 and β (0.43) for S1ES2 → P2, leading to an inhibition by αV maxP1 <V maxP1 and βV maxP2 <V maxP2. In addition, K m values were shown to increase for both K B = 435 μm (S1ES2 ⇌ ES2) and K A = 150–211 μm(S1ES2 ⇌ S1E), respectively, implying that the kinetic interaction of the two substrates at the active sites occurs. On the other hand, when ES2 and S1ES2 were occupied/displaced with α-NF,V maxP2 for FES2 → P2increased substantially by a factor δ (δ = 8.3, δV maxP2 > V maxP2) with a little decrease in K m for FES2 ⇌ FE (K FS = 15.1 μm <K S2 = 25–40 μm). In contrast, losartan decreased the V max for FES2→ Q by a factor γ (γ = 0.29, γV maxQ< V maxQ) but did not alterK m for FES2 ⇌ ES2(K SF = 182–203 μm ≃K F = 158–203 μm). These results suggest that the presence of the two substrates (either the same or different molecular species) elicits changes in the metabolic profile of the enzyme as a result of several mechanisms of substrate interactions, e.g. competitive, cooperative, conformational, steric, and/or electronic effects that cause kinetic and metabolic multiplicity.Table IIIKinetic parameters calculated from the equations in the textEquilibrium 3-aEnzyme-substrate complexes and their equilibria shown in Scheme FSI.Product 3-bProduct formed from the specific enzyme-substrate complex.K± S.E. 3-cK, dissociation constant of each substrate-enzyme complex in the model, and the values were calculated by the equations shown above.Factor 3-dFactor that determines the change in V max for the first site when the second site is occupied.V max± S.E. 3-eV max values indicate that maximum velocity at the specific site of each product-forming complex in the model and were calculated by the equations, respectively.

In aqueous solution, this adduct was shown to assume a ring-closed form. In contrast, when γ-OH-1,N 2-propano-2′-deoxyguanosine pairs with dC at the center of an 11-mer oligodeoxynucleotide duplex, the exocyclic ring opens, enabling the modified base to participate in a standard Watson-Crick base pairing alignment. Analysis of the duplex spectra reveals a regular right-handed helical structure with all residues adopting an anti orientation around the glycosidic torsion angle and Watson-Crick alignments for all base pairs.

The transition between the PdG(syn)·dA+(anti) and PdG(anti)·dA(anti) forms was reversible with a pKa of ∼7.0, indicating that both forms are present and in equilibrium under physiological conditions (26Kouchakdjian M. Eisenberg M. Live D. Marinelli E. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4456-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Huang P. Patel D.J. Eisenberg M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3852-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PdG also was used to evaluate the thermodynamic impact of acrolein-derived lesions in DNA duplexes. The adduct reduced thermal stability, transition enthalpy, and transition free energy of the duplex; thermal destabilization was insensitive to the base opposite the adduct (28Plum G.E. Grollman A.P.

Surprisingly, synthesis past the adduct was essentially error-free. To better understand the striking differences between the model adduct, PdG, and the naturally occurring acrolein-derived adduct, γ-OH-PdG, we used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of γ-OH-PdG both as a free nucleoside and in duplex DNA. For the latter structure, the adduct was incorporated opposite dC at the center of an 11-mer oligodeoxynucleotide duplex (referred to as the acr-dG·dC duplex). Our data establish that γ-OH-PdG nucleoside exists in a closed form in solution but undergoes complete conversion to an open structure in duplex DNA. The chemical structure of γ-OH-PdG and the duplex sequence employed in this study are shown in Fig.1. Acrolein is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant formed by incomplete combustion of organic materials, including wood, food, tobacco, and fuels. This α,β-unsaturated aldehyde reacts to form hydroxylated 1,N 2-propano-2′-deoxyguanosine adducts in DNA (1World Health Organization Publications (1992) The WHO Environmental Health Criteria Series, Vol. 127.Google Scholar, 2Galliani G.

The mutagenic properties of acrolein have been explored in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (13Marnett L.J. Hurd H.K. Hollstein M.C. Levin D.E. Esterbauer H. Ames B.N. Mutat.

However, until recently, site-specific mutagenesis studies were not feasible due to the chemical lability of γ-OH-PdG under conditions required for solid phase DNA synthesis. Accordingly, a structural analog, 1,N 2-propano-2′-deoxyguanosine (PdG), which shares the exocyclic ring but lacks the hydroxyl group of naturally occurring acrolein-derived adducts (see Fig. 1), was adopted as a model for structural and biological studies of exocyclic DNA adducts (17Shibutani S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22392-22400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other sequence contexts, frameshift mutations were not observed and the principal mutagenic events in bacteria and mammalian cells were G → T transversions and G → A transitions (21Moriya M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28844-28850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies of PdG embedded in duplex DNA showed that, under acidic conditions, the modified base tends to adopt a syn conformation around the glycosyl bond, forming PdG(syn) ·dA+(anti) and PdG(syn)·dC+(anti) alignments. Also, a pH-independent PdG(syn)·dG(anti) base pair was observed in solution (23Kouchakdjian M. Marinelli E. Gao X.L. Johnson F. Grollman A. Patel D.

In each of these alignments, PdG was inside the helix and hydrogen bonds formed across the base pair involved the Hoogsteen edge of the adduct. An alternative PdG(anti)·dA(anti) alignment, observed at basic pH, showed an adduct exposed to solvent, displaced into the major groove of the helix and unstacked from the flanking bases (26Kouchakdjian M. Eisenberg M. Live D. Marinelli E. Grollman A.P. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4456-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Proteins from this family have been implicated in a variety of processes including stress response, de novoprotein folding, protein degradation, protein trafficking, and disassembly of protein complexes (for reviews, see Refs. 5Bukau B.

Central to all hsp70 activities is their ability to undergo association/dissociation cycles with peptide substrates and to couple ATP binding and hydrolysis with conformational changes that modulate their peptide binding affinity. ATP binding results in conformational changes leading to destabilization of hsp70·peptide substrate complexes, whereas subsequent ATP hydrolysis to ADP results in conformational changes leading to complex stabilization (8Palleros D.P.

Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Kawula T.H. Lelivelt M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 610-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No specific peptide substrates have been identified for Hsc66, and its exact cellular function(s) are not known. It is also unclear whether Hsc66 functions as a general chaperone with broad substrate specificity as is the case for DnaK (2Wang T.F. Chang J.H. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26051-26409Google Scholar, 6Rudiger S. Buchberger B. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Rudiger S. Germeroth L.

Localization of the gene encoding Hsc66,hscA, to a gene cluster (iscSUA-hscBA-fdx) encoding proteins thought to function in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters suggests that Hsc66 may play a specialized role in the folding of Fe/S proteins (17Zheng L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The hscB gene product from this cluster encodes a 20-kDa protein designated Hsc20 that exhibits sequence similarities with the N-terminal J-domain of DnaJ-type auxiliary co-chaperones, and in vitro studies indicate that Hsc20 stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc66 and regulates the rate of conversion of Hsc66 between its different peptide affinity states (20Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Hsc66 and Hsc20 appear to comprise a distinct chaperone system with nonoverlapping functions with the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system since physiologically relevant levels of DnaJ or GrpE do not affect Hsc66 ATPase activity, and Hsc20 does not stimulate DnaK ATPase activity (18Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that the iscU gene product, IscU, also stimulates the ATPase activity of Hsc66 (21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). IscU is a novel Fe/S-binding protein believed to function as a scaffold for Fe/S cluster assembly (21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 22Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.J.

Chem. 2000; 5: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The nature of the interaction of IscU with Hsc66 and the mechanism by which it stimulates Hsc66, however, is unclear. IscU stimulation could arise from actions as an auxiliary, regulatory co-chaperone in addition to Hsc20. Alternatively, stimulation could result from interactions of IscU with the peptide-binding domain of Hsc66, i.e. with IscU serving as a substrate for Hsc66. To better understand IscU regulation of Hsc66, we have investigated the ability of IscU to compete with model peptide substrates for binding to Hsc66 and have characterized the effects of nucleotides on Hsc66 and IscU binding. In addition, we investigated the ability of IscU to bind Hsc66 truncation mutants lacking specific subdomains of the C-terminal peptide-binding region. Escherichia coli DH5αFIQ cells were from Life Technologies, Inc. Enzymes for DNA manipulation were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs, Inc., or U. S. Biochemical Corp. Synthetic nucleotides were obtained from Genosys. Bacterial growth media components were from Difco, and other reagents were from Sigma. Recombinant Hsc66, Hsc20, and IscU were expressed and purified as described previously (20Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T.

Vectors for overexpressing truncated forms of Hsc66, pTrc66(D383stop) for residues 2–382, and pTrc66(D506stop) for residues 2–505, were made by introducing stop codons into the vector encoding Hsc66 (pTrc66; see Ref. 20Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) using the Unique-Site Elimination method (CLONTECH). Both truncation mutants were overexpressed and purified using similar methods as reported for full-length Hsc66 (20Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T.

Steady-state ATPase rates were determined at 23 °C in HKM buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.4 mm ATP as previously reported (18Silberg J.J.

The aggregation of bovine rhodanese and porcine citrate synthase were performed in HKM buffer containing 1 mm ADP as described previously (18Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SPR methods were carried out at 25 °C with a Biacore 3000 instrument (Piscataway, NJ) using methods described previously (21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hsc66 in the presence of MgADP was randomly cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip using amine coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. IscU was injected over the immobilized Hsc66 in HKM buffer containing 1 mm DTT and either 1 mm ADP or 1 mm ATP. Data are reported as changes in relative response units (RU). Similar results were obtained when Hsc66 was immobilized to the surface of a sensor chip in the presence of MgATP indicating that the differences in binding kinetics observed were not the result of the conditions of Hsc66 immobilization. A Microcal (Amherst, MA) Omega titration calorimeter was used to investigate the binding of IscU to Hsc66, Hsc:2–505, and Hsc:2–382 in HKM buffer containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm ADP using procedures described previously (21Hoff K.G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To investigate the possible role of IscU as a specific substrate for Hsc66, we examined the ability of IscU to compete with the model peptide substrates rhodanese and citrate synthase (18Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were carried out by measuring the effect of Hsc66·ADP on the extent of rhodanese or citrate synthase aggregation in the presence of varying levels of IscU. The effect of IscU on the ability of Hsc66 to suppress the aggregation of chemically denatured rhodanese is shown in Fig.1 A. IscU inhibited Hsc66 suppression of rhodanese aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner with a molar ratio of IscU to Hsc66 of 1:1 resulting in ∼75% inhibition of Hsc66 chaperone activity (15 min), and a ratio of 5:1 giving >95% inhibition. IscU alone had no effect on rhodanese aggregation suggesting that the changes in turbidity caused by addition of IscU to reactions containing Hsc66 are not due to IscU directly enhancing rhodanese aggregation. The effect of IscU on the ability of Hsc66 to suppress the aggregation of thermally denatured citrate synthase is shown in Fig. 1 B. IscU inhibited Hsc66 suppression of citrate synthase aggregation, and this effect was dependent on the level of IscU with a molar ratio of IscU to Hsc66 of 2.5:1 inhibiting Hsc66 chaperone activity ∼85% (40 min). IscU alone had no effect on citrate synthase aggregation. The competition of IscU with both rhodanese and citrate synthase for binding to Hsc66 is consistent with interaction of IscU with the peptide-binding domain of Hsc66 and suggests that IscU may form a stable complex with the high peptide affinity ADP state of Hsc66. A hallmark of hsp70 proteins is their ability to modulate substrate binding in a nucleotide-dependent manner. The ADP complexes of hsp70 proteins display high affinity for peptide substrates and exhibit slow on and off rates, and exchange of ADP for ATP results in conformational changes leading to a low substrate affinity form with faster substrate association and dissociation rates (8Palleros D.P.

Because IscU was found to compete with model peptide substrates for binding to Hsc66, it was of interest to determine whether IscU binding to Hsc66 is regulated in a manner similar to that observed for other hsp70 substrates. In initial experiments, SPR analysis was used to investigate nucleotide effects on the interaction of IscU with Hsc66. Fig.2 shows the results of titrations in which Hsc66 was randomly cross-linked to the sensor chip and exposed to different concentrations of IscU in the presence of ADP or ATP. The extent of binding of IscU to Hsc66 was similar in the presence of either nucleotide, but the apparent affinity of Hsc66 for IscU was greater in the presence of ADP (K D (app)≅ 9 μm) compared with that observed in the presence of ATP (K D (app) ≅ 37 μm). Examination of the sensorgrams (insets Fig. 2) also reveals differences in the binding kinetics as a function of nucleotide. IscU association in the presence of ATP is faster than that observed in the presence of ADP, and the half-time for IscU dissociation in the presence of ATP (t 12 ≅ 2 s) is ∼30-fold faster than that observed in the presence of ADP (t 12 ≅ 60 s). These results indicate ATP destabilizes Hsc66·IscU complexes in a manner similar to that observed for other hsp70-substrate interactions (8Palleros D.P. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L.

Because of possible complications in the SPR binding studies arising from surface and/or immobilization effects, we also used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to more accurately quantitate the interaction of IscU with Hsc66. Fig. 3shows the enthalpic changes observed in an experiment in which successive additions of IscU were made to Hsc66 in the presence of ADP. The data are plotted as the integrated heats of binding (Q inj) versus the molar ratio of IscU to Hsc66. The best fit curve to the data indicates the presence of a single, high affinity binding site (K D ≅ 1.6 μm) consistent with specific binding to the Hsc66·ADP complex in a manner expected for a substrate. Hsp70 proteins are composed of two functionally distinct domains, a highly conserved N-terminal ATPase domain ∼44-kDa and a C-terminal peptide-binding domain ∼25 kDa (1Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 746-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wang T.F. Chang J.H. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26051-26409Google Scholar, 3Gragerov A.

Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Structural studies on the C-terminal domain of DnaK complexed with peptide substrate indicate that this domain can be further divided into two subdomains: a β-sandwich region that directly binds model peptide substrates, and a C-terminal helical cap that lies above the peptide binding pocket of the β-sandwich (25Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). To investigate which domain(s) of Hsc66 are required for IscU binding, we constructed two truncation mutants (Fig.4, A and B). The first mutant, designated Hsc:2–505, lacked the C-terminal helical cap but contained both the N-terminal ATPase domain and the peptide-binding β-sandwich subdomain (residues 2–505). The second mutant, designated Hsc:2–382, contained only the ATPase domain (residues 2–382). The effect of IscU on the ATPase activity of Hsc66, Hsc:2–505, and Hsc:2–382 was compared to characterize the region(s) of Hsc66 required for IscU binding (Fig. 4 C). Both truncation mutants exhibited intrinsic ATPase activity that was slightly greater than that of full-length Hsc66. The ATPase activities of full-length Hsc66 and Hsc:2–505 were stimulated by IscU indicating the C-terminal helical cap is not necessary for IscU binding and activation. The activity of the ATPase domain fragment Hsc:2–382, however, was not affected by IscU indicating that the peptide-binding β-sandwich subdomain is required for IscU stimulation of ATPase activity as expected if IscU is a substrate for Hsc66. To determine whether IscU interacts with the isolated ATPase domain Hsc:2–382 in a manner not manifested as effects on ATPase activity, we also used ITC to measure enthalpic changes that might arise as a result of binding. Injection of IscU into a cell containing Hsc: 2–382 and ADP did not result in any detectable enthalpic changes suggesting that IscU does not interact directly with the isolated ATPase domain (data not shown). Two approaches were used to further investigate the role of the C-terminal helical cap of Hsc66 in interactions with IscU. To investigate interactions of IscU with the ATP-bound state of Hsc:2–505, we examined the concentration dependence of IscU stimulation of Hsc:2–505 ATPase activity (see Fig.5 A). The concentration of IscU required for half-maximal stimulation of Hsc:2–505 activity (K m ≅ 31 μm) is similar to that previously reported for full-length Hsc66 (K m ≅ 34 μm; Ref. 21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), although the maximal stimulation observed for Hsc:2–505 (∼14-fold) is slightly greater than that of full-length Hsc66 (∼8-fold; Ref. 21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that removal of the C-terminal helical cap of Hsc66 has little effect on either the affinity of ATP-bound Hsc66 for IscU or its ability to couple IscU binding with increased ATPase activity. To investigate interactions of IscU with the ADP-bound state of Hsc:2–505, we measured the thermodynamics of IscU binding to Hsc:2–505 in the presence of ADP. Fig. 5 B shows the results of an ITC experiment in which successive additions of IscU were made to a cell containing the Hsc:2–505·ADP complex. The binding affinity observed (K D ≅ 26 μm) is ∼16-fold weaker than that of full-length Hsc66 under similar conditions (K D ≅ 1.6 μm; Fig. 3). Instead, it is similar to the apparent affinity observed for the ATP-bound state of Hsc:2–505 (31 μm; Fig. 5 A). Thus, the C-terminal helical cap of Hsc66 is required for the increased binding affinity for IscU that occurs following ATP hydrolysis. In earlier studies we found that both Hsc20 and IscU stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc66 and regulate the rate of conversion of Hsc66 between its different peptide affinity states (20Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Whereas Hsc20 shares sequence similarities with DnaJ-type auxiliary co-chaperones and is thought to function in a manner similar to these proteins (18Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IscU represents a novel ATPase stimulatory protein whose mechanism of action was unclear. IscU was also found to bind to Hsc20, and in the presence of Hsc20 the concentration of IscU required for half-maximal stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity was reduced (21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The interaction between IscU and Hsc20 resembles the interaction of peptide substrates with DnaJ, a hsp40 co-chaperone. DnaJ decreases the concentration of peptide substrates required for half-maximal stimulation of DnaK ATPase activity (26Jordan R. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4563-4569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and thereby serves to target these substrates to the high peptide affinity ADP state of DnaK (27Russell R. Karzai A.W. Mehl A.F. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Similarities in the actions of Hsc20 and DnaJ suggested that the increased binding affinity of Hsc66 for IscU observed in the presence of Hsc20 could reflect the role of IscU as a substrate. The results described herein provide direct evidence that IscU behaves as a substrate for Hsc66. IscU was shown to compete with model peptide substrates for binding to the Hsc66·ADP complex consistent with IscU binding to the high peptide affinity ADP state of Hsc66. Affinity sensor studies also showed that nucleotides regulate Hsc66 binding to IscU in a manner consistent with that observed for nucleotide effects on hsp70·peptide substrate interactions (8Palleros D.P. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 9Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P.

Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). ATP-bound Hsc66 exhibited faster association and dissociation rates for IscU compared with ADP-bound Hsc66 indicating that ATP destabilizes Hsc66·IscU complexes. In addition, calorimetric studies revealed that IscU binds to Hsc66 at a single site with an affinity (K D ≅ 1.6 μm) ∼20-fold greater than the concentration of IscU required for half-maximal stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity (K m ≅ 34 μm; Ref. 21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Assuming that the K m observed in ATPase stimulation assays reflects the binding affinity of IscU for the ATP state of Hsc66, 2The K m obtained in ATPase assays is only a good estimate of the equilibrium dissociation constant of ATP-bound Hsc66 for IscU if binding of IscU is rapid relative to ATP hydrolysis (29Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 677-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). the differences in affinities of the ADP and ATP-bound states is similar to that observed with other hsp70·substrate complexes (9Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 11Green L.E. Zinner R. Naficy S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

Studies examining the interaction of IscU with truncation mutants of Hsc66 provide further support that IscU behaves as a substrate for Hsc66. IscU stimulated the ATPase activity of a mutant containing the ATPase domain and the peptide-binding β-sandwich region (Hsc:2–505), but no interactions were observed with a mutant composed solely of the ATPase domain (Hsc:2–382). These results establish that the β-sandwich region of Hsc66 is essential for IscU binding as is the case for substrate binding to other hsp70 proteins (25Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Although the Hsc66 C-terminal helical cap was not required for IscU stimulation of Hsc66 ATPase activity, this subdomain was required for coupling of ATP hydrolysis with conformational changes that increase Hsc66 binding affinity for IscU. In contrast to full-length Hsc66 in which Hsc66·ADP complexes exhibit ∼20-fold higher affinity for IscU compared with ATP complexes, ADP and ATP complexes of Hsc:2–505 displayed similar IscU affinities indicating that both the β-sandwich and helical cap subdomains are required for high affinity binding. The C-terminal helical cap does not, however, appear to be required for all hsp70-substrate interactions. A recent report showed that DnaK mutants lacking the cap retain efficient coupling of ATP hydrolysis with increased substrate binding affinity (28Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Wander Kooi C.W. Feng H. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This may reflect structural differences between Hsc66 and DnaK or may arise from differences in the types of substrates recognized. The short peptide used in the DnaK studies (28Pellecchia M. Montgomery D.L. Stevens S.Y. Wander Kooi C.W. Feng H. Gierasch L.M. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) would not be expected to make extensive contacts with the C-terminal helical cap (25Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The larger IscU protein, in contrast, may interact with both the β-sandwich and helical cap subdomains of Hsc66, and interactions of IscU with both subdomains may be required for high affinity binding. There is evidence that the helical cap may be important for regulatory interactions of the eukaryotic homologs of Hsc66. Mutations in the corresponding C-terminal subdomain of the yeast mitochondrial homolog of Hsc66, Ssq1, gives rise to phenotypic effects indicative of reduced chaperone activity (19Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The finding that IscU behaves as a substrate for Hsc66 raises the question of whether the Hsc66/Hsc20 chaperone system has evolved specifically to interact with IscU in Fe/S-cluster assembly or whether it serves a more general chaperone function in the cell. Like other hsp70 chaperones Hsc66 is able to bind denatured proteins (e.g. rhodanese and citrate synthase) and to prevent their aggregation (18Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These “model substrates,” however, have no effect on the ATPase activity of Hsc66. IscU binding, in contrast, is coupled to the nucleotide state of Hsc66 and regulates the chaperone's ATPase reaction cycle. IscU also exhibits specific interactions with the co-chaperone Hsc20 that is not observed with other proteins or peptides (18Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). These results, together with genetic findings implicating yeast homologs of Hsc66, Hsc20, and IscU in iron-sulfur protein biogenesis (19Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggest that the primary cellular function of the Hsc66/Hsc20 chaperone system may be to interact with IscU in Fe/S-cluster generation. While the studies described herein indicate that IscU binds as a substrate to Hsc66, the specific structural features of IscU required for interaction with Hsc66 are not known. Hsc66 may recognize a structured motif within IscU or may bind an unstructured region of IscU in an extended conformation similar to that recognized by DnaK (25Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). Further studies are also needed to investigate how Hsc66 and Hsc20 affect the function of IscU in iron-sulfur cluster assembly. The exact role the Hsc66/Hsc20 chaperone system plays in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis remains unclear. The chaperone system may function in assembly or stabilization of Fe/S clusters on IscU or may facilitate transfer of Fe/S clusters formed on IscU to an apo-acceptor protein."

However, neuronal properties are strongly affected by activity dependent and modulatory influences, making it essential, ultimately, to study these properties in behaving animals. Unfortunately, intracellular recording has only been widely applied in vitro, since cardiac and respiratory pulsations make intracellular recording difficult in vivo. In awake behaving animals, spontaneous movements make intracellular recording nearly impossible. Here I present a novel technique to dynamically stabilize the position of a recording electrode relative to the brain.

In efforts to understand the molecular processes regulating apoptosis in this cell type, we have defined a novel mechanism involving the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Sp1. Subtypes of SMC expressing abundant levels of Sp1 produce the death agonist, Fas ligand (FasL) and undergo greater spontaneous apoptosis. Sp1 activates the FasL promoter via a distinct nucleotide recognition element whose integrity is crucial for inducible expression. Inducible FasL promoter activation is also inhibited by a dominant-negative form of Sp1. Increased SMC apoptosis is preceded by Sp1 phosphorylation, increased FasL transcription, and the autocrine/paracrine engagement of FasL with its cell-surface receptor, Fas. Inducible FasL transcription and apoptosis are blocked by dominant-negative protein kinase C-ζ, whose wild-type counterpart phosphorylates Sp1.

Liao H.-S. Macgovern J. Circulation. 1998; 98: I-48Google Scholar). Fas is also highly expressed in intimal SMCs of the plaque (6Geng Y.J. Henderson L.E. Levesque E.B. Muszynski M. Libby P.

Apoptosis in undiseased tissue may inhibit arterial thickening by limiting cell proliferation and accumulation in the intima (6Geng Y.J. Henderson L.E. Levesque E.B. Muszynski M. Libby P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2200-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In atherosclerotic tissue, apoptosis particularly of collagen-producing SMCs may substantially weaken the plaque causing it to rupture, initiate thrombosis, and trigger acute coronary syndromes (11Flynn P.D.

Overexpression of FasL in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries devoid of endothelium-induced apoptosis in medial SMCs and inhibited intimal hyperplasia (13Sata M. Perlman H. Muruve D.A. Silver M.

Circulation. 1999; 99: 1776-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence in a rabbit model suggests that FasL may promote rather than retard atherogenesis. FasL overexpression in nondenuded arteries of hypercholesterolemic animals stimulated lesion formation in these animals via increased cellularity (15Schnieder D.B. Vassalli G. Wen S. Driscoll R.M.

These observations may be due to differences in artery and lesion cellular composition or cholesterol feeding between the two animal models. Despite clear evidence for FasL and Fas expression in SMCs of the artery wall, the molecular mechanisms mediating FasL production in vascular cells are presently not known. The promoter region of the FasL gene has recently been cloned and found to contain binding sites for a number of transcription factors including NF-κB (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 3456-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The promoter contains a single transcription initiator site, as well as positive and negative regulatory regions within a 2.3-kilobase portion of the 5′-untranslated genome (19Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. Algeciras A. Badley A.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Analysis of the FasL promoter has mostly been confined to T cells. For example, T cell activation following CD4 cross-linking induces NFAT binding to the FasL enhancer and gene transactivation (19Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. Algeciras A. Badley A.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Similarly, cytotoxic stress-induced FasL expression involves the activation of NF-κB, AP-1, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, prior to cell death (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar). Activity of the FasL promoter is also regulated by MEK kinase-1 (18Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5414-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcription factor phosphorylation has not yet been directly demonstrated as a prerequisite step in apoptosis. The discovery and functional characterization of Sp1 as a GC-rich binding nuclear protein has provided a useful paradigm to our understanding of the regulation of transcriptional activation in eukaryotic cells (21Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 5: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a broadly expressed nuclear protein of ∼100 kDa and contains three Kruppel-like zinc fingers that contact DNA (21Jackson S.P. MacDonald J.J. Lees-Miller S. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 5: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 22Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). A nucleotide recognition element for Sp1 is located in the FasL promoter at position −281/−276 base pairs (GGGCGG) relative to the transcriptional start site. Sp1 can influence gene expression by changes in its nuclear concentration and interaction with the promoter, by providing architectural support, serving as a cofactor, or by undergoing chemical modification. Sp1 phosphorylation e.g. mediates inducible tissue factor expression in vascular endothelial cells exposed to fluid shear stress (23Lin M.-C. Almus-Jacobs F. Chen H.-H. Parry G.C.N. Mackmann N. Shyy J.Y. Chen S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The significance of Sp1 in the process of apoptosis in any cell type is presently unknown. This knowledge would advance our understanding of the transcriptional basis of extrinsic apoptosis, given the wide distribution of both Sp1 and FasL. WKY12-22 and WKY3M-22 cells are well established subtypes of vascular smooth muscle cells that are phenotypically distinct (24Majesky M.W. Giachelli C.M. Reidy M.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 25Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). WKY12-22 cells have a cobblestone morphology in culture, proliferate in plasma-derived serum (which lacks vital growth factors), and spontaneously overexpress mRNA for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain, elastin, and osteopontin (24Majesky M.W. Giachelli C.M. Reidy M.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 25Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, WKY3M-22 cells are typically spindle-shaped and do not express PDGF-B, elastin, or osteopontin mRNA, nor do they grow in plasma-derived serum. Both cell subtypes are phenotypically stable in culture and can be passaged indefinitely. Therefore, WKY12-22 and WKY3M22 cells represent important cells with which to delineate the molecular basis for differences in SMC phenotype and gene expression. We recently reported that Sp1 is spontaneously expressed at greater levels in WKY12-22 cells than WKY3m-22 cells and that as a consequence, Sp1-dependent genes, such asPDGF-B, are overexpressed in WKY12-22 cells compared with its sister cell subtype (26Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These observations provided important insight into the transcriptional basis for differential gene expression. Here we explored the regulatory role of Sp1 in inducible FasL expression and apoptosis in two phenotypically distinct SMC subtypes. SMCs were maintained in Waymouth's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), pH 7.4, containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Transient transfections were performed with cells at 60% confluence, and the indicated constructs together with 2 μg of the internal control vector, pRL-TK, using FuGENE6 transfection agent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After 24 h, the transfected cells were incubated with or without CAM (1 μg/ml), and luciferase activity was quantified using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla data generated from pRL-TK. Various sized fragments of the FasL promoter (−271FasL·hsLuc and −296FasL·hsLuc) were amplified from the parent vector FasL·hsLuc (gift of Dr Shailaja Kasibhatla, La Jolla Inst. of Cellular Immunology) by PCR and blunt-end cloned into pGL3. The mutant counterpart of FasL·hsLuc bearing a mutation in the Sp1 binding site (mSp1FasL·hsLuc) was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pEBGNLS-Sp1 was obtained from Gerald Thiel (Inst. for Genetics, University of Cologne), CMV-Sp1 was obtained from Robert Tjian (Howard Hughes Medical Inst., University of California), and CMV-FLAG·DN-PKC-ζ was obtained from Debabrata Mukhopadhyay (Beth Israel-Deaconess Hospital, Boston) and Alex Toker (Boston Biomedical Research Inst.). SMCs were grown in 96-well plates to 80% confluency in 100 μl of growth medium. Where indicated, the cells were incubated with Fas-Fc (R&D Systems) and/or IgG Fc (R&D Systems) (50 μg/ml, final concentration) for 1 h prior to the addition of CAM. After 24-h exposure to CAM, apoptosis was quantitated using the Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). This assay, which measures cytoplasmic histone-associated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, has been used previously to quantitate inducible apoptosis in cultured cells (27Ho F.M. Liu S.H. Liau C.S. Huang P.J. Lin-Shiau S. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2618-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 28Jones M.M. Xu C. Ladd P.A.

Med. 1997; 22: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed gently in PBS and incubated with shaking in lysis buffer for 30 min at 22 °C. Lysates were transferred into Eppendorf tubes and spun at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. Twenty μl of the supernatant was used in the ELISA, which was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to total cell number measured using a Coulter counter. Results are expressed as total internucleosomal DNA fragmentation as a proportion of the cell population. SMCs were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 and resuspended in 1× binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. One hundred microliters of the suspension was transferred to 5-ml flat bottomed tubes where 5 μl of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 10 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml stock in PBS) was added. The cells were gently vortexed and incubated in the dark at 22 °C for 15 min. Four hundred microliters of binding buffer was added to each tube, and annexin V staining was analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h. Results are expressed as annexin V staining as a percentage of the total cell population. SMCs were grown in chamber slides (80% confluent) and incubated with CAM (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The cells were washed in PBS, pH 7.4, and fixed with methanol/acetone (80:20) for 10 min at 22 °C. Propidium iodide (50 μm) was added to each well and incubated for a maximum of 5 min followed by a second wash with PBS. Cells undergoing apoptosis were visualized by confocal microscopy. SMCs treated with CAM for various times were washed and scraped in 10 ml of PBS and transferred to precooled centrifuge tubes. Samples were spun at 1300 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl (for two 100-mm dishes) of solution A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl) and placed on ice for 5 min. Samples were spun at 14,000 rpm for 40 s. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of solution C (20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA) and mixed gently for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to precooled Eppendorf tubes containing 20 μl of solution D (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol) and stored at −80 °C until use. All buffers contained protease inhibitors. Nuclear extracts (6–10 μg) were incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (150,000 cpm, 40 fmol) in 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 5% sucrose, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mixture was incubated for 35 min at 22 °C. In supershift experiments, nuclear extract was incubated with 2 μg of antibody prior to addition of the probe. Samples were resolved by 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and binding complexes were visualized by autoradiography at −80 °C. Fifteen micrograms of nuclear extract was resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Sp1 was detected with Sp1 polyclonal antibodies (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequent chemiluminescent visualization. Nuclear extracts (10–15 μg) were incubated with or without 5 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP, NEB) for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was quenched by the addition of loading dye prior to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis for Sp1. In EMSA, 8 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 5 milliunit of CIP (final concentration determined by CIP titration experiments with32P-labeled FasL Oligo) at 33 °C for 5 min and then on ice for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors at a final concentration of 10 nm LiNaF, 10 nm sodium vanadate, 10 nm potassium pyrophosphate, and 5 nm sodium phosphate. EMSA was performed as described above. CIP treatment prior to EMSA has previously been used for the assessment of Sp1 phosphorylation in nuclear extracts (30Leggett R.W. Armstrong S.A. Barry D.

Five micrograms of total RNA isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were treated with DNase I, and cDNA was generated using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with random primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences of the primers for FasL, Fas, and β-actin are as follows: 5′-FasL, 5′-AAACCCTTTCCTGGGGC-3′; 3′-FasL, 5′-GTGTCTTCCCATTCCAG-3′; 5′-Fas, 5′-CTGTGGATCATGGCTGTCCTGCCT-3′; 3′-Fas, 5′-CTCCAGACTTTGTCCTTCATTTTTC-3′; 5′-β-actin, 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′; 3′-β-actin, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′; 5′-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′; 3′-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma), 5 μl of cDNA, and either 100 pmol of Fas primers, 100 pmol of FasL primers, or 20 pmol of β-actin primers using a Perkin Elmer thermocycler. Amplication was performed by denaturing the sample at 94 °C for 2 min, then cycled at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, and an extension at 72 °C for 4 min. The number of PCR cycles for Fas/β actin was 25. Twenty microliters of the reaction was visualized on 1.5% agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining. Fifteen μg of total RNA isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was loaded onto a 1% formaldehyde/agarose gel and resolved by electrophoresis. Northern blot was performed as previously described (32Khachigian L.M. Williams A.J. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27679-27686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). FasL and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA amplified by PCR were used as probes. The cDNA was labeled by nick translation (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To begin investigating a possible mechanistic role for Sp1 in programmed cell death, we compared apoptosis in two well established SMC subtypes isolated originally from the arteries of pup (2-week-old) and adult (3-month-old) rats (24Majesky M.W. Giachelli C.M. Reidy M.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 25Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar). Pup SMCs (WKY12-22 cells) are phenotypically distinct from their adult counterparts (WKY3M-22 cells) and express abundant levels of Sp1 (26Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We found that cytoplasmic histone-associated internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (27Ho F.M. Liu S.H. Liau C.S. Huang P.J. Lin-Shiau S. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2618-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 28Jones M.M. Xu C. Ladd P.A. Toxicolology. 1997; 116: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Sandoval M. Zhang X.-J. Liu X. Mannick E.E. Clarck D.A. Miller M.J.S. Free Red. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) is greater in WKY12-22 cells than WKY3M-22 cells (Fig. 1 A, left), indicating higher levels of spontaneous apoptosis in the former cell subtype and providing further evidence that these SMC subtypes are phenotypically distinct. These observations were confirmed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining upon fluorescence-activated cell sorting, indicating greater disrupted membrane symmetry exposing phosphatidylserine to the external environment (Fig. 1 A, right). Similar findings were obtained qualitatively by DNA laddering on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (data not shown). To determine whether Sp1 could directly modulate apoptosis, Sp1 cDNA was transiently overexpressed in WKY3M-22 cells using a cytomegaloviral promoter-driven expression vector (CMV-Sp1). Sp1 increased apoptosis in this cell type (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, apoptosis was inhibited by 50% in WKY12-22 cells following overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Sp1 (DNA binding domain) using pEBGNLS-Sp1 (33Petersohn D. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating profound inhibition effected by a single transcription factor. These data provide the first demonstration of the capacity of Sp1 to modulate apoptosis in any cell type. Inspection of the FasL promoter sequence revealed the existence of a putative recognition element for Sp1 (5′-GGGCGG-3′) located at nucleotides −281/−276. Because Sp1 is preferentially expressed in WKY12-22 cells (26Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that FasL, if it is Sp1-dependent, would be more abundantly expressed in WKY12−22 cells than WKY3M-22 cells. We assessed FasL mRNA expression in WKY12−22 and WKY3M-22 cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR. FasL was readily expressed in WKY12-22 cells but was weakly, if at all, expressed in WKY3M-22 cells (Fig. 1 D). Northern blot analysis confirmed preferential FasL mRNA expression in WKY12-22 cells (Fig. 1 E). These findings suggested that Sp1 may regulate cell death through its activation of the FasL promoter. To determine whether FasL is under the transcriptional control of Sp1, transient transfection analysis was performed with the construct FasL·hsLuc, a firefly luciferase-based reporter vector driven by 1.2 kilobases of the FasL promoter (16Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of FasL·hsLuc with an Sp1 expression vector induced FasL promoter-dependent expression (Fig. 2 A). To localize the Sp1 response element in the FasL promoter, we generated a series of reporter constructs derived from parent FasL·hsLuc bearing 5′ deletions in the FasL promoter. Luciferase activity increased upon cotransfection of −296FasL·hsLuc and CMV-Sp1 (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, −271FasL·hsLuc failed to respond to Sp1 overexpression (Fig. 2 B). The 5′-FasL promoter end points in these constructs (−296 and −271) occur on either side of the putative Sp1 binding site (−281/−276). EMSA using a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning this region of the promoter ([32P]FasL oligonucleotide, −296/−265) and nuclear extracts prepared from WKY12-22 cells revealed the formation of a number of nucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 2 C). The most intense band was supershifted with polyclonal antibodies directed to Sp1 (Fig. 2 C). Identical amounts of Smad1 polyclonal antibodies used as a negative control had no influence on nucleoprotein complex formation (Fig. 2 C). To demonstrate sequence specificity of complex formation, we prepared an oligonucleotide ([32P]mFasL oligonucleotide, −296/−265) bearing a mutation that disrupts the Sp1 binding site (to 5′-TTTCTT-3′). This mutation no longer supported the interaction of Sp1 with this region of the FasL promoter (Fig. 2 C). When introduced into full-length FasL·hsLuc, producing construct mSp1FasL·hsLuc, luciferase expression inducible by Sp1 was completely abolished (Fig.2 D). These findings demonstrate that Sp1 positively regulates FasL transcription. Activation by exogenous Sp1 of the FasL promoter was greater in WKY3m-22 cells than WKY12-22 cells (Fig. 2, E versus A), consistent with higher endogenous Sp1 expression in the latter cell type (26Rafty L.A. Khachigian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5758-5764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We next explored the effect of extracellular apoptotic stimuli on the capacity of Sp1 to stimulate apoptosis and transactivate the FasL promoter. CAM, an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I, has been reported to induce apoptosis in several cell types (34Pantazis P. Leukemia Res. 1995; 19: 775-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) although its effect on SMCs is not known. Nuclear condensation of SMCs stained by propidium iodide increased dramatically following 24-h exposure to CAM (Fig. 3 A). This agent also induced internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA and annexin V staining (data not shown). To determine whether FasL expression is altered by CAM and define the involvement of Sp1 in this process, we performed RT-PCR and transient transfection analysis with FasL promoter constructs.

These transgenic mice displayed EGFP fluorescence restricted to skeletal muscle and increased glucose tolerance characteristic of enhanced insulin sensitivity. The GLUT4-EGFP protein localized to the same intracellular compartment as the endogenous GLUT4 protein and underwent insulin- and exercise-stimulated translocation to both the sarcolemma and transverse-tubule membranes. Consistent with previous studies in adipocytes, overexpression of the syntaxin 4-binding Munc18c isoform, but not the related Munc18b isoform, in vivo specifically inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4-EGFP translocation. Surprisingly, however, Munc18c inhibited GLUT4 translocation to the transverse-tubule membrane without affecting translocation to the sarcolemma membrane. The ability of Munc18c to block GLUT4-EGFP translocation to the transverse-tubule membrane but not the sarcolemma membrane was consistent with substantially reduced levels of syntaxin 4 in the transverse-tubule membrane. Together, these data demonstrate that Munc18c specifically functions in the compartmentalized translocation of GLUT4 to the transverse-tubules in skeletal muscle. In addition, these results underscore the utility of this transgenic model to directly visualize GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle.

Although the precise signaling steps that occur downstream of the PI 3-kinase ultimately leading to GLUT4 translocation have remained elusive, recent studies have begun to resolve the specific trafficking, docking, and fusions events. In adipocytes, it is well established that GLUT4 storage compartments contain vesicle-localized proteins (v-SNAREs) that specifically interact with cognate cell surface target proteins (t-SNAREs) at the plasma membrane to promote vesicle docking and fusion (13Pessin J.E.

Furthermore, the syntaxin 4-binding protein, Munc18c, has been shown to specifically modulate insulin-sensitive GLUT4 translocation in 3T3L1 adipocytes (22Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S.

However, it is important to recognize that the majority of these studies have been performed in cultured 3T3L1 adipocytes and L6 myotubes due to the inherent technical limitations in the study of GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes and skeletal muscle in vivo. Skeletal muscle is the primary depot for insulin-stimulated disposal of blood glucose in vivo and has unique functional and structural characteristics that distinguish it from adipose tissue. Like adipocytes, insulin stimulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle also occurs through a PI 3-kinase pathway. But in addition, muscle contraction/exercise also potently stimulates glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation independently of the PI 3-kinase pathway (25Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O.

Furthermore, unlike the simpler single plasma membrane of adipocytes, skeletal muscle has two functionally distinct surface membranes, the sarcolemma and transverse-tubule, both of which function as GLUT4 protein acceptor membranes in the translocation process (30Rodnick K.J.

Currently, there is little functional data with regard to the v-SNARE and t-SNARE proteins involved in either insulin- or exercise/contraction-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle. Thus, to develop a more tractable skeletal muscle system to investigate GLUT4 translocation, we have generated transgenic mice specifically expressing a GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein in skeletal muscle. In this article, we demonstrate that the GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein displays an identical distribution and trafficking pattern as the endogenous GLUT4 protein. These animals provide a model system to investigate skeletal muscle GLUT4 translocation in vivo and can be used to distinguish between sarcolemma and transverse-tubule GLUT4 translocation through the function of the syntaxin 4-binding protein, Munc18c. The rabbit polyclonal GLUT4 and Munc18c antibodies were obtained as described previously (24Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 8D5 (specific for β-dystroglycan) and IIID5E1 (specific for the α1 subunit of the L-type calcium channel) were kindly provided by Dr. Kevin P. Campbell, University of Iowa. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant GFP was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). A sheep antibody was prepared against the cytosolic domain of syntaxin 4 was obtained as described previously (20Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). A rabbit Munc18 polyclonal antibody that recognizes Munc18b was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Vectashield and the Monoclonal on Mouse kit were purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Adenoviral vectors encoding full-length, Flag-tagged Munc18c and Munc18b were prepared by the University of Iowa Gene Therapy Vector Core according to standard procedures. A 2.2-kilobase fragment of the GLUT4 cDNA fused in-frame with the EGFP cDNA was ligated into the transgenic vector pStec which contains the SV40 polyadenylation and intron sequences. A 2.2-kilobase fragment of the human skeletal muscle actin (HSA) promoter was isolated from the pHSAaNeorplasmid and ligated upstream of the pStec-GLUT4/EGFP vector. The resulting vector, pStec-HSA-GLUT4/EGFP, was linearized withAfl III, microinjected into the nucleus of pre-implanation embryos, and transferred to the oviduct of psuedo-pregnant mice as described previously by the University of Iowa Transgenic Animal Facility. The resulting pups were screened for the presence of the transgene by polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA and the positive animals bred onto the C57Bl/6 background. Various tissues were dissected from carbon dioxide asphixiated mice and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues were diced in a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mmbenzamidine and then ground with a handheld pellet pestle (Kontes, Vineland, NJ) for 20 s. The samples were then transferred to a Dounce homogenizer and homogenized with 10 hand strokes. After rocking at 4 °C for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 30 min at 13,000 × g and the clear lysate subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Control and GLUT4-EGFP transgenic mice were fasted overnight. A basal glucose level was taken with tail vein blood on a Hemocue Glucometer (Hemocue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). At time point 0, the mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of 2 grams of glucose per kg of body weight. Glucose measurements were then taken from tail vein blood at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-glucose injection. The subcellular fractionation of skeletal muscle was performed as described (34Zhou M. Sevilla L. Vallega G. Chen P. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Pilch P.F. Kandror K.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E187-E196PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following an overnight fast, the transgenic mice were either left untreated or given an intraperitoneal injection of 21 units of Humulin R per kg of body weight. After 30 min, the mice were sacrificed, and the quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were dissected and trimmed of fat and connective tissues. The muscles were put in a homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm benzamidine, and homogenized with a Polytron PT-10 homogenizer 3 times in 10-s bursts. The samples were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was re-centrifuged at 9,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet (P1) was re-suspended in PBS containing protease inhibitors. The supernatant from the P1 fraction was then centrifuged at 180,000 ×g for 90 min, and the pellet was re-suspended in PBS plus protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (1 mg) from each pellet were loaded onto a 4.5-ml 10–30% continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 216,000 × g for 55 min in an SW50.1 rotor (Beckman-Coulter, Palo Alto, CA). The sucrose gradient was fractionated into 500-μl aliquots and the pellet (P2) was re-suspended in PBS plus protease inhibitors. Five μg of protein plus equal volumes of the fractions were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblotting. Transgenic littermates were fasted overnight and either left untreated or given an intraperitoneal injection of 21 units of Humulin R per kg of body weight. After 30 min, the mice were sacrificed, the quadriceps dissected, covered in TissueTek O.C.T. embedding compound, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Frozen muscles were stored at −80 °C, subsequently cut with a Zeiss Cryostat to a thickness of 7 μm and adhered to glass slides. Similarly, mice were exercised as described below and the basal and exercised mice were sacrificed and skeletal muscle tissue prepared as described above. The tissue slices were incubated in blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum in PBS for 1 h. After rinsing with PBS, the samples were incubated with a 1:50 dilution of the primary antibody in the blocking solution for 90 min. The samples were then washed with PBS three times for 5 min each and then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody. The slides were washed with PBS three times for 5 min each, dried, mounted with a drop of Vectashield, and covered with a coverslip. Antibody-labeled tissues slices were then viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Fluorescent Microscope. Due to the high labeling background of the IIID5E1 mouse monoclonal antibody on mouse tissue, a special antibody labeling protocol was used. In this particular case, the samples were blocked with avidin and biotin blocking buffers, and blocked and labeled using the Monoclonal on Mouse kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mice were trained to run on a Columbus Instruments Rodent Treadmill (Columbus, OH) with 3–4 training sessions consisting of 15 min at a speed of 10–15 m/min at an incline of 10%. The exercise experiment involved the running of fasted mice for 60 min at a speed of 15–20 m/min. Trained but not exercised mice were used as controls for these analyses. Adenovirus infection of muscle was done according to standard protocols (35Duclos F. Straub V. Moore S.A. Venzke D.P. Hrstka R.F. Crosbie R.H. Durbeej M. Lebakken C.S. Ettinger A.J. van der Meulen J.

Briefly, 4–6-week-old mice were anesthetized with a dose of 91 mg/kg ketamine and 9.1 mg/kg of xylazine. Purified adenovirus (1 × 109 particles) was injected into the right quadriceps of the mouse just above the kneecap. After 4 days, mice were fasted overnight and either left untreated or stimulated with insulin (21 units/kg for 30 min) and the muscles were isolated as described above. To develop an in vivo skeletal muscle model in which the trafficking of GLUT4 could be readily visualized, we generated several independent transgenic mouse lines expressing the GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein driven by the HSA promoter. The tissue specificity of GLUT4-EGFP expression was directly compared with that of the endogenous GLUT4 protein in the heart, diaphragm, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and adipose tissue extracts by immunoblot analysis (Fig.1). As previously established, control nontransgenic mice displayed strong GLUT4 immunoreactivity in these tissues at a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, GLUT4 immunoblots of the transgenic mice show the presence of both the endogenous GLUT4 protein and the GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein with a molecular mass of ∼75 kDa (Fig. 1 D). Importantly, the 75-kDa band was only detected in skeletal muscle tissues (diaphragm, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius) but was absent in both cardiac and adipose tissue extracts. As expected, the GFP antibody was unreactive to the tissues from the nontransgenic mice (Fig.1 A), while a 75-kDa band corresponding to GLUT4-EGFP was detected in the skeletal muscle extracts from the transgenic mice (Fig.1 C). Again, this GFP immunoreactivity was restricted to the skeletal muscle tissues and was not observed in cardiac or adipose tissues. Although the extent of GLUT4-EGFP expression was different among the 4 transgenic lines isolated, all of these lines displayed an identical tissue-specific expression pattern (data not shown). These results demonstrate that GLUT4-EGFP protein expression in these animals occurs to a similar degree as endogenous GLUT4 protein levels and this expression is appropriately restricted to skeletal muscle tissue. Previous studies have demonstrated that increased expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle results in relative fasting hypoglycemia with increased glucose disposal in response to a glucose challenge (37Brozinick Jr., J.T. Yaspelkis 3rd, B.B. Wilson C.M. Grant K.E. Gibbs E.M. Cushman S.W. Ivy J.L. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Tsao T.S. Burcelin R. Katz E.B. Huang L. Charron M.J. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, we fasted GLUT4-EGFP transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates and assessed the changes in plasma glucose levels following an intraperitoneal injection of glucose (Fig.2). As typically observed, wild-type mice achieved a peak blood glucose level (∼500 mg/dl) at 30 min that subsequently decrease slowly over next 90 min. Although the GLUT4-EGFP transgenic mice also reached a peak glucose level at 30 min, the increase in circulating glucose was markedly reduced averaging only 275 mg/dl. The blood glucose levels were also significantly lower in the transgenic mice over the entire time frame examined. These data demonstrate that the addition of EGFP to the COOH-terminal domain of GLUT4 does not impair its ability to transport glucose and transgenic expression in skeletal muscle results in enhanced glucose tolerance. The ability of GLUT4-EGFP to enhance glucose disposal could either result from a basal increase in the levels of GLUT4-EGFP at the cell surface and/or an insulin-stimulated translocation of the GLUT4-EGFP from intracellular storage sites to the cell surface. To investigate the subcellular distribution of GLUT4-EGFP, we utilized skeletal muscle homogenization coupled with sucrose velocity sedimentation to separate sarcolemma/transverse-tubule enriched fractions (P1 and P2) from the fractions enriched for intracellular membranes (34Zhou M. Sevilla L. Vallega G. Chen P. Palacin M. Zorzano A. Pilch P.F. Kandror K.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E187-E196PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig.3, in the basal state there is a relatively low level of GLUT4 in the P1 and P2 fractions with the majority distributed in fractions 4–8 of the continuous sucrose velocity gradient indicative of an intracellular localization (Fig.3 A). The distribution of the GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein mirrored the distribution of the endogenous GLUT4 protein. Insulin stimulation resulted in a decreased amount of endogenous GLUT4 localized to the intracellular compartment with a concomitant increase in the P1 and P2 fractions (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, the GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein also displayed a marked reduction in the intracellular fractions paralleled with increased levels in the P1 and P2 fractions in response to insulin. These data demonstrate that the transgenic GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein localizes to similar intracellular sites and undergoes an identical pattern of insulin-stimulated translocation as the endogenous skeletal muscle GLUT4 protein. To distinguish between sarcolemma and transverse-tubule translocation, we utilized confocal fluorescent microscopy of the GLUT4-EGFP protein in comparison with the established sarcolemma-localized protein (β-dystroglycan) and the transverse-tubule protein marker the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (Figs.4 and 5). In the basal state, GLUT4-EGFP was primarily distributed throughout the interior of the muscle fibers with no evidence of sarcolemma localization (Fig. 4, panel a). Following insulin stimulation, there was a marked redistribution of GLUT4-EGFP resulting in a strong labeling of the fiber surface coupled with a greater organization of the fiber interior (Fig. 4, panel b). The sarcolemma membrane was labeled with the monoclonal β-dystroglycan antibody and did not change following insulin stimulation (Fig. 4,panels c and d). Consistent with the results of the subcellular fractionation, the extent of GLUT4-EGFP and β-dystroglycan colocalization was relatively low in the basal state but greatly increased following insulin stimulation (Fig. 4,panels e and f).Figure 5Insulin stimulation results in the translocation of GLUT4-EGFP to the transverse-tubule membranes.GLUT4-EGFP transgenic mice were fasted overnight and either left untreated (panels a, c, and e) or stimulated with insulin (panels b, d, and f) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The quadriceps muscle was frozen, sliced, and incubated with the monoclonal antibody directed against the α1 subunit of the α1-VDCC using the Monoclonal on Mouse kit according to the manufacturers instructions (panels c andd). Sections were visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy (×63) and then further magnified 11 times. The width of each panel is ∼13 μm. These are representative fields from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to sarcolemma translocation, several studies have demonstrated that GLUT4 protein also translocates to the transverse-tubule membrane (31Marette A. Burdett E. Douen A. Vranic M. Klip A. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1562-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Wang W. Hansen P.A. Marshall B.A. Holloszy J.O. Mueckler M. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1429-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The transverse-tubules are deep invaginations of surface membrane that originate from and are continuous with the sarcolemma membrane. These invaginations are more difficult to visualize by light microscopy, but can be distinguished by colocalization with an antibody against the transverse-tubule specific α1 subunit of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (α1-VDCC) when visualized at high magnification (Fig. 5). In the basal state, GLUT4-EGFP was randomly distributed within the interior of the fiber and did not colocalize with the α1-VDCC subunit (Fig. 5, panels a, c, and e). In contrast, insulin stimulation resulted in the appearance of GLUT4-EGFP in a striated pattern consistent with localization of the transverse-tubules (Fig. 5, panel b). This was confirmed by the insulin-stimulated colocalization of GLUT4-EGFP with the α1-VDCC subunit (Fig. 5, panels d and f). Together, these data demonstrate that in response to insulin, the GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein translocates to the sarcolemma and transverse-tubule in a manner similar to that of the endogenous GLUT4 protein. In addition to insulin, a variety of other stimuli such as exercise, contraction, and hypoxia also enhance glucose uptake by induction of GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle (3Goodyear L.J. Kahn B.B. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 235-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 39Hayashi T. Wojtaszewski J.F. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1039-E1051PubMed Google Scholar). These “alternative” pathways of GLUT4 translocation are independent of insulin action and occur in the complete absence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (25Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 26Yeh J.I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2107-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether the GLUT4-EGFP protein was appropriately distributed into vesicular compartments responsive to an “alternate” signaling pathway. As shown in Fig.6, exercise promotes the translocation of the GLUT4-EGFP protein from intracellular storage sites to the sarcolemma membrane (Fig. 6, panels a and b). The sarcolemma translocation was again confirmed by the colocalization of GLUT4-EGFP with β-dystroglycan (Fig. 6, panels c, d, e, and f). Similarly, exercise also induced the redistribution of GLUT4-EGFP to the transverse tubule membranes as detected by colocalization with the α1-VDCC subunit (Fig.7, panels a-f). It should also be noted that the extent of GLUT4-EGFP translocation was weaker than observed with insulin stimulation, which may reflect the degree of exercise used in these experiments. Regardless, these data further demonstrate that the GLUT4-EGFP protein is also stored in the exercise-responsive population of GLUT4-containing intracellular vesicles.Figure 7Exercise stimulation results in the translocation of GLUT4-EGFP to the transverse-tubule membranes.GLUT4-EGFP transgenic mice were fasted overnight and either left untreated (panels a, c, and e) or run for 60 min on a treadmill (panels b, d, and f) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The quadriceps muscle was frozen, sliced, and incubated with the monoclonal antibody directed against the α1 subunit of the α1-VDCC using the Monoclonal on Mouse kit according to manufacturers instructions (panels c andd). Sections were visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy (×63) and then further magnified 11 times. The width of each panel is ∼13 μm.

Here we present the 2.0-Å crystal structure of the wild type iron-dependent regulator from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in its fully active holorepressor conformation. Clear, unbiased electron density for the Src homology domain 3-like third domain, which is often invisible in structures of iron-dependent regulators, was revealed by density modification and averaging. This domain is one of the rare examples of Src homology domain 3-like folds in bacterial proteins, and, in addition, displays a metal binding function by contributing two ligands, one Glu and one Gln, to the pentacoordinated cobalt atom at metal site 1. Both metal sites are fully occupied, and tightly bound water molecules at metal site 1 (“Water 1”) and metal site 2 (“Water 2”) are identified unambiguously. The main chain carbonyl of Leu4 makes an indirect interaction with the cobalt atom at metal site 2 via Water 2, and the adjacent residue, Val5, forms a rare γ turn. Residues 1–3 are well ordered and make numerous interactions. These ordered solvent molecules and the conformation and interactions of the N-terminal pentapeptide thus might be important in metal-dependent activation.

Killman H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 104-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), is a virtually indispensable cofactor in important biological processes, including respiration, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and DNA synthesis. However, despite its natural abundance, the biological availability of iron is extremely low. In neutral solution ferrous iron, Fe(II), rapidly oxidizes to ferric iron, Fe(III), and forms insoluble hydroxides (KS∼ 10−18m). Iron is often a limiting factor for growth of living organisms, and in the case of pathogenic organisms it is a limiting factor in infection (2Weinberg E.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1978; 42: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Higher organisms such as humans sequester iron in tight complexes with iron storage and transport proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and ferritin, making the iron unavailable to invading bacteria (3Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). To obtain sufficient iron from their environment, many bacteria secrete low molecular weight chelators called siderophores, such as the exochelins and mycobactins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4Macham L.P. Ratledge C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1975; 89: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ferric-siderophore complexes are actively imported by membrane-spanning receptor proteins. Pathogens also secrete proteins capable of extracting iron from heme and iron transport proteins of the host (3Guerinot M.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 743-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar,5Otto B.R. Verweij-van A.M. MacLaren D.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 18: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and iron-dependent production of virulence factors has been observed in many bacteria (6Litwin C.M. Calderwood S.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Iron-dependent regulators (IdeRs)1 are metal-activated DNA-binding proteins found in Gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria. These proteins are transcriptional regulators of virulence factors as well as siderophore synthesis enzymes and their associated transport proteins (7Tai S.-P.S. Krafft A.E. Nootheti P. Holmes R.K. Microb. Pathog. 1990; 9: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the intracellular iron concentration is sufficiently high, transcription of virulence factors and iron import pathways is repressed by the binding of Fe(II)-IdeR complexes to the promoter/operator sequences for their genes (9Schmitt M.P. Twiddy E.M. Holmes R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7576-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 10Tao X. Boyd J. Murphy J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pathol. 1936; 17: 335-341Google Scholar) that iron availability regulates production of diphtheria toxin by Corynebacterium diphtheriae led to the discovery of the first iron-dependent regulator, the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR) (12Boyd J.M. Manish O.N. Murphy J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5968-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). DtxR, when in complex with Fe(II), represses transcription of the tox gene of corynebacteriophage β, which encodes diphtheria toxin, by binding to a target sequence within thetox operator (8Schmitt M.P. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Boyd J.M. Manish O.N. Murphy J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Domain 1 (residues 1–74) is the DNA binding domain and contains a helix-turn-helix motif. Domain 2 (residues 75–140) is the dimerization domain and contains most of the metal binding residues. Domain 3 (residues 141–226) appeared to have an SH3-like fold and to be connected to domain 2 by a flexible linker (19Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutational studies (20Ding X. Zeng H. Schiering N. Ringe D. Murphy J.R. Nat. Struct.

Holmes R.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Structures of metal-bound DtxR in complex with DNA in three distinct crystal forms (24White A. Ding X. vanderSpek J.C. Murphy J.R. Ringe D. Nature. 1998; 394: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10397-10407Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) revealed that each 19-base pair pseudo-palindromic operator sequence binds two dimers of DtxR. The complex of Co(II)-DtxR-DNA by Pohl et al. (25Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) revealed domain 3 in a new position in which it, quite surprisingly, contributes two metal ligands to metal site 1, providing the first example of a metal binding function for an SH3-like domain and implicating this domain in the metal-dependent repressor activation mechanism. The ideR gene from M. tuberculosis has been cloned (27Doukhan L. Predich M. Nair G. Dussurget O. Mandic-Mulec I. Cole S.T. Smith D.R. Smith I. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the IdeR protein, which shares ∼88% sequence identity to DtxR within the first 140 residues of this 230 residue protein, has been shown to be a functional homologue of DtxR. It regulates expression of β-galactosidase under control of thetox, IRP1, or IRP2 DtxR-specific promoter/operators in response to high and low iron conditions (28Schmitt M.P. Predich M. Doukhan L. Smith I. Holmes R.K. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4284-4289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown to regulate transcription of fxbA, a gene needed for exochelin synthesis in Mycobacterium smegmatis (29Dussurget O. Timm J. Gomez M. Gold B., Yu, S. Sabol S.Z. Holmes R.K. Jacobs W.T. Smith I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3402-3408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 2.6-Å structure of M. tuberculosis IdeR (30Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) revealed the first two domains and showed both metal sites fully occupied, but the intriguing third domain, which shares only ∼24% sequence identity with DtxR, was invisible. Here we present the 2.0-Å crystal structure of wild type M. tuberculosis IdeR in complex with Co(II). This structure contains, for the first time, domain 3 of IdeR and reveals its SH3-like fold and metal binding function. This is the most complete and highest resolution structure of an iron-dependent regulator to date in what we believe to be the fully active holorepressor conformation. Several features of the environments of the metal binding sites that were hinted at by previous work but remained questionable have been confirmed unambiguously. These features, which include several tightly bound water molecules and precise ordering of the N-terminal residues to form a γ turn centered at Val5, may be important in metal-dependent activation. Wild type M. tuberculosis IdeR was purified as described by Pohl et al. (30Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For crystallization the protein was concentrated to ∼8–10 mg/ml (as judged by the Bio-Rad protein assay) by evaporation in a Savant SpeedVac on low temperature and dialyzed thoroughly at 4 °C against a buffer containing only 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, using the microdialysis technique described by Overall (31Overall C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 165: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This procedure was adopted because a significant amount of the protein was lost upon concentration with membrane concentrators, apparently due to adhesion to the membrane. DNA used for crystallization was purchased from Macromolecular Resources as the reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography-purified, single-stranded oligonucleotides. Duplex oligonucleotides were formed by mixing equimolar volumes (as judged by absorption spectroscopy at 260 and 280 nm) of complementary oligonucleotide dissolved in 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and annealing by fully submerging in an 80 °C water bath, which was then allowed to cool gradually to room temperature. The homogeneity of the annealed duplexes was judged by capillary electrophoresis on a Bio-Rad BioFocus 3000. The oligonucleotide used for crystallization of IdeR was a blunt-ended 21-base pair duplex formed by annealing oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-ATTAGGTTAGCCTAACCTAAA-3′ and 3′-TAATCCAATCGGATTGGATTT-5′. IdeR and annealed DNA duplex were mixed in an approximate 3:1 molar ratio (∼0.3 mm IdeR monomer and ∼0.1 mmDNA) with 5 mm CoCl2 and incubated on ice for 30 min prior to use. Crystallization was performed at room temperature by hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of Co(II)-IdeR-DNA solution and precipitant solution on silanized coverslips over wells containing 500 μl of precipitant solution. Crystals were obtained from 2.0 m LiSO4, 0.01m MgCl2, 0.05 m MES, pH 5.6, and grew to a maximum size of ∼500 × 300 × 150 μm within 1–2 weeks. Analysis of the diffraction pattern revealed the crystals to be in space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 46.30, b = 113.97, and c = 236.21 Å. Initial diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 5.0.2 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on a Quantum 4 CCD detector at a wavelength of 1.0 Å. The data were reduced with Mosflm (Andrew G. W. Leslie, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology) and Scala (Phil Evans, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology) and converted to structure factors with Truncate (32French G.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1978; 34: 517-525Crossref Scopus (895) Google Scholar). A second diffraction data set was collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) beamline 19-ID at Argonne National Laboratory on the APS1 3 × 3 CCD detector at a wavelength of 1.0332 Å. These data were reduced at APS with HKL2000 (33Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, England1993: 56-63Google Scholar) and converted to structure factors with Truncate. The crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after immersion for ∼20 s in a cryoprotectant consisting of a 20% weight/volume solution of dl-threitol in the crystal mother liquor. Diffraction from these crystals was anisotropic. Analysis of the reduced intensities by the fall-off procedure (originally from the Groningen BIOMOL package) as implemented in Truncate showed the crystals to diffract most strongly along the crystallographic b axis and most weakly along the crystallographic a axis.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) with the ALS data set from 20.0 Å to 3.5 Å, using as a search model the Zn(II)-IdeR structure (30Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This dimeric structure contains only the first two domains (residues 4–140) of IdeR. AMoRe located two clear solutions. The first solution had an initial correlation coefficient (CC) of 15.8 and R-factor of 54.8%, which was improved to a CC of 38.4 and R-factor of 50.9% after rigid body refinement. Addition of the second solution gave a CC of 35.6 and R-factor of 48.5%, which improved to a CC of 43.6 and R-factor of 46.8% after rigid body refinement. These solutions represented the 21 helical packing arrangement of IdeR along the crystallographic aaxis, with an ∼40-Å wide solvent channel running through the center. This two-domain solution provided no crystal contacts along theb and c axes, suggesting that a significant portion of the model, presumably domain 3, was yet to be included. The initial two-domain solution was refined briefly by the conjugate direction method with TNT (35Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1987; 43: 489-503Crossref Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Each domain (residues 4–74 and 75–140) was restrained by the 4-fold improper noncrystallographic symmetry. Clear and unbiased density for domain 3 was then revealed by density modification and averaging; a combination of solvent flattening, histogram matching, and NCS averaging was performed with DM (36Cowtan K.D. Zhang K.Y. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) beginning with ςA-weighted (37Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) observed structure factors phased on the partially refined model. NCS averaged electron density maps were then calculated with FFT (Lyn F. Ten Eyck) and Maprot (38Stein P.E. Boodhoo A. Armstrong G.D. Cockle S.A. Klein M.H. Read R.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 45-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). These maps allowed residues 151–207 and 216–228 (∼30% of the total protein mass of IdeR) to be built de novo. This model for domain 3 packed perfectly into the unit cell to provide the missing contacts along the b and caxes of the unit cell. Examination of ςA-weighted F obs −F calc maps with Peakmax (Phil Evans) allowed placement of 13 apparent Co(II) atoms in the asymmetric unit. At this point refinement was continued with the APS data set, and NCS restraints were removed. Maximum Likelihood refinement with Refmac (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) was interspersed with rounds of model building with XtalView (40McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Several applications of the wARP protocol (41Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) were used to identify potential solvent molecules. A number of significant electron density features were noted that had a tetrahedral shape and an appropriate size to accommodate a sulfate or orthophosphate ion. Because the crystal mother liquor contained 2.0 m LiSO4, these peaks were modeled as sulfate ions. One of these sites, formed by Arg27 and Arg60, approximates the binding of a phosphoryl group of the DNA backbone as observed in the Co(II)-DtxR-DNA complex (25Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A total of 17 sulfate ions were included in the final model. R free decreased steadily as the model building and refinement progressed, and plots of log(ςA)versus resolution (37Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar) for the final model were linear from medium to the highest resolution. Val5, as discussed below, is a severe outlier in the Ramachandran plot for all four IdeR monomers. Arg60 is also a consistent but less severe outlier in the Ramachandran plot. This might be functionally significant because Arg60 is known to bind to a phosphoryl group of the DNA backbone in the DtxR-DNA complexes. Residues Ala148 and Asp149 of monomer A are also outliers in the Ramachandran plot. This, however, seems to be due to limitations of the data because these residues are in the linker region between domain 2 and domain 3, which has very poor electron density. Residues Asp147 and Asp148 of monomer A and residue Arg194 of monomers C and D were truncated to their Cβ atoms because of poor electron density. Final refinement statistics for the APS data set are presented in Table I. Solvent-accessible surface area calculations, superimpositions, and other coordinate analyses were performed with EDPBD (42Zhang X.-J. Matthews B.W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 624-630Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Figures were made with MOLSCRIPT (43Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (44Esnouf B. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar), RASTER3D (45Merritt Murphy Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar), and GRASP (46Nicholls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of wild type M. tuberculosis IdeR in complex with Co(II) has been solved at 2.0-Å resolution and refined to an R-factor of 21.4% with anR free of 27.2% and good geometry (TableI). The electron density is of excellent quality and reveals nearly the complete polypeptide chain for four 25-kDa IdeR monomers (designated as A, B, C, and D) in the asymmetric unit that form two functional dimers. As determined by PROCHECK (47Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 99.2% of peptide φ-ψ angles fall within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with 92.6% within the most favored regions (Fig.1). Val5 falls into a severely disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (φ = ∼75°, ψ = ∼−60°) in all four IdeR monomers. The electron density revealed that this residue participates in a γ turn (48Printz M.P. Nemethy G. Macromolecules. 1972; 5: 755-758Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar) from residues Leu4 to Asp6 (Fig.2). The implications of this unusual feature are discussed further below.Figure 2Stereo diagram of the electron density of the γ turn at Val5.

This domain, like domain 3 of DtxR determined by Qiu et al. (19Qiu X. Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12292-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and Pohl et al. (25Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), has an SH3-like fold with six β-strands and three α-helices. Superimposing 77 equivalent Cα atoms from domain 3 of IdeR monomer A and domain 3 of DtxR monomer 2 from the Co(II)-DtxR-DNA complex (25Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol.

The linker region (residues 141–150) between domain 2 and domain 3 is visible in one IdeR monomer, although the electron density is generally poor, but it is not discernible in the other three IdeR monomers. Domain 3 is positioned in the groove between domains 1 and 2 (Fig.4) and contributes two ligands, Glu172 and Gln175, to metal site 1. The interactions of domains 3 with domains 1 bury 307–357 Å2of solvent-accessible surface for domain 1 and 295–347 Å2for domain 3. The interactions of domains 3 with domains 2 bury 537–656 Å2 for domain 2 and 532–566 Å2 for domain 3. This interaction of domain 3 of IdeR with the other two domains is essentially identical to that of the “wedge” position of domain 3 of DtxR as observed in the Co(II)-DtxR-DNA complex (25Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As suggested by the range of buried surface areas reported above, the position of domain 3 is slightly different in each IdeR monomer. The Cα atoms for domains 1 and 2 (residues 1–140) were overlaid for each possible pair of monomers, and the orientation of the domains 3 were then compared. The difference in orientations is due to overall rotations of 3.0–7.3° with the Co(II) atom at metal site 1 acting as the approximate pivot point. Because all domains 3 are involved in crystal contacts, it is difficult to assess the significance of this observation. A similar analysis of domain 3 in the Co(II)-DtxR-DNA complex (25Pohl E. Holmes R.K. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 653-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), in which only one domain 3 is involved in a crystal contact, showed differences in relative orientation ranging from 1.1° to 8.0° (note that in this case three of the domains 3 are incomplete so only residues 168–187 and 215–226 could be used in the comparison). Taken together, these analyses indicate a certain degree of flexibility in the interactions of domain 3 with domains 1 and 2. The Co(II) atoms at metal sites 1 were identified in ςA-weighted (37Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The liganding atoms from each side chain form direct coordinate bonds to the Co(II) atom (TableII). Furthermore, there is no sixth ligand; the Co(II) atom at metal site 1 is pentavalently coordinated with distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry.

Limitations in oxygen have profound physiological and health consequences in humans. Prolonged or severe decreases in physiological oxygen resulting from ischemia are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in stroke and cardiac infarction (4Wilson J.D. Fauci A.S. Martin J.B. Kasper D.L. Braunwalk E. Isselbacher K.J. Hauser S.L. Longo D.L. Harrison's Principle of Internal Medicine. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1991: 2568Google Scholar). Cells in pretumorous growths are often deprived of oxygen as a result of insufficient and inefficient vascularization, and this hypoxia (low oxygen) is postulated to play a role in limiting tumor progression (5Green S.L. Giaccia A.J. Cancer J. Scientific American. 1998; 4: 218-223PubMed Google Scholar). The outcome of hypoxia can differ dramatically. For example, a turtle can survive months of hypoxic conditions, whereas the cells of the human brain begin to die following a few minutes of hypoxia (6Hochachka P.W. Buck L.T. Doll C.J. Land S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9493-9498Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). These outcomes presumably depend on the cellular responses to hypoxia, which range from metabolic adaptation to quiescence to apoptosis (1Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Among the cellular responses to hypoxia is an arrest of the cell cycle (1Guillemin K. Krasnow M.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar,5Green S.L. Giaccia A.J. Cancer J. Scientific American. 1998; 4: 218-223PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia is reported to arrest mammalian cells during G1, mid-S phase, and G2/M. Analysis of the response to hypoxia in Drosophila has similarly revealed an arrest of the cell cycle in mid-S phase and mitosis (2Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of these cellular responses, the signals mediating responses to hypoxia are ill defined, and the factors influencing the type of response are poorly understood. What allows some cells to survive when others die? In this study, we examined the responses to hypoxia duringDrosophila embryogenesis. The development ofDrosophila from egg to larva is remarkably fast and dynamic. Development begins with 13 rapid mitotic divisions in a common cytoplasm, referred to as the syncytial stage. Next, cell membranes invaginate and form around the nuclei, referred to as cellularization. Following cellularization, the germ layers are formed during gastrulation, the body plan is defined, and tissue types begin to form. Finally, about 24 h after fertilized oocyte deposition, the embryo hatches into a larva. The ability to survive hypoxia is likely to be an important adaptive mechanism in an organism whose eggs develop on rotting fruit where microbial proliferation can deplete oxygen. It was previously reported that Drosophila embryos progress from being sensitive to hypoxia to being remarkably resistant (2Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The early syncytial stage embryo is quite sensitive and can only survive a brief period of hypoxia. However, starting at about 2 h after cellularization, embryos survive almost complete anoxia. Cellularized, stage 9 embryos arrest upon depletion of oxygen, remain quiescent for a week, and successfully resume development upon restoration of oxygen. 1J. A. Wingrove and P. H. O'Farrell, unpublished observations. Recent work has suggested that the survival of Drosophilalarvae and older embryos during hypoxia involves active responses that induce widespread changes in behavior, cell cycle progression, and development (2Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H.

These responses appear to be governed, in part, by nitric oxide (3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). NO is a signaling molecule in mammals that contributes to neuronal signaling, the innate immune response, and regulation of blood vessel tone. In Drosophila, NO has also been shown to influence synaptogenesis during the development of the nervous system (8Truman J.W. De. Vente J. Ball E.E. Development. 1996; 122: 3949-3958PubMed Google Scholar), to negatively regulate the cell cycle during imaginal disc growth (9Kuzin B. Roberts I. Peunova N. Eni, Kolopov G. Cell. 1996; 87: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and to be involved with an S phase block and a change in larval behavior in response to hypoxia (3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). NO involvement in the response to hypoxia in Drosophila has parallels with one of its roles in vertebrates in which it induces vasodilation and increased blood flow in response to local limitations in oxygen (10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar). Exceptional features of the syncytial embryo such as the synchrony and speed of the nuclear divisions and the clear cytology provide an ideal system for characterization of the effect of hypoxia and NO on cell cycle progression. We examined the kinetics of the hypoxic arrest in real time, demonstrated a comparable arrest by NO, and characterized the reversal of these arrests at the level of metabolism, the cell cycle, and development. Rapid and reversible arrest of the nuclear divisions occurred at two stages: interphase and metaphase. The phenocopy of the hypoxia arrest by treatment with NO suggests a role for NO in the hypoxic response. Also, measurements of ATP levels and cyanide treatments of embryos reveal metabolic changes that could contribute to the cell cycle arrest in response to hypoxia. By following recovery after prolonged hypoxia, we showed that the failure of syncytial embryos to hatch after exposure to hypoxia was due to detrimental effects on development and did not reflect an inability of the embryo to recover metabolically or restore cell cycle progression. Sevelen was used as a wild-type stock. All embryo collections, fixations, and stainings were performed as described previously (11Su T.T. Sprenger F. DiGregorio P.J. Campbell S.D. O'Farrell P.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1495-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Ashburner, M. (ed) (1989) Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual, p. 434, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). ≥95% of the embryos in the collections were of the proper age with a contamination of other unfertilized or older stage embryos (data not shown). Fixed images were acquired using an upright fluorescent microscope (Leica DMRD). Hatching assays were performed by first washing treated embryos with a NaCl/Triton solution (0.7% NaCl, 0.03% Triton X-100). A known number of embryos were then placed on a grape juice agar plate, incubated for 24–30 h at 24 °C, and counted for the number of eggs that hatched into larvae. For all experiments, N2 and O2 gas was mixed to achieve desired oxygen levels. The mixture was humidified, and output oxygen was measured using an oxygen sensor (Reming Bioinstruments, model PROOX 110). Different stage embryos were collected, dechorionated with 50% bleach, and resuspended in an aerated NaCl/Triton solution. A phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)2 solution was perfused with mixed N2/O2 air at least 15 min prior to treatment to equilibrate the solution to desired oxygen concentrations. Embryos were made hypoxic by replacing the NaCl/Triton solution with deoxygenated PBS + 0.05% Triton X-100. For NO and cyanide treatments, 10 mm s-nitroacetylpenicillamine (SNAP) or 0.2% sodium cyanide in PBS was used. Embryos were then rocked in an Eppendorf tube containing the specified PBS solution while lightly blowing N2/O2 gas mixture into the Eppendorf tube to replace the oxygenated air (for hypoxia treatments only). To return to normoxic conditions, the deoxygenated PBS was replaced with the NaCl/Triton solution and rocked gently. Prolonged exposures to hypoxia were performed as described previously (3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Embryos were collected from a transgenic line expressing a fusion protein of histone 2A and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (13Clarkson M. Saint R. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Embryos were dechorionated with 50% bleach, aligned on a glass coverslip, and placed under halocarbon oil or PBS to prevent dehydration. The GFP fluorescent signal was visualized in real time using an Olympus IX-70 microscope, and images were recorded using Delta Vision Version 2.10 software (Applied Scientific, Inc.). While monitoring chromosome dynamics live, embryos were made hypoxic by blowing a stream of N2/O2 gas onto specific embryos through a Pasteur pipette. Embryos were treated with NO donors or CN− by removing the PBS solution and replacing it with 10 mm SNAP or 0.2% sodium cyanide dissolved in PBS. Embryonic extracts were made by resuspending 25–100 μl of embryos in 200–1000 μl of glycine buffer (O.2m glycine, 50 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) contained within a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The embryo/buffer solution was then sonicated on ice with 1 s pulses from a microtip of a Branson Sonifier (model 185). Extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 RPM (16,000 relative centrifugal force). The soluble supernatant was saved, and protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Extracts were diluted to 2 mg/ml in glycine buffer and boiled for 45 s to precipitate protein. After a 15-min centrifugation, supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes, diluted, and measured for ATP concentration (see below). The luciferase-luciferin assay for ATP levels was modified from a protocol provided with the luciferase-luciferin mix (Sigma catalog number L0633). Briefly, 20 μl of diluted extract with protein removed (see above) was mixed with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml luciferase-luciferin mix diluted in water. The mixture was placed in a small scintillation vial, and photon counts were measured using the “single-photon monitor” mode of a Beckman scintillation counter (model LS 1801). Amounts of ATP in extracts were calculated using a standard curve generated from known ATP standards. All data are represented as percentages of the “normoxic” control, which is a sample treated under similar conditions but kept under normal ambient oxygen conditions. All images and graphs were processed using Adobe Photoshop version 5.0 and Adobe Illustrator version 8.0. All graphs were plotted in Kaleidagraph version 3.0.5 (Abelbeck Software). Consistent with previous studies (2Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), syncytial embryos (1–2 h old) are considerably more sensitive than cellularized (7–8 h old) embryos to the hypoxia treatments used during this study (Fig.1). Older embryos in the original collection are sufficient to account for the low level of syncytial stage embryos (3 ± 1%) that survive 24 h of hypoxia. In contrast to this sensitivity of syncytial embryos, 82 ± 5% of cellularized embryos (7–8 h old) made hypoxic for 24 h survive to hatch into larvae (Fig. 1). The decline in hypoxia sensitivity begins as embryos pass two developmental milestones, cellularization, and the beginning of gastrulation (Refs. 2Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar and 3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar and data not shown). A transgenic line expressing a fusion protein of histone 2A and green fluorescent protein (referred to as His-GFP; Ref.13Clarkson M. Saint R. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was used to visualize chromosome condensation and movements. Visualization and imaging of embryos prior to hypoxia allowed precise staging of the cell cycle. Hypoxia was imposed without interruption of imaging by blowing a stream of gas (humidified nitrogen or air/nitrogen mixtures) on the embryos. This approach allowed us to determine how hypoxia influences individual events during mitosis and to define the detailed kinetics of arrest and release from hypoxia even over the short (7–8 min at 22 °C) time course of a normal mitosis (Fig.2). We limited observations to embryos beyond the ninth mitotic cycle because the behavior of the His-GFP severely limits the quality of the imaging at earlier stages. Fig. 2gives an example of a syncytial nuclear division from interphase through mitosis and into the following interphase. It is important to note that metaphase is short, lasting only 2–3 min (Fig. 2). The nuclei of embryos made hypoxic in prophase progressed at normal rates through prophase and prometaphase and achieved a normal alignment of the chromatin on the metaphase plate (Fig.3, A and B). However, progress to anaphase was blocked. The arrest in metaphase persisted for the duration of the hypoxic treatment (≤25 min). While blocked in metaphase, the nuclei adopted a hypercondensed morphology (Fig. 3, compare B and C). Upon restoration of oxygen, the nuclei delayed 2–8 min in metaphase and then exited mitosis with kinetics similar to controls. In contrast to a previous report (2Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), using real time observation we observed that the metaphase-anaphase transition is the only observed arrest point in mitosis. Nuclei made hypoxic in late metaphase/anaphase did not arrest in mitosis. However, progression through anaphase was slowed. Nonetheless, the nuclei reached telophase, the chromatin decondensed, and the nuclei took on an interphase-like morphology (data not shown). The metaphase arrest is not unique to the syncytial cycles. Analysis of the later stage, cellularized embryos (stages 8–12) showed that hypoxia induced an identical type of arrest at metaphase. The kinetics of the arrest and its reversal resembled that of the syncytial embryos (data not shown). As previously reported, hypoxia also causes interphase cells to arrest with an unusual nuclear morphology (2Foe V.E. Alberts B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We examined the kinetics of this response. Interphase cells made hypoxic did not progress into mitosis and remained in interphase (data not shown). The interphase nuclei increased in volume, and chromatin became hypercondensed within 2–3 min of hypoxia. Like the metaphase arrest, this arrest was reversed by restoration of oxygen. Control embryos gassed with ambient air did not arrest. Hypoxia blocked specific stages of the cell cycle, whereas other steps appeared normal or slowed. The specificity and reversibility of the arrest in metaphase suggest that the arrest behaves like a checkpoint. By observing the response to oxygen deprivation in live embryos, the specificity of the metaphase arrest in mitosis is more clearly illustrated. NO, which usually acts to signal between cells (10Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2138) Google Scholar), has been implicated in the S phase arrest in cellularized embryos and larvae (3Wingrove J.A. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We tested its effect on mitosis in the syncytial embryo. His-GFP embryos were treated with a NO producing agent, SNAP, in a saline solution while visualizing cell cycle stage as described above. Treatment of syncytial embryos with 10 mm SNAP caused a reversible arrest of interphase (data not shown) and metaphase (Fig.4) with similar kinetics and morphology to that seen with hypoxia. Fig. 4 shows an embryo treated with the NO donor, SNAP, as the nuclei entered prophase. Nuclei progressed normally into metaphase but remained blocked in metaphase for the duration of the SNAP exposure (10 min). The nuclei arrested in metaphase adopted a hypercondensed chromatin morphology similar to hypoxic arrested metaphase nuclei (Fig. 4 C). The effects of NO were reversible; nuclei exited mitosis normally within 3 min after removal of SNAP (Fig. 4 D). Similar effects in blocking the metaphase-anaphase transition were also observed in older, cellularized embryos exposed to NO donors (data not shown). The data show that NO can provoke an arrest of the cell cycle in the syncytial embryo that resembles the arrest caused by hypoxia. The possible role of NO as a mediator of the hypoxic response is presented under “Discussion.” We sought to determine whether the arrest of embryogenesis protects the embryo from a drop in ATP levels during hypoxia. Generally, oxidative phosphorylation uses molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor in the coupling of electron transport and the conversion of ADP into ATP. Pronounced reductions in oxygen levels should slow the generation of ATP, leading to a drop in ATP levels in the absence of compensating responses. Levels of ATP were monitored as a measure of the ability ofDrosophila embryos to accommodate reduced oxygen availability. Using a modification of a luciferase-based assay, total ATP levels were measured in embryonic cell extracts from different stage embryos under various treatment conditions. Syncytial (1–2 h old) and cellularized embryos (>3.5 h old) were made hypoxic with ≤0.1% O2 for different lengths of time, and total ATP levels were determined (Fig.5 A). ATP levels decreased within 5 min of treatment at all stages examined. However, a difference between the rates of ATP decline was observed between cellularized and syncytial stage embryos. In syncytial stage embryos, ATP levels dropped to 65 ± 4% of control embryos within 5 min and continued to decline to 38 ± 2% (Fig. 5 A) at 30 min of hypoxia (the minimal level observed is 29 ± 1%; see Fig. 7). In contrast, in cellularized, older embryos, ATP levels appeared to level off at 75% of controls within 15 min (Fig. 5 A) and did not further decline after prolonged hypoxic treatments of >90 min (data not shown). These results suggest that cellularized embryos are better equipped to metabolically adjust to hypoxia than syncytial embryos.Figure 7Recovery of ATP levels after prolonged hypoxia. ATP levels were assayed during recovery from prolonged, lethal exposures to hypoxia. Syncytial embryos were exposed to <0.1% O2 for 13.5 h and then transferred to an oxygenated saline solution to recover for 3 h. ATP levels were assayed immediately after the hypoxic exposure (left column) and after the 3 h recovery (right column). ATP levels declined to 29 ± 1% after 13.5 h of hypoxia and recovered to 93 ± 6% of controls 3 h after reoxygenation.

It remains possible that a decline in ATP levels arrests syncytial embryos, whereas a distinct mechanism mediates the similar metaphase arrest of the later stage embryos. If the decrease in ATP levels caused the cell cycle and developmental arrest of syncytial embryos, the decline in ATP levels and the responses ought to be tightly correlated during this stage. To test whether there is a correlation in ATP levels and the observed effects of hypoxia, we compared the threshold in oxygen concentrations at which responses (cell cycle and developmental arrests) are triggered to concentrations that cause ATP decline in syncytial embryos. Treatment of syncytial embryos with 2% O2, failed to arrest the cell cycle or development, and survival was not decreased. Conversely, exposure to 1% O2 arrested the cell cycle and development at all stages tested (data not shown). Likewise, embryonic and larval survival was decreased. Thus, a transition in response to oxygen deprivation occurred between 1 and 2% O2. ATP levels were determined for embryos exposed to different O2levels. ATP levels declined in response to <0.1 and 1% but not to 2% O2 treatments (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest a parallel between the oxygen requirements for sustaining ATP levels and for continued development and cell cycle progression in the syncytial embryo. However, a more detailed analysis of the correlation would be necessary to examine the parallel in the rates of the decline of ATP and the timing of the metaphase block at different O2concentrations. At the level of the present analysis, the correlation is unclear. That is, at 5 min after imposition of hypoxia, the ATP levels declined about 12% in 1% O2, whereas the drop was 35% in <0.1% O2, yet both of these treatments resulted in a metaphase arrest. However, our ability to score a difference between the rate at which nuclei arrest is limited. Metaphase arrest is observed about 4 min after the beginning of the hypoxic treatment. We do not know when during the 4 min between the imposition of hypoxia and the metaphase block, oxygen concentration is sensed and elicits an arrest. We can, however, conclude that if the decline in ATP mediates the response to oxygen, cells would have to respond to a remarkably small decline in ATP (i.e. considerably less than the 12% decline seen at 5 min). The kinetics of ATP recovery was assayed after 30 min of <0.1% O2 treatment (Fig. 5 C). ATP levels quickly (within 5 min) recovered to maximal levels. ATP levels are fully recovered by the time cell cycle progression is renewed. These data cannot discount the possibility that the restoration of ATP levels is responsible for the reversal of the arrest (see “Discussion”). Because ATP declines in response to hypoxia, a failure to maintain ATP levels (and other metabolites) could contribute directly or indirectly to the hypoxic responses (i.e. cell cycle arrest). Results from a previous study have shown that treatment of syncytial embryos with dinitrophenol caused a mitotic arrest, among other effects (7Zalokar M. Erk I. J. Microscop. Biol. Cell. 1976; 25: 97-107Google Scholar). To test whether an inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of hypoxia is sufficient to arrest the syncytial nuclear divisions, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, CN−, was used to decrease ATP levels. Cyanide was titrated to a concentration that effectively reduced ATP levels with similar kinetics to that of hypoxia (Fig.6). Dechorionated embryos treated with 0.02% CN− were assayed for ATP levels compared with control, untreated embryos. With 0.02% CN− treatment, ATP levels declined with similar kinetics to hypoxia (56% for CN− to 52% for hypoxia after 15 min of treatment; Figs. 5and 6). Using the His-GFP syncytial embryos, the effect of CN− treatment on the syncytial nuclear divisions was determined. As in the case of hypoxia and NO addition, administering 0.02% CN− at prophase and interphase blocked the nuclear divisions in metaphase and interphase, respectively. Hence, inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation in the absence of hypoxia is sufficient to arrest the cell cycle. The reversibility was not tested because CN− is an irreversible inhibitor. In summary, hypoxia, NO, and inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation are each sufficient to arrest the syncytial nuclear division in interphase and metaphase. It was also shown that hypoxia and CN− cause a decline in ATP levels. Treatment of syncytial stage embryos with the NO donor, SNAP also caused a decline in ATP, but the decline was delayed (Fig. 6). There was an approximately 5–10-min lag before the decline in ATP levels. Because the arrest of the cell cycle by NO occurs within a minute, there is discordance between ATP decline and the biological response upon treatment with the NO donor. This disparity suggests that NO has an ATP-independent mode of controlling cell cycle progress (see “Discussion”). As shown above, normal cell cycle, development and ATP levels are rapidly restored following short, sublethal exposures to hypoxia. We examined these same parameters after prolonged hypoxia to investigate the basis for the unique vulnerability of syncytial embryos exposed to hypoxia. Fig. 1 shows that 13.5- and 24-h exposures to <0.1% O2 reduce the survival of syncytial stage embryos to 23 ± 1% and 3 ± 1% of control embryos, respectively. The same treatments do not significantly reduce the survival of older embryos. To assay the recovery of ATP metabolism after a lethal exposure to hypoxia, syncytial embryos were made hypoxic for 13.5 h and shifted to an oxygenated saline solution for 3 h. ATP levels dropped to 29 ± 1% of control embryos after 13.5 h of hypoxia but returned to 93 ± 6% of the normoxic controls within 3 h of oxygen restoration (Fig. 7). Similar results were observed with 24-h hypoxic treatments of syncytial embryos (data not shown). We conclude that ATP levels recover rapidly following hypoxia and that a persistent failure of ATP metabolism does not contribute to the embryonic lethality of prolonged hypoxia. To test for restoration of cell cycle progression following prolonged hypoxia, syncytial embryos were made hypoxic for 13.5 h, returned to normoxic conditions for 3 h, and then fixed"

The latter process occurs by essentially the same mechanism. CDT has been extensively studied in a variety of conjugative plasmids and transposons, and details surrounding the biochemistry and regulation of this process are emerging (for reviews see Refs. 1Ippen-Ihler K.

ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 2377-2401Google Scholar). Conjugation begins with the formation of a stable mating pair between a donor cell and a recipient cell. In response to a “mating signal” that remains to be defined, DNA strand transfer is initiated from a site- and strand-specific nick within the plasmid oriT (origin oftransfer). A single strand of DNA is then passed into the recipient cell with an overall 5′ to 3′ polarity and is stabilized in the recipient by one of two mechanisms (i) circularization and second strand synthesis or (ii) recombination into the recipient genome. Molecular details surrounding the initiation of strand transfer are coming to light in several systems including the Escherichia coli F plasmid. In the F plasmid system a specific nucleoprotein complex, so far known to consist of the F-encoded proteins TraY and TraI and the host encoded integration host factor (5Nelson W. Howard M. Sherman J.

TraI is a key player in the initiation of CDT, and two distinct biochemical activities intrinsic to TraI are believed to be relevant to its biological role. One, a DNA transesterase activity, is characterized by the ability of the protein to introduce a sequence- and strand-specific nick at the F plasmid oriT (15Matson S. Morton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16232-16237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reygers U. Wessel R. Muller H. Hoffman-Berling H.

Matson, unpublished results.2D. R. N. Byrd and S. W. Matson, unpublished results. TraI is also a nucleoside 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis-dependent 5′ to 3′ DNA helicase (18Abdel-Monem A. Durwald H. Hoffmann-Berling H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Lahue E. Matson S. J. Biol.

Both regions of TraI have similarities in their primary structure to other transesterases and helicases (2Frost L. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gorbalenya A. Koonin E. Donchenko A. Blinov V.

The transesterase activity makes TraI indispensable for DNA transfer because formation of the sequence- and strand-specific nick is a required first step in strand transfer and is a plasmid-specific function. Interestingly, the overwhelming majority of CDT initiator transesterases do not contain identifiable helicase motifs nor do they exhibit helicase activity (for review see Ref. 24Byrd D. Matson S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, TraI is believed to use its helicase activity to catalyze F plasmid unwinding concomitant with DNA transfer, thus providing the force required to drive a single strand of DNA from the donor to the recipient bacterium (14Abdel-Monem M. Taucher-Scholz G. Klinkert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4659-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This notion is based on the following lines of reasoning: (i) to transfer only one strand of the duplex plasmid unwinding is a mechanistic requirement, (ii) TraI physically interacts with the transferred (T)-strand and is required for transfer, and (iii) the 5′ to 3′ polarity of the TraI helicase activity is consistent with the observed polarity of strand transfer (31Ohki M. Tomizawa J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1968; 33: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Rupp W. Ihler G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1968; 33: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In plasmid systems harboring a CDT initiator transesterase without helicase activity, this role is presumably filled via the recruitment of either a host- or plasmid-encoded helicase. Alternatively, strand displacement synthesis catalyzed by a DNA polymerase concomitant with DNA transfer could provide the ssDNA that is transferred to the recipient. Thus, there is neither precedent nor direct evidence demonstrating a requirement for the helicase activity of TraI in CDT. To investigate the role of the TraI helicase activity in CDT, we made several traI mutants and evaluated their function in DNA transfer using genetic and biochemical methods. A traIdeletion/insertion strain was transfer-defective as expected. AtraI C-terminal deletion that removed the helicase-associated motifs was also transfer-defective despite the fact that the region of traI encoding the transesterase activity was intact. Biochemical studies demonstrated that the N-terminal 954 residues of TraI were sufficient to catalyzeoriT-dependent transesterase activity in vitro, comparable with that of native TraI. Thus, a functional transesterase was not sufficient to support CDT. Finally, a point mutant, TraI-K998M, that lacked detectable helicase activity and had only minimal DNA-dependent ATPase activity was characterized. This protein catalyzedoriT-dependent transesterase activity in vitro and in vivo but failed to complement atraI deletion strain in conjugative DNA transfer assays.

Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 783-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and moved to other strains by transformation. Overexpression of the traI alleles cloned into pET11d (Novagen, Madison, WI) was in HMS174(DE3). Donor strains for mating experiments were constructed by transforming HMS174(DE3) with the appropriate pOX38T derivative and, where indicated, the appropriate pET11d-traI allele.

Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.1-A.3Google Scholar). LB was supplemented with 1.5% agar for plates. Medium was supplemented with antibiotics, as appropriate, at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; tetracycline, 12 μg/ml; streptomycin, 30 μg/ml; kanamycin, 30 μg/ml; and chloramphenicol, 20 μg/ml. The liquid mating assay protocol was as follows. Donor and recipient strains were diluted 1:50 into LB from saturated overnight cultures grown under selection and allowed to grow to mid or late log phase in the absence of selection at 37 °C. Donors and recipients were then mixed at a volume ratio of one donor to nine recipients and incubated at 37 °C. After 5 min, the mating mixtures were diluted 1:10 into LB and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. The mating mixtures were then vigorously vortexed to disrupt mating pairs and 10-fold serial dilutions were prepared at room temperature in phosphate buffered saline. Appropriate dilutions were plated onto LB agar containing streptomycin and tetracycline to counter-select donors and unmated recipients while selecting for transconjugants. Aliquots of the unmated donor and recipient cultures were subjected to 10-fold serial dilution into phosphate buffered saline and plated onto LB agar containing the appropriate antibiotics to determine the viable donor cell count and the viable recipient cell count. Mating frequency was calculated as the number of transconjugants/100 viable donor cells. The traI gene was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Vent DNA polymerase using primers 049 and 050 (gift of Dr. Michael T. Howard, University of Utah) and pMP8 (35Panicker M. The Role of the traD Gene Product in F Sex Factor-mediated Conjugation in Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis. Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA1985Google Scholar) as the template. The primers containBamHI sites that were used to clone the PCR product into the unique BamHI site of the Litmus28 phagemid (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). This plasmid was designated L28traI. The traI gene was sequenced to ensure the absence of PCR-generated mutations. L28traI was modified to replace a portion of the traI gene with a kanamycin resistance gene. The central portion of thetraI coding region was removed by digestion withSphI and BsrGI, and the remainder of the plasmid (having 496 bp of 5′ and 938 bp of 3′ traI sequence) was gel purified. The kanamycin resistance gene (kan R) from pACYC177 was cloned into a hybrid polylinker derived from pLit28 and pLit38. This allowed for the generation of a DNA fragment containing kan R and having overhangs compatible with SphI and BsrGI. The appropriate DNA fragment was gel purified and ligated to the traI remnant to produce a plasmid in which the direction of transcription of thekan R gene was the same as that oftraI. A representative clone was selected on LB plates containing kanamycin, characterized by restriction mapping, and designated ptraIK. The ptraIK construct was used to disrupt the traI locus on the F derivative pOX38T (the “T” denotes tetracycline resistance) (gift of Dr. Elisebeth Raleigh, New England Biolabs) by the following procedure. First, pOX38T was introduced into JC7623 by transformation. Several colonies were selected and screened for a transfer proficient phenotype, and a representative isolate was designated DB4 (Table I). ABamHI fragment of ptraIK containing the disruptedtraI gene was transformed into DB4. Transformants harboring the disrupted traI gene were selected on LB agar containing kanamycin and tetracycline. Deletion/insertion at the traIlocus was confirmed by restriction mapping and Southern blot analysis of the pOX38T derivative (data not shown). The new pOX38T derivative was designated pOX38TΔtraI::kan, and the JC7623 derivative strain that harbored it was designated DB5. The intact traI gene was initially subcloned from L28traI into pET11d using the BamHI sites resident on each plasmid. This resulted in two ribosome binding sites upstream oftraI, one site from pET11d and the native traIribosome binding site. The pET11d ribosome binding site was deleted using the flanking XbaI and NheI sites. This construct was designated pET11d-traI. A unique KpnI/Acc651 site was introduced into thetraI gene in pET11d-traI at codon 955. This was done by PCR with Vent DNA polymerase using pMP8 as the template, primers 049 and 054 to amplify the first 2865 bp of the gene, and primers 050 and 055 to amplify the last 2406 bp of the gene. The two PCR products were digested with KpnI and ligated. As expected, ligation resulted in three products: a 5730-bp product and a 4812-bp product that were head to head ligations of the 5′ and 3′ halves of the gene, respectively, and the desired 5271-bp product. The latter was gel purified, digested with BamHI, and cloned into the uniqueBamHI site of pET11d. The KpnI/Acc651 site was used to create a C-terminal deletion of the TraI protein. The construct described above was digested with Acc651 andBsrGI, which leaves 2865 bp of 5′ and 938 bp of 3′traI sequence. The ligation of these compatible cohesive ends brings a TAA stop codon into frame two codons after codon 955 and, therefore, eliminates expression of the C-terminal region (residues 955–1756), which includes the helicase-associated motifs. This construct was designated pET11d-traIN956. To make the pOX38TtraIΔC deletion, the Acc651 andBsrGI sites in L28traI were used to replace most of thetraI C-terminal coding region, including the entire region encoding the helicase-associated motifs, with a kanamycin resistance marker. This plasmid was designated L28traIΔCK. The disruptedtraI gene in L28traIΔCK was amplified with primers 049 and 050 and transformed into DB4. The traIΔC disruption in pOX38T was assessed in the same manner as outlined above for pOX38TΔtraI. The plasmid was designated pOX38TtraIΔC, and the resulting derivative strain was designated DB6. pOX38T, pOX38TΔtraI, and pOX38TtraIΔC were introduced into HMS174(DE3) by transformation and the resulting strains were designated DB10, DB11, and DB20, respectively (Table I). The plasmid pBSoriT was described previously (15Matson S. Morton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16232-16237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pACYCoriT is a derivative of pLysE (Novagen) containing the F plasmid oriTregion. It was constructed by cloning the 932-bp PvuII fragment from pBSoriT into pLysE cleaved with EcoRV. The construction was confirmed by restriction digest analysis. pET11d-traIK998M is a derivative of pET11d-traI with a point mutation at codon 998 that changes the conserved lysine in helicase motif I to methionine. This mutation was made by PCR using primers K998M and K998WT (Table II) as described previously (36Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith,J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,Vol. 1, pp. 8.5.5-8.5.7, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). ThetraI-K998M gene was sequenced to confirm the K998M mutation and to ensure the absence of other mutations. One liter of HMS174(DE3) harboring pET11d-traIN956 was grown to an A 600 of 0.7, and isopropyl-thio-B-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce protein expression. Following a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, ∼8 g of cells were recovered by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. The cell paste was suspended in 32 ml of cold lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 7.5% sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmphenylmethane-sulfonyl fluoride). Lysozyme was added to 0.3 mg/ml, Brij-35 was added to 0.4%, and the preparation was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. The lysate was sonicated to reduce viscosity and centrifuged for 60 min at 27,000 × g. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the clarified supernatant to 60% saturation, and the resulting precipitate was recovered by centrifugation for 60 min at 27,000 × g. The pellet was suspended in 5 ml of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) and dialyzed against 200 volumes of Buffer B containing 200 mm NaCl. This was designated Fraction II. Fraction II was applied to a 10-ml heparin-agarose (Sigma) column (cross-sectional area, 0.79 cm2) equilibrated in Buffer B + 0.2 m NaCl, and the column was washed to baseline as judged by Bradford protein assay. A 10 column volume NaCl gradient from 0.2 to 0.8 m in Buffer B was used to develop the column. The elution of TraIN956 was followed by Western blot using antibodies raised against purified TraI. The protein eluted between 0.37 and 0.44m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and designated Fraction III. Fraction III was assayed for oriT-dependent transesterase activity as described below. In addition to a pronouncedoriT-specific transesterase activity, a second activity consistent with a type II topoisomerase was evident, irrespective of the presence of oriT. This activity could be mitigated with heat treatment (70 °C for 5 min) with no apparent reduction in theoriT-specific nicking activity. The contaminating activity could also be removed by further purification. Fraction III was applied to a 10-ml phosphocellulose column (cross-sectional area, 0.79 cm2). A 10-column volume NaCl gradient from 0.1 to 0.7 m was used to develop the column. TraIN956 eluted over a range from 0.2 to 0.45 m NaCl. The purity of these fractions was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Faster migrating species, evident by Coomassie staining, strongly cross-reacted with polyclonal antibody raised to TraI, suggesting that they were derived from proteolysis of the 956-amino acid species. The peak fractions were pooled, quantified by Bradford protein assay, and used to assess theoriT-specific nicking activity of the N-terminal 956 residues of TraI. TraI-K998M was purified using TraI purification procedure described previously (19Lahue E. Matson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3208-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A partial duplex helicase substrate was made essentially as described (37Matson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10169-10175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 91-base oligonucleotide was annealed to its complementary sequence on purified M13mp6 ssDNA at a 1:1 molar ratio. The partial duplex DNA was 3′ end-labeled using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the substrate was further purified on a Biogel A5M column. The void volume fractions were pooled, ethanol precipitated, and suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA to a final concentration of ∼5 fmol/μl. DNA unwinding reaction mixtures (typically 20 μl) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 fmol of DNA substrate, and 2 mm ATP. Reaction mixtures were assembled at room temperature, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme. Incubations were at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction mixtures were quenched by the addition of EDTA to 25 mm and SDS to 1%. Reaction products were resolved from the substrate on an 8% (20:1 cross-linking) native polyacrylamide gel. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) were identical with those used for helicase assays with the following exceptions: 15 pmol [α-32P]ATP was added to each reaction mixture (final concentration of ATP, 2 mm) that contained 0.75 μg of M13mp6 ssDNA instead of the partial duplex helicase substrate. Reactions were assembled at room temperature and initiated by the addition of enzyme. Incubations were at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 85 mm. 4 μl was spotted onto a cellulose polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography plate (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) and allowed to dry, and the plates were developed with a mobile phase consisting of 1.0 m formic acid and 0.8m LiCl. The plates were allowed to dry, and the degree of ATP hydrolysis was quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Assays were done in a manner slightly modified from those described previously (15Matson S. Morton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16232-16237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the protein (usually present at 50–60 nm), a typical reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 6 nm pBSoriT DNA (either supercoiled or covalently closed circular), 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, and 15% glycerol. Reactions were assembled at room temperature and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and SDS to final concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 0.25%, respectively, and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for an additional 20 min. The products were resolved on 0.8% agarose gels in the absence (in the case of sc-pBSoriT), or presence (in the case of ccc-pBSoriT) of ethidium bromide, followed by staining and/or destaining, as required to visualize the results. For quantification of the transesterase reaction catalyzed by TraI and TraI-K998M, pBSoriT was digested withXbaI to linearize the plasmid, and known amounts of plasmid DNA were loaded on the agarose gel to produce a standard curve. The fluorescence of the nicked DNA species was compared with the fluorescence of the standard curve to determine the amount of DNA that was nicked using an Eagle Eye imaging system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Reaction conditions were the same as for the dupl"
https://openalex.org/W2049373010,"The ability of DNA gyrase (Gyr) to wrap the DNA strand around itself allows Gyr to introduce negative supercoils into DNA molecules. It has been demonstrated that the deletion of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of the GyrA subunit abolishes the ability of Gyr to wrap the DNA strand and catalyze the supercoiling reaction (Kampranis, S. C., and Maxwell, A. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 14416–14421). By using this mutant Gyr, Gyr (A59), we have studied effects of Gyr-mediated wrapping of the DNA strand on its replicative function and its interaction with the quinolone antibacterial drugs. We find that Gyr (A59) can support oriC DNA replication in vitro. However, Gyr (A59)-catalyzed decatenation activity is not efficient enough to complete the decatenation of replicating daughter DNA molecules. As is the case with topoisomerase IV, the active cleavage and reunion activity of Gyr is required for the formation of the ternary complex that can arrest replication fork progression in vitro. Although the quinolone drugs stimulate the covalent Gyr (A59)-DNA complex formation, the Gyr (A59)-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes do not arrest the progression of replication forks. Thus, the quinolone-induced covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex formation is necessary but not sufficient to cause the inhibition of DNA replication. We also assess the stability of ternary complexes formed with Gyr (A59), the wild type Gyr, or topoisomerase IV. The ternary complexes formed with Gyr (A59) are more sensitive to salt than those formed with either the wild type Gyr or topoisomerase IV. Furthermore, a competition experiment demonstrates that the ternary complexes formed with Gyr (A59) readily disassociate from the DNA, whereas the ternary complexes formed with either the wild type Gyr or topoisomerase IV remain stably bound. Thus, Gyr-mediated wrapping of the DNA strand is required for the formation of the stable Gyr-quinolone-DNA ternary complex that can arrest replication fork progression.

DNA gyrase double-strand break dithiothreitol early replicative intermediates nicked or gapped DNA molecule(s) late replicative intermediates norfloxacin topoisomerase Topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that alter the linking number of DNA. As such, they play essential roles in every aspect of DNA metabolism (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Type II topoisomerases are well conserved throughout the evolution and form a large protein family. DNA gyrase (Gyr)1 is unique among the type II topoisomerases. Gyr wraps the DNA strand around itself when it binds to the DNA, and this unique mode of DNA binding allows Gyr to introduce the negative supercoils into DNA molecules (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Kampranis and Maxwell (2Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that Gyr can be converted into a conventional type II topoisomerase by deleting the C terminal of the DNA binding domain of the GyrA subunit. This mutant Gyr, Gyr (A59), no longer wraps the DNA strand around itself and cannot catalyze the supercoiling reaction. However, Gyr (A59) is still capable of catalyzing decatenation and relaxation reactions. In addition, Gyr (A59) can partially complement the phenotype of aparC ts mutant (2Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is suggested that Gyr (A59) could substitute for the cellular function of topoisomerase IV (Topo IV). Topoisomerases are the cellular targets for clinically important antibacterial and anticancer drugs (3Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 191-218Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 5Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). These topoisomerase inhibitors convert topoisomerases into poisons by trapping the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex (also called the “cleavable complex”) as a topoisomerase-drug-DNA ternary complex. In the ternary complex, the DNA helix is broken, and the topoisomerase bridge maintains the linear integrity of the DNA. Although the ternary complex formation is critical for the cytotoxicity of these topoisomerase inhibitors, ternary complexes are normally reversible. It has been proposed that an active DNA transaction, such as the passage of replication forks, is required for the disruption of ternary complexes and the generation of nonreversible, cytotoxic DNA lesions (3Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 191-218Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

We have studied the molecular events during the collision between a replication fork and a Topo IV-norfloxacin (Norf)-DNA ternary complexin vitro, using the oriC replication system reconstituted with purified proteins (6Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The active strand cleavage and reunion activity of Topo IV are required for the formation of the ternary complex that can arrest replication fork progression. Interestingly, the collision between a replication fork and a Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complex converts the ternary complex to a nonreversible form but does not generate a double-strand break (DSB). An additional step is required for the generation of DSBs. Thus, the cytotoxicity associated with this class of topoisomerase inhibitors results from a two-step process as follows: the conversion of a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex to a nonreversible form and the generation of a DSB by subsequent denaturation of the topoisomerase in the dead-end complex (6Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To investigate further the molecular mechanism of replication fork arrest by the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex, we modeled the collision between a replication fork and a Gyr-Norf-DNA ternary complex, using the wild type and two mutant Gyr proteins, Gyr (A59) and Gyr (A, Y122F). Gyr (A59) cannot wrap the DNA strand around itself (2Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and Gyr (A, Y122F) is a catalytically inactive mutant. Norf stimulated both the wild type Gyr- and Gyr (A59)-catalyzed DNA cleavages. No DNA cleavage was detected when Gyr (A, Y122F) was used. The ternary complexes formed with either Gyr (A, Y122F) or Gyr (A59) did not block the progression of replication forks in vitro. These results demonstrated that the formation of the quinolone-induced covalent Gyr-DNA complex was necessary but not sufficient to arrest the replication fork progression. We also assessed the stability of ternary complexes formed with either Gyr (A59), the wild type Gyr, or Topo IV. We found that Gyr (A59)-Norf-DNA ternary complexes were more sensitive to salt than Gyr-Norf-DNA and Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes. A competition experiment showed that the Gyr (A59)-Norf-DNA ternary complexes readily disassociated from the DNA, whereas both Gyr-Norf-DNA and Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes remained stably bound. These results demonstrated that the ternary complexes formed with Gyr (A59) were less stable than those formed with either the wild type Gyr or Topo IV. Thus, Gyr-mediated wrapping of the DNA strand was required for the formation of stable Gyr-quinolone-DNA ternary complexes that could arrest the progression of replication forks. These results indicated that the stability of the topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex might determine if the collision between a replication fork and a topoisomerase-quinolone-DNA ternary complex would result in the inhibition of DNA replication. Escherichia coli DNA replication proteins, generous gifts of Kenneth Marians (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), were as described previously (7Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14649-14658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, after the chromatography on Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and DEAE-cellulose DE52 (Whatman), the protein fraction was loaded onto a Superose 6 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (4 °C), 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, and 500 mm NaCl). The peak of the 59-kDa protein was pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (4 °C), 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, and 100 mm NaCl). This final preparation of GyrA(59) was greater than 95% homogeneous for a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The active site Tyr of the GyrA subunit was replaced with Phe by the site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gyrA gene using the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction technique. 2H. Hiasa, D. O. Yousef, and K. J. Marians, unpublished results. The GyrA (Y122F) protein was overexpressed and purified according to the same protocol used for the purification of GyrA(59). The final preparation of GyrA (Y122F) was greater than 95% homogeneous for a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). GyrA(59) and GyrA (Y122F) were mixed with the wild type GyrB to reconstitute Gyr (A59) and Gyr (A, Y122F), respectively. The wild type Gyr was also prepared by mixing the wild type GyrA and GyrB proteins. Two types of oriC plasmids, pBROTB535 type I (11Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures (12.5 μl) containing theoriC plasmid pBROTB535 type I DNA, DnaA, DnaB, DnaC, DnaG, HU protein, single-stranded DNA-binding protein, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and topoisomerase were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After terminating the reaction by adding EDTA to 25 mm, nucleotide incorporation was measured, and the replication products were analyzed by the native agarose gel electrophoresis as described by Hiasa and Marians (11Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Any changes in the reaction conditions are indicated in the figure legends. The modified pulse-chase protocol was performed, using pBROTB535 type I DNA as the DNA template, as described previously (6Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

Any changes in the reaction conditions are indicated in the figure legends. pBROTB353 type I DNA was linearized by digesting with the EcoRI restriction endonuclease and 3′-end-labeled by incorporation of 2 residues of [32P]dAMP with Klenow enzyme. This 3′-end-labeled linear plasmid DNA was used as a substrate. Standard reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 40 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgOAc2, 10 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmATP, 20 fmol (as molecule) of 32P-labeled linear pBROTB353 type I DNA, the indicated concentrations of Norf, and the indicated amounts of either the wild type or a mutant Gyr were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. SDS was added to 1% to terminate the reactions, and the reaction mixtures were further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. EDTA and proteinase K were then added to 25 mm and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified by extraction of the reaction mixtures with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and then analyzed by electrophoresis through vertical 1% agarose (Seakem ME, FMC) gels (14 × 10 × 0.3 cm) at 4 V/cm for 4 h or at 2 V/cm for 8 h in a running buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9 at 23 °C), 40 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA (TAE). Gels were dried under vacuum onto GR3 papers (Whatman) and autoradiographed with Hyperfilm MP films (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amounts of cleaved DNA were quantitated by scanning images by a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Reaction mixtures were assembled as described in the previous section, and 300 fmol (as tetramer) of Gyr, Gyr (A59), or Topo IV was bound to 20 fmol (as molecule) of 32P-labeled linear pBROTB353 type I DNA in the presence of 100 μm Norf during the first stage of incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, various concentrations of NaCl were added to the reaction mixtures, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS to 1% and incubating at 37 °C for 5 min. EDTA and proteinase K were added to a final concentration of 25 mm and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was further continued at 37 °C for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified and analyzed as described in the previous section. Reaction mixtures (120 μl) containing 40 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgOAc2, 10 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mmATP, 120 fmol (as molecule) of 32P-labeled linear pBROTB353 type I DNA, 1.2 pmol (as tetramer) of the wild type Gyr, Gyr (A59), or Topo IV and 100 μm Norf were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. A cold competitor, 9.6 μg (2.4 pmol as molecule) of pBROTB353 type I DNA, was added to the reaction mixtures, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. Portions (18 μl each) of the reaction mixtures were withdrawn at indicated times, and SDS was added to 1% to terminate the reactions. The reaction mixtures were further incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. EDTA and proteinase K were then added to 25 mm and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The DNA products were purified and then analyzed as described in the previous section. The ability of Gyr to introduce negative superhelicity into DNA molecules distinguishes this enzyme from other topoisomerases (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that Gyr can be converted into a conventional type II topoisomerase, an enzyme similar to Topo IV, by deleting the C terminus of the DNA binding domain of the GyrA subunit (2Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14416-14421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This mutant protein, Gyr (A59), unlike the wild type Gyr, does not wrap the DNA strand and cannot catalyze the supercoiling reaction. By using our preparations of the wild type Gyr and Gyr (A59), we assessed biochemical activities of these enzymes. Gyr (A59) could catalyze decatenation and relaxation reactions, but no supercoiling activity was detected. The specific activity of Gyr (A59) was identical to that of the wild type Gyr when the decatenation activity of these enzymes was measured using kinetoplast DNA as a substrate (data not shown). Here, we investigated effects of Gyr-mediated wrapping of the DNA strand on its functional activities during DNA replication and its interaction with the quinolone antibacterial drugs. Gyr (A59) Can Support Nascent Chain Elongation, but Not Decatenation of Replicating Daughter DNA Molecules, during oriC DNA Replication in Vitro—The wild type Gyr is incapable of decatenating replicating daughter DNA molecules (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the oriCreplication system reconstituted with purified proteins, little monomer product is generated when only Gyr is present as a topoisomerase. Topoisomerase III or Topo IV is required for the production of the final monomer product (15Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

We assessed the decatenation activity of Gyr (A59) during oriCDNA replication in vitro. Standard oriC replication reactions were incubated in the presence of the various amounts of either Gyr (A59) or Topo IV, in addition to a constant amount of the wild type Gyr, and then the DNA products were analyzed by native agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A). In the presence of Gyr alone, the majority of the replication products were late replicative intermediates (LRI) and multiply linked form II-form II DNA dimers (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). The addition of Topo IV resulted in the accumulation of form II DNA molecules (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6 and7). In contrast, the addition of Gyr (A59) did not change the pattern of the replication products (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–5), although the linking number of DNA dimers was reduced when Gyr (A59) was present at high concentrations. These results showed that the decatenation activity of Gyr (A59) was not efficient enough to complete the decatenation of replicating daughter DNA molecules and produce the final monomer product. We further examined if Gyr (A59) alone could support oriCDNA replication. Standard oriC replication reactions were incubated in the presence of various amounts of either the wild type Gyr or Gyr (A59). Analysis of the replication products revealed the types of DNA molecules generated during the Gyr- and Gyr (A59)-supported oriC DNA replication (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of any topoisomerase, only ERIs were accumulated (Fig.1 B, lane 1). ERI are molecules on which initiation has occurred but no extensive nascent chain elongation has ensued (6Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described above, LRI and form II-form II DNA dimers were accumulated during the wild type Gyr-supported oriC DNA replication (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2–5). The same patterns of the replication products were generated when Gyr (A59) was used (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6–9). We also performed the product analysis by alkaline-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and we confirmed that both leading and lagging strands were synthesized during theoriC DNA replication supported by either the wild type Gyr or Gyr (A59) (data not shown). These results demonstrated that Gyr (A59) was capable of supporting the nascent chain elongation but not decatenating daughter DNA molecules during the oriC DNA replication in vitro. These results also demonstrated that the supercoiling activity of Gyrper se was not required to support nascent chain elongation. Next, we assessed the effect of the quinolone drugs on Gyr (A59). By using a 3′-end-labeled linear plasmid DNA as a substrate, we measured the stimulation of Gyr (A59)-catalyzed DNA cleavages by Norf (Fig. 2). Norf stimulated both the wild type Gyr- and Gyr (A59)-catalyzed cleavages in a concentration-dependent manner. However, Gyr (A59) was less sensitive to Norf than the wild type protein. The [Norf]1/2 for Gyr (A59)-catalyzed and the wild type Gyr-catalyzed DNA cleavages were 4–5 and 0.1–0.2 μm, respectively (Fig. 2 B; data not shown).Figure 1Gyr (A59) cannot decatenate replicating daughter DNA molecules during oriC DNA replicationin vitro. A, standard oriC DNA replication reactions containing 140 fmol (as tetramer) of the wild type Gyr and the indicated amounts (as tetramer) of either Gyr (A59) or Topo IV were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and the DNA products were analyzed by the electrophoresis through 0.8% native agarose gels (11Hiasa H.

These results showed that, under these conditions, the plasmid DNA was occupied by at least one ternary complex formed with either the wild type Gyr or Gyr (A59). The active strand cleavage and reunion activity of Topo IV are required for the formation of the Topo IV-Norf-DNA ternary complexes that can arrest the progression of replication forks in vitro (6Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We examined if this was also the case with Gyr, by using a catalytically inactive mutant Gyr (A, Y122F). First, the standard DNA cleavage assay was performed and showed no Gyr (A, Y122F)-catalyzed DNA cleavage (Fig.3 A). These results confirmed that the substitution of the active site Tyr with Phe abolished the strand cleavage activity of Gyr. The modified oriC pulse-chase protocol (6Hiasa H. Yousef D.O. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26424-26429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16371-16375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed to assess the ability of the ternary complex formed with Gyr (A, Y122F) to arrest replication fork progression in vitro (Fig.3 B). ERI were formed and labeled, and then the paused replication forks were released by linearizing the DNA template with the SmaI restriction endonuclease, which digested the DNA template once at oriC. Linearization of the DNA template was sufficient to release the paused replication forks and generate the full-length product as a result of the run-off DNA replication (Fig.3 B, lane 1). Because no topoisomerase was required to relieve topological constraint, this reaction was insensitive to the presence of Norf (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). Either the wild type Gyr or Gyr (A, Y122F) was added, together with Norf, to the reaction mixtures prior to the addition of the SmaI restriction enzyme. The subsequent release of replication forks would result in collisions between replication forks and the ternary complexes. The ternary complexes that could arrest replication fork progression would, therefore, manifest themselves in this assay by preventing the appearance of the full-length DNA product. In the absence of Norf, neither the wild type Gyr nor Gyr (A, Y122F) affected elongation of the nascent chains in the ERI to the full-length product (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3 and 5). When Norf was present, replication fork progression was blocked in the presence of the wild type Gyr (Fig. 3 B, lane 4) but not in the presence of Gyr (A, Y122F) (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). These results demonstrated that the active strand cleavage and reunion activity of Gyr was required for the formation of the ternary complex that could arrest replication fork progression. We further examined if the formation of covalent Gyr-DNA complexes was not only necessary but also sufficient to arrest replication fork progression. If the covalent Gyr-DNA complex formation is sufficient to inhibit DNA replication, the Gyr (A59)-Norf-DNA ternary complex would block the replication fork progression. The occupancy of the topoisomerase on the DNA is one of the determining factors of the probability of collisions between replication forks and topoisomerase-DNA complexes. The amounts of topoisomerase-catalyzed DNA cleavages represent the formation of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complexes on the DNA. As shown in Fig. 2, the occupancies of the plasmid DNA template by the ternary complexes formed with either the wild type Gyr or Gyr (A59) were similar when Norf was present at high concentrations. Thus, under these conditions, we expected the collisions between replication forks and the ternary complexes formed with either the wild type Gyr or Gyr (A59) would take place at a similar frequency.

https://openalex.org/W2048709799,"Abstract DNA polymerase η (Polη) functions in error-free replication of UV-damaged DNA, and in vitro it efficiently bypasses a cis-syn T-T dimer by incorporating two adenines opposite the lesion. Steady state kinetic studies have shown that both yeast and human Polη are low-fidelity enzymes, and they misincorporate nucleotides with a frequency of 10− 2–10− 3 on both undamaged and T-T dimer-containing DNA templates. To better understand the role of Polη in error-free translesion DNA synthesis, here we examine the ability of Polη to extend from base mismatches. We find that both yeast and human Polη extend from mismatched base pairs with a frequency of ∼10− 3 relative to matched base pairs. In the absence of efficient extension of mismatched primer termini, the ensuing dissociation of Polη from DNA may favor the excision of mismatched nucleotides by a proofreading exonuclease. Thus, we expect DNA synthesis by Polη to be more accurate than that predicted from the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation alone."
https://openalex.org/W2014673108,"The p53 protein plays a key role in the cellular response to stress by inducing cell growth arrest or apoptosis. The polyproline region of p53 has been shown to be important for its growth suppression activity. p53 protein lacking the polyproline region has impaired apoptotic activity and altered specificity for certain apoptotic target genes. Here we describe the role of this region in the regulation of p53 by its inhibitor Mdm2. p53 lacking the polyproline region was identified to be more susceptible to inhibition by Mdm2. Furthermore, the absence of this region renders p53 more accessible to ubiquitination, nuclear export, and Mdm2-mediated degradation. This increased sensitivity to Mdm2 results from an enhanced affinity of Mdm2 toward p53 lacking the polyproline region. Our results provide a new explanation for the impaired growth suppression activity of p53 lacking this region. The polyproline region is proposed to be important in the modulation of the inhibitory effects of Mdm2 on p53 activities and stability."
https://openalex.org/W2081299398,"PRH (proline-richhomeodomain protein) is strongly expressed in the hematopoietic compartment. Here we show that PRH is a repressor of transcription in hematopoietic cells. A fragment of PRH that includes the homeodomain can bind to TATA box sequences <i>in vitro</i> and can also bind to the TATA box-binding protein. PRH represses transcription from TATA box-containing promoters in intact cells but does not repress transcription from a promoter lacking a TATA box. A mutation in the PRH homeodomain that blocks binding to DNA but that has little or no effect on binding to the TATA box-binding protein significantly reduces the ability of the protein to repress transcription and provides the first clear demonstration that a homeodomain can bring about transcriptional repression <i>in vivo</i> by binding to a TATA box. However, we also show that mutation of the PRH homeodomain does not block the ability of PRH to repress transcription when this protein is tethered upstream of the TATA box via a heterologous DNA-binding domain. PRH also contains an N-terminal proline-rich repression domain that is separate from the homeodomain. Deletion mapping suggests that this repression domain contains at least two regions that both independently contribute to transcriptional repression."

Recent studies have shown that myeloperoxidase (MPO), an abundant heme protein released by activated leukocytes, can oxidize nitrite (NO2−) to a radical species, most likely nitrogen dioxide. Furthermore, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the major strong oxidant generated by MPO in the presence of physiological concentrations of chloride ions, can also react with nitrite, forming the reactive intermediate nitryl chloride. Since MPO and MPO-derived HOCl, as well as reactive nitrogen species, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis through oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein ( LDL ), we investigated the effects of physiological concentrations of nitrite (12.5–200 μm) on MPO-mediated modification of LDL in the absence and presence of physiological chloride concentrations. Interestingly, nitrite concentrations as low as 12.5 and 25 μmsignificantly decreased MPO/H2O2/Cl−-induced modification of apoB lysine residues, formation of N-chloramines, and increases in the relative electrophoretic mobility of LDL. In contrast, none of these markers of LDL atherogenic modification were affected by the MPO/H2O2/NO2−system. Furthermore, experiments using ascorbate (12.5–200 μm) and the tyrosine analogue 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (12.5–200 μm), which are both substrates of MPO, indicated that nitrite inhibits MPO-mediated LDL modifications by trapping the enzyme in its inactive compound II form.

Oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in vitro by MPO or HOCl primarily involves chlorination of the ε-amino groups of lysine residues of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), the major protein component of LDL, resulting in the formation ofN-chloramines (32Hazell L.J.

LDL-associatedN-chloramines have been implicated in the altered electrophoretic migration, aggregation, and subsequent uncontrolled uptake of HOCl-modified LDL by macrophages (32Hazell L.J.

In contrast to HOCl, however, MPO-derived reactive nitrogen species primarily cause lipid peroxidation in LDL (36Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin.

Thus, increased macrophage uptake of LDL modified by reactive nitrogen species is most likely due to increased levels of lipid oxidation products (36Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J.

In this study we investigated the effects of physiological concentrations of nitrite (12.5–200 μm) on MPO-mediated modification of LDL in the absence and presence of physiological chloride concentrations (140 mm). In addition, we examined whether the physiological antioxidant ascorbate can inhibit LDL modification under these conditions. Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which nitrite inhibits MPO-mediated atherogenic modification of LDL. Human leukocyte MPO and anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibodies were procured from Calbiochem, HOCl was from Aldrich, and 7-fluorobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonamide (ABD-F) was from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody and BCIP/TNBT color reagent were from Chemicon International, Temecula, CA. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was composed of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and contained the metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA, 100 μm). Tris-buffered saline was composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and contained 0.1% Tween 20. Griess reagent was composed of 1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2.5% H3PO4. Thionitrobenzoic acid (TNB) was prepared from 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) by alkaline hydrolysis with subsequent neutralization (40Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). LDL was isolated from fresh plasma by a sequential centrifugation method (41Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) modified as described by us previously (34Carr A.C. Tijerina T. Frei B. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The isolated LDL (1.019 < d < 1.067 g/ml fraction) was desalted by two sequential passages through PD-10 gel filtration columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The total protein was estimated using the Lowry micro method kit (Sigma P5656). For experiments the LDL was diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg of protein/ml (≈1 μm LDL) in PBS unless indicated otherwise. For chloride-free experiments, the LDL was diluted in phosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA. MPO (50 nm) was incubated with LDL for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the stated concentrations of H2O2. The H2O2 was freshly diluted in phosphate buffer and standardized at 240 nm (ε = 43.6m−1 cm−1) (42Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and was added to the LDL samples in aliquots of 25–50 μm over the 30-min incubation period. Under these conditions all of the added H2O2 was converted into HOCl as determined by TNB oxidation using 10 mmtaurine as a trap (40Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). LDL samples were also incubated in the presence of the MPO substrates nitrite, ascorbate, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HPA) (12.5 - 200 μm each). HPA was used instead of tyrosine because it lacks an amino group and, thus, has only minimal reactivity with HOCl. Ascorbate was freshly diluted in phosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA and standardized at 265 nm (ε = 15,000m−1 cm−1) (43Chesney J.A. Mahoney J.R. Eaton J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ascorbate was measured using paired-ion, reversed-phase HPLC with electrochemical detection (44Frei B. England L. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). Nitrite was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm using the Griess reagent (45Vodovotz Y. Biotechniques. 1996; 20: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HOCl was standardized at 292 nm (ε = 350 m−1cm−1) after dilution into pH 12 buffer (46Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Standardized HOCl was freshly diluted in PBS; the pK a of HOCl is 7.5 (46Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar), and therefore the solution contained both HOCl and OCl−. HOCl was added to the LDL in the presence of nitrite (coincubation) or before the addition of nitrite (pre-incubation), and the LDL was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Tryptophan residues were measured directly by fluorescence (excitation = 280 nm, emission = 335 nm) (32Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In samples containing HPA, the fluorescence of the equivalent concentration of HPA was subtracted from the total fluorescence. Lysine residues were measured after fluorescamine derivatization (excitation = 390 nm, emission = 475 nm) (47Bohlen P. Stein S. Dairman W. Udenfriend S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 155: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues were measured after 7-fluorobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonamide (ABD-F) derivatization (excitation = 365 nm, emission = 490 nm) (48Toyo'oka T. Imai K. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 2461-2464Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar), as described by us previously (34Carr A.C. Tijerina T. Frei B. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). N-Chloramines were determined after TNB oxidation (ε412 = 14, 100m−1 cm−1) (40Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Carbonyls were measured after 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization (ε450 = 22,000m−1 cm−1) (33Hazell L.J. van den Berg J.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). 3-Nitrotyrosine was measured by dot blot using an anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody (49Ye Y.Z. Strong M. Huang Z.Q. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 201-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrocellulose blots were treated for 1 h with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline, 1 h with anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody (1:200 in Tris-buffered saline), 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5,000 in Tris-buffered saline) and detected with BCIP/TNBT color reagent. The change in the relative electrophoretic mobility (REM) of LDL was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis using a Paragon lipoprotein electrophoresis kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Statistical analyses were carried out using analysis of variance with Fisher's post hoc analysis and regression analysis using StatView software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We (34Carr A.C. Tijerina T. Frei B. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and others (32Hazell L.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 33Hazell L.J. van den Berg J.J. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) have shown that bolus addition of reagent HOCl (25–200 μm) to human LDL results in a number of modifications to apoB, e.g. oxidation of cysteine, tryptophan, and lysine residues, formation of N-chloramines, and an increase in REM. In the present study, we investigated the physiologically more relevant system of HOCl generated by MPO/H2O2/Cl−. The addition of increasing amounts of H2O2 (25–200 μm) to human LDL (0.5 mg protein/ml; ≈1 μm) in the presence of MPO (50 nm) caused basically identical modifications to LDL (Fig.1) as those seen with reagent HOCl (34Carr A.C. Tijerina T. Frei B. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, 200 μm H2O2 alone did not cause oxidation of LDL amino acid residues or an increase in REM (data not shown). Using the MPO/H2O2/Cl− system, all of the added H2O2 was converted into HOCl as determined by TNB oxidation using taurine as a trap (40Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Cysteine residues were the most sensitive target on LDL and were completely oxidized in the presence of 75 μmH2O2 (Fig. 1 a). Lysine and tryptophan residues were modified at equal rates, with 39 and 43% of the residues modified, respectively, after the addition of 200 μm H2O2 (Fig. 1 a). Since LDL contains ∼3–5 free cysteine residues (50Sommer A. Gorges R. Kostner G.M. Paltauf F. Hermetter A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11245-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 51Yang C.Y. Kim T.W. Weng S.A. Lee B.R. Yang M.L. Gotto A.M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), 356 lysine residues, and 37 tryptophan residues (52Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jurgens G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar), lysine residues can be calculated to be quantitatively the major target of HOCl generated by the MPO system. The decrease in lysine residues was mirrored by the formation of N-chloramines, which accounted for approximately one-third of the added H2O2 (Fig.1 b). A dose-dependent increase in REM was also observed with increasing concentrations of H2O2(Fig. 1 b). Previous studies have investigated the modification of LDL by MPO/H2O2/NO2−in the absence of chloride (36Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.F. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 37Byun J. Mueller D.M. Fabjan J.S. Heinecke J.W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We found that this system caused relatively few changes to apoB under the conditions used in the present study (Fig. 2). No significant modification of lysine residues occurred, and only a small dose-dependent decrease of tryptophan residues was observed with increasing nitrite concentrations (Fig. 2 a); ∼25% of the tryptophan residues in LDL were oxidized in the presence of 200 μm nitrite. Analysis of cysteine residues was confounded by the fact that in the absence of nitrite ∼50% of the residues were already oxidized (Fig. 2 a). Since 200 μmH2O2 alone did not cause cysteine oxidation (data not shown), this finding is most likely due to a small amount of halide contamination in the buffers used. Nevertheless, nitrite did not exert any dose-dependent effect on oxidation of apoB cysteine residues (Fig. 2 a). In agreement with the lack of lysine oxidation by the MPO/H2O2/NO2−system, there was no increase in the REM or TNB reactivity of LDL (Fig.2 c). However, dot blot analysis using an anti-nitrotyrosine monoclonal antibody showed dose-dependent formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, measurement of nitrite using the Griess assay indicated that approximately twice as much of the added nitrite was consumed in the absence of chloride than in its presence (e.g. 124 ± 4 μm nitriteversus 56 ± 7 μm nitrite, respectively, after the addition of 200 μm nitrite) (data not shown). It should be noted, however, that reaction of nitrogen dioxide with substrates that can donate hydrogens regenerates nitrite, and thus, the Griess assay may underestimate the amount of nitrite utilized by MPO. Since nitrite is a substrate for MPO (20Burner U. Furtmuller P.G. Kettle A.J. Koppenol W.H. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20597-20601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the effect of physiological concentrations of nitrite on LDL modification in the presence of 200 μmH2O2 and physiological chloride concentrations was investigated. The addition of increasing concentrations of nitrite (12.5–200 μm) affected specific MPO-mediated modifications of LDL (Fig. 3). Low concentrations of nitrite (≥12.5 μm) significantly decreased modification of apoB lysine residues induced by MPO/H2O2/Cl− (Fig. 3 a). A concurrent, although less extensive, decrease in modification of tryptophan residues was observed at 25–50 μm nitrite, but this effect was lost at higher nitrite concentrations (Fig.3 a). Since the cysteine residues were almost fully oxidized with 200 μm H2O2 (Fig.3 a), LDL was treated with sufficient H2O2 (25 μm) to oxidize approximately one-third of the cysteine residues; the addition of nitrite, however, did not have a significant effect on thiol oxidation at this concentration of H2O2 (data not shown). In agreement with the decrease in lysine oxidation by low concentrations of nitrite (Fig. 3 a), formation ofN-chloramines and increase in REM were also inhibited (Fig.3 b). Interestingly, at higher concentrations of nitrite (150 and 200 μm), the REM increased again, although not to control levels seen in the absence of nitrite (Fig. 3 b). This increase in REM could be a result of increased nitrite-dependent lipid peroxidation and subsequent derivatization of apoB lysine residues to carbonyls by lipid hydroperoxide breakdown products. In support of this hypothesis, we found that nitrite dose-dependently increased apoB carbonyl levels (e.g. 14 ± 1 μm carbonyls without nitrite versus 60 ± 2 μm carbonyls at 200 μm nitrite) but not until the concentrations of added nitrite reached ≥50 μm (data not shown). A number of mechanisms could account for the marked decrease in lysine oxidation,N-chloramine formation, and increase in REM by MPO/H2O2/Cl− in the presence of low concentrations of nitrite (Figs. 3, a and b). For example, nitrite could “scavenge” MPO-derived HOCl (21Eiserich J.P. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B.,. van der Vliet A. J. Biol.

(2000) Biophys. J. 78, 1810–1824). Whether this is also the case with the native Ca2+ release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), however, remains to be determined. Taking advantage of the facts that [3H]ryanodine binds only to the open form of the channels and that it is practically irreversible at 4 °C, we devised a method to separate the total binding to contributions of α- and β-RyR, using immunoprecipitation with an α-RyR-specific monoclonal antibody. Surprisingly, the binding of α-RyR was strongly suppressed to as low as ∼4% that of β-RyR in the SR vesicles. The two isoforms, however, showed no difference in sensitivity to Ca2+, adenine nucleotides, or caffeine. This reduced binding of α-RyR was ascribed to the low affinity for [3H]ryanodine, with no change in the maximal binding sites. Solubilization of SR with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid partly remedied this nonequivalence, whereas 1 m NaCl was ineffective. 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), however, could not be responsible for it, because FK506 treatment did not eliminate the suppression, in contrast to marked removal of 12-kDa FK506-binding protein from α-RyR.

Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 2Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 3Sutko J.L.

The RyR channel is mainly activated by two distinct modes: depolarization-induced Ca2+ release (DICR) and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). DICR, which is the primary mechanism in skeletal muscle contraction, is triggered directly or indirectly by the conformational change of the voltage sensor, the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), on depolarization of the transverse tubule membrane. On this occasion, extracellular Ca2+ entry is not necessarily required. In contrast, CICR is caused by activation of the RyR channel by micromolar or greater concentrations of Ca2+, which is attained by the Ca2+ influx through DHPR, although tight association with DHPR is not required for this mode. Adult mammalian skeletal muscles predominantly express the type 1 isoform of RyR (RyR1). Some specific muscles, e.g. diaphragm and soleus, however, also have a minuscule amount (<1–4%) of the type 3 isoform (RyR3; Refs. 5Conti A. Gorza L. Sorrentino V. Biochem.

This is supported by the fact that aCrooked Neck Dwarf mutant of chicken that lacks normal α-RyR fails to exhibit DICR (14Airey J.A. Baring M.D. Beck C.F. Chelliah Y. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Houenou L.J. McKemy D.D. Sutko J.L. Talvenheimo J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 169-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The role and significance of β-RyR in these muscles, however, are still unclear. α- and β-RyR purified from frog skeletal muscle demonstrated the CICR channel activity, and the Ca2+ release appeared to be a simple summation of each contribution (11Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Murayama T. Ogawa Y. Biomed. Res. 1993; 14: 71-72Google Scholar). Further investigations on [3H]ryanodine binding activity revealed that these isoforms were very similar in activity and that their responses to CICR modulators were indistinguishable under conditions simulating the myoplasm, suggesting an equal assignation of α- and β-RyR to CICR in situ in frog skeletal muscle (16Murayama T. Ogawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted using purified proteins that were solubilized with a detergent such as CHAPS to separate them from each other. It is well known that the RyR channel activity is modulated by several accessory proteins (e.g. 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and calmodulin; Refs. 4Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 18Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Ogawa Y. Kurebayashi N. Murayama T. Adv. Biophys. 1999; 36: 27-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, no or only a minor amount of such accessory proteins was detected in the purified RyR preparations (20Wagenknecht T. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Wiederrecht G.J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1709-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), probably because of dissociation of these proteins from RyR in the presence of CHAPS during the solubilization and purification procedure; this, in turn, might cause changes in properties of these isoforms. Recent investigation revealed that CHAPS greatly enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding to RyRs in SR vesicles of rabbit and frog skeletal muscles (22Ogawa Y. Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 191-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the affinities for divalent cations of the activating and inactivating Ca2+ sites of the purified α- and β-RyR were found to be lower than those of the Ca2+ release channel of RyRin situ (17Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Determination of the activity of each of α- and β-RyR in situ are therefore required for better understanding of their roles. In the present study, we established a method for separating the total [3H]ryanodine binding activity into those of α- and β-RyR in frog skeletal muscle SR vesicles where the native organization of the Ca2+ release channel including RyR and accessory proteins was still maintained. This success is attributable entirely to two findings: first, an extremely slow dissociation of ryanodine from RyR, practically irreversible at a low temperature (23Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,24Ogawa Y. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and second, separation of the two isoforms without loss of their binding activity by immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antibody after solubilization of the SR with CHAPS (6Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The results, contrary to our expectations, demonstrate that [3H]ryanodine binding activity of α-RyR is much lower than that of β-RyR in the SR vesicles, suggesting a selective suppression of the CICR activity of α-RyR in frog skeletal muscle. [3H]Ryanodine (60–90 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, Inc. Goat anti-rat IgG-agarose, nonimmune rat IgG, and monoclonal anti-calmodulin antibody (C-7055) were obtained from Sigma. Anti-FKBP12 antibody (PA1-026) was from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. Egg lecithin (egg total phosphatide extract) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other reagents were of analytical grade. SR vesicles were prepared from bullfrog leg muscle (11Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 514-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The isolated vesicles were quickly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C until used. Membrane protein was measured by the biuret method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE was performed with 2–12% or 5–15% linear gradient gels (21Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. For Western blotting, gels were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was performed with rabbit anti-FKBP12 antibody (1:1000 dilution), rat anti-α-RyR antibody (1H7, 1:100 dilution), and mouse anti-calmodulin antibody (1:100 dilution), and positive bands were detected by an ECL system using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (21Murayama T.

A monoclonal antibody against frog α-RyR, 1H7, was produced in rats according to the method of Kishiro et al. (26Kishiro Y. Kagawa M. Naito I. Sado Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1995; 20: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) using the purified α-RyR as an antigen. This antibody selectively recognized α-RyR among proteins of SR vesicles prepared from frog skeletal muscle and did not react with β-RyR (see “Results”). It also did not react with any RyR isoforms of mammals (RyR1–3) or α-RyR of chicken or fish (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation was performed using 1H7-bound agarose beads, which were prepared from anti-rat IgG-agarose beads (6Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of 100 μl of the antibody solution was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of goat anti-rat IgG-agarose beads in a buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.05% Tween 20. Nonimmune rat IgG was similarly adsorbed to the beads for control experiments. These beads were washed three times with the buffer and stored at 4 °C until use. SR vesicles were solubilized with 1% CHAPS and 0.5% egg lecithin in the above buffer and incubated with the antibody beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with the buffer, proteins bound to the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE. SR vesicles were usually incubated with 8.5 nm [3H]ryanodine for 5 h at 25 °C in 200 μl of a buffer containing 0.17m NaCl, 20 mm3-(N-morpholino)-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid/NaOH, pH 6.8, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. 1 mm β,γ-methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate (AMPPCP) and various concentrations of Ca2+ buffered with 10 mm EGTA were supplemented unless otherwise indicated. Free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the value of 8.79 × 105m−1 as the apparent binding constant for Ca2+ of EGTA (27Harafuji H. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. 1980; 87: 1305-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). After 5 h of incubation when the [3H]ryanodine binding reached nearly steady state, the vesicles were supplemented with 20 μmnonradioactive ryanodine to terminate further incorporation of [3H]ryanodine, followed by immediate cooling to 4 °C, and solubilized with 1% CHAPS and 0.5% egg lecithin. For separation of the total binding into that for α- and β-RyR, α-RyR was immunoprecipitated by incubating for 2 h at 4 °C with the 1H7-bound agarose beads, which had been washed by the reaction medium containing 1% CHAPS and 0.5% egg lecithin. The precipitated agarose beads were washed three times with the same washing buffer, and the radioactivity responsible for α-RyR was recovered by incubating the beads with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 1.5, which was used to disrupt the antigen-antibody complex. The resultant supernatant, on the other hand, gave [3H]ryanodine binding to β-RyR which was determined by the gel filtration method using a small-scale column in a centrifuge (21Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Total binding to SR vesicles was separately determined in a similar way from the supernatant after immunoprecipitation using nonimmune rat IgG-agarose beads instead of 1H7-agarose beads. Nonspecific radioactivity was determined in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled ryanodine at the onset of the binding reaction. In previous experiments (6Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24030-24037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we successfully determined [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR3 in the mixture of solubilized RyR1 and RyR3. In the present experiments, however, total binding to SR vesicles must be separated into α- and β-RyR by immunoprecipitation after solubilization of SR vesicles by CHAPS and phospholipids. These reagents, however, enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding at steady state as shown in Fig. 6(also see Ref. 22Ogawa Y. Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 191-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the immunoprecipitation procedure requires 3–4 h of additional incubation, [3H]ryanodine binding might increase during this period. Resources to avoid this are required. Fig. 1, inset, shows the time course of [3H]ryanodine binding to frog skeletal muscle SR vesicles at 25 °C in an isotonic medium containing 0.17m NaCl, 8.5 nm [3H]ryanodine, and the optimal Ca2+ (pCa 4.0; see “Experimental Procedures”). Because frog SR vesicles show very low [3H]ryanodine binding activity without added ligands other than Ca2+ (24Ogawa Y. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 1 mm AMPPCP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, was supplemented to the medium to stimulate the binding. The binding followed an apparently exponential time course (24Ogawa Y. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and was close to near steady state at 4 h (Fig. 1.,inset). After 5 h of incubation (Fig. 1, upward arrow), incorporation of [3H]ryanodine was terminated by addition of 20 μm unlabeled ryanodine, and the vesicles were solubilized with 1% CHAPS and 0.5% egg lecithin to separate α- and β-RyR as described below. The following change of bound [3H]ryanodine after solubilization is shown in Fig.1. The radioactivity gradually decreased with time at 25 °C (open circles) because of replacement of the bound [3H]ryanodine by the unlabeled one. At 4 °C, in contrast, it was unchanged up to 3.5 h, because the bound [3H]ryanodine hardly dissociated from RyR at the low temperature (filled circles; Refs. 23Lai F.A. Erickson H.P. Rousseau E. Liu Q.-Y. Meissner G. Nature. 1988; 331: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Ogawa Y. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 887-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, by incubating at 4 °C, we were able to hold the [3H]ryanodine binding at the steady state under a specified condition for several hours after solubilization. This allowed us to separate α- and β-RyR retaining their [3H]ryanodine binding. The immunoprecipitation method with a monoclonal antibody against α-RyR, 1H7, was used to separate α- and β-RyR but to retain their [3H]ryanodine binding activity as shown previously (21Murayama T. Oba T. Katayama E. Oyamada H. Oguchi K. Kobayashi M. Otsuka K. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17297-17308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,28Percival A.L. Williams A.J. Kenyon J.L. Grinsell M.M. Airey J.A. Sutko J.L. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1834-1850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows an SDS-PAGE pattern for the immunoprecipitation experiments. In frog skeletal muscle SR vesicles, α- and β-RyR were detected as two bands of nearly equal intensity (Fig. 2 A, SR). The ratio of intensity of these bands (α:β) was estimated by densitometry to be 45:55. When SR proteins after solubilization with CHAPS were immunoprecipitated with control nonimmune IgG, both isoforms remained in the supernatant, and neither was detected in the precipitated beads (Fig. 2 A, IgG). In contrast, when immunoprecipitated with 1H7, α-RyR was recovered all in a single band in the beads and was not found in the supernatant, whereas β-RyR remained in the supernatant (Fig. 2 A, 1H7). These indicate that 1H7 specifically and completely immunoprecipitated α-RyR from the solubilized SR proteins. This complete separation of the two RyRs was consistently observed, irrespective of the presence or absence of the CICR modulators (Ca2+, AMPPCP, caffeine, and ryanodine) that were used in the [3H]ryanodine binding experiments (data not shown). Model experiments using the purified α- and β-RyR clearly proved that the method of immunoprecipitation with 1H7 as described under “Experimental Procedures” properly determined [3H]ryanodine binding of individual isoforms (Fig.2 B). The purified α- and β-RyR were prelabeled with [3H]ryanodine up to steady state and then immunoprecipitated with 1H7 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The [3H]ryanodine binding activity of the supernatant after immunoprecipitation with nonimmune IgG, which was separately determined, is referred to as total binding, because the supernatant should contain both isoforms (Fig. 2 B, hatched columns). Total binding of α- and β-RyR was 134 ± 6 and 131 ± 3 pmol/mg protein, respectively, and they were similar as shown previously (16Murayama T. Ogawa Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By immunoprecipitating with 1H7, almost all of the radioactivity for α-RyR was recovered in the beads (Fig. 2 B, filled columns), whereas all the binding for β-RyR remained in the supernatant (Fig. 2 B, open columns). With each isoform, the sum of radioactivity in the supernatant and the precipitate (beads) was consistent with the total binding, indicating no significant loss of bound [3H]ryanodine during immunoprecipitation (Fig.2 B, columns in α-RyR and β-RyR). With a mixed preparation of equal amounts of α- and β-RyR, furthermore, approximately half of the total binding was detected in each of the supernatant and the precipitate (Fig.2 B, α + β). Thus, solubilization with supplement of nonradioactive ryanodine followed by immunoprecipitation with the 1H7 antibody works well to determine the individual [3H]ryanodine binding of α- and β-RyR in the SR vesicles where both isoforms occur. A three-step procedure was used to determine the binding of α- and β-RyR in SR vesicles of frog skeletal muscles. First, the SR vesicles were labeled with [3H]ryanodine to determine total [3H]ryanodine binding at the steady state under a specified condition. Second, they were supplemented with nonradioactive ryanodine, cooled down to 4 °C, and solubilized with CHAPS and phospholipids. Finally, the solubilized specimen was incubated at 4 °C with 1H7 to separate α- and β-RyR into the precipitate of agarose beads and the supernatant, respectively, and the [3H]ryanodine binding of each isoform was determined. Total [3H]ryanodine binding to SR vesicles was separately determined using nonimmune IgG-agarose beads as mentioned above, confirming the validity of our results. Fig.3 shows the stimulatory effect of various amounts of AMPPCP on α- and β-RyR in SR vesicles. The ryanodine binding reaction was carried out at the optimal concentration of pCa 4.0 in an isotonic medium containing 0.17 m NaCl in the presence of 0.2 and 1 mm AMPPCP. Surprisingly, the [3H]ryanodine bound to α-RyR was much less than that bound to β-RyR; the radioactivities in the beads were <1 and 4% of those in the supernatant at 0.2 mm and 1 mmAMPPCP, respectively. This low binding is not attributable to loss of the bound [3H]ryanodine from the beads during the separation procedure, because the sum of the binding in the supernatant and the beads was almost equal to the total binding. This reduced value of α-RyR (∼4% of β-RyR) was consistently observed at a longer incubation period (over 15 h) of the binding reaction, excluding the possibility of a shorter incubation time for this reason. The increase in AMPPCP from 0.2 to 1 mm enhanced the total binding ∼3-fold, which was primarily ascribed to an increase in the binding to β-RyR. It should be noted, however, that α-RyR is also sensitive to AMPPCP in this stimulation of [3H]ryanodine binding (Fig. 3, inset). The enhancement factor for α-RyR appeared to be somewhat greater than that for β-RyR with the increase from 0.2 to 1 mm AMPPCP. This is also the case with 5 mm AMPPCP (data not shown). Similar results were also obtained by immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal antibody against β-RyR (25Murayama T. Ogawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5079-5084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) instead of 1H7 (data not shown). Consequently, these results indicate that α-RyR intrinsically has much lower ryanodine binding than β-RyR in the SR vesicles. Ca2+ dependence of the [3H]ryanodine binding to each isoform is shown in Fig. 4. For clear observation, 1 mm AMPPCP was supplemented to the reaction medium to enhance the binding. β-RyR showed a biphasic Ca2+ dependence, with apparent EC50 values of ∼16 μm and ∼0.8 mm for Ca2+activation and Ca2+ inactivation, respectively (Fig. 4,triangles). α-RyR also showed a similar biphasic Ca2+ dependence, although the relationship seemed to be slightly shifted to a lower Ca2+ concentration range (Fig.4, squares, also see inset). There was only a slight difference, however, between α- and β-RyR in the Ca2+ sensitivity in either Ca2+ activation or Ca2+ inactivation. α-RyR, in contrast, displayed much less binding at all of the Ca2+ concentrations examined (Fig. 4, squares). The peak value for α-RyR (0.036 pmol/mg protein) at pCa 4.0 was <4% of that for β-RyR (0.95 pmol/mg). Fig. 5 demonstrates the effect of caffeine on α-RyR (Fig. 5 A) and β-RyR (Fig.5 B) in the SR vesicles. At pCa 5.6, which is near the threshold for Ca2+ activation without caffeine, 10 mm caffeine enhanced the binding several 10-fold. At the optimal concentration of pCa 4.0, however, the enhancement by caffeine was 3-fold at most. In the presence of caffeine, the binding at pCa 5.6 was significantly higher than that at pCa 4.0. These findings were common to the two isoforms and consistent with the well-known modification of the RyR channel activity by caffeine: increased sensitivity to Ca2+ in the Ca2+ activation and enhancement of the peak activity of CICR and [3H]ryanodine binding (17Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1810-1824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Ogawa Y. Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 191-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that β-RyR showed [3H]ryanodine binding 10–30 times as great as that of α-RyR under the same conditions. These results indicate that α-RyR is sensitive to caffeine, as is the case with β-RyR, in SR vesicles, although the former is much lower than the latter in ryanodine binding activity even in the presence of caffeine. In isotonic media, α-RyR had [3H]ryanodine binding activity much lower than β-RyR, although the sensitivity to Ca2+, AMPPCP, and caffeine was still retained. The effects of high salt and CHAPS, both of which potently stimulate [3H]ryanodine binding to SR vesicles (22Ogawa Y. Murayama T. Kurebayashi N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 191-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ogawa Y. Harafuji H. J. Biochem. 1990; 107: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), were examined (Fig.6). In medium containing 1 mNaCl, the total [3H]ryanodine binding was nearly 5-fold higher than that in medium containing 0.17 m NaCl. A marked enhancement in binding was observed not only with β-RyR but also with α-RyR. The nonequivalence of the two RyRs, however, was still remarkable: β-RyR showed 6-fold higher [3H]ryanodine binding than α-RyR. The addition of 1% CHAPS with 0.5% egg lecithin into the isotonic medium increased the total binding 4-fold. Under this condition, the [3H]ryanodine binding to α-RyR was more enhanced, reaching nearly half of the binding to β-RyR. Thus, [3H]ryanodine binding activity of α-RyR is effectively increased by solubilization of the SR vesicles with CHAPS. These findings indicate that some molecular interaction that is weakened by CHAPS may selectively suppress the CICR activity of α-RyR. It has been reported that FKBP12 selectively inhibits the Ca2+ release channel activity of RyR1 among three RyR isoforms in mammals (30Copello J.A. Jeyakumar L. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 31Barg S. Copello J.A. Fleischer S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1726-C1733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possible involvement of FKBP12 in the suppressed activity of α-RyR was therefore tested using FK506, which specifically removed the FKBP12 (32Timerman A.P. Ogunbumni E. Freund E. Wiederrecht G. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22992-22999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.7 A demonstrates Western blots of the fraction immunoprecipitated with 1H7 of solubilized frog SR vesicles. A small protein of ∼15 kDa was positively reacted with anti-FKBP12 antibody (Control lane). This band disappeared from the SR vesicles treated with 100 μm FK506 before immunoprecipitation, without change in the amount of precipitated α-RyR (+FK506 lane). The reacted band was closer in its partial N-terminal amino acid sequence to human FKBP12.6 than to F"

Virology. 1991; 180: 814-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ICAM-1 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with five immunoglobulin-like domains making up its extracellular part. The LDLR family comprises a number of membrane proteins all having various numbers of highly conserved complement type A repeats of about 40 amino acids in length containing six cysteines each, which exhibit extensive disulfide bridging (for review, see Ref. 9Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Whereas the structure of ICAM-1 is known at atomic resolution (10Casasnovas J.M. Stehle T. Liu J.H.

In an attempt to determine the binding site of LDL receptors on minor group viruses, we had previously expressed soluble fragments of LDLR in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus system (18Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Marlovits T.C. Abrahamsberg C. Blaas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33835-33840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although these recombinant minireceptors are extremely potent in protecting HeLa cells against infection with various minor group virus serotypes, it was not possible to demonstrate the formation of virus-receptor complexes in solution.The earlier observation of comigration of the detergent-solubilized chicken homolog of human VLDLR and HRV2 on sucrose density gradients (6Gruenberger M. Wandl R. Nimpf J. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Kuechler E. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7244-7247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether minireceptors derived from human VLDLR might be capable of forming stable virus complexes. We demonstrate here that this is indeed the case. Using electron cryo-microscopy, we have discovered that the receptor binding site does not lie in the canyon; its exact location has been determined (20Hewat E.A. Neumann E. Conway J.F. Moser R. Ronacher R. Marlovits T.C. Blaas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).An icosahedron exhibits three kinds of symmetry-related sites. 60 equivalent sites result from 2-fold symmetry and 20 sites from 3-fold symmetry, and 12 equivalent sites are present at the 5-fold axes. Therefore, determining the number of receptor molecules attached to the virion allows predictions of the geometric class of the binding site. For example, we have previously shown that about 30 molecules of the virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody 8F5 can attach to HRV2 (21Tormo J. Centeno N.B. Fontana E. Bubendorfer T. Fita I. Blaas D. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); this was then confirmed with the finding that the antibody binds bivalently to two epitopes related by 2-fold icosahedral symmetry (22Hewat E.A. Blaas D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Scatchard analysis of data obtained from surface plasmon resonance measurements revealed about 67 binding sites for ICAM-1 on the surface of HRV14 (23Casasnovas J.M. Reed R.R. Springer T.A. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1994; 6: 157-167Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which is close to the theoretical 60 sites and corresponds well with the data obtained by electron cryo-microscopy showing that 60 receptors are attached to all 60 available sites (14Olson N.H. Kolatkar P.R. Oliveira M.A. Cheng R.H. Greve J.M. McClelland A. Baker T.S. Rossmann M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, steric hindrance, low affinity, or other constraints might lead to lack of complete occupancy of all theoretically available sites. Therefore, knowledge of the stoichiometry can indicate whether the number of receptors attached to the virus is compatible with the theoretical value or whether the receptor attaches in an unexpected way.Electrophoretic separation of analytes by capillary electrophoresis (CE) is based on the differences of mobilities in a given buffer solution. With this method, affinity interactions can be studied in solution, and no attachment of any of the components to a solid support is required (which is the case for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-type formats or for surface plasmon resonance methodology). As a consequence, all available sites should be equally accessible. Attachment of antibody or receptor molecules to the viral surface results in a change in the molecular mass of the particle and/or in its charge giving rise to an alteration of the electrophoretic mobility (24Okun V.M. Ronacher B. Blaas D. Kenndler E. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 4634-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The method appears thus ideally suited for the analysis of complex formation not only because of its resolution power, but also because the amounts of material required for analysis are extremely low (the nanogram range).In a series of articles we have previously demonstrated the separation of rhinoviral particles from contaminants (25Okun V.M. Ronacher B. Blaas D. Kenndler E. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2028-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the resolution of native virus and subviral particles (26Okun V.M. Blaas D. Kenndler E. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 4480-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the detection of antibody-virus complexes (24Okun V.M. Ronacher B. Blaas D. Kenndler E. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 4634-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) by CE. Using this technique, we show here that a recombinant soluble very low density lipoprotein receptor fragment, which is fused to the carboxyl terminus of maltose-binding protein and comprises ligand-binding repeats 1 to 3 (MBP·VLDLR1–3) binds HRV2 with a stoichiometry of about 1:60. A recombinant receptor protein containing repeats 1–8 (MBP·VLDLR1–8) attaches to the virus with a stoichiometry of about 1:30. This suggests that the presence of the additional five repeats is either sterically hindering the attachment of other receptor molecules or that this larger molecule possesses additional binding sites for the virus, which are presumably contributed by the extra repeats.DISCUSSIONAnalysis of the binding stoichiometry between a prototype virus of the minor receptor group of human rhinoviruses (HRV2) and a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (VLDLR) was analyzed by CE. Previous attempts at isolating defined complexes between various recombinant minireceptors derived from LDLR and expressed in the baculovirus system failed possibly because of extensive aggregation (18Marlovits T.C. Zechmeister T. Gruenberger M. Ronacher B. Schwihla H. Blaas D. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or too low affinity (19Marlovits T.C. Abrahamsberg C. Blaas D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33835-33840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the observation of comigration of the chicken ovarian homolog of this receptor with HRV2 on sucrose density gradients (6Gruenberger M. Wandl R. Nimpf J. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Kuechler E. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7244-7247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that of a strong reaction of a VLDL receptor fragment shed from HeLa cells with HRV2 in ligand blots (7Marlovits T.C. Abrahamsberg C. Blaas D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10246-10250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hofer F. Berger B. Gruenberger M. Machat H. Dernick R. Tessmer U. Kuechler E. Blaas D. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), we reasoned that this receptor might exhibit higher affinity toward minor group HRVs than the LDL receptor. Making use of two different VLDL receptor fragments, one encompassing repeats 1–3 and the other the whole ligand binding domain with repeats 1–8 expressed as maltose-binding protein fusions in bacteria (30Ronacher, B., Marlovits, T. C., Moser, R., and Blaas, D. (2000)Virology, in pressGoogle Scholar), we analyzed the binding stoichiometry by capillary electrophoresis. We thus obtained circumstantial evidence for the longer receptor binding more strongly to HRV2 and found that about 60 MBP·VLDLR1–3 molecules were accommodated on the viral surface, but only about 30 molecules of MBP·VLDLR1–8 bound to HRV2. This leaves us with the question of whether the additional repeats inhibit binding of 60 copies of the receptor (as seen for MBP·VLDLR1–3) because of steric hindrance or whether they are able to simultaneously attach to another site related by icosahedral symmetry. There are some arguments in favor of the latter interpretation. (i) The interaction between MBP·VLDLR1–8 and HRV2 is clearly stronger than that of MBP·VLDLR1–3 as shown by the lower concentration required to appreciably shift the viral peak. (ii) The complete absence of aggregation indicates that MBP·VLDLR1–8 is not able to bind to two virions simultaneously, and (iii) a receptor fragment containing only repeats 4–6 does not bind HRV2 (30Ronacher, B., Marlovits, T. C., Moser, R., and Blaas, D. (2000)Virology, in pressGoogle Scholar) and might act as an inert spacer between repeats 1–3 and repeats 6–8. Furthermore, there are nine additional amino acids between repeats 5 and 6 that have been proposed to impart some flexibility to the molecule allowing the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus of the molecule to approach each other (33Mikhailenko I. Considine W. Argraves K.M. Loukinov D. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3269-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent model of the LDL receptor, as obtained by electron cryo-microscopy image reconstruction, suggests that the ligand-binding repeats are not arranged linearly, but there might be a kink between repeats 3 and 4 (34Jeon H. Shipley G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30465-30470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This could result in a conformation of the molecule, which allows for the simultaneous attachment of amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal repeats to two symmetry-related viral binding sites. The recent structure determination of a concatamer of ligand-binding repeats 1 and 2 of human LDLR by NMR technology (35Kurniawan N.D. Atkins A.R. Bieri S. Brown C.J. Brereton I.M. Kroon P.A. Smith R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1282-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) revealed that these two repeats could move freely with respect to each other, and it is thus likely that the whole molecule can adopt various conformations. This might be one of the reasons for its potential to interact with a number of structurally unrelated ligands. Based on an approximate length of 3 nm for one repeat, the total length of the ligand binding domain can be estimated to be about 24 nm. If only two repeats might be available to function as spacers (with the remaining six being engaged in interactions with the virus) the distance between the viral 5-fold axes (about 16 nm) might not permit binding over the 2-fold axes of viral icosahedral symmetry. However, other modes of attachment have also been observed. In the case of rabbit hemorrhagic disease, on virus-like particles, which exhibit 180 equivalent monoclonal antibody binding sites, steric hindrance prevents the simultaneous occupation of 2-fold symmetry-related sites, and the antibodies bind bivalently over local 3-fold axes resulting in 50% occupation (36Thouvenin E. Laurent S. Madelaine M.F. Rasschaert D. Vautherot J.F. Hewat E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). If MBP·VLDLR1–8 indeed adopts a conformation with a pseudo 2-fold symmetry and binds bivalently, it will be of great interest to determine the nature of the interactions between the viral symmetry-related sites and the two clusters of ligand-binding repeats located at the termini of the receptor molecule.Recent data of cryo-electron microscopy image reconstruction of complexes between HRV2 and MBP·VLDLR1–3 point to a binding site different from the canyon floor with five receptor molecules attaching very close to the 5-fold axes of symmetry (20Hewat E.A. Neumann E. Conway J.F. Moser R. Ronacher R. Marlovits T.C. Blaas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structure determination of complexes between HRV2 and the receptor containing all eight ligand binding repeats will finally clarify whether the lower stoichiometry of the larger receptor results from bivalent binding or only from steric effects. Human rhinoviruses (HRVs),1 members of the picornavirus family, are small (∼30 nm in diameter) icosahedral particles composed of 60 copies each of the viral capsid proteins VP1 through VP4 and a positive strand RNA genome of about 7200 nucleotides in length (1Couch R.B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 713-734Google Scholar).

Making use of two different VLDL receptor fragments, one encompassing repeats 1–3 and the other the whole ligand binding domain with repeats 1–8 expressed as maltose-binding protein fusions in bacteria (30Ronacher, B., Marlovits, T. C., Moser, R., and Blaas, D. (2000)Virology, in pressGoogle Scholar), we analyzed the binding stoichiometry by capillary electrophoresis. We thus obtained circumstantial evidence for the longer receptor binding more strongly to HRV2 and found that about 60 MBP·VLDLR1–3 molecules were accommodated on the viral surface, but only about 30 molecules of MBP·VLDLR1–8 bound to HRV2. This leaves us with the question of whether the additional repeats inhibit binding of 60 copies of the receptor (as seen for MBP·VLDLR1–3) because of steric hindrance or whether they are able to simultaneously attach to another site related by icosahedral symmetry. There are some arguments in favor of the latter interpretation. (i) The interaction between MBP·VLDLR1–8 and HRV2 is clearly stronger than that of MBP·VLDLR1–3 as shown by the lower concentration required to appreciably shift the viral peak. (ii) The complete absence of aggregation indicates that MBP·VLDLR1–8 is not able to bind to two virions simultaneously, and (iii) a receptor fragment containing only repeats 4–6 does not bind HRV2 (30Ronacher, B., Marlovits, T. C., Moser, R., and Blaas, D. (2000)Virology, in pressGoogle Scholar) and might act as an inert spacer between repeats 1–3 and repeats 6–8. Furthermore, there are nine additional amino acids between repeats 5 and 6 that have been proposed to impart some flexibility to the molecule allowing the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus of the molecule to approach each other (33Mikhailenko I.

This might be one of the reasons for its potential to interact with a number of structurally unrelated ligands. Based on an approximate length of 3 nm for one repeat, the total length of the ligand binding domain can be estimated to be about 24 nm. If only two repeats might be available to function as spacers (with the remaining six being engaged in interactions with the virus) the distance between the viral 5-fold axes (about 16 nm) might not permit binding over the 2-fold axes of viral icosahedral symmetry. However, other modes of attachment have also been observed. In the case of rabbit hemorrhagic disease, on virus-like particles, which exhibit 180 equivalent monoclonal antibody binding sites, steric hindrance prevents the simultaneous occupation of 2-fold symmetry-related sites, and the antibodies bind bivalently over local 3-fold axes resulting in 50% occupation (36Thouvenin E.

Previous attempts at isolating defined complexes between various recombinant minireceptors derived from LDLR and expressed in the baculovirus system failed possibly because of extensive aggregation (18Marlovits T.C.

With this chromatin, we observed robust activation of transcription with three different transcription factor sets (nuclear factor κB p65 + Sp1, estrogen receptor, and Gal4-VP16) added either before or after chromatin assembly. In fact, the efficiency of activated transcription from the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin was observed to be comparable with that from naked DNA templates or chromatin assembled with a crudeDrosophila extract (S190). With ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin, we found that transcriptional activation is dependent upon acetyl-CoA. This effect was not seen with naked DNA templates or with crude S190-assembled chromatin. We further determined that acetyl-CoA is required at the time of preinitiation complex assembly but not during assembly of the chromatin template. These findings suggest that there is at least one key acetylation event that is needed to assemble a functional transcription preinitiation complex with a chromatin template.

In eukaryotes, the transcription of protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II occurs in the milieu of chromatin and involves the covalent and noncovalent modification of nucleosomes (for reviews, see Refs. 1Cairns B.R.

There are, for instance, enzymes that modify histones by acetylation/deacetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, or ADP-ribosylation. In addition, ATP-dependent proteins, termed chromatin remodeling factors, alter histone-DNA contacts and catalyze nucleosome mobility. It will thus be important to understand the relation between chromatin structure and the activity of each of the tens of thousands of genes in an organism. To investigate the role of chromatin in transcriptional regulation, it is possible to use biochemical systems for the analysis of in vitro reconstituted chromatin. To this end, we previously developed a chromatin transcription system that is based on a crude chromatin assembly extract termed the S190 extract, which is derived from Drosophila embryos (14Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Robinson K.M. Kadonaga J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: M1-M6PubMed Google Scholar). This S190-based chromatin transcription system has been used for the analysis of many transcription factors. Although the S190 extract has been a reliable source of chromatin assembly activity, we have recently achieved the ATP-dependent assembly of chromatin with purified, recombinant chromatin assembly factors (16Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In these reactions, periodic nucleosome arrays are assembled with purified recombinant ACF,1 purified recombinant dNAP1, purified native core histones, plasmid DNA, and ATP. dNAP1 functions stoichiometrically as a core histone chaperone, whereas ACF acts catalytically in an ATP-dependent manner to mediate the deposition of histones onto DNA as well as to catalyze the formation of periodic nucleosome arrays. In this work, we have used the purified chromatin assembly factors, instead of the S190 extract, to assemble chromatin for transcriptional analyses. With this new chromatin transcription system, we have found that the presence of acetyl-CoA at the time of transcription preinitiation complex assembly is essential for activation with chromatin templates. FLAG-tagged human estrogen receptor α (ER), His6-tagged NF-κB p65, and His6-tagged p300 were synthesized in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (17Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 18Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Picard D. Nuclear Receptors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 167-189Google Scholar). Purified Sp1 was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Gal4-VP16 was purified as described previously (19Chasman D.I. Leatherwood J. Carey M. Ptashne M. Kornberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4746-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions with NF-κB p65 and Sp1 were carried out with a DNA template containing the IRF-1 promoter region (from −1312 to +39 relative to the RNA start site) (20Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Transcription with the ER was performed with pERE, which contains four estrogen response elements upstream of the adenovirus E4 core promoter (17Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Transcription with Gal4-VP16 was carried out with pGIE-0, which contains five Gal4 binding sites upstream of the adenovirus E4 core promoter (14Pazin M.J. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1994; 266: 2007-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The assembly of chromatin with purified recombinant ACF, purified recombinant dNAP1, purifiedDrosophila core histones, plasmid DNA, and ATP was performed as described by Ito et al. (16Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), except that the scale of the reactions was typically about five times larger than that used previously. The assembly of chromatin with the DrosophilaS190 extract was carried out as described by Bulger and Kadonaga (21Bulger M. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 241-262Google Scholar). The resulting chromatin samples were subjected to in vitrotranscription analysis as well as to micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis to confirm the efficient assembly of periodic nucleosome arrays. In vitro transcription reactions were performed with HeLa nuclear extracts, as described previously (17Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 18Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Picard D. Nuclear Receptors: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 167-189Google Scholar). With chromatin templates, the transcriptional activators, p300 (where indicated), and HeLa extract were added subsequent to the completion of chromatin assembly, except where noted otherwise. Acetyl-CoA (Sigma; catalog number A-2056) was typically used at a concentration of 9 μm, but variation of the acetyl-CoA concentration from 3 to 300 μm yielded essentially identical results (data not shown). Quantitation of the data was carried out with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All reaction conditions were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was performed a minimum of two (but typically, several) independent times to establish the reproducibility of the results. The cloning of the Acf1 subunit of ACF led to the development of a purified chromatin assembly system that consists of defined components: purified recombinant ACF, purified recombinant dNAP1, purified native core histones, plasmid DNA, and ATP (16Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The purified proteins are shown in Fig. 1. ACF consists of Acf1 and ISWI subunits and catalyzes the ATP-dependent deposition of histones onto DNA as well as the periodic spacing of nucleosomes (16Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). dNAP1 is a core histone chaperone that is a homomultimer of a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of ∼43 kDa, although it migrates with a larger apparent mass on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (22Ito T. Bulger M. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3112-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The assembly of extended, periodic nucleosome arrays with the purified factors is shown in Fig. 1.Figure 1Assembly of periodic nucleosome arrays with purified recombinant ACF and dNAP1. Purified recombinant ACF, purified recombinant dNAP1, and purified native core histones were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The sizes of molecular mass markers (in kilodaltons) are indicated. Chromatin was assembled with the purified proteins, plasmid DNA, and ATP, and then subjected to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion analysis. The mass markers (MW) in the left lane are the 123-base pair ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). The samples in the middleand right lanes were obtained by digestion of the chromatin with different concentrations of micrococcal nuclease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With this system, we compared the transcriptional properties of chromatin assembled with purified ACF + dNAP1 to those of chromatin assembled with the crude S190 extract. These experiments were performed as follows. First, plasmid DNA was assembled into chromatin with either purified ACF + dNAP1 or S190 extract, and then a nuclear extract was added as a source of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery. When desired, sequence-specific activators and purified human p300 were added after chromatin assembly and prior to the addition of the nuclear transcription extract. In initial experiments with the Gal4-VP16 activator and the soluble nuclear fraction (a crude, undialyzed nuclear transcription extract derived from Drosophila embryos) (23Kamakaka R.T. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 44: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we observed comparable levels of transcription with the recombinant ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin as with the S190-assembled chromatin (data not shown). These results with recombinant ACF and dNAP1 are similar to those that we had obtained previously with native ACF and dNAP1 in conjunction with Gal4-VP16 and the soluble nuclear fraction (25Ito T. Bulger M. Pazin M.J. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). In contrast, when we performed transcription reactions with Gal4-VP16 and a standard HeLa nuclear extract (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) instead of the soluble nuclear fraction, there was robust transcription from the S190-assembled chromatin, but no detectable transcription from the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin. To investigate the basis for the lack of Gal4-VP16-activated transcription with the ACF+dNAP1-assembled chromatin, we performed a series of experiments in which we tested the ability of proteins and protein fractions as well as nonprotein factors to stimulate transcription with the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin and the HeLa extract. These studies led to the identification of acetyl CoA as a key, essential cofactor that is present in the S190 chromatin assembly extract (and presumably the soluble nuclear fraction) and is absent from our preparations of purified ACF and dNAP1. This acetyl-CoA dependence of transcription was then tested with NF-κB p65 + Sp1 (Fig. 2, top row) and human estrogen receptor α (Fig. 2, middle row) as well as Gal4-VP16 (Fig. 2, bottom row). With ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin, we observed a strong enhancement of transcription by acetyl-CoA that varied from 21- to 41-fold with a standard HeLa transcription extract and from 17- to 41-fold with HeLa extract supplemented with purified p300 coactivator (Fig. 2, left panels). In contrast, with S190-assembled chromatin, there was no significant change in transcriptional activity upon addition of acetyl-CoA (ranging from a 0.7- to 1.4-fold effect), presumably due to the presence of acetyl-CoA in the S190 extract (Fig. 2, middle panels). With naked DNA templates, we observed a slight increase in transcription upon addition of acetyl-CoA that varied from 1.2- to 2.5-fold (Fig. 2, right panels). In addition, trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, did not enhance transcription in the absence of exogenously added acetyl-CoA with the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin (data not shown). Thus, these findings collectively indicate that there is a general chromatin-specific requirement for acetyl-CoA for transcriptional activation. It is also important to note that the exposure times of the three autoradiograms in each row of Fig. 2 are either identical (i.e. derived from the same autoradiogram) or nearly identical. Therefore, the levels of activated transcription from the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin are comparable with those seen with S190-assembled chromatin or with naked DNA templates. Hence, there is robust transcription from the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin in the presence of acetyl-CoA. To investigate further the transcriptional properties of the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin, we examined whether or not there is a greater amount of transcription when activators are added to naked DNA templates prior to chromatin assembly than when activators are added to chromatin that is previously assembled. It is possible, for instance, that the purified chromatin assembly system may lack nucleosome remodeling activities that are necessary for activators to bind to chromatin and/or to recruit coactivators and the basal transcriptional machinery. As shown in Fig. 3, we observed essentially identical levels of transcriptional activation by either NF-κB p65 + Sp1 or Gal4-VP16 when the activators were added either before or after chromatin assembly. Similar results were also obtained with the estrogen receptor (data not shown). Therefore, transcriptional activators function effectively with chromatin that is previously assembled with ACF and dNAP1. Last, to gain a better understanding of the acetyl-CoA effect, we sought to identify the step at which acetyl-CoA stimulates transcription. To this end, we performed single round transcription experiments, as outlined in Fig. 4 A. In these experiments, chromatin assembly by ACF and dNAP1 was initiated at time = 0 min. At time = 180 min, activators (NF-κB p65 + Sp1 or estrogen receptor) and purified p300 (where indicated) were added to the chromatin. Then, at time = 200 min, HeLa nuclear extract was added to allow the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC). Next, at time = 260 min, the four ribonucleoside 5′-triphosphates (rNTPs) were added to initiate transcription. To limit transcription to a single round, the detergent Sarkosyl (0.2% w/v final concentration) was added 10 s after the rNTPs. Sarkosyl inhibits PIC assembly but not elongation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (27Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8163-8172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hawley D.K. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3452-3461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2624-2631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this manner, single round transcription experiments were carried out in which acetyl-CoA was added at different times in the chromatin assembly and transcription processes. The results obtained with NF-κB p65 + Sp1 at the IRF-1 promoter are shown in Fig. 4 B. First, when acetyl-CoA was added at the beginning of the chromatin assembly process (at time = 0 min), we observed a strong stimulation of transcription, as seen in Fig. 2. Similarly, there was also a strong stimulation of transcription when acetyl-CoA was added after chromatin assembly and prior to PIC assembly (at time = 185 min). These results indicate that acetyl-CoA is not required during chromatin assembly for transcriptional activation. In contrast, when acetyl-CoA was added subsequent to PIC incubation and prior to transcription initiation (at time = 259 min 50 s), we did not observe transcriptional activation in either the absence or the presence of exogenously added p300. Hence, these findings indicate that acetyl-CoA is required at the time of PIC assembly. In addition, essentially identical results were obtained with the estrogen receptor (Fig. 4 C). It was also possible, however, that the lack of activation by acetyl-CoA upon addition after PIC incubation (at time = 259 min 50 s) was due to the inactivation of an acetyltransferase during the 60-min PIC incubation period (as shown in Fig. 4 A). Thus, as a control, we carried out reactions in which the HeLa extract was preincubated separately from the chromatin (which contained p300 and activators) for 75 min at 30 °C and then subsequently combined with the chromatin to initiate PIC assembly. Under these conditions, we still observed a strong dependence upon acetyl-CoA for transcription of ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin (data not shown). We therefore conclude that acetyl-CoA is required at the time of PIC assembly for the efficient transcription of chromatin templates. We have used a defined, purified chromatin assembly system to generate periodic nucleosome arrays for the analysis of chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. In these experiments, we found that acetyl-CoA is essential for transcriptional activation with chromatin templates and that acetyl-CoA is required at the time of PIC assembly. Given the extensive acetylation of core histones and the chromatin specificity of the acetyl-CoA dependence, it is reasonable to postulate that the potent stimulation by acetyl-CoA (e.g. 41-fold enhancement with the estrogen receptor) is due to histone acetylation. On the other hand, it is possible that the acetylation of a transcription factor will enhance its ability to function with chromatin. In this regard, the acetylation of sequence-specific DNA binding factors (see, for example, Refs. 30Gu W. Roeder R.G.

Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) have been observed. Moreover, it has been found that acetyl-CoA can enhance the transcription of naked DNA (greater than 5-fold) as well as the binding of TFIID to promoter DNA in the absence of histones (35Galasinski S.K. Lively T.N. Grebe de Barron A. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1923-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). (Note that we observe a more modest 1.2–2.5-fold increase in transcription by acetyl-CoA with naked DNA templates (Fig. 2, right panels).) Thus, in our experiments, protein acetylation might affect not only the properties of components of chromatin, but also the activity of transcription factors and coactivators that function with chromatin. For transcription with chromatin templates assembled with recombinant ACF and dNAP1, we observed a strong dependence upon acetyl-CoA with a standard HeLa nuclear extract (26Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, left panels). In contrast, only a 2–3-fold enhancement of transcription by acetyl-CoA was seen with a standard HeLa transcription extract in conjunction with a nucleosomal template consisting of a promoter-containing dinucleosome embedded in an array of nucleosomes in tandem 5 S rDNA repeats (36Steger D.J.

Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 19: 410-416Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In the same series of experiments, however, the magnitude of acetyl-CoA stimulation was increased upon the addition of any one of four different acetyltransferase-containing complexes. Then, in other studies with a chromatin template consisting of a promoter embedded in a tandem 5 S rDNA array, Kundu et al. (38Kundu T.K. Palhan V.B. Wang Z. An W. Cole P.A. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 551-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have described p300-dependent, Gal4-VP16-activated transcription that is stimulated by acetyl-CoA. These results suggest that p300/CBP and/or HAT complexes such as SAGA, NuA3, NuA4, or Ada may contribute to the acetyl-CoA requirement that we have observed. Yet, unlike the chromatin in the tandem 5 S rDNA arrays, the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin exhibits a strong dependence upon acetyl-CoA with a standard HeLa extract that is not supplemented with exogenously added acetyltransferases. In the future, we hope to use the ACF + dNAP1-based chromatin transcription system to gain a better understanding of the essential acetylation event(s) at the time of PIC assembly. Importantly, the efficiency of transcription from the ACF + dNAP1-assembled chromatin is comparable with that obtained with either S190-assembled chromatin or with naked DNA templates. Thus, the ACF + dNAP1-based chromatin transcription system is likely to be of general utility for the analysis of the function of a broad range of transcriptional regulators at their downstream target genes. These studies should yield new insights into fundamental aspects of the complex and fascinating mechanisms of gene regulation.

In this study, we report that membrane phospholipid oxidation can modulate the hemostatic balance.

A negative charge on the membrane is recognized as necessary for the binding of the vitamin K-dependent enzymes and substrates through their N-terminal Gla1 domains. Through this binding, the local concentrations of the proteins are markedly increased, augmenting activation rates. Binding may also induce conformational changes in the proteins, aligning substrate cleavage sites with the active site of the enzyme (3Mutucumarana V.P. Duffy E.J. Lollar P. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17012-17021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of the phospholipid head group was known to play a role, and phosphatidylserine (PS) has been considered the most important (4Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 5Pei G. Powers D.D. Lentz B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3226-3233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For many years, it was believed the reactions of the coagulation cascade shared similar requirements for the membrane surface. However, most experiments were performed with the prothrombin-activating complex, prothrombinase, with a tendency to generalize to the other complexes. More recently, it has become apparent that the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) potently enhanced the rate of inactivation of factor Va by the activated protein C (APC) complex (6Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the anticoagulant activity in plasma (7Esmon N.L. Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. Haematologia. 1997; 78: 474-477Google Scholar) while having little to no effect on the prothrombinase reaction when the PS concentration was optimal. Polyunsaturation of the phospholipids further enhanced the activity of the APC complex (8Smirnov M.D. Ford D.A. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L.

In the latter studies, the incorporation of PE into the vesicles decreased the amount of PS required for optimal prothrombin activation (12Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 419-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) much as we observed (8Smirnov M.D. Ford D.A. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unlike the APC system, the PE stimulation could be overcome by increased PS.The role of oxidation in disease has gained considerable attention in the last several years. Oxidation is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, reperfusion injury, and autoimmune diseases (14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar, 15Jain S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Kramer J.H. Dickens B.F.

It can also lead to the activation of endothelium and platelets, possibly through lysophosphatidic acid, a product of oxidation (18Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide, a substance elaborated by activated leukocytes, can also act as a direct cell agonist (19Mullane K. Trends Cardiovasc.

Endothelial cell activation can then lead to the elaboration of other inflammatory mediators which themselves exacerbate coagulation (21Esmon C.T. Taylor Jr., F.B. Snow T.R. Thromb.

Oxidation of red blood cells results in increased exposure of both PS and PE on the membrane surface, making these cells potentially procoagulant (15Jain S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Oxidized LDL can also be immunogenic and lead to the development of antibodies that cross-react with cardiolipin or the surface of endothelial cells (26Wu R.

Alfthan G. Jauhiainen M. Leirisalo-Repo M. Aho K. Palosuo T. Lancet. 1993; 341: 923-925Abstract PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). In addition, apoptotic cells with negatively charged surfaces can be immunogenic and lead to the development of anti-phospholipid antibodies (APAs) with procoagulant activity (28Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Subang R. Rauch J. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 66: 82-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations led Horrko et al. (29Horkko S. Miller E. Dudi E. Reaven P. Curtiss L.K. Zvaifler N.J. Terkeltaub R. Pierangeli S.S. Branch D.W. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 30Horkko S. Miller E. Branch D.W.

A. 1997; 94: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to determine that many APAs are directed toward epitopes of oxidized phospholipids.Oxidation has long been recognized as having an effect in the in vitro coagulation assays (31Barrowcliffe T.W. Stocks J. Gray E. Haemostasis. 1982; 11: 96-101PubMed Google Scholar), usually observed as a change in clotting time with the age of the phospholipid preparation. In general, the response to this observation has been to minimize oxidation by using only freshly prepared lipid vesicles. Very recently, Weinsteinet al. (32Weinstein E.A. Li H. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22925-22930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have reported enhanced prothrombinase activity in response to oxidation using defined systems. Whether the hemostatic balance is affected as a consequence of the oxidation was not directly addressed.Clinical studies have shown that decreases of as little as 50% in the plasma protein C concentrations increase the risk of thrombosis. There is an even more profound effect when other relatively common risk factors, such as factor V Leiden, are also present (33Zoller B. Garcia D.F. Hillarp A. Dahlback B. Haematologica. 1999; 84: 59-70PubMed Google Scholar). Clinical studies have shown that the levels of activated protein C in the circulation correlate directly with the levels of plasma protein C (34Cattaneo M. Franchi F. Zighetti M.L. Martinelli I. Asti D. Mannucci P.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), most likely because the physiological protein C concentration is below the K m value for the physiological activation complex. Given the relationship between protein C levels and the risk of thrombosis, it follows that mechanisms that modulate APC anticoagulant function even 2–3-fold will have a substantial impact on the probability of thrombus formation. In our studies of the phospholipid requirements of the APC complex in contrast to those of the prothrombinase complex, we noticed a dramatically different effect of aging of the phospholipids on the two reactions. Here we report the differential effect of lipid oxidation on these reactions and the identification of anti-phospholipid antibody populations that selectively inhibit the influence of oxidation.DISCUSSIONThe results from the present studies begin to address several important and unresolved clinical issues. First, the mechanism by which new thrombi or newly injured vessels which are very thrombogenic become less so with time, a process known as “passivation” (50Ma S.-F. Garcia J.G.N. Reuning U. Little S.P. Bang N.U. Dixon E.P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 611-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 51Gallo R. Padurean A. Toschi V. Bichler J. Fallon J.T. Chesebro J.H. Fuster V. Badimon J.J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ability of phospholipid oxidation, a time-dependent process, to enhance APC anticoagulant function would be expected to contribute to this process. Second, although protein S is clinically established as a key component of the anticoagulant pathway with total deficiencies resulting in massive thrombosis, protein S effects on factor Va inactivation observed in purified systems have been relatively modest. As seen in Fig. 2, the ability of protein S to accelerate APC inactivation of factor Va is markedly enhanced by phospholipid oxidation. If oxidation is indeed involved in thrombus passivation, this may demonstrate a potentially important function for protein S in that process. Third, patients with APAs have an increased propensity to thrombose. Oxidized lipids are a target for at least some of these APAs. APAs that can block the ability of theoxidized lipid to enhance anticoagulant function may contribute to a prothrombotic state.Our previous studies indicated the importance of PE and polyunsaturation in the expression of APC activity (6Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Smirnov M.D. Ford D.A. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 49Smirnov M.D. Triplett D.T. Comp P.C. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 309-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The studies reported here indicate yet another feature that distinguishes procoagulant from anticoagulant phospholipid surfaces. We have found that oxidization of the phospholipid membrane further enhances the activity of APC in the factor Va inactivation complex with little or no effect on the prothrombinase reaction. The enhanced factor Va inactivation results in increased anticoagulant activity. That the effect is greater in the presence of protein S in the purified system indicates oxidation may be impacting more than one interaction.The present results demonstrate that lipid oxidation has a significant effect on the ability of APC to block total thrombin generation without significantly influencing thrombin generation in the absence of APC. These findings exclude the possibility that the increased anticoagulant activity in plasma is due to an increase in the lag time before thrombin generation is initiated. It is of interest that studies of deficiency states and inhibitors have demonstrated that the impact on total thrombin generation is usually greater than the effect on the clotting time. Indeed, studies of total thrombin generation were able to demonstrate the presence of an acquired inhibitor of APC in pregnant women and women on birth control pills that is thought to contribute to thrombotic risk (52Rosing J. Tans G. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Oerle R.V. van der Ploeg P.M.E.N. Heijnen P. Hamulyak K. Hemker H.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 97: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Standard coagulation tests failed to detect this inhibitor.For the oxidation to be effective, both PE and PS must be present in addition to a significant degree of polyunsaturation. Based on the studies with APC-PtGla, it is apparent that the oxidation effect is mediated by features of the Gla domain of protein C that differ from those of prothrombin. We demonstrated previously that the PE head group specificity was also resident in the Gla domain of protein C (37Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9031-9040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The requirements for the assembly of the anticoagulant complex include interaction of the enzyme, APC, and the substrate, factor Va, with the membrane surface. Optimal factor Va binding requires the presence of the PS head group, probably explaining the need for PS. APC is essentially inactive in the absence of PE. PE, polyunsaturation, and lipid oxidation all favor formation of hexagonal phase lipids (28Levine J.S. Koh J.S. Subang R. Rauch J. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 1999; 66: 82-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 53Vance, D. E., and Vance, J. (eds) (1991) Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes, Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., AmsterdamGoogle Scholar). Based on the observations that PE, polyunsaturation, and oxidation all favor APC function, we would presume that the oxidation is favoring hexagonal phase lipid formation. This would be consistent with the ability of the anti-PL antibodies to block the oxidation effect as other investigators (54Rauch J. Tannenbaum M. Neville C. Fortin P.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 55Subang R. Levine J.S. Janoff A.S. Davidson S.M. Taraschi T.F. Kioke T. Minchey S.R. Whiteside M. Tannenbaum M. Rauch J. J. Autoimmun. 2000; 15: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have demonstrated these antibodies bind preferentially to hexagonal phase phospholipids and that oxidation can enhance their binding.We have not yet obtained a liposome composition using synthetically produced phospholipids that is as effective as the naturally occurring brain-derived phospholipids. This may be due to the progressive loss of liposome structure during the oxidation process of highly unsaturated phospholipids. This is quite possibly a function of the difficulty to control the rate of oxidation in these preparations. When these liposomes are oxidized in the absence of copper, greater APC activity is observed after an extended period, but the unpredictability of this reaction makes it impractical for detailed study.One constituent present in the brain-derived material that is absent in the synthetic mixtures is various plasmalogen forms of PE that may serve to stabilize the membranes (45Khaselev N. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although possibly serving this role, plasmalogens themselves are not sufficient for the effect, as liposomes composed solely of brain-derived PC and PE, which contain the plasmalogens, lack any enhancing activity after oxidation. Lysophospholipid or conjugated diene derivatives of the fatty acid side chains are also not sufficient to support the enhanced activity of these membranes. Conjugated diene formation was a useful monitor of oxidation. However, experiments using soybean lipoxygenase, which produces only conjugated dienes (42Perez-Gilabert M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 354: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), failed to produce enhanced activity, even though the concentration of conjugated dienes formed was equivalent to or greater than that observed in the copper-oxidized phospholipids (data not shown). Although conjugated triene formation appears to correlate with activity in the data presented, this was not always the case (data not shown). Attempts to produce trienes specifically to directly test whether their formation is sufficient have not been successful. Only a small degree of oxidation of the phospholipids (<4%) is required for the observed effects as monitored by conjugated diene/triene formation. Thus, isolation and identification of the putative moieties responsible for the activity will require sensitive and extensive investigation. Such studies are ongoing.Very recently, Weinstein et al. (32Weinstein E.A. Li H. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Axelsen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22925-22930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported on enhanced prothrombinase activity in the presence of oxidized 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-PC (18:0, 20:4-PC) (SAPC). However, the conditions used by these authors are very different from those used in the studies reported here, making comparisons difficult. In the cited reference, other than the SAPC, the vesicles are composed of dimyristoyl (14:0, 14:0)-PC and/or -PS. These are very sterically hindered nonphysiological forms of these molecules. Extremely strong oxidation conditions (2 mm H2O2 and 200 μm CuSO4) are used relative to the mild conditions used here (10 μm CuSO4 and air), which will most likely yield different products. The use of EDTA at concentrations as high as 75 mm may also result in unexpected effects. Butylated hydroxytoluene is added to all mixtures to stop oxidation. However, it may also be incorporated into the vesicles used for the prothrombinase reactions and have direct effects on observed activity. The tocopherols (and ascorbic acid to some extent), used in some experiments to block oxidation, would be coextracted with the SAPC and presumably reincorporated into the vesicles used for the prothrombinase reactions. Incorporation of tocopherols into membranes has been found to decrease membrane fluidity (56Arora A. Byrem T.M. Nair M.G. Strasburg G.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 57Urano S. Yano K. Matsuo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), further complicating interpretation of these experiments. Indeed, the reversal of the known effects of unsaturated fatty acids (in this case, SAPC whether or not it is oxidized) on prothrombinase activity (58Kung C. Hayes E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25838-25848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 59Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Janssen M.P. Zwaal R.F.A. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10000-10008Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) would argue for a direct effect of the lipophilic antioxidants on the membrane structure, further complicating interpretation of these experiments.In addition to cell or platelet surfaces, plasma lipoproteins have been found to be active in the coagulation reactions. Both Rota et al. (60Rota S. McWilliam N.A. Baglin T.P. Byrne C.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Moyer et al. (61Moyer M.P. Tracy R.P. Tracy P.B. Van't Veer C. Sparks C.E. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 458-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) observed very low density lipoproteins supported prothrombin generation. Rota et al. (60Rota S. McWilliam N.A. Baglin T.P. Byrne C.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 508-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also found that copper oxidation of the low density (LDL) population led to a marked increase in prothrombin activation. However, oxidation of the other lipoprotein classes did not lead to enhanced activation. Since the authors showed that the relative concentration and composition of phospholipids did not vary significantly between the lipoprotein populations, oxidation of the phospholipid per se was unlikely to be the major mechanism of the enhanced anticoagulant activity. More likely, oxidation of the protein moieties in the LDL permitted improved display of the phospholipid present in these particles. Griffin et al. (62Griffin J.H. Kojima K. Banka C.L. Curtiss L.K. Fernandez J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) observed APC anticoagulant function on high density lipoprotein particles but not LDL. Neither very low density lipoproteins nor the effect of oxidation on any of the lipoproteins was investigated.When a coagulant stimulus is generated, leukocytes are recruited into the forming clot (63Palabrica T. Lobb R. Furie B.C. Aronovitz M. Benjamin C. Hsu Y.M. Sajer S.A. Furie B. Nature. 1992; 359: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 64Taylor Jr., F.B. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Ferrell G. Chang A.C.K. Laszik Z. Kosanke S. Peer G. Esmon C.T. Blood. 2000; 95: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet activation occurring during this time results in the expression of P-selectin on the platelet surface, serving to rosette the incoming neutrophils and monocytes around the activated platelet (65Yang J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Lipid oxidation as a result of the leukocyte-platelet interaction leads to the evolution of lipoxins, eicosanoids with anti-inflammatory effects including inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis (66Serhan C.N. Haeggstrom J.Z. Leslie C.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 67Brady H.R. Serhan C.N. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1996; 5: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Activation of the adherent leukocytes may also enhance the anticoagulant properties of the platelet through lipid oxidation.Relative to phospholipid surfaces, the platelet expresses a relatively high prothrombinase activity compared with their ability to support factor Va inactivation (68Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Simioni P. Girolami A. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1998; 91: 2818-2829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this in vitroobservation, it has been shown that APC (69Gruber A. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Hanson S.R. Blood. 1989; 73: 639-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or thrombin infusion which elicits APC formation (70Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), can block platelet deposition on thrombogenic surfaces, a system that has been shown previously to involve thrombin formation. The latter observations are opposite to what would be predicted from the in vitro experiments. We would propose that the key difference between the in vitroand in vivo results may be leukocyte-mediated oxidation that helps passivise the developing thrombus. The mechanisms responsible for this process are unknown and undoubtedly complex. Lipid oxidation caused by the adherent leukocytes could contribute significantly to this phenomenon that is critical for successful vascular repair. The first response to a low or moderate inflammatory stimulus would be the development of a procoagulant surface. As leukocytes enter the clot, oxidation of cell surfaces would begin after a time lag. The anticoagulant response would then be promoted to prevent excessive thrombus growth. Membrane constituents such as plasmalogens (45Khaselev N. Murphy R.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 71Hahnel D. Thiery J. Brosche T. Engelmann B. Arerioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or sphingomyelin (72Subbaiah P.V. Subramanian V.S. Wang K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36409-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) may help stabilize minimally oxidized surfaces to maintain APC activity for a longer period. The red cell membrane could also be oxidized by the infiltrating leukocytes in addition to the platelets normally envisioned, possibly adding anticoagulant surface despite the externalization of PS and PE that can occur on these cells in response to oxidation (15Jain S.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).The effect of oxidation on the APC complex may also further differentiate subclasses of autoimmune antibodies. Previously we showed that plasma or immunoglobulin derived from at least a subset of lupus patients could inhibit APC function selectively in a PE-dependent manner (37Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Regan L. Mather T. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Rezaie A.R. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9031-9040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 49Smirnov M.D. Triplett D.T. Comp P.C. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 309-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although normal precautions against oxidation were taken, including storage under argon and usage within 1 week of liposome preparation, the oxidation state of the phospholipids used in those studies was not specifically known. In a small sampling of patients, immunoglobulin populations have been identified that inhibit APC anticoagulant activity on oxidized phospholipids much more effectively than on nonoxidized liposomes. It is not known how common this r"

As a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein, Env is cotranslationally translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum. In this report, we characterized the synthesis of Env, which did not occur at a constant rate but by translational/translocational pausing that has not previously been shown with a viral encoded glycoprotein. Overall translation was not impeded by the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol in vivo, although this did influence the cleavage of the precursor gp160 into its mature form, gp120. Env interacts transiently with resident components of the endoplasmic reticulum such as calnexin, which had maximal association at a 10-min post-translation. Addition of the glucosidase inhibitor, castanospermine, failed to significantly influence the association of Env with calnexin, consistent with the notion that calnexin recognizes components other than α-terminal glucose. Moreover, castanospermine treatment failed to affect the infectivity of virions. Taken together, this report demonstrates the existence of translational/translocational pausing for a viral glycoprotein and suggests that trimming of glucose from HIV-1 Env is not essential for the initiation of virus infection.

Protein expression of Gag and Pol is directed from full-length viral genomic RNA, which is also packaged as a dimer into virions. Gag protein expression is sufficient to drive the budding and assembly of virions from the plasma membrane (1Freed E.O. Virology. 1998; 251: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), while the Pol proteins act as the major enzymatic components of the retrovirus life cycle. Env (gp160) traffics through the secretory pathway as a type I integral membrane protein and is cleaved into its gp120 and gp41 forms by a cellular protease that resides in the medial to trans Golgi network (2Willey R.L. Bonifacino J.S. Potts B.J. Martin M.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9580-9584Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 3Hunter E. Swanstrom R. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23883-23886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). During the budding process, virions acquire a portion of the host cell membrane containing the Env molecule, which is composed of two subunits, the surface domain or gp120 and the transmembrane protein or gp41. After gp120 successfully binds CD4 and its respective coreceptor, it is thought that a conformational switch occurs to expose the fusion peptide of gp41. This then leads to the fusion of the viral membrane and the new target cell to initiate a new round of infection. The translation of Env (gp160) begins as a coupled event with ER translocation. The N terminus of Env encodes a signal sequence, which as it emerges from a translating ribosome is recognized by the signal recognition particle complex. The binding of the signal recognition particle to the leader sequence recruits the emerging nascent polypeptide to the Sec61p/translocon of the ER (6Matlack K.E.S. Mothes W. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 381-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The ribosome then forms a tight seal over the cytosolic side of the ER membrane at the translocon pore as the protein is translated. Translocation then proceeds with the proposed assistance of ER lumenal components such as BiP (7Vogel J. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Nguyen T.H. Law D.T.S. Williams D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been demonstrated that certain proteins do not undergo a translationally coupled translocation at a steady rate, but rather that amino acid coding regions of certain proteins dictate translocational pausing (11Chuck L.M. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These pause-transfer sequences mediate the stopping and restarting of translocation during which the protein-conducting channel becomes partially opened, exposing the nascent chain polypeptide to the cytosol (12Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These studies have raised the notion that in addition to the ribosome and the lumenal components of the ER, the nascent chain may regulate translocation. During protein translocation into the ER, the signal peptide is cleaved by the signal peptidase, and the growing nascent polypeptide chain is modified by the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides within the lumen of the ER. Alteration in the glycosylation of Env has been shown to impact the folding of Env (13Fennie C. Lasky L.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 639-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lee W.-R., Yu, X.-F. Syu W.-J.

Virol. 1994; 68: 4636-4642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the role of the ER lumenal chaperones in translocation of nascent polypeptides, BiP, protein-disulfide isomerase, and 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein act to prevent the misfolding of these proteins (16Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Melnick J. Dul J.L. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The lectin-like molecular chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin, have been shown to promote the folding and assembly of glycoproteins within the ER (18Degen E. Williams D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 19Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Data have emerged suggesting that the association of the oxidoreductase, ERp57, in a complex with either calnexin or calreticulin regulates oxidation and isomerization of newly synthesized glycoproteins (21Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that calnexin acts on emerging glycoproteins through its association with their sugar residues (23Zapun A. Petrescu S.A. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); however, this has been disputed in a study in which calnexin was shown to prevent the aggregation of nonglycosylated proteins in vitro (24Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Several reports have shown that the treatment of cells with drugs that inhibit α-glucosidase, such as castanospermine (CST) and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), interfere with the ability of calnexin to associate with glycoproteins in the ER (25Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). This results in the inability of these molecules to fold properly leading to their retention within the ER (26Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Following the misfolding of proteins within the ER, they undergo a degradative process, probably mediated by the cytosolic 26 S proteasome (27Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The treatment of HIV-1-infected cells with α-glucosidase inhibitors was shown to interfere with syncytia formation (28Gruters R.A. Neefjes J.J. Tersmette M. de Goede R.E.Y. Tulp A. Huisman H.G. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1987; 330: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 29Walker B.D. Kowalski M. Goh W.C. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. Rosen C. Rohrschneider L. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). However, gp120, expressed in the presence of DNJ (13Fennie C. Lasky L.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 639-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NB-DNJ demonstrated no difference in their abilities to bind to CD4 or to bind to T-cells (30Fischer P.B. Collin M. Karlsson G.B. James W. Butters T.D. Davis S.J. Gordon S. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5791-5797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies brought us to re-examine the effects that α-glucosidase inhibitors have on HIV-1 infection. In this report, we examined the biosynthesis of gp160 Env as it is translated and translocated into the ER. It was revealed that Env undergoes several translational/translocational pauses, which are ATP-dependent but not dependent on disulfide bond formation. Additionally, Env associates with calnexin in HIV-1-infected T-cells independent of the glucose trimming pathway. Moreover, the treatment of HIV-1-infected T-cells with CST fails to interfere with its secretory pathway trafficking or infectivity on susceptible target cells. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and passaged upon confluence. H9 cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics and maintained at a density of <1 × 106cells/ml. COS-7 cells were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method. Briefly, COS-7 cells were trypsinized and seeded at 50% confluence 24 h prior to transfection. Cells (5 × 106) were then trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of TD buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 0.7 mm K2HPO4) containing 500 μg of DEAE-dextran and 5 μg of HXB2 or HXB2NEO (31Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection was carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and the cells were then washed in 5 ml of complete medium and reseeded in T-75 flasks. CST was added directly to the tissue culture medium at the time of transfection. Cell culture supernatants containing viral particles were harvested 3 days after transfection, precleared by centrifugation in a Sorvall RT 6000B centrifuge at 3,000 × g for 30 min, filtered through a 0.2-μm pore size membrane, and used for infectivity analysis. Virions were pelleted through a 30% sucrose cushion at 100,000 × g for 90 min. H9 cells chronically infected with HXB2NEO were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min in cysteine-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum. When performing rapid pulse-chase, pulse labeling was performed for 2 min in cysteine-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), otherwise longer pulse labelings were performed in the presence of 200 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine. The pulse was ended by adding prewarmed RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum with 5 mm cysteine. After various chase time periods, the cells were transferred to ice and washed twice in ice-cold PBS (32Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Alternatively, following the 2-min pulse labeling either cycloheximide (CHX, 0.5 mm) or dithiothreitol (DTT, 5 mm) was added to the chase media, or ATP was depleted from cells by the addition of prewarmed glucose-free media with 20 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose and 10 mmsodium azide (33Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 357: 260-262Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Additionally, H9 cells were incubated with 200 μm CST (Sigma) for 45 min prior to pulse labeling, and the drug remained present throughout the pulse-chase period. For immunoprecipitation of Env, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Triton, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. For coimmunoprecipitation of Env and calnexin, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 2% CHAPS, 50 mmHepes (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. Nuclei were pelleted for 5 min at 1,500 × g, and postnuclear supernatant was incubated with either sheep anti-gp120 antiserum (AIDS Research Reagents Program, catalog number 288) or rabbit anti-calnexin antiserum (Stressgene) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 3 h. Immunoprecipitated samples were washed 3 times in their respective lysis buffers, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Virion-associated viral proteins were prepared from cell culture supernatants by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 30 min in a Sorvall RT 6000B centrifuge followed by filtration of the supernatants through a 0.2-μm membrane. Virus particle-containing supernatants were concentrated by centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion at 100,000 × g for 90 min in a Sorvall Ultra80. Viral pellets were resuspended in PBS. Cell-associated viral proteins were analyzed by direct lysis of cells (1 × 105) in 1 × loading dye (0.08m Tris, pH 6.8, 2.0% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mdithiothreitol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue), samples were boiled for 10 min, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were probed with HIV-1-positive human serum (1:200) or sheep anti-serum against gp120 (1:500). Blots were developed using an alkaline phosphatase reaction. Cell-associated viral proteins were lysed in the presence of 1% Triton, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors. Postnuclear supernatants were then boiled for 5 min and treated with PNGase F (Genzyme) for 18 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1% Nonidet P-40. Samples were boiled for 10 min in SDS-PAGE loading dye and subjected to immunoblotting. Viral supernatants from COS-7 transfected cells were pelleted through 30% sucrose as described above and resuspended in PBS. Virions were normalized by reverse transcriptase activity as described previously (31Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 10,000 cpm equivalent of virus was used to initiate an infection. Infections were performed in triplicate using HeLa CD4-LTR-β-gal cells as targets. Assays were performed as described previously (34Klimpton J. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2232-2239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1 Env protein is synthesized as a 160-kDa glycoprotein (gp160). The cleavage of gp160 to gp120 and gp41 indicates the trafficking of Env through the Golgi stacks. The mature gp120 molecule arises as a cleavage product of gp160 initially at ∼80 min post-translation as demonstrated in a pulse-chase analysis of H9 infected cells (Fig. 1 A). Additionally, a band of faster mobility than gp160, which reacted with the anti-Env antisera, was observed in the 0 min chase lane (as indicated with an asterisk; Fig. 1 A). Because this band was chased out at later time points, we reasoned that it might be a translational/translocational intermediate of gp160. In steady-state labeling of H9 infected cell lines, the presence of the Env precursor (gp160) and the mature cleaved form of gp120 was evident (Fig. 1 B). Upon treatment of gp160 and gp120 with PNGase F to remove the N-linked sugars, these molecules migrated more rapidly, consistent with molecular mass of ∼100 and 60 kDa, respectively. A light band between gp120 and gp160 was detected (Fig.1 B, left panel). This protein band is likely to be a translationally arrested product because its size dropped to ∼90 kDa after treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 1 B, right panel). We next examined the biosynthesis of gp160 during the time of protein translation. HIV-1-infected cells were pulse-labeled for 2 min and chased for up to 10 min to examine the translational intermediate products. Surprisingly, distinct bands, which were immunoprecipitated with an antiserum against gp160 but of lower molecular weight, were observed (Fig. 2 A). These molecules were evident during very brief labeling periods and could be chased out during the time period examined. To examine whether these molecules were translational/translocational intermediates, CHX was added during the pulse period to stall translation, which resulted in the sustained presence of these lower molecular weight Env (gp160) intermediates (Fig. 2 B). We additionally analyzed Env-related polypeptides, which were either treated with CHX or left untreated during their biosynthesis, and ran them side-by-side on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 C). With the addition of deoxy-d-glucose and sodium azide to the tissue culture system to deplete ATP (33Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 357: 260-262Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we observed a similar pausing of the Env protein during translation (Fig. 2 D). Disruption of disulfide bond formation by the addition of DTT to the chase media of infected cells (35Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) failed to significantly impede translation of Env (Fig. 2 E). Because translation and ER translocation are thought to be coupled in mammalian cells, it remained difficult to make a distinction between these two steps. These data demonstrate that the synthesis of the Env glycoprotein does not proceed at a steady rate but rather is marked by periods of translational/translocational pausing. We next wanted to test the effect of DTT addition on the stability and cleavage of Env in infected cells. In a pulse-chase analysis, the addition of DTT to the chase media interfered with the cleavage of gp160 into its gp120 form (Fig.3 B). When steady-state labeling experiments were performed in the presence of DTT, not only were the higher molecular weight Env-related complexes disrupted (as indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 3 C), but the overall abundance of gp160 was diminished. These data are consistent with the notion that misfolding of Env causes it to be subjected to the quality control mechanisms within the ER, leading to its ER retention and removal by decay pathways. One of the mechanisms by which functional maturation of glycoproteins proceeds is through their association with resident ER chaperones. One such molecule, calnexin, has been shown to retain misfolded molecules within the ER in part via recognition of the α-terminal glucose ofN-linked glycoproteins (25Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Again, using pulse-chase analysis with antisera against Env (Fig.4 A) and calnexin (Fig.4 B), an association between gp160 and calnexin was shown to have a t 1/2 of 10 min after the initiation of Env synthesis (Fig. 4 B). To examine what role the α-terminal glucose had on the association of Env with calnexin, cells were treated with an α-glucosidase inhibitor, CST, prior to radiolabeling. Mock-infected and HXB2-infected cells were pulse-labeled and -chased for 60 min followed by immunoprecipitation with antiserum to Env and CN. Here we observed no significant disruption of the association of gp160 and calnexin with CST treatment (Fig. 5 A). Treatment of infected cells with CST caused Env to have a slower mobility by SDS-PAGE (indicated by arrowheads). As a control, infected cells that were labeled with [35S]cysteine for 10 min in the presence of DTT caused the association between gp160 and CN to be significantly disrupted (Fig. 5 B, lanes 6 and8). In contrast, the treatment of HIV-1-infected cells with CST did not appear to impact the interaction between Env and CN (Fig.5 B, lanes 5 and 7). Besides the effects that CST treatment has on the glucose trimming of Env, we addressed whether it had any additional impact on the formation and infectivity of virions. When CST was added in increasing concentrations, a mobility shift in Env was evident for the cell-associated molecules (Fig.6 A, indicated byarrows), however no significant differences were observed for the Gag-related proteins or for reverse transcriptase within the cell (Fig. 6 B). Env was present in similar quantities within cell-free virions irrespective of whether viral producer cells were grown in CST (Fig. 6 C), indicating that CST has little influence on the trafficking or retention of Env through the secretory pathway. In addition, virion-associated Gag, Integrase, reverse transcriptase, and gp41 were not significantly altered by CST treatment (Fig. 6 D) nor was the infectivity of CST-treated virions impeded in a MAGI assay (Fig. 6 E).Figure 5Effects of CST and DTT treatment on HIV-1 Env association with calnexin. A, H9 mock-infected or HXB2-infected cells were treated with 200 μm CST 45 min prior to pulse labeling with [35S]cysteine for 10 min and chased for 60 min in the presence of CST. B, H9 infected cells were labeled for 10 min with [35S]cysteine either in the absence of modifying chemicals or in the presence of 200 mm CST, 5 mm DTT, or a combination of both.

Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In fact, nascent polypeptides containing specific amino acid sequences, termed pause-transfer sequences, have been demonstrated to induce temporary pauses in translocation that coincide with nascent chain accessibility to the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (11Chuck L.M. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Hegde R.S. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1996; 85: 217-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These observations for translational/translocational pausing from an in vitrosystem have also been supported by evidence in tissue culture cells with apolipoprotein B (37Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this report we examined the biosynthesis of the Env protein in HIV-1-infected T-cells during the time of translation/translocation into the ER. We find several pause-transfer points as part of normal ER translocation, experiments which have not been reported for a viral protein previously (Fig. 2). This temporary pausing and restarting of cotranslational translocation was, as expected, dependent on the ribosomal passage over the envmRNA because CHX treatment impeded further translation/translocation. Additionally, restarting of the paused intermediates was dependent on ATP, which might suggest the involvement of the ER translocation components rather than strictly the translational machinery. It has previously been noted that ER lumenal proteins, which use ATP as an energy source, may regulate the translocation of nascent chain proteins into the ER (7Vogel J. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 8Nguyen T.H. Law D.T.S. Williams D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1565-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Sanders S.L. Whitfield K.M. Vogel J.P. Rose M.D. Schekman R.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 353-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, demonstration of cytosolic Hsp70 binding to nascent chains of apolipoprotein B in an ATP-dependent manner suggests the additional involvement of non-ER lumenal components in cotranslational translocation (38Zhou M. Wu X. Huang L.S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25220-25224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although the existence of pause-transfer sites may be dependent on the amino acid sequences within the nascent chain polypeptide itself (11Chuck L.M. Lingappa V.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 9-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the restarting of these pausing events may require additional associating molecules. The varied rate of translation/translocation of HIV-1 Env highlights an additional level of regulation. By pausing during translation/translocation of the nascent chain polypeptide, the addition of sugars and chaperone-assisted folding may occur in a regional manner to ensure the production of functional Env. Our data suggest that the restarting of Env pause sites during its biosynthesis appears to be dependent on translation as well as ATP and not the formation of disulfide bonds. The ER houses several molecule chaperones such as BiP, protein-disulfide isomerase, 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein, calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57, which serve to prevent the misfolding of newly synthesized glycoproteins (25Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). To this end, misfolded proteins tend to be retrieved from further transport through the secretory pathway until properly folded. This understanding has raised the notion that the ER acts as a cellular quality control compartment (25Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Retention of misfolded molecules within the ER usually leads to their degradation (26Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), a process dependent on the cytosolic 26 S proteasome (27Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). ER misfolding pathways may be studied by the introduction of mutations into glycoproteins and by the addition of chemicals, such as DTT, which disrupt the disulfide bonding of these molecules (35Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The use of DTT to treat HIV-1-infected T-cells had little effect on the restarting of Env translational/translocational pause intermediates (Fig. 2 E), however it did result in a failure of gp160 to reach the Golgi compartment as evidenced by the absence of the cleaved gp120 form of Env (Fig. 3). DTT additionin vivo consequently leads to a marked reduction in the overall levels of Env (Fig. 3 C, lane 2), which was independent of its translation/translocation (Fig. 3 B). ER resident chaperones are thought to associate with newly synthesized glycoproteins to regulate their folding and retain misfolded molecules within the ER. Because the addition of DTT disrupted the association between Env and calnexin (Fig. 5 B), it suggests that other chaperones may dictate the retention of misfolded Env within the ER. For example, BiP has been shown to bind newly synthesized glycoproteins in a sequential manner prior to calnexin (39Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It has been shown that treatment of cells with CST, an α-glucosidase inhibitor, can disrupt the association of calnexin with various viral glycoproteins because calnexin is thought to recognize the trimmed monoglucosylated form of these glycoproteins (22Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 25Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 39Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 40Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). However, the association of HIV-1 Env with calnexin after treatment with CST appeared to be unaltered (Fig. 5). This is consistent with a previous report that demonstrated that CST treatment failed to abolish the association of gp160 with calnexin (41Otteken A. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 97-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that calnexin does not recognize HIV-1 Env only through its interaction with the monoglucosylated core glycans. In a recent report, it was demonstrated that calnexin recognized the polypeptide portion of unfolded molecules in vitro, suggesting that it may not be acting solely as a lectin-associating chaperone (24Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although association of calnexin and Env in infected T-cells may not be dependent on the glucosylation state of Env, we cannot rule out the possibility of subtle interaction differences between CST-treated and untreated samples. Additionally it could be argued that Env association with calnexin may be through a trimeric complex with ERp57 and that this thiol-dependent reductase plays a more critical role in this particular association (21Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). It remains possible that calnexin binds the unfolded state of Env and plays a role in preventing the aggregation of misfolded molecules. This remains intriguing considering the association of translation/translocation intermediates of gp160 with calnexin in the earliest chase times (Fig. 4 B, 2 and 5 min). Although the inhibition of terminal glucose trimming demonstrated limited disruption in calnexin association with Env, their inaction may still be critical for the formation of functionally active Env. Previous studies have examined the effects of CST on HIV-1-infected cells and have shown a reduction in the formation of syncytia and virus infectivity (28Gruters R.A. Neefjes J.J. Tersmette M. de Goede R.E.Y. Tulp A. Huisman H.G. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1987; 330: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 29Walker B.D. Kowalski M. Goh W.C. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. Rosen C. Rohrschneider L. Haseltine W.A. Sodroski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These reports have either assayed the effect of CST on viral replication in multiple rounds or have used cell culture supernatants containing CST as a source of virus input. Because CST does not specifically target viral glycoproteins, it remained plausible that its use may confer sublethal cell toxicity that could alter other molecules of cellular origin effecting virus cell-to-cell spread. In the present study, we observed little to no effect in the inhibition of infectivity of cell-free virions produced in the presence of CST (Fig.6 E). The differences in the results may be explained by the fact that we tested cell-free virions in a one-round infectivity assay rather than growing virally infected cells in the presence of α-glucosidase inhibitors over the course of several days. Additionally, we removed all CST from the cell culture supernatants by pelleting virus before infecting target cells, thus minimizing the effects CST may have on these cells. In fact, we demonstrate that CST caused a retardation in the mobility of both gp160 and gp120, characteristic of the absence of glucose trimming of these molecules (Fig. 6). Additionally, the treatment of HIV-1-infected cells with CST has no significant impact on the virion incorporation of gp120 and gp41, suggesting that trafficking of Env through the secretory pathway was unimpeded. These results are consistent with reports using DNJ and NB-DNJ to inhibit glucosidase I and II in the production of Env, which demonstrated no effect on CD4 binding (13Fennie C. Lasky L.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 639-646Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fischer P.B. Collin M. Karlsson G.B. James W. Butters T.D. Davis S.J. Gordon S. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5791-5797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, treatment of HIV-1-infected cells with NB-DNJ did display a post-CD4 binding entry defect (30Fischer P.B. Collin M. Karlsson G.B. James W. Butters T.D. Davis S.J. Gordon S. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5791-5797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was not observed with CST treatment (Fig.6 E). These differences may be explained because NB-DNJ inhibits ER glucosidases generally (42Saunier B.R. Kilker D.J. Tkacz J.S. Quaroni A. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14155-14161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), potentially conferring a more severe phenotype. Our data suggest that glucose trimming is not essential for the initiation of cell-free virus infection nor does it significantly influence the association of HIV-1 Env with calnexin.

Activation of gene expression by Ca2+ regulates fundamental biological responses, including cell cycle, hormone secretion, and cell morphology (1Hardingham G.E. Bading H. Microsc. Res.

Src family kinases are involved in a broad range of cellular responses ranging from cell division and cytoskeletal rearrangement in fibroblasts to the differentiation of neuronal PC12 cells (3Kremer N.E.

McGrath J.P. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Many putative substrate proteins have been identified. Ras and Raf have been reported to be required for the transformed phenotype induced by v-Src (7Jiang H. Lu Z. Luo J.Q. Wolfman A. Foster D.A. J. Biol.

Although Ras is not a substrate of v-Src, and Raf is phosphorylated on tyrosine, Raf functions downstream of Ras (9Alexandropoulos K. Qureshi S.A. Bruder J. Rapp U.R. Foster D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 731-737PubMed Google Scholar). The immediate early gene pip92 was cloned from activated T lymphocytes treated with cycloheximide (10Coleclough C. Kuhn L. Lefkovitz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and serum-stimulated BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts (11Charles C.H. Simske J.S. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6769-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). pip92 is rapidly and transiently induced by stimulation with serum and growth factors in fibroblasts. In addition to cell growth, pip92 is also induced during neuronal differentiation by differentiating factors (12Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Althoughpip92 encodes a short-lived, proline-rich protein with no significant sequence similarity to any known protein, little is known about the function of its encoded protein. Previously it was shown that thapsigargin-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) (13Chao T.S. Byron K.L. Lee K.M. Villereal M. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19876-19883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This activation is independent of protein kinase C or Ca2+influx but requires the presence of Raf-1 (14Chao T.S. Foster D.A. Rapp U. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Src-tyrosine kinase mediates the stimulation of Raf-1 and ERK by thapsigargin (15Chao T.S. Abe M. Herschenson M.B. Gomes I. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3168-3173PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have observed that pip92 is expressed in the mouse brain after a single intraperitoneal injection of excitatory amino acid NMDA (16Chung K.C. Shin S.W. Yoo M. Lee M.Y. Lee H.W. Choe B.K. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Many actions of NMDA are coupled to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ mediated directly or indirectly by its receptor present in neurons, and transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels are known to trigger a number of cellular responses, including change of gene expression (17Bading H. Hardingham G.E. Johnson C.M. Chawla S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 541-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Ca2+is known to activate ERK signaling in neuronal PC12 and H19-7 cells (15Chao T.S. Abe M. Herschenson M.B. Gomes I. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3168-3173PubMed Google Scholar, 18Egea J. Espinet C. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 75-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the basis of those findings, it was suggested that the calcium ion and Src kinase could regulate the pip92expression. To resolve the mechanism of thapsigargin-induced cell growth, we analyzed whether pip92 expression is induced by thapsigargin subsequently followed by intracellular free Ca2+ mobilization and whether the activation of ERK and Src kinase is involved. The results indicated that an increase of intracellular calcium ion levels by thapsigargin stimulatespip92 expression via ERK- as well as Src kinase-dependent signaling pathways, suggesting thatpip92 is likely to play a role in thapsigargin-induced neuronal cell growth. Fetal bovine serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and G418 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Thapsigargin, ionomycin, and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem.

The cells were cultured at 33 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/ml G418 to maintain selection pressure on the transduced immortalization vector. When specified, cells were pretreated with 30 μm synthetic MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 30 min before drug stimulation. DNA synthesis was measured by use of [3H]thymidine incorporation. The H19-7 cells were suspended by trypsinization, counted, and replated into 24-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells/well in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h to decrease the cell proliferation and to induce quiescence. Then the media were changed to DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum with or without thapsigargin. The cells were incubated with thymidine (1 μCi/well) during the last 4 h. At the end of the incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with cold DMEM and then solubilized with Protosol (NEN Life Science Products). Radioactivity was measured with a Beckman scintillation counter. For Ca2+ measurement, Fura-2 loading and fluorescence analyses were carried out as described previously (20Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on a sterile 22 × 22-mm coverslip at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2. At the confluence of 70–80%, the cells were washed twice with a HEPES-buffered solution (solution A) and loaded with Fura-2 by a 30-min incubation at room temperature in solution A containing 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Solution A contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. After the loading, the coverslips were washed once with solution A and assembled to form the bottom of perfusion chamber. The chamber was continuously perfused with either a Ca2+-containing solution (solution A) or a Ca2+-free solution (solution B). Ca2+-free solution B was prepared by replacing CaCl2 with 3 mm EGTA. The osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 310 mOsm with the major salts before use. Fluorescence was measured and calibrated using a PTI system (PTI Delta Ram, New Brunswick, NJ) as described previously (20Lee M.G. Zeng W. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32951-32955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fura-2 fluorescence was excited at 355 and 380 nm and calibrated by exposing the cells to solutions containing high and low concentrations of Ca2+ and 10 μmionomycin. Transient transfection was performed by using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid pCMV-GAL, which contains the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene driven by the cytomegalovirus, promoter was used as an internal control to determine transfection efficiency. The CAT assay was done with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay CAT assay kit (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Total cellular RNAs from H19-7 cells were isolated by the single-step extraction procedure using guanidium isothiocyanate as described elsewhere (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis to measure pip92 mRNA levels was done as described previously (12Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Src-tyrosine kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of rabbit muscle enolase as described previously (15Chao T.S. Abe M. Herschenson M.B. Gomes I. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3168-3173PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the phosphorylation level of enolase was measured by scintillation counting of excised protein bands. ERK2 kinase activity was measured by immunoprecipitation of the epitope-tagged Erk2, followed by an in vitrophosphorylation assay as described previously (12Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were stimulated and lysed with solution C, consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mmNa2EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm p-methylsulfonylfluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm sodiumo-vanadate, pH 10.0, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, and 0.1 g/mlp-nitrophenylphosphate. The cell lysates were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose coupled with the anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 24 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed with lysis buffer and with kinase reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm o-vanadate, and 10 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate. The assay of immunoprecipitated HA-tagged ERK2 was done using myelin basic protein as a substrate as described previously (12Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from H19-7 cells as described elsewhere (22Xu J. Wu Y. He L. Yang Y. Moore S.A. Hsu C.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An electrophoretic mobility shift analysis assay was performed as described previously (23Chung K.C. Kim S.M. Rhang S. Lau L.F. Gomes I. Ahn Y.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4676-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vitroElk1 phosphorylation by using gluthathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was examined as described previously (23Chung K.C. Kim S.M. Rhang S. Lau L.F. Gomes I. Ahn Y.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4676-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immortalized H19-7 cells were generated from rat hippocampal neurons. Initially, we investigated how the stimulation of the H19-7 cells with thapsigargin affects cell growth. Thapsigargin in the range of 0.1–10 μg/ml induced a concentration-dependent increase in DNA synthesis measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig.1). Stimulation of the cells with 10 μg/ml thapsigargin for 24 h increased the DNA incorporation ∼1.6-fold compared with that of control cells in the absence of thapsigargin. These data indicated that thapsigargin stimulates the proliferation of neuronal H19-7 cells. To examine whether thapsigargin causes a change in intracellular calcium levels, cells were preloaded with Fura-2 and then monitored for changes in intracellular calcium after exposure to thapsigargin in medium containing 1 mmcalcium. The time courses of calcium mobilization by thapsigargin are shown in Fig. 2. By ∼5 min after addition of 10 μg/ml thapsigargin, cytosolic free calcium levels had increased from ∼70 to 250 nm, followed by a long plateau. Although there was some variation in the shape of the calcium profile, depending on the particular cell being monitored, in general thapsigargin caused a gradual increase followed by a long plateau phase. Ionomycin also increases the calcium levels by channeling through membranes from a nonspecific source (24Kauffman R.F. Taylor R.W. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2735-2739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the same way, addition of 1 μm ionomycin increased the intracellular calcium levels up to ∼1500 nm, reaching a peak by 1–2 min. Addition of EGTA to the cells during the plateau phase dropped the calcium down to basal levels. Next we examined whether intracellular calcium mobilization induced by thapsigargin causes the stimulation of pip92expression in H19-7 cells. We first measured the time course ofpip92 mRNA expression by thapsigargin. Northern blot analysis showed that pip92 is expressed rapidly and transiently within 30–60 min after 10 μg/ml thapsigargin stimulation (Fig. 3 A) but not with vehicle. Transcriptional activation of the pip92 gene was examined by using a CAT reporter plasmid linked to a −1281-base pairpip92 promoter fragment (−1281pip92/CAT) transiently expressed in H19-7 cells. The −1281-base pairpip92 promoter fragment was shown to mediate serum induction in a manner that closely mimics the endogenous gene (25Latinkic B.V. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23163-23170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with 10 μg/ml thapsigargin caused rapid stimulation ofpip92 transcriptional activity, which reached a plateau by 1 h as monitored by CAT assay (Fig. 3 B). Mock-transfected control cells did not activate the pip92promoter (data not shown). A similar level of pip92 mRNA and its transcription were induced with 1 μm calcium ionophore ionomycin, and an additive increase of pip92transcription was not observed by the cotreatment with thapsigargin and ionomycin (data not shown). Many studies demonstrated a role for pp60 SRC -tyrosine kinase (Src) in Ca2+-induced cell cycle progression and mitogenesis (26Broome M.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16798-16806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Erpel T. Alonso G. Roche S. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16807-16812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). To test that Src kinase functions as a mediator for thapsigargin and calcium signaling in H19-7 cells, we assayed the Src kinase activity in response to thapsigargin. Fig. 4 A shows that thapsigargin activates Src-tyrosine kinase 2.5-fold. Transfection of kinase-deficient Src mutant resulted in the inhibition of thapsigargin-induced Src kinase activity to the basal level in H19-7 cells, suggesting that thapsigargin may use Src kinase for downstream signaling events. To test whether MAP kinase is also a downstream target of thapsigargin-induced calcium mobilization, the cells were transiently transfected with a kinase-inactive MEK mutant (MEK-2A), which encodes a protein with 2 alanine residues substituted at the sites of the activating serine residues, together with an HA epitope-tagged ERK2. The addition of thapsigargin resulted in the significant increase of ERK activity, measured by using an epitope-tagged ERK2-immune complex kinase assay (Fig. 4 B), and kinase-deficient MEK-2A completely blocked the thapsigargin-induced HA-ERK2 activity. To further verify the role of MEK-ERK activation by thapsigargin, we measured the ERK2 activity by thapsigargin after pretreating the cells with 30 μm MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 30 min. Previously we have shown that activation of ERK by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is completely blocked by 30 μm PD98059 in H19-7 cells (29Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Addition of MEK inhibitor also significantly blocked the thapsigargin-induced HA-ERK2 activity. In all samples, ERK2 enzymes were present at the same levels. These results suggest that calcium mobilization by thapsigargin activates both ERK and Src kinase in H19-7 cells. To test whether pip92 is activated via the activation of Src kinase and ERK in response to thapsigargin, the H19-7 cells were transiently transfected with the combination of −1281pip92/CAT and a kinase-inactive Src or MEK-2A, and transcriptional activity of pip92 by thapsigargin was measured. As shown in Fig. 4 C, thapsigargin-induced activation of the pip92 promoter was significantly blocked by the Src kinase mutant. In the presence of kinase-inactive MEK-2A, transcriptional activation of pip92 by thapsigargin was also significantly decreased (Fig. 4 C). In an effect similar to that of MEK-2A, pretreatment of the cells with the MEK inhibitor remarkably suppressed pip92 expression by thapsigargin. The induction of pip92 mRNA levels by thapsigargin was also greatly reduced by mutant Src, MEK-2A, or PD98059, measured by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that the regulation of the episomally expressed pip92 reporter does reflect mRNA expression from the endogenous gene. Overall these results indicated that the activation of Src kinase and ERK is necessary for thapsigargin-induced activation of pip92. v-Src is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. To test whether Src kinase is sufficient for mediating thapsigargin-induced activation of MAP kinase and pip92expression, v-Src was transfected into H19-7 cells together with −1281pip92/CAT or HA-ERK2 plasmid. Expression of constitutive v-Src kinase in H19-7 cells resulted in a significant increase in pip92 transcriptional activity (Fig.5) and activation of ERK in a constitutive manner, which is comparable with that by thapsigargin (Fig. 6 B). In a similar way, transient transfection of the constitutively active MEK mutant (MEK-2E), which encodes a protein with 2 glutamic acid residues substituted at the sites of the activating serine residues, markedly induced pip92 transcription without thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 5). It was previously shown that expression of MEK-2E is effective at generating constitutively active MAPK, and the activity is comparable with that induced by growth factor stimulation of the cells (30Kuo W.L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E.M. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D.J. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with 30 μm MEK inhibitor also blocks the pip92 expression induced by v-Src or MEK-2E treatment (Fig. 5). Previously, it was also shown that dominant negative Src blocks thapsigargin-induced activation of ERK (15Chao T.S. Abe M. Herschenson M.B. Gomes I. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3168-3173PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results confirmed that ERK activation is necessary for the Src kinase-induced pip92 activation.Figure 6Transcriptional activation ofpip92 by thapsigargin and v-Src is inhibited by dominant-inhibitory Raf-1. A, two micrograms of −1281pip92/CAT reporter plasmids or with 10 μg of a kinase-inactive Raf mutant (T+Raf-KR) were transiently transfected into H19-7 cells, as indicated, and the cells were stimulated with vehicle (Control) or 10 μg/ml thapsigargin (Thap) for 1 h. Where specified, 2 μg of −1281pip92/CAT plasmid was transiently transfected into the cells with 10 μg of oncogenic v-Src or a combination with 5 μg of Raf-KR (S+Raf-KR). The transcriptional activity ofpip92 was measured at 33 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are plotted as the percentage ofpip92 transcriptional activity by thapsigargin and represent the mean plus the range of samples from two independent experiments.B, the cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of HA-ERK2 plasmid with or without 5 μg of kinase-inactive Raf (Raf-KR) and/or constitutively active src (v-Src) plasmid. After transfection, the cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml thapsigargin (Thap) for 1 h, and the kinase activity of HA-ERK2 was measured as described in Fig. 3 B. As a control for equal protein loading, HA-tagged ERK2 levels were measured by Western analysis using anti-HA antibodies. MBP, myelin basic protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize the effect of Raf-1 activity on the thapsigargin-induced signaling pathway leading to the induction of pip92, we transiently transfected the cells with the kinase-inactive Raf-1 mutant (Raf-KR) and measured the induction ofpip92 transcriptional activity by thapsigargin. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the dominant negative Raf-1 mutant suppressedpip92 induction by thapsigargin significantly. In a similar way, when the cells were cotransfected with constitutively active v-Src and kinase-deficient Raf-KR, the pip92 activation was blocked remarkably. To further determine the requirement of Raf-1 for thapsigargin-induced MAP kinase signaling, we transiently transfected the H19-7 cells with Raf-KR with an HA-tagged ERK2 plasmid. As analyzed by an epitope-tagged ERK2 immune complex assay (Fig. 6 B), the dominant negative Raf-KR mutant blocks the epitope-tagged ERK2 activity induced by thapsigargin and v-Src kinase. The data indicate that Raf-1 kinase is required for thapsigargin-induced MAP kinase activation and pip92 expression. Previous studies have shown that serum response element (SRE) present in the pip92 promoter can interact with recombinant serum response factor (SRF) and Elk1 proteins forming a tertiary complex (16Chung K.C. Shin S.W. Yoo M. Lee M.Y. Lee H.W. Choe B.K. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Latinkic B.V. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23163-23170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elk1 can be phosphorylated by ERK, and it is critical for transcriptional activation of pip92and c-fos. Next we examined whether Elk1 can be phosphorylated by thapsigargin. After cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml thapsigargin, nuclear extracts and cell lysates were prepared. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using pip92 SRE oligonucleotide and anti-phospho-Elk1 antibodies showed that endogenous Elk1 does not bind to the pip92 SRE element without stimulation and is activated by thapsigargin (Fig.7 A). The cell lysates were incubated in the presence of radiolabeled ATP with the wild-type GST-Elk1 C terminus (GST-ElkC) prebound to Sepharose 4B beads. As shown in Fig. 7 B, wild-type GST-ElkC was phosphorylated by extracts from the cells stimulated with thapsigargin. To demonstrate that the phosphorylation of GST-ElkC by nuclear extracts from thapsigargin-treated cells is specifically mediated by ERK and Src kinase, the effect of the inhibition of ERK or Src kinase activity was examined. Pretreatment of the cells with PD98059 before stimulation or removal of ERK by the incubation of cell lysates with agarose-ERK-immunoglobulin after stimulation resulted in a complete block of GST-ElkC phosphorylation by cell lysates. Similarly, transfection of kinase-inactive MEK and the Src mutant remarkably inhibited GST-ElkC phosphorylation by thapsigargin-induced cell lysates. These results implied that Src kinase and ERK mediate thapsigargin-induced activation of pip92 via the phosphorylation of Elk1. Thapsigargin, a non-phorbol ester-type tumor promoter, discharges intracellular Ca2+ stores by specific inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. Although the mechanism of tumor promotion by thapsigargin is not well understood, treatment of mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with thapsigargin induced rapid expression of the c-fos and c-jun protooncogenes (31Schonthal A. Sugarman J. Brown J.H. Hanley M.R. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7096-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thapsigargin could synergize with another tumor promoter, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, to induce c-fos but not c-jun. The stress-inducible glucose-regulated proteins, a class of calcium binding molecular chaperones localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, have been implicated in the development of thapsigargin-induced tumorigenicity (32Gazit G. Lu J. Lee A.S. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 54: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, the present study suggests that Elk1-dependent activation of pip92 might contribute the tumorigenesis of thapsigargin in neuronal cells. It has been well documented that thapsigargin and ionomycin mobilize Ca2+ through distinct mechanisms, thapsigargin by inhibiting microsomal Ca2+-ATPases and ionomycin by channeling calcium through the membrane from nonspecific sources (33Mintz E. Guillain F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 52-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). On the basis of the finding that both thapsigargin and ionomycin are able to induce pip92 expression, and there was no synergistic effect by the coaddition of the two agents (Fig. 2), Ca2+ appears to be a common mediator for thepip92 induction. Although the two drugs produced a 6–7-fold differential increase of intracellular calcium levels, similar levels of pip92 induction were observed, suggesting that a slight increase of intracellular calcium mobilization by thapsigargin is likely to be sufficient to induce pip92. Previously we demonstrated that pip92 is expressed rapidly and transiently during NMDA-induced cell death in H19-7 cells (16Chung K.C. Shin S.W. Yoo M. Lee M.Y. Lee H.W. Choe B.K. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that pip92 is also expressed during thapsigargin-induced cell proliferation. Both processes are commonly mediated by the increase of intracellular Ca2+ influx. Many of the same immediate early genes such as c-fos andpip92 are induced in a variety of biological contexts as diverse as mitogenic responses and the cellular response to cytotoxic stimuli. It will be interesting to investigate the molecular mechanism of variable biological responses resulting from the use of genes of which products are used in many contexts. The mechanism may be triggered as a consequence of differential quantitation of different ligands or different kinetics of the induction of immediate early genes and their products. Because Ca2+ signals are short-lived when compared with alterations in differentiated gene expression, it is generally considered that genes coding for short-lived transcription factors (e.g. c-fos and c-jun) are the immediate targets of Ca2+ signaling (34Santella L. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1091-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 35van Haasteren G. Li S. Muda M. Susini S. Schlegel W. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). On the basis of the previous finding that Pip92 is selectively expressed in the nucleus as a fusion with green fluorescent protein (23Chung K.C. Kim S.M. Rhang S. Lau L.F. Gomes I. Ahn Y.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4676-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Pip92 seems to be a second messenger, for example, as a transcription factor, rather than a direct effector of a variety of cell responses, such as cell growth, differentiation, and transformation. We are currently investigating the functional roles of the Pip92 protein in the nucleus. Previously we have shown that both FGF and Raf activate MAPK-independent kinases that can stimulate Elk1 phosphorylation andpip92 transcription (12Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An increase of intracellular calcium levels by thapsigargin or ionomycin caused a rapid and transient increase of pip92 gene expression, and the signals for intracellular calcium mobilization are transmitted through the activation of Src kinase- and Raf-MEK-ERK-dependent signaling pathways in H19-7 cells. Elk1 becomes a transcriptional activator to induce pip92 in response to thapsigargin. However, because of a previous finding that kinase-inactive Src kinase did not completely block the activation of ERK by FGF and neuronal differentiation by Raf-1 activation (29Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), Src-tyrosine kinases appear to be differentially activated via distinct signaling pathways by FGF and thapsigargin in H19-7 cells. Many studies demonstrated a role for Src kinase in intracellular calcium signaling. For example, functional calcium-sensing receptors in rat fibroblasts are required for activation of Src kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase in response to extracellular calcium (36McNeil S.E. Hobson S.A. Nipper V. Rodland K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1114-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The Src kinase pathway is involved in Ca2+-dependent pancreatic exocytosis (37Tsunoda Y. Yoshida H. Africa L. Steil G.J. Owyang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 876-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and angiotension II-induced phosphorylation of p130Cas by Src family tyrosine kinases is dependent on intracellular calcium and protein kinase C (38Sayeski P.P. Ali M.S. Harp J.B. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1279-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence also supports the role of Src family kinases in the stimulation of ERK. Many G protein-coupled receptors initiate Ras-dependent activation of the ERK cascade by inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins that serve as scaffolds for the plasma membrane recruitment of Ras guanine exchange factors. Activation of Src kinase by the α-thrombine (39Chen Y.H. Pouyssegur J. Courtneidge S.A. Van Obberghen-Schilling E. J. Biol.

Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) has been reported. A number of studies have suggested that Src cooperates with Ras to activate MAP kinase in some signaling events. For example, activation of Src family kinases and Ras is required for activation of ERKs by angiotension II in smooth muscle cells (43Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Chai Q. Marrero M.B. Bernstein K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10329-10333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress, such as H2O2, activates ERKs through Src kinase in cultured cardiac myocytes of neonatal rats (44Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). However, conflicting results also have been reported to indicate that both can activate independent pathways in certain instances. In fibroblast NIH3T3 cells, Myc, but not Fos or Jun, was able to rescue the inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis by dominant negative Src, whereas Fos and Jun, but not Myc, rescued the cell growth block given by dominant negative Ras (45Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Src appears to activate a Ras- and Raf-independent pathway during the differentiation of H19-7 cells by FGF (29Kuo W.L. Chung K.C. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4633-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies using dominant inhibitory Raf-1 mutants also indicate that Src can be an upstream activator for Raf-1, and Raf-1 may be required for the Src-dependent activation of MAP kinase (15Chao T.S. Abe M. Herschenson M.B. Gomes I. Rosner M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3168-3173PubMed Google Scholar). We thank S. Ryu and D. G. Kim for helpful discussions. We also thank L. F.

A chimeric polypeptide consisting of the rat sodium pump α3 subunit with the peptide Gln905–Val930 of the gastric proton pump α subunit substituted in place of the original Asn886–Ala911 sequence was expressed together with the gastric β subunit in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells that express this subunit combination are sensitive to palytoxin, which interacts specifically with the sodium pump, and lose intracellular K+ ions. The palytoxin-induced K+ efflux is inhibited by the sodium pump-specific inhibitor ouabain and also by the gastric proton pump-specific inhibitor SCH 28080. The IC50 for SCH 28080 inhibition of palytoxin-induced K+ efflux is 14.3 ± 2.4 μm, which is similar to the K i for SCH 28080 inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by the gastric H+,K+-ATPase. In contrast, palytoxin-induced K+ efflux from cells expressing either the native α3 and β1 subunits of the sodium pump or the α3 subunit of the sodium pump together with the β subunit of the gastric proton pump is inhibited by ouabain but not by SCH 28080. The acquisition of SCH 28080 sensitivity by the chimera indicates that the Gln905–Val930 peptide of the gastric proton pump is likely to be involved in the interactions of the gastric proton-potassium pump with SCH 28080. Na+,K+-ATPase is inhibited by cardiac glycosides such as ouabain, and palytoxin, which do not inhibit gastric H+,K+-ATPase.

K+-ATPase, sodium- and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.37) K+-ATPase, proton-and potassium-activated adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.36) 8-benzyloxy-3-cyanomethyl-2-methyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine membrane-spanning domains 1–10 phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20 The sodium pump (Na+,K+-ATPase)1and the gastric proton pump (H+,K+-ATPase) are ion-transporting ATPases, both hydrolyzing ATP to actively pump ions against their electrochemical gradients (1Fambrough D.M. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Sachs G. Munson K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unlike other ion-transporting ATPases, they both require a highly glycosylated smaller peptide, the β subunit, for their function, in addition to a larger ATP-recognizing α subunit. The α subunits of proton and sodium pumps have ∼60% identical primary sequences and form 10 membrane-spanning domains, denoted M1–M10, with their amino and carboxyl termini localized in the cytosol (3Levenson R.

The β subunits are 30% identical and form a single membrane span with the amino terminus on the extracellular side of the membrane. Despite this limited identity of the primary structure, the tertiary structure of both types of β subunits must be very similar, since the proton pump β subunit was shown in numerous investigations to form functional complexes with the α subunit of the sodium pump when these proteins were expressed together (10Eakle K.A.

Thus, the pumping activity of the gastric proton pump is specifically inhibited by imidazopyridines like 8-benzyloxy-3-cyanomethyl-2-methyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (SCH 28080) or omeprazole (15Prinz C.

Med. 1994; 67: 81-95PubMed Google Scholar). The sodium pump is specifically inhibited by a series of naturally occurring steroids, such as ouabain and digitalis (20Hansen O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1984; 36: 143-163PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wallick E.T. Schwartz A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Based on their clinical use, these substances are also referred to as cardiac glycosides or cardioactive steroids; their application helps to increase muscular contractility of the failing heart (22Repke K.R. Weiland J. Megges R. Schon R. Prog. Med. Chem. 1993; 30: 135-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 23McDonough A.A. Wang J. Farley R.A. J. Mol. Cell.

Cardiology. 1995; 86: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In recent years, the work of many investigators has been focused on the identification of amino acids or peptides of the proton and sodium pumps involved in interaction with omeprazole and SCH 28080, or ouabain and related cardiac glycosides, respectively. Analysis of a series of sodium pump mutants helped to identify several amino acids involved in the recognition of ouabain (25Price E.M. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 26Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), but little is known about amino acids or peptides of the gastric proton pump involved in the recognition of omeprazole or SCH 28080. Amino acids in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the α subunit of gastric H+,K+-ATPase have been suggested to participate in the binding sites for these inhibitors. Blostein et al.(29Blostein R. Zhang R. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) expressed a chimeric polypeptide consisting of the amino-terminal 519 amino acids of gastric H+,K+-ATPase and the COOH-terminal 507 amino acids of Na+,K+-ATPase in LLC-PK1 cells and reported inhibition of potassium influx by SCH 28080. Munson et al. (30Munson K.B. Gutierrez C. Balaji V.N. Ramnarayan K. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18976-18988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) labeled a peptide from the M1-M2 region of gastric H+,K+-ATPase with a photoactive analog of SCH 28080. Labeling experiments have also identified Cys892 within the extracellular loop connecting the M7 and M8 membrane spans of the gastric proton-potassium pump α subunit as a component of the binding site for omeprazole (17Besancon M. Shin J.M. Mercier F. Munson K. Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since omeprazole binding to the proton pump can be inhibited by SCH 28080 (31Hersey S.J. Steiner L. Mendlein J. Rabon E. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), this result raises the possibility that amino acids within the COOH-terminal half of the gastric pump α subunit might also participate in interactions of the gastric proton pump with SCH 28080. To test this hypothesis, we made use of the highly specific interactions between the sodium pump and palytoxin to investigate whether the M7/M8 extracellular peptide of the gastric proton pump α subunit is involved in SCH 28080 recognition. Palytoxin from marine corals of the genus Palythoa, like the cardioactive steroids, is a specific inhibitor of the sodium pump (32Habermann E. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 1171-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Ishida Y. Tagaki K. Takahashi M. Satake N. Shibata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7900-7902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the cardioactive steroids, however, which inhibit ion flow through the pump, palytoxin converts the enzyme into an open channel that allows ions to flow down their concentration gradient (34Scheiner-Bobis G. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The palytoxin-induced channels have been studied with electrophysiological tools (35Ikeda M. Mitani K. Ito K. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1988; 337: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36Kim S.Y. Marx K.A. Wu C.H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 542-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and have been found to have a single-channel conductance of about 10 picosiemens in crayfish giant axons. Single-channel recordings have also been obtained from Na+,K+-ATPase incorporated into planar lipid bilayers (36Kim S.Y. Marx K.A. Wu C.H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1995; 351: 542-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression of Na+,K+-ATPase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes the yeast cells to lose intracellular K+ when exposed to palytoxin, whereas yeast cells without Na+,K+-ATPase are not affected by palytoxin (11Lyu R.M. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1717-C1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Scheiner-Bobis G. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Christ M. Habermann E. Mol.

Taking advantage of the high specificity of the palytoxin/sodium pump interaction, we used the expression of Na+,K+-ATPase in yeast to address the following questions. Does palytoxin also induce a K+efflux from yeast cells that express a hybrid sodium pump consisting of a sodium pump α subunit and a gastric proton pump β subunit? Does a similar phenomenon occur when yeast cells express a chimeric sodium pump α subunit containing the extracellular sequence Gln905–Val930 from the M7/M8 loop of the gastric proton pump α subunit? Finally, is any palytoxin-induced K+ efflux observed sensitive to ouabain or SCH 28080? The yeast expression vectors used in this study and the various combinations used for transformation of yeast cells are summarized in Table I. The methods applied for their construction have been described previously. Therefore, a brief summary of the most important features is given here. The yeast expression plasmid YEp1PT was used as a vector for the cDNA coding for the rat sodium pump α3 subunit. This vector is denoted YEprα3 (39Eakle K.A. Kabalin M.A. Wang S.G. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6550-6557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same expression plasmid was also used for the insertion of the cDNA coding for a chimera of the sodium pump α3 subunit that was made to contain Gln905–Val930 of the rat gastric proton pump α subunit in place of the original Asn886–Ala911 (13Wang S.G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This vector is named YEpNGH26. Vectors pG1T-rβ1 and pG1T-HKβ were used for the expression of the rat sodium pump β1 subunit and the rat gastric proton pump β subunit, respectively (39Eakle K.A. Kabalin M.A. Wang S.G. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6550-6557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IVector description and vector combinations used in the experimentsVector used for transformationsProtein expressed in yeastCombined with vectorEnzyme expressed in yeastYEprα3NKα3 (= rat sodium pump α3 subunit)pG1T-rβ1NKα3/NKβ1YEpNGH26NGH26 (= rat sodium pump α3 subunit with the region Asn886–Ala911 replaced by the corresponding 26 amino acids Gln905–Val930 of the rat gastric proton pump α subunit)pG1T-HKβNGH26/HKβpG1T-rβ1NKβ1 (= rat sodium pump β1 subunit)YEpNGH26NGH26/NKβ1pG1T-HKβHKβ (= rat gastric proton pump β subunit)YEprα3NKα3/HKβ Open table in a new tab The S. cerevisiae strain 30-4 (MAT-α, trp1,ura3, Vn2, GAL+) was used for transformation with either of the yeast expression vectors YEpNGH26 (coding for the chimeric sodium pump α subunit) or YEprα3 (coding for the wild-type sodium pump α3 subunit of the rat) together with either of the vectors pG1T-rβ1 or pG1T-HKβ coding for the β subunits of rat Na+,K+-ATPase and gastric H+,K+-ATPase, respectively. Thus, coexpression of the various vectors results in the four different combinations of subunits given in Table I. The conditions for the selection of transformants are described elsewhere (40Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4189-4192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomes from transformed or nontransformed yeast cells were prepared as described previously (40Horowitz B. Eakle K.A. Scheiner-Bobis G. Randolph G.R. Chen C.Y. Hitzeman R.A. Farley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4189-4192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content of the microsomal preparations was determined by the method of Lowry (41Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conditions for electrophoresis and immunoblot detection of α3 or NGH26 subunits have been described previously in detail (13Wang S.G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of microsomal protein isolated from yeast expressing either the NKα3/NKβ or NGH26/HKβ heterodimers was run on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and was then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by semidry blotting at 0.8 mA/cm2. The α3 and NGH26 subunits were visualized by using monoclonal antibody 5 against sodium pump α subunits (1:400 dilution) and the commercially available enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL) following the protocol of the provider. HKβ subunits in membrane preparations from cells expressing either NKα3/HKβ or NGH26/HKβ were detected in a similar way. Here, however, 35 μg of microsomal protein were sufficient for electrophoresis and semidry blotting. The monoclonal antibody 2/2E6 served as a primary antibody against the gastric pump β subunit (1:2000 dilution). All other conditions were the same as above. An antibody capture assay (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) was used with some minor modifications (43Scheiner-Bobis G. Schreiber S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9198-9208Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to estimate the expression level of the HKβ in membrane preparations from yeast expressing either NKα3/HKβ or NGH26/HKβ. Microsomal proteins from nontransformed cells served as a control. A total of 35 μg of yeast microsomal protein in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) was added to the wells of a microtiter plate. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the microtiter wells were washed twice with PBS-T. Afterward, 150 μl of blocking buffer composed of 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-T with 0.02% sodium azide were added overnight to saturate the remaining protein binding sites of the well. Then, the wells were washed once again as described before. To each of the wells 50 μl of a monoclonal antibody (2/2E6) against the gastric proton pump β subunit were added at a 1:2000 dilution in PBS-T and incubation continued for 2 h at room temperature. Unbound antibody was then removed by four washes with PBS-T, and afterward 50 μl of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were added to the wells. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed four times with PBS-T, and then twice with 10 mmdiethanolamine, pH 9.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2. All further steps concerning the time course of the formation ofp-nitrophenolate from p-nitrophenyl phosphate were carried out as described (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A total of 250 μg of yeast microsomal protein was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with 5 mm PO4 (Tris form), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and various concentrations of [3H]ouabain. The incubation volume was 250 μl. Thereafter, the protein was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. After washing twice with 1 ml of ice-cold water, the pellet was dissolved in 250 μl of 1 m NaOH by incubation for 15 min at 80 °C. The NaOH was neutralized by 250 μl of 1 m HCl, and the radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting after the addition of scintillation fluid. A total of 125 μg of microsomal protein was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 nm[3H]ouabain, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and various concentrations of ATP (Tris form). The total volume of each sample was 250 μl. Thereafter, the protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, washed twice with H2O at 4 °C, dissolved in 250 μl of 1 m NaOH, and processed as described at the end of the preceding paragraph. To investigate whether SCH 28080 inhibits binding of [3H]ouabain to yeast membranes, the above experiment was repeated at 0, 1, and 10 μm ATP in the presence of 25 μm SCH 28080. All other conditions were the same as described above. Single yeast colonies were incubated at 30 °C in a cell incubator with vigorous shaking overnight in 5 ml of SD growth medium (6.7 g/liter Bacto Yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) supplemented with d-galactose (20 g/liter SD medium) as the only carbon source. The cell suspension was then transferred to 200 ml of SD medium and incubation continued for an additional 24 h under the same conditions. Thereafter, cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 × g, washed twice with 30 ml of NaGHBC (200 mm NaCl, 100 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5 mmboric acid, 1 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.5 with Tris), and suspended in NaGHBC to a final concentration of 106 cells/ml (A 600 = 6). For the measurement of the palytoxin-induced K+ loss from yeast cells, 450 μl of the cell suspension were incubated with various concentrations of palytoxin in the absence or presence of ouabain or SCH 28080 for 2 h at 30 °C. Since SCH 28080 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide:ethanol (1:1, v/v), the content of the solvent was kept constant in all samples; the final volume of each sample was 500 μl. To determine the total cellular K+content (100% value), 450 μl of the yeast cell suspension were incubated for 1 h at 70 °C with 50 μl of 1% lithium dodecyl sulfate (w/v). Afterward, cells were centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 2 min in a bench-top centrifuge. The supernatants were collected and measured for their K+ content in a flame photometer. Initial rates of palytoxin-induced K+ efflux were measured in a flow ionometer. Yeast cells were suspended at a concentration of 15 × 106 cells/ml in NaGHBC buffer containing 0.2, 0.5, or 5 μm palytoxin for cells with NKα3/NKβ1; 0.5, 2, or 5 μm palytoxin for cells expressing NKα3/HKβ; and 1, 2.5, or 5 μm palytoxin for cells expressing the NGH26/HKβ hybrid. The total volume of the solution was 1 ml. Using a peristaltic pump, the reaction mixture was transported to a chamber containing a K+-sensitive electrode. The time elapsed between palytoxin addition and signal recording was 7 min, and recording was continued for an additional 5 min. The electric signals derived from the K+-sensitive electrode were digitized and analyzed by a computer program provided by the supplier of the flow ionometer. Data are plotted in the figures as mean values ± standard deviations. The lines through the data are the best fits of appropriate equations obtained using the programs InPlot 4.0 or Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Growth media were purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI). Palytoxin was obtained from Dr. L. Bèress (Christian-Albrechts-Universität, Kiel, Germany). The yeast strain 30-4 was obtained from Dr. R. Hitzeman (Genentech, CA). Restriction endonucleases were from MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania) or Amersham Buchler (Braunschweig, Germany). Amersham Bucher was also the provider of [3H]ouabain (28 Ci/mmol) and of the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot analysis system. The nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). The microtiter plates MaxiSorb were from Nunc (Wiesbaden, Germany). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was purchased from SeroTec (Oxford, United Kingdom). The hybridoma cells producing monoclonal antibody 5 were purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank Project, University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). The antibody 2/2E6 against the gastric proton pump β subunit was a gift of Dr. C. Okomoto (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). The flow ionometer is a product of ZABS GmbH (Marburg an der Lahn, Germany). In the presence of phosphate (P) and Mg2+, Na+,K+-ATPase (E 2) becomes phosphorylated (E 2-P) and binds ouabain with high affinity [E 2*-P·ouabain]. Use of radioactive ouabain enables one to determine the affinity of the enzyme for ouabain under these conditions. Thus, as expected, the rat wild-type sodium pump α3 and β1 subunits (NKα3/NKβ1) in microsomal yeast membranes bind [3H]ouabain with high affinity (Fig. 1). TheK d determined from a Scatchard plot is 7.7 ± 0.3 nm (Table II). A similar affinity for ouabain was obtained with membranes from cells expressing the NKα3/HKβ subunits (K d of 6.4 ± 1.4 nm). TheB max for ouabain binding to the NKα3/HKβ hybrid (0.85 ± 0.07 pmol/mg) is slightly reduced compared with that of the wild-type sodium pump (1.1 ± 0.02 pmol/mg) (TableII). Ouabain binding to microsomal membranes from cells expressing the chimeric sodium pump α subunit (NGH26) together with the sodium pump β1 subunit (NKβ1) is almost undetectable (data not shown).Table IISummary of results determined for yeast expressing various sodium/proton pump subunit combinations described in textK D , ouabainB max, ouabainEC50, ATPEC50, palytoxink′ NIC50, ouabainIC50, SCH 28080nmpmol/mgμmnms −1μmμmNKα3/NKβ17.7 ± 0.31.10 ± 0.023.90 ± 0.16136.40.25 ± 0.0226.5 ± 0.1∞ 2-a∞, very low affinity.NKα3/HKβ6.5 ± 1.40.85 ± 0.071.05 ± 0.16313.30.14 ± 0.0223.1 ± 3.4∞NGH26/HKβ21.1 ± 2.50.18 ± 0.011.13 ± 0.51822.00.05 ± 0.0127.6 ± 1.914.3 ± 2.4The EC50 values for palytoxin are from a single experiment.

The EC50 values for ATP are the means ± S.D. of four measurements obtained with two membrane preparations. All other values represent the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Replacement of the sodium pump β1 by the proton pump β subunit results in the formation of NGH26/HKβ complexes capable of binding ouabain (Fig. 1). The equilibrium dissociation constantK d for ouabain binding to the NGH26/HKβ heterodimer (21.1 ± 2.5 nm; Table II) is slightly increased compared with complexes assembled with NKα3, indicating a reduction in affinity. In addition, the maximum amount of ouabain bound by NGH26/HKβ is also reduced (0.18 ± 0.01 pmol/mg), accounting for only a fraction (17%) of the total binding obtained with the wild-type sodium pump (Fig. 1; Table II). To investigate the relative level of expression of the α3 and NGH26 subunits, microsomal proteins isolated from transformed yeast were probed in a Western blot with a monoclonal antibody raised against the sodium pump α subunit. Fig. 2 shows that both subunits are expressed in the yeast in comparable quantities. As shown in the same figure, the antibody does not recognize any protein of ∼100 kDa corresponding to the α3 or NGH26 subunit in microsomes isolated from nontransformed yeast cells. The expression levels of the gastric proton pump β subunit (HKβ) were measured in yeast membrane preparations from cells expressing either NKα3/HKβ or NGH26/HKβ using a monoclonal antibody raised against the gastric proton pump β subunit. The Western blot presented in Fig. 3 A shows that the antibody recognizes two protein bands of about 40 and 43 kDa in membranes from cells expressing the NKα3/HKβ or NGH26/HKβ heterodimers. Since corresponding bands are not detected in membranes from nontransformed cells, these bands at 40 and 43 kDa are gastric pump β subunits, possibly glycosylated to various extents. It is apparent from the figure that the abundance of the HKβ subunit in membrane preparations from cells expressing the NKα3/HKβ complex is higher than in membranes from cells expressing the NGH26/HKβ hybrid. Quantification of the HKβ subunit expression levels in yeast microsomes from cells expressing either the NKα3/HKβ or the NGH26/HKβ hybrid cannot easily be addressed by the Western blotting method. This was done instead by applying a variation of an antigen capture assay (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). In this assay the antigen (here HKβ) is affixed to the wells of a microtiter plate. This affixed antigen is then incubated with an antibody specific for the antigen (here antibody 2/2E6 against HKβ). Subsequently, an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (here an anti-mouse IgG) is added to the well. With sufficient washes between additions, the antigen, the primary antibody, the secondary antibody, and alkaline phosphatase should be present in equal amounts. Thus, the amount of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolyzed by the alkaline phosphatase is directly proportional to the number of HKβ subunits present in each well, and, therefore, the amount of the p-nitrophenolate anion produced by the alkaline phosphatase can be used as measure of the relative abundance of HKβ subunits. Fig. 3 B shows the results of this experiment. After either 40 or 60 min of incubation with substrate, the amount of thep-nitrophenolate anion formed in samples containing the HKβ from cells expressing the NGH26/HKβ heterodimers accounts for only 13–17% of the value obtained from the microsomes from cells expressing the NKα3/HKβ subunit combination.

Yeast minichromosome multimerization provides an appropriate system in which to study mechanistic aspects of DNA recombination. temperature sensitive base pair(s) kilobase(s) Three distinct families of DNA topoisomerases disentangle DNA strands and modulate DNA supercoiling inside the cell. Type IA topoisomerases transiently cleave single-stranded DNA to allow the passage of other DNA segments. Type IB topoisomerases cleave one DNA strand in a double-helix and allow the rotation of the duplex by the uncleaved strand before resealing the DNA. Type II topoisomerases transiently cleave both strands in a double-stranded DNA segment and transport another double-stranded DNA segment across the gated duplex (for a review, see Ref. 1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). The main biological roles of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases has been inferred from studies in yeast cells. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three topoisomerases: topoisomerase I, a type IB enzyme encoded by the TOP1 gene (2Goto T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7178-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Thrash C. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4374-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); topoisomerase II, a type II enzyme encoded by the TOP2 gene (4Giaever G. Lynn R. Goto T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12448-12454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and topoisomerase III, a type IA enzyme encoded by the TOP3 gene (5Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). One function of these enzymes is to remove DNA supercoiling. During replication, DNA ahead of the replication fork becomes positively supercoiled as the parental DNA strands come apart behind it. During DNA transcription, the hindrance to the rotation of the transcription ensemble drives positive supercoiling of DNA ahead of the polymerase and negative supercoiling behind it (6Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Yeast topoisomerase I serves as the major DNA swivel during replication and transcription, but this role can be fulfilled by topoisomerase II (7Brill S.J. DiNardo S. Voelkel-Meiman K. Sternglanz R. NCI Monogr. 1987; 4: 11-15Google Scholar, 8Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); thus, both enzymes are capable of relaxing positively and negatively supercoiled DNA in vivo (9Saavedra R.A. Huberman J.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 65-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 10Giaever G.N. Wang J.C. Cell. 1988; 55: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because untwining of parental DNA strands is often incomplete at the end of DNA replication, the other main role of topoisomerases is to unlink the new pairs of replicated DNA molecules. Decatenation activity of topoisomerase II is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (11DiNardo S. Voelkel K. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 12Uemura T. Ohkura H. Adachi Y. Morino K. Shiozaki K. Yanagida M. Cell. 1987; 50: 917-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and meiosis (13Rose D. Thomas W. Holm C. Cell. 1990; 60: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The less abundant topoisomerase III has weak DNA relaxation activity and does not contribute to supercoil removal in vivo (14Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it is, however, required to complete the final stages of meiotic recombination (15Gangloff S. de Massy B. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Fabre F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1701-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas TOP2 is essential for cell viability, cell growth is not blocked by null mutations of the yeast TOP1 orTOP3 genes. However, deficiency of any of the three yeast topoisomerases is found to affect genome stability (for a review, see Refs. 16Wang J.C. Caron P.R. Kim R.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 403-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 17Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A null top1 mutant and a top2thermo-sensible (ts)1 mutant, grown at a semipermissive temperature, were shown to have a high frequency of mitotic recombination in the rDNA cluster (18Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In double mutant yeast cells Δtop1 top2-ts, grown at permissive temperature, destabilization of the rDNA gene cluster was revealed by the presence of over half of the rDNA genes as extrachromosomal rings containing one or more copies of the 9-kb rDNA unit (19Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These excised rings were found to integrate back into the rDNA locus, presumably through homologous recombination, when plasmid-borne TOP1 orTOP2 genes were expressed. Recombination in tandem arrays of repetitive nucleotide sequences, other than the rDNA cluster, appears to be unaffected by reducing the cellular level of DNA topoisomerase I or II (18Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). On the other hand, null top3 mutants show an increased recombination between a variety of sequence repeats (5Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), including subtelomeric sequences (20Kim R.A. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2667-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which topoisomerases apparently suppress mitotic recombination remain to be explored. While studying the biological functions of DNA topoisomerases, using various mutants of the yeastS. cerevisiae, we found evidence of the involvement of DNA topoisomerases in genome stability. We observed that in the topoisomerase double mutant Δtop1 top2-ts circular minichromosomes strongly multimerize. These multimeric forms consist of tandem copies of the monomeric rings, and their formation or resolution is readily affected by DNA topoisomerase I. The yeast strains used in this study were kindly provided by R. Kim and J. C. Wang (Harvard University). All strains are derivatives of FY251 (MATahis3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 ura3–52). JCW 26 (top2–4), harboring a thermo-sensitive mutation in the TOP2 gene, was derived by one-step gene replacement (21Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). JCW27 (Δtop1) and JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4) were derived from FY251 and JCW26, respectively, by the hit-and-run method of gene replacement to create a null mutation in the TOP1 gene (22Roca J. Gartenberg M.R. Oshima Y. Wang J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4671-4672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). JCW253 (Δtop3::TRP1) and JCW273 (Δtop3::TRP1 Δtop1) were derived by one-step gene replacement from JCW25 and JCW27, respectively, to create a null mutation in the TOP3 gene. Yeast cells were grown in synthetic selective media as described by Sherman (23Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar). Cell transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate method described by Ito et al. (24Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Circular constructs Yp 0.8, Yp 1.4, Yp 1.5, and Yp 2, which did not contain DNA sequences to allow bacterial amplification, were constructed by self-ligation of linear DNA fragments obtained by the polymerase chain reaction or from bacterial plasmids. Yp 0.8 (855 bp) was constructed from theEcoRI yeast chromosomal fragment (1453 bp) containingTRP1 and ARS1. The following primer sequences: 5′-GCCGGAATTCATTGAGCACGTGAGTATACG-3′ and 5′-GCCGGAATTCTTTAGCATTATCTTTACATCTTG-3′ were used to amplify a segment of 869 bp having TRP1 and ARS1, which was then digested with EcoRI (primer-engineeredEcoRI sites are shown in boldface) and self-ligated to obtain the 855-bp DNA ring. Yp 1.4 (1453 bp) was constructed by circularizing the 1453-bp EcoRI yeast chromosomal fragment containing TRP1 and ARS1. Yp 1.5 (1487 bp) was constructed by circularizing a DNA fragment, which was composed of aSacI-HindIII segment (1211 bp) containing yeastURA3, followed by a HindIII-SacI segment (276 bp) containing yeast ARS-HO. Yp 2 (2055 bp) was constructed by circularizing a DNA fragment, which was composed of anEcoRI-HindIII segment (1217 bp) containing yeastURA3, followed by a HindIII-EcoRI (838 bp) segment containing yeast ARS1. Yp 3.4 (3468 bp) was constructed by inserting the 1453-bp EcoRI yeast chromosomal fragment containing TRP1 and ARS1 into pHC624 (a 2015-bp plasmid derivative of pBR322). Yp 4.6 (4414 bp) was constructed by inserting the 1453-bp EcoRI yeast chromosomal fragment containing TRP1 and ARS1 into pBluescript-KSII (a 2961-bp plasmid from Stratagene). Dimeric and trimeric constructs of Yp 1.4 were constructed by self-ligation of the 1453-bp EcoRI yeast chromosomal fragment containing TRP1 andARS1. Ligated products were treated with topoisomerase II to eliminate catenanes, and the resulting circular species containing two and three copies of the TRP1 ARS1 fragment were purified from agarose gels. Plasmids pRK-G1T1 (19Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and YCp-G1hT1 (25Benedetti P. Fiorani P. Capuani L. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4343-4348PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by R. Kim and J. C. Wang (Harvard University). DNA from transformed yeast cells was prepared from yeast spheroplast as described by Shermanet al. (26Sherman F Fink G.R. Lawrence C. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). Blot hybridization was as described by Southern (27Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21490) Google Scholar), using 32P-labeled DNA probes obtained by random priming of gel-purified DNA sequences. Yeast DNA topoisomerase II was purified from a S. cerevisiae strain BCY123 harboring a yeast DNA topoisomerase II expression clone YEpTOP2GAL1 as described by Worland and Wang (28Worland S.T. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Knotted DNA rings from P4-phage capsids were purified and used to assay the DNA unlinking activity of topoisomerase II as described by Liu et al. (29Liu L.F. Davis J.L. Calendar R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3979-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). DNA minicircles of different size containing an autonomous replicating sequence (ARS1 or ARS-HO) and a selective gene marker (TRP1 or URA3) were constructed to transform the S. cerevisiae strain FY251 and its derivative double mutant JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4), which carries a deletion in the TOP1 gene and a ts mutation in the TOP2 gene. Transformants of the FY251 and JCW28 strains were obtained in selective media plates and then grown in liquid cultures at 26 °C, a permissive temperature for thetop2–4 mutant. DNA samples from individual transformants were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the DNA minicircle sequences were identified by blot-hybridization with32P-labeled probes. Fig.1 a depicts the structure of the DNA minicircles constructed, and Fig. 1 b shows the typical electrophoretic patterns obtained with these constructs following yeast transformation. As DNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in TBE buffer containing calculated amounts of chloroquine, covalently closed DNA molecules produced characteristic ladders of topoisomers. In the FY251 strain, most of the constructs migrated as monomeric DNA circles (Fig. 1 b, lane 1 in eachpanel). In contrast, in the JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4) strain most of these DNA migrated as a variety of multimeric forms (Fig. 1 b, lane 2 in each panel). The degree of multimerization was inversely proportional to the size of the rings. The smaller the monomeric rings, the stronger the multimerization. Constructs Yp 1.4, a 1.4-kb ring with theTRP1-ARS1 sequence, and Yp 1.5, a 1.5-kb ring with theURA3 ARS-HO sequence, similarly generate multimeric forms. We ruled out the possibility that the presence of multimeric forms could be due to their preferred uptake by the Δtop1 top2–4 cells at the time of transformation, thus identical results were obtained by transforming these cells with gel-purified monomeric forms of each construct. The multimers were invariably found in any single transformant of the double mutantΔtop1 top2–4 strain, and the distribution of multimers did not change significantly in exponentially growing cells or in cell-saturated cultures. The ladder-type distribution of multimers generated in the Δtop1 top2–4 strain suggested that these DNA forms consisted of several complete copies of the monomeric rings. This was confirmed by cutting them at restriction sites that were unique to the monomeric sequences. Fig.2 a shows that the digestion of the multimeric forms of the Yp 1.4 construct with EcoRI endonuclease generated a unique DNA fragment of 1.4 kb, which corresponds to the linearized monomeric sequence. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 2 b, DNA extracted from theΔtop1 top2–4 strain, which contained multimeric forms of the Yp 1.4 construct, was mixed with knotted DNA rings derived from P4-phage capsids. These mixtures were then treated with purified yeast topoisomerase II, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium (Fig. 2 b,left panel). The knotted DNA rings derived from P4-phage capsids, which migrated as an smeary distribution (Fig. 2 b,K), were converted to the unknotted form (Fig.2 b, U) in the reaction containing ATP and topoisomerase II. The same gel was then blotted and probed to visualize the multimeric forms of the Yp 1.4 construct (Fig. 2 b,right panel). No alteration in the distribution of multimers was observed following topoisomerase II treatment in any of the reacted samples. This indicated, therefore, that the multimeric forms, rather than catenanes, were circular DNA molecules consisting of tandem repeats of the monomeric ring. To test whether the formation of multimers in the double mutant strainΔtop1 top2–4 was strictly related to the alteration of the TOP1 or TOP2 gene, we examined the stability of monomeric rings in the single mutant strains JCW26 (top2–4) and JCW27 (Δtop1). Fig.3 a shows the electrophoretic patterns of DNA rings extracted from strains FY251, JCW26, JCW27, and JCW28, transformed with either the Yp 1.4 construct (lanes 1–4) or Yp 1.5 construct (lanes 5–8). We observed that in the JCW26 (top2–4) strain the monomeric forms of these constructs were stable (lanes 2 and 6). No multimers were observed, even when this strain was grown at semipermissive temperature (30 °C) (data not shown). Multimeric forms of the constructs, however, were apparent in the single mutant strain JCW27 lacking topoisomerase I (lanes 3 and7). The degree of multimerization in this strain was, however, much lower than in the double mutant Δtop1 top2–4 (lanes 4 and 8). We also examined the occurrence of multimerization in cells defective in topoisomerase III. The single mutant strain JCW253 (Δtop3) and the double mutant strain JCW273 (Δtop1 Δtop3) were transformed with the Yp 1.5 construct and the monomer stability of this ring was examined. As shown in Fig.3 a, lanes 9 and 10, the absence of topoisomerase III, either by itself or in conjunction with the absence of topoisomerase I, did not contribute to the generation of multimeric forms. The degree of multimerization in the double mutantΔtop1 Δtop3 (lane 10) was comparable to that observed in the single mutantΔtop1 (lane 7). To corroborate that multimerization was strictly dependent of topoisomerase I deficiency, we examined minichromosome stability in the double mutant strain Δtop1 top2–4 containing the plasmid pRK-G1T1 (19Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This plasmid derives from the single-copy yeast vector YCp50 and expresses the yeast TOP1 gene from an inducible yeast promoter pGAL1. As shown in the experiment depicted in Fig. 3 b, multimerization did not occur inΔtop1 top2–4 cells expressing the plasmid-borne yeast TOP1 gene (lanes 1 and2). An identical result was also obtained when expressing a plasmid-borne human TOP1 gene (lanes 3 and4). We conclude, therefore, that topoisomerase I was necessary and sufficient to confer monomer stability of the circular minichromosomes. On the other hand, the alteration of topoisomerase II function as a result of the top2–4 mutation had no effect by itself, but it dramatically augmented multimerization when topoisomerase I was absent. For any given DNA construct, the relative amounts of monomers and multimers observed in topoisomerase-deficient yeast cells was very similar in all the transformants examined, and did not change in ongoing generations of the cells. This suggested that the distributions of multimers were the result of a steady-state equilibrium between generation and resolution pathways. To examine this hypothesis, we transformed the JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4) strain with gel-purified constructs that contained either 2 or 3 tandem repeats of the monomeric sequence of Yp 1.4. As shown in Fig. 4, in all the transformants examined, a broad distribution of multimers of the Yp 1.4 construct was observed (lanes 2 and5). Such distributions contained more or fewer repeats than the initial dimeric or trimeric construct used to transform the cells (lanes 1 and 4), and were indistinguishable from the distributions previously obtained with the monomeric rings. Digestion of these multimers with the restriction enzymeEcoRI yielded a unique product of 1.4 kb (lanes 3and 6), which confirmed that such multimers consisted of direct repeats of the monomeric sequence. Experiments in the above section indicated that interconversion among different multimeric forms of minichromosomes takes place rapidly in topoisomerase-deficient cells. We hypothesized that the restoration of topoisomerase I expression, in cells already containing multimeric minichromosomes, would shift the distribution of multimers toward the monomeric form. In the experiment depicted in Fig. 5, the double mutant JCW28 (Δtop1 top2–4), containing multimeric forms of the Yp 1.4 construct, was transformed with the plasmid pRK-G1T1. The distribution of multimers was then examined following the repression or the induction of the plasmid-borne TOP1 gene. As shown in Fig. 5 a, multimers were present as long as the cells grew in media containing 2% dextrose, which represses the expression of TOP1 (lane 1). When cells were transferred for 50 generations to a medium containing 2% galactose, which induces the expression of TOP1, the distribution of multimers was shifted toward the monomeric form (lane 2). When the cells were returned to a medium containing 2% dextrose, the multimers reappeared (lane 3). These were again reverted to the monomer when the cells were grown in 2% galactose (lane 4). This effect of topoisomerase I expression on the directionality of multimer formation or resolution is similar to that described for the excision and integration of extrachromosomal rDNA rings, which also happens in Δtop1 top2–4strains (19Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Hence, in the same DNA samples analyzed above, we examined whether the formation and resolution of minichromosome multimers occurred in parallel to the excision and integration of rDNA rings. As shown in Fig. 5 b, extrachromosomal rDNA rings were present in the Δtop1 top2–4 strain when theTOP1 gene was repressed (lanes 1 and3). Upon induction of the TOP1 gene (lanes 2 and 4), the excised rDNA rings integrated back into the chromosome. The excision of rDNA rings and the multimerization of minichromosomes, therefore, take place concomitantly in the topoisomerase-deficient cells, and both processes are reversed upon expressing TOP1. Multimerization of plasmids is mediated by factors involved in homologous recombination, and has frequently been observed in bacteria (30otter H. Dressler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4168-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31Kolodner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4847-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Fishel R.A. James A.A.

Genet. 1989; 219: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We report here that in topoisomerase-deficient yeast cells, circular minichromosomes generate broad distributions of multimeric forms, which consist of tandem copies of their monomeric sequences. By examining the presence of such minichromosome multimers in a set of isogenic yeast strains, with mutations in one or more of the three known topoisomerases, we find that the main determinant for multimerization is the absence of topoisomerase I. In TOP1cells, the monomeric forms of minichromosomes remain stable regardless of additional mutations in the TOP2 or TOP3genes. Conversely, incipient multimerization appears inΔtop1 or Δtop1 Δtop3 strains, and multimerization increases dramatically in the Δtop1 top2–4 strain. The dependence of multimerization on topoisomerase I activity is ratified by showing that it does not occur in Δtop1 top2–4 cells expressing a plasmid-borne TOP1 gene. The enhancing effect of the top2–4 mutation on the formation of multimers, in the Δtop1background, suggests that this phenomenon is related to the overall decreased capacity of these cells to remove DNA supercoils. Topoisomerase I and II provide the DNA swivel activity in yeast cells. In the single mutant Δtop1, topoisomerase II might closely compensate the absence of topoisomerase I. In the double mutant Δtop1 top2–4, however, DNA swivel activity must be severely reduced. The amount of topoisomerase II activity detected in lysates from top2–4 cells, grown at permissive temperature (26 °C), is at least 10-fold less than that detected in lysates from TOP2cells. 2S. Trigueros and J. Roca, unpublished data. In that regard, as the main role of yeast topoisomerase II is to unlink the newly replicated DNA molecules, we suspected that in theΔtop1 top2–4 strain the increased multimerization was due to the incomplete unlinking of monomeric rings. We found, however, no trace of catenanes among the multimeric forms. This observation highlights a topoisomerase II function apart from DNA unlinking. The fact that Δtop3 strains does not contribute to the formation of multimers, further supports the hypothesis that multimerization is related to the reduced efficiency with which DNA supercoils are removed. AlthoughΔtop3 strains are hyper-recombinogenic (5Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), topoisomerase III is the least abundant cellular topoisomerase and its ability to remove DNA supercoils is weaker than that of topoisomerase I or II (14Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of minichromosome multimers in the topoisomerase-deficient yeast cells could be due either to the high instability of monomeric forms, or to the increased stability of the oligomers. We show that DNA circles, consisting of two or three tandem copies of a given construct, are not stable when introduced in topoisomerase-deficient cells. Therefore, the distributions of multimers observed probably reflects a dynamic equilibrium of a bidirectional pathway, in which oligomeric constructs are continuously generated and then transformed back to simpler forms. In topoisomerase-deficient cells, both directions of the process could be enhanced, but the tendency to generate multimers surpasses the tendency to reduce them. In support of that, we show that pre-existing distributions of multimers can be efficiently reverted to the monomeric form just by turning on the expression of the TOP1 gene. The multimerization of minichromosomes has several similarities with the instability of the rDNA gene cluster also observed in topoisomerase-deficient yeast cells. In a double mutantΔtop1 top2–4 strain, over half the rDNA genes are present as extrachromosomal rings containing one or more copies of the 9-kb rDNA unit. These excised rings integrate back into the rDNA locus when a plasmid borne TOP1 or TOP2 gene is expressed (19Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Like minichromosome multimerization, the instability of the rDNA gene cluster is a bidirectional process, in which both the forward and reverse pathways are probably mediated by homologous recombination. We have verified that in Δtop1 top2–4 strains both cases of instability coexist and are analogously tuned. In topoisomerase-deficient cells, excision dominates over integration in the case of rDNA genes, and multimerization dominates over resolution in the case of minichromosomes. The expression of a plasmid-borne TOP1 gene readily eliminates the multimers as well as the excised rDNA rings. The instability of circular minichromosomes and that of rDNA genes may be variations of the same process. If that is the case, a common threat is making circular minichromosomes and the rDNA genes particularly sensitive to topoisomerase deficiency. This thread does not alter, however, the stability of tandem copies of other DNA sequences located at the chromosomal level (18Christman M.F. Dietrich F.S. Fink G.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 413-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The instability of rDNA genes has been attributed to their exceptionally high transcriptional rate (19Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). DNA supercoiling generated during their transcription would persist longer when the combined relaxation activity of the cellular topoisomerases is low. Supercoiling in general and negative supercoiling in particular may stimulate recombination by unwinding the DNA duplex or disrupting the chromatin structure. However, the rate of transcription in the circular constructs examined here (which harbor the yeastTRP1 or URA3 genes) is not high. Nevertheless, we envisage that in circular minichromosomes any sporadic burst of DNA supercoiling might be more intense or persist longer than in chromosomal sequences, and that such an effect would be magnified in topoisomerase-deficient cells. One reason is that a burst of DNA supercoiling in a small domain cannot be diluted to the same extend as in a large one. Another reason is that the amount of topoisomerase activity required to modulate DNA supercoiling must correlate with the dimensions of the topological domains in which cellular DNA is organized, rather than with the total amount of cellular DNA. Therefore, the smaller the size of a topological domain, the more limited the diffusible topoisomerase activity that will reach it. Circular minichromosomes, hence, would become quickly affected when cellular levels of topoisomerase are low. This scheme would explain why the instability of the monomers is inversely proportional to their size; and also, why all the multimeric distributions are centered around circles of similar dimensions (about 5–10 kb, as seen in Fig.1), regardless of the size of the monomeric construct that generated them. Taken together, these results suggest that topoisomerase dosage is finely adjusted by the cell for the removal of DNA supercoils. On one hand, cells might not be allowed to surpass a threshold amount of topoisomerase activity. Overexpression of topoisomerase I from multicopy plasmids carrying the TOP1 gene rapidly leads to cell death (35Bjornsti M.A. Benedetti P. Viglianti G.A. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6318-6323PubMed Google Scholar). On the other, subthreshold levels of topoisomerases compromise genome stability, which is promptly manifested as increased recombination in certain multicopy sequences (circular minichromosomes and the rDNA cluster). The reported findings will provide a suitable model to further study the interplay between DNA topology and genome stability, as well as mechanistic aspects of DNA recombination."
