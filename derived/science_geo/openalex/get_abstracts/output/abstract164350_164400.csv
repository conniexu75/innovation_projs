https://openalex.org/W2106261260,"Neural responses accompanying anticipation and experience of monetary gains and losses were monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Trials comprised an initial ""prospect"" (expectancy) phase, when a set of three monetary amounts was displayed, and a subsequent ""outcome"" phase, when one of these amounts was awarded. Hemodynamic responses in the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA) and orbital gyrus tracked the expected values of the prospects, and responses to the highest value set of outcomes increased monotonically with monetary value in the nucleus accumbens, SLEA, and hypothalamus. Responses to prospects and outcomes were generally, but not always, seen in the same regions. The overlap of the observed activations with those seen previously in response to tactile stimuli, gustatory stimuli, and euphoria-inducing drugs is consistent with a contribution of common circuitry to the processing of diverse rewards."
https://openalex.org/W2090816060,"The role of mPer1 and mPer2 in regulating circadian rhythms was assessed by disrupting these genes. Mice homozygous for the targeted allele of either mPer1 or mPer2 had severely disrupted locomotor activity rhythms during extended exposure to constant darkness. Clock gene RNA rhythms were blunted in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of mPer2 mutant mice, but not of mPER1-deficient mice. Peak mPER and mCRY1 protein levels were reduced in both lines. Behavioral rhythms of mPer1/mPer3 and mPer2/mPer3 double-mutant mice resembled rhythms of mice with disruption of mPer1 or mPer2 alone, respectively, confirming the placement of mPer3 outside the core circadian clockwork. In contrast, mPer1/mPer2 double-mutant mice were immediately arrhythmic. Thus, mPER1 influences rhythmicity primarily through interaction with other clock proteins, while mPER2 positively regulates rhythmic gene expression, and there is partial compensation between products of these two genes."
https://openalex.org/W1996323440,"Odor coding in the Drosophila antenna is examined by a functional analysis of individual olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in vivo. Sixteen distinct classes of ORNs, each with a unique response spectrum to a panel of 47 diverse odors, are identified by extracellular recordings. ORNs exhibit multiple modes of response dynamics: an individual neuron can show either excitatory or inhibitory responses, and can exhibit different modes of termination kinetics, when stimulated with different odors. The 16 ORN classes are combined in stereotyped configurations within seven functional types of basiconic sensilla. One sensillum type contains four ORNs and the others contain two neurons, combined according to a strict pairing rule. We provide a functional map of ORNs, showing that each ORN class is restricted to a particular spatial domain on the antennal surface."
https://openalex.org/W2150443013,"Using pharmacological approaches, several recent studies suggest that local protein synthesis is required for synaptic plasticity. Convincing demonstrations of bona fide dendritic protein synthesis in mammalian neurons are rare, however. We developed a protein synthesis reporter in which the coding sequence of green fluorescent protein is flanked by the 5' and 3' untranslated regions from CAMKII-alpha, conferring both dendritic mRNA localization and translational regulation. In cultured hippocampal neurons, we show that BDNF, a growth factor involved in synaptic plasticity, stimulates protein synthesis of the reporter in intact, mechanically, or ""optically"" isolated dendrites. The stimulation of protein synthesis is blocked by anisomycin and not observed in untreated neurons. In addition, dendrites appear to possess translational hot spots, regions near synapses where protein synthesis consistently occurs over time."
https://openalex.org/W2130493951,"Synaptic inhibition by GABA(A) and glycine receptors, which are ligand-gated anion channels, depends on the electrochemical potential for chloride. Several potassium-chloride cotransporters can lower the intracellular chloride concentration [Cl(-)](i), including the neuronal isoform KCC2. We show that KCC2 knockout mice died immediately after birth due to severe motor deficits that also abolished respiration. Sciatic nerve recordings revealed abnormal spontaneous electrical activity and altered spinal cord responses to peripheral electrical stimuli. In the spinal cord of wild-type animals, the KCC2 protein was found at inhibitory synapses. Patch-clamp measurements of embryonic day 18.5 spinal cord motoneurons demonstrated an excitatory GABA and glycine action in the absence, but not in the presence, of KCC2, revealing a crucial role of KCC2 for synaptic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1982110038,"Myelinated fibers are organized into distinct domains that are necessary for saltatory conduction. These domains include the nodes of Ranvier and the flanking paranodal regions where glial cells closely appose and form specialized septate-like junctions with axons. These junctions contain a Drosophila Neurexin IV-related protein, Caspr/Paranodin (NCP1). Mice that lack NCP1 exhibit tremor, ataxia, and significant motor paresis. In the absence of NCP1, normal paranodal junctions fail to form, and the organization of the paranodal loops is disrupted. Contactin is undetectable in the paranodes, and K(+) channels are displaced from the juxtaparanodal into the paranodal domains. Loss of NCP1 also results in a severe decrease in peripheral nerve conduction velocity. These results show a critical role for NCP1 in the delineation of specific axonal domains and the axon-glia interactions required for normal saltatory conduction."
https://openalex.org/W2041388242,"Rapid nerve impulse conduction depends on specialized membrane domains in myelinated nerve, the node of Ranvier, the paranode, and the myelinated internodal region. We report that GPI-linked contactin enables the formation of the paranodal septate-like axo-glial junctions in myelinated peripheral nerve. Contactin clusters at the paranodal axolemma during Schwann cell myelination. Ablation of contactin in mutant mice disrupts junctional attachment at the paranode and reduces nerve conduction velocity 3-fold. The mutation impedes intracellular transport and surface expression of Caspr and leaves NF155 on apposing paranodal myelin disengaged. The contactin mutation does not affect sodium channel clustering at the nodes of Ranvier but alters the location of the Shaker-type Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 potassium channels. Thus, contactin is a crucial part in the machinery that controls junctional attachment at the paranode and ultimately the physiology of myelinated nerve."
https://openalex.org/W2063791205,"The patterning of skeletal muscle is thought to depend upon signals provided by motor neurons. We show that AChR gene expression and AChR clusters are concentrated in the central region of embryonic skeletal muscle in the absence of innervation. Neurally derived Agrin is dispensable for this early phase of AChR expression, but MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by Agrin, is required to establish this AChR prepattern. The zone of AChR expression in muscle lacking motor axons is wider than normal, indicating that neural signals refine this muscle-autonomous prepattern. Neuronal Neuregulin-1, however, is not involved in this refinement process, nor indeed in synapse-specific AChR gene expression. Our results demonstrate that AChR expression is patterned in the absence of innervation, raising the possibility that similarly prepatterned muscle-derived cues restrict axon growth and initiate synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W2130672873,"The primary motor cortex (M1) is known to control motor performance. Recent findings have also implicated M1 in motor learning, as neurons in this area show learning-related plasticity. In the present study, we analyzed the neuronal activity recorded in M1 in a force field adaptation task. Our goal was to investigate the neuronal reorganization across behavioral epochs (before, during, and after adaptation). Here we report two main findings. First, memory cells were present in two classes. With respect to the changes of preferred direction (Pd), these two classes complemented each other after readaptation. Second, for the entire neuronal population, the shift of Pd matched the shift observed for muscles. These results provide a framework whereby the activity of distinct neuronal subpopulations combines to subserve both functions of motor performance and motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W1995457093,"Oxidative stress may cause tissue injury through activation of the precursors of matrix metalloproteinase (proMMPs). In this study, we observed glutathione (GSH)-dependent proMMP activation induced by peroxynitrite, a potent oxidizing agent formed during inflammatory processes. Peroxynitrite strongly activated all three types of purified human proMMPs (proMMP-1, -8, and -9) in the presence of similar concentrations of GSH. Of the potential reaction products between peroxynitrite and GSH, only S-nitroglutathione (GSNO2) caused proMMP activation. ExtensiveS-glutathiolation of the proMMP protein occurred during activation of proMMP by peroxynitrite and GSH, as shown by radiolabeling studies with [35S]GSH or [3H]GSH. Evidence of appreciableS-glutathiolation persisted even after dithiothreitol and protein-denaturing treatment, however, suggesting that someS-glutathiolation did not occur through formation of simple mixed disulfide. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry indicated that not only peroxynitrite plus GSH but also synthetic GSNO2 produced dithiothreitol-resistant S-glutathiolation of the synthetic peptide PRCGVPD, which is a well conserved Cys-containing sequence of the propeptide autoinhibitory domain of proMMPs. PRCGVPDS-glutathiolation is presumed to be formed through glutathione disulfide S-oxide (GS(O)SR), based on them/z 1064.

MMPs, a group of zinc neutral endopeptidases, are produced by a variety of cells and are released extracellularly as inactive precursors (proMMPs) (7Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H.

Activation of proMMPs can be achieved either by limited proteolysis of the zymogens or by chemical modification, such as by organomercurial compounds and reactive oxygen species (7Springman E.B.

We previously found that some bacterial proteinases, particularly thermolysin family enzymes such as Pseudomonas elastase and Vibrio cholerae proteinase, can activate proMMPs via limited proteolysis of the autoinhibitory domain (11Okamoto T.

Moreover, we showed that reactive nitrogen intermediates such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) activate human neutrophil proMMP (proMMP-8), which may be involved in neutrophil-induced tissue injury (12Okamoto T.

Excessive production of peroxynitrite has been reported to cause oxidative and nitrative stress under various pathological conditions (14Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J.

For example, oxidative stress during inflammatory responses is often associated with tissue destruction (19Weiss S.J. N. Engl. J.

GSH, a tripeptide (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly), is a sulfhydryl-containing compound with wide distribution in various organisms (24Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev.

This ubiquitous tripeptide is the most abundant intracellular thiol in cells; it regulates gene expression, cell proliferation and apoptosis, signal transduction, enzyme and protein functions, and oxidative stress in biological systems (26Sies H.

In addition, protein S-glutathiolation through mixed disulfide formation is suggested to have physiological and pathophysiological consequences occurring during oxidative stress (29Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 30Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem.

The biological relevance of protein S-glutathiolation is, however, not fully clarified, particularly in oxidative stress-related pathology.The intracellular concentration of GSH is maintained at a high level (1–8 mm) in a variety of cells, but in the extracellular milieu it exists at a low micromolar level. High levels of GSH (about 100 µm) are found in alveolar lining fluid in normal human subjects, and the GSH concentration is decreased in many inflammatory lung diseases including IPF and acute respiratory distress syndrome (28Rahman I.

Our recent study indicated that different isoforms of MMPs are critically involved in ECM remodeling of lung tissue in IPF (4Suga M. Iyonaga K. Okamoto T. Gushima Y. Miyakawa H. Akaike T. Ando M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1949-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which seems to undergo oxidative stress as evidenced by reduced levels of GSH (36Cantin A.M. Hubbard R.C. Crystal R.G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 139: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of great importance to explore the role of GSH in the pathogenesis of oxidative stress-induced tissue damage as related to regulation of MMP activities, which may be affected by free radical species and reactive oxygen and nitrogen oxide intermediates, such as peroxynitrite, generated during inflammation.In the present study, to obtain a better understanding of the regulatory function of GSH in ECM destruction induced by oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of GSH on peroxynitrite-mediated activation of proMMPs by using three types of purified human proMMPs (proMMP-1, -8, and -9). Our results revealed a unique mechanism of proMMP activation caused by S-glutathiolation of proMMPs, in which the GSH adduct of proMMP may be produced through disulfideS-oxide formation involving generation ofS-nitroglutathione (GSNO2) by peroxynitrite.DISCUSSIONA number of MMPs play an important role in degradation and remodeling of ECM under physiological and pathological conditions (1Salo T.

ProMMPs are produced by various cells, and their expression is regulated in different ways in each type of cell (7Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Many other cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, macrophages, and tumor cells produce a diverse array of MMPs, including MMP-1, -2, and -9, stromelysin, matrilysin, and macrophage elastase (MMP-12). Some types of MMPs are up-regulated by proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and transforming growth factor-β1, leading to tissue injury in various inflammatory diseases (39Salo T.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar). All MMPs are produced as inactive precursors (proMMPs), and a specific activation process is a prerequisite of the generation of their proteolytic activity against ECM components (7Springman E.B.

ProMMPs consist of three discernible domains, referred to as the autoinhibitory domain, the zinc-binding catalytic domain, and the homopexin-like C-terminal domain (7Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 9Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S.

A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). The sequence PRCGVPD in the autoinhibitory domain, which is highly conserved among all members of the proMMP family, is thought to be involved in maintaining the inactive form of the enzyme by coordinate binding of cysteine thiolate and zinc ion, which protects the active site from substrates. The key event during proMMP activation is dissociation of the binding of the thiolate moiety in the PRCGVPD region and the zinc atom at the active center of the enzyme, leading to full accessibility of the enzyme to the ECM (i.e. the cysteine switch activation mechanism) (7Springman E.B.

We previously found that proteolytic activation of proMMPs is also brought about quite effectively by some exogenous proteinases derived from pathogenic bacteria, which may contribute to the invasiveness and the pathogenic potential of such bacteria (11Okamoto T.

Moreover, reactive oxygen species, particularly hypochlorite anion (OCl−), are reported to activate proMMP-8, possibly through oxidative modification of the autoinhibitory domain, although the exact mechanisms and biological relevance of the oxidative activation of proMMPs remain unclear (38Weiss S.J. Peppin G. Ortiz X. Ragsdale C. Test S.T. Science. 1985; 227: 747-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in our previous work, similar activation of proMMP-8 purified from human neutrophils is induced by physiologically relevant micromolar concentrations of reactive nitrogen oxides such as NO2 and peroxynitrite (12Okamoto T. Akaike T. Nagano T. Miyajima S. Suga M. Ando M. Ichimori K. Maeda H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory mechanism of proMMP activation occurring under oxidative stress has been poorly understood.In this context, our present study revealed a unique mechanism of proMMP activation that is induced by peroxynitrite and GSH, possibly through S-glutathiolation of the autoinhibitory domain of proMMPs via formation of a stable disulfide S-oxide. This result suggests an important role of peroxynitrite as a potential mediator of oxidative tissue injury through MMP-dependent ECM destruction. This idea is further supported by our recent study showing involvement of peroxynitrite-dependent proMMP activation in enhanced vascular permeability in the skin of mice and guinea pigs and in an experimental murine solid tumor in vivo (42Wu J. Akaike T. Hayashida K. Okamoto T. Okuyama A. Maeda H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 2001; 92: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).GSH, ubiquitously distributed in biological systems, is known to be an important molecule in defense against oxidative stress (26Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 916-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 27Meister A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1969.s-1975sGoogle Scholar, 28Rahman I. MacNee W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1405-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). GSH scavenges active oxygen species and peroxynitrite, and GSH is thus often decreased during oxidative stress occurring in various diseases. For example, although relatively high concentration of GSH (∼100 µm) exists in the alveolar spaces of the lung (28Rahman I. MacNee W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1405-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 34van der Vliet A. O'Neill C.A. Cross C.E. Koostra J.M. Volz W.G. Halliwell B. Louie S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L289-L296PubMed Google Scholar), the GSH concentration in the alveolar spaces is significantly decreased (less than 100 µm) in various inflammatory lung diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome and IPF (28Rahman I. MacNee W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1405-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 35Pacht E.R. Timerman A.P. Lykens M.G. Merola A.J.

Dis. 1989; 139: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); plasma in normal human subjects contains only low micromolar levels of GSH. MMP activity appears to be regulated by GSH in a manner that is based on a delicate redox balance of GSH affected by peroxynitrite. Specifically, under physiological conditions, a high concentration of GSH suppresses the activation of proMMPs and protects the ECM against disintegration induced by peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress. Prolonged and sustained inflammation, however, will produce a high level of proMMP expression in the inflammatory foci along with excessive amounts of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediate species such as superoxide, NO, and their product peroxynitrite. Excessive oxidant production thus causes a reduction of local concentrations of GSH, as just mentioned. Accordingly, oxidative stress will tip the balance between GSH and peroxynitrite in favor of oxidative glutathiolation of proMMP (at the autoinhibitory domain), leading to accelerated proMMP activation and ECM destruction. It is interesting that the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, an endogenous MMP inhibitor, is readily inactivated by peroxynitrite (43Frears E.R. Zhang Z. Blake D.R. O'Connell J.P. Winyard P.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which suggests that peroxynitrite may potentiate MMP activity not only by direct activation of proMMPs but also by preservation of MMP activity after it is generated. Another important postulate related to glutathiolation-induced proMMP activation is that the thiolate ligand located in the well conserved motif PRCGVPD of the autoinhibitory domain of proMMPs may function as a redox sensor for the triggering of ECM disintegration in both physiological and pathological conditions.In the present study, only GSH induced proMMP activation with the help of peroxynitrite; other sulfhydryl-containing compounds such asl-cysteine and NAC did not. This result suggests a unique function of GSH in the chemical modification of proMMPs (S-glutathiolation). Glutathiolation of proMMPs via disulfide S-oxide may drastically distort the structure and function of the autoinhibitory domain of proMMPs, possibly because of an as yet unidentified interaction with amino acid residues in the vicinity of the glutathiolation. In contrast, several reports have revealed a complicated picture of chemical reactions of sulfhydryls with NO and peroxynitrite (20Karoui H. Hogg N. Frejaville C. Tordo P. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol.

For example, various oxidized, nitrosylated, and nitrated derivatives of GSH are produced by peroxynitrite or NO. Of a series of these derivatives, GSNO2 seems to be the most important molecular species involved in proMMP activation by S-glutathiolation through disulfide S-oxide formation, as we found in the present study.Formation of GSNO2 from the reaction of peroxynitrite and GSH has been described by Balazy et al. (37Balazy M. Kaminski P.M. Mao K. Tan J. Wolin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32009-32015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similar to their study, our MALDI-TOF MS analysis showed generation of GSNO2 from GSH by peroxynitrite (data not shown). These results are further supported by the fact that both authentic GSNO2 and GSNO2 formed in the reaction of peroxynitrite and GSH exhibit the same potential for activating proMMP and forming a glutathione disulfide S-oxide adduct of PRCGVPD. GSNO2 formation by peroxynitrite may be explained at least in part by a mechanism of tyrosine nitration by peroxynitrite, as proposed by Lymar's and Goldstein's groups (51Coddington J.W. Hurst J.K. Lymar S.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2438-2443Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 52Goldstein S. Czapski G. Lind J. Merenyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3031-3036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). They suggested that nitrotyrosine is formed via reaction of tyrosine with radicals ⋅OH and ⋅NO2 that have escaped from a solvent-caged radical pair of ONOOH (ONO⋅, ⋅OH) (51Coddington J.W. Hurst J.K. Lymar S.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2438-2443Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, analogous to the tyrosine nitration reaction, glutathione thiyl radical (GS⋅) might first be formed by reaction of GSH with either ⋅OH or ⋅NO2, and then GSNO2 could be produced by a coupling of the radicals GS⋅ and ⋅NO2. GS⋅ generation from GSH by peroxynitrite was clearly documented by Karoui et al.(20Karoui H. Hogg N. Frejaville C. Tordo P. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6000-6009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Another question remains, however. How does GSNO2participate in disulfide S-oxide formation in proteins and peptides? Thermodynamic analysis of organic thionitrate (RSNO2) isomers has suggested that concerted rearrangement of thionitrate occurs, resulting in formation of isomers such as sulfenyl nitrite (RSONO) and sulfinyl nitrite (RS(O)NO), with subsequent homolytic generation of NO (53Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennet B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 1627-1638Crossref Google Scholar). A proposed mechanism for this NO generation is a homolysis-recombination pathway of thionitrate: RSNO2 → (RS⋅, ⋅NO2) → RSONO → RSO⋅ + ⋅NO. Indeed, NO release from GSNO2was demonstrated by Balazy et al. (37Balazy M. Kaminski P.M. Mao K. Tan J. Wolin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32009-32015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting indirectly that GSH sulfinyl radical (GSO⋅), which is the counterpart of sulfenyl nitrite and sulfinyl nitrite for NO, may be generated to yield disulfide S-oxide in the proteins.Protein S-glutathiolation was also reported to be involved in oxidative regulation of various enzymatic and protein functionsin vitro (29Ziegler D.M.

To understand the effect of aberrant Egr2 activity on Schwann cell gene expression, we performed microarray expression profiling to identify genes regulated by Egr2 in Schwann cells. These include genes encoding myelin proteins and enzymes required for synthesis of normal myelin lipids. Using these newly identified targets, we have shown that neuropathy-associated EGR2 mutants dominant-negatively inhibit wild-type Egr2-mediated expression of essential myelin genes to levels sufficiently low to result in the abnormal myelination observed in these patients."

By inducing mitotic recombination in a subclass of eye progenitors, we generated mutant R7 axons surrounded by largely wild-type R cell axons and a wild-type target.

We show that alternatively spliced forms of synaptotagmin VII are expressed in a developmentally regulated pattern in brain and are concentrated in presynaptic active zones of central synapses. In neuroendocrine PC12 cells, the C(2)A and C(2)B domains of synaptotagmin VII are potent inhibitors of Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis, but only when they bind Ca(2+).

In a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of the AL, interactions between excitatory PNs and inhibitory local neurons (LNs) created coherent network oscillations during odor stimulation. GABAergic interconnections between LNs led to competition among them such that different groups of LNs oscillated with periodic Ca2+ spikes during different 50–250 ms temporal epochs, similar to those recorded in vivo. During these epochs, LN-evoked IPSPs caused phase-locked, population oscillations in sets of postsynaptic PNs. The model shows how alternations of the inhibitory drive can temporally encode sensory information in networks of neurons without precisely tuned intrinsic oscillatory properties."

Pol ε is a proofreading DNA polymerase, which has been implicated in DNA replication, as temperature-sensitive mutants show defects in DNA replication in both S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (6Araki H.

Moreover, pol ε is associated with origins of DNA replication and it proceeds along the replication fork (9Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In human cells, pol ε is associated with actively replicated cellular DNA (10Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syväoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and has been shown to perform an important fraction of replicative DNA synthesis (11Pospiech H. Kursula I. Abdel-Aziz W.

Surprisingly, the catalytic domain of pol ε is not essential for viability in S. cerevisiae. Instead, the C terminus, which interacts with Dpb2, exerts all of the essential functions (12Kesti T. Flick K. Keränen S. Syväoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Pol ε has been proposed to function in the repair of UV-damaged DNA because it is able to catalyze UV-induced DNA synthesis in vivo (13Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell.

A role in base excision repair is suggested by the fact that pol ε mutants fail to support repair synthesis in vitro, and repair activity can be restored by the addition of purified pol ε (15Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1051-11058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pol ε has also been proposed to function in a specialized replication process required to repair double strand breaks (16Holmes A.M. Haber J.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 415-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition to replicative and repair roles, it has been suggested that pol ε coordinates transcriptional and cell cycle responses to DNA damage and replication blocks (17Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, a BRCT domain-containing protein, Dpb11, interacts with the pol ε complex and was originally identified as a suppressor of pol ε catalytic and Dpb2 subunit mutants (18Araki H.

The inability of DPB11 mutants to restrain mitosis in the presence of incomplete replication suggests that Dpb11 is also needed for the replication checkpoint (18Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A.

Apparently Dpb11 functions during early steps of DNA replication and is required for loading of DNA polymerases onto replication origins (19Masumoto H. Sugino A. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Based on these observations it appears that the association of pol ε with Dpb11 is important for at least part of the functions of pol ε. S. pombe Cut5 also contains four BRCT domains (22Bork P.

Cut5 has been shown to associate with another BRCT domain containing protein Crb2 and with the Chk1 kinase (28Saka Y. Esashi F. Matsusaka T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3387-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We were interested in identifying functional homologs of budding yeast Dpb11 and fission yeast Cut5 in metazoans because of the characterized association of Dpb11 and pol ε. Based on homology searches we have focused our investigations on a protein with eight BRCT domains, topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein (TopBP1) (29Yamane K. Kawabata M. Tsuruo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results strongly suggest that the 180-kDa TopBP1 protein is required for DNA replication and strongly implicated in other functions ascribed to Dpb11 and Cut5, including checkpoint control. A human cDNA sequence KIAA0259 (GenBank accession D87448) was used to search for human EST clones from the expressed sequence tag data base. EST clones AA013344,AA195149, and R54257 from Genome Systems, Inc. (USA) were used to construct full-length TopBP1 cDNA. EST clones contained deletions, and therefore nucleotides 308–1560 and 1628–2620 were amplified from human T-cell (HUT-78) and thymus cDNA libraries (CLONTECH). Human Rad9 cDNA was amplified from human thymus cDNA library (CLONTECH). S. cerevisiae YHA 401 (MATa dpb11–1 ade5–1 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 trp289) (18Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc.

Cell. 1993; 74: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were scored for growth at restrictive, semipermissive, or permissive temperature. HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL2.2) were cultivated in suspension as “spinner cells” in Joklik's modification of minimal essential medium (Flow Laboratories) supplemented with sodium bicarbonate and 5% calf serum. Attached HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2), MCF-7 cells, and EcR-293 cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. IMR-90 cells (ATCC CCL 186) were cultivated as monolayers in minimal essential medium supplemented with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.) and nonessential amino acids. All media contained 2 mmGlutamax-I, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. For EcR-293 cells, the medium also contained 200 µg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Recombinant clones were selected and maintained in a medium supplemented with 400 µg/ml G418 (Geneticin). Primary antibodies for immunostaining included α-BRCA1 clone MS13 (Oncogene or Zymed Laboratories Inc.), α-PCNA clone PC-10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), α-BrdUrd clone BMC-9318 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-BrdUrd clone BMC-9318 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and polyclonal antibodies α-TopBP1.1 and α-TopBP1.2. Secondary antibodies included affinity-purified tetramethylrhodamine isomer R-conjugated swine α-rabbit IgG (DAKO), affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat α-mouse IgG (DAKO), and affinity purified A-488-conjugated goat α-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Mouse monoclonal antibodies 93H3B and 93G1A against human pol ε have been described previously (32Uitto L. Halleen J. Hentunen T. Höyhtyä M. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal α-human actin C4(3) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, monoclonal α-FLAG M5 and M2 from Sigma, and polyclonal α-mouse IgG from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody SJK-132-20 (33Tanaka S. Hu S.Z. Wang T.S. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8386-8390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was purified from hybridoma (ATCC CRL-1640) culture supernatant using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbits were immunized according to standard protocols with a protein fragment representing different regions of the catalytic A subunit of human pol ε or TopBP1. The antigens were prepared as described by Uitto et al. (32Uitto L. Halleen J. Hentunen T. Höyhtyä M. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The antiserum of rabbit K27 was raised against a peptide of human pol ε A subunit (amino acids 1–203, GenBank accession 3192938). The rabbit antisera α-TopBP1.1 and α-TopBP1.2 were raised against amino acids 792–1003 and 1023–1167 of TopBP1, respectively. Specificity of antibodies was examined by Western analysis of human HeLa S3 cell extracts and by antigen block assay. Antibodies were purified by protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from IMR-90 cells was isolated with TRIzol®LS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The ribonuclease protection assay was performed with an RPA IIITM ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion) using 10 µg of the total RNA. The cDNA templates for human cytoplasmic β-actin and histone H3 were used to prepare antisense RNA probes for ribonuclease protection assays as described (34Tuusa J. Uitto L. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2178-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The template for TopBP1 was a 174-base pair fragment, representing nucleotides 2035–2209 of the cDNA. For preparation of cell extract, IMR cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 5 min on ice with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholic acid). Lysate was cleared by centrifugation. 20 µg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and α-TopBP1.2 antibody was used for immunoblotting. Preparation of HeLa S3 cell nuclei and cytoplasmic extracts and subsequent permeabilization of the nuclei with lysolecithin were performed as described by Stoeber et al. (35Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Krude T. Romanowski P. Marheineke K. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Nuclei were permeabilized immediately before use, washed, and suspended by 10 strokes with a loose fitting pestle. DNA replication reactions in isolated nuclei were performed at least in triplicate per experiment as described by Pospiech et al. (11Pospiech H. Kursula I. Abdel-Aziz W. Malkas L. Uitto L. Kastelli M. Vihinen-Ranta M. Eskelinen S. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3799-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). IMR-90 fibroblasts were synchronized by serum starvation for 96 h as described by Tuusa et al. (34Tuusa J. Uitto L. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2178-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were synchronized (36Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) by serum starvation for 24 h. Cells were in S phase 24 h after the readdition of serum as measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine in parallel cell cultures (34Tuusa J. Uitto L. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2178-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and punctate PCNA staining and in G1 phase 5 h after the addition of serum. DNA was damaged (37Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with 1 mmhydroxyurea (HU), 100 µg/ml zeocin, 50 µg/ml methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), or 10 J/m2 UV light. Cells were grown to logarithmic phase and fixed in 3% neutral paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Alternatively, cells were fixed in 3% neutral paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and in cold methanol for either 2 or 10 min. Incubation with primary antibody was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS with 0.2% gelatin (from cold water fish skin, Sigma). After washes with PBS and PBS with 0.2% gelatin, incubation with secondary antibody was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS with 0.2% gelatin. DNA was stained with bisbenzimide (1 µg/ml Hoechst 33258, Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. To label nascent DNA, MCF-7 cells were incubated in growth medium containing 0.1 mm BrdUrd (Sigma) for 3 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with methanol-paraformaldehyde, and PCNA was immunolabeled as described above. Cells were fixed again using paraformaldehyde for 10 min and treated with 4 m HCl for 10 min to reveal incorporated BrdUrd. Immunolabeling was done as above using either fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-BrdUrd or α-BrdUrd- and A-488-labeled α-mouse IgG. Alternatively, cells were treated with 1 mm HU for 5 h and labeled with 0.1 mm BrdUrd for 15 min right after the release. Slides were mounted with IMMU-MOUNT (Shandon) after washes with PBS and water and examined with a fluorescence microscope (Leitz or Olympus) under the 50× or 60× objective. Color slides were taken using Kodak Ektachrome 400 film, or alternatively images were recorded using a CCD camera and 60× or 100× objective. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Under the conditions used, no significant signal attributable to secondary antibody alone was detected. The BRCT domains 4 and 5 (amino acids 534–763) of human TopBP1 were fused to LexA DNA binding domain in pLex-a vector (38Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). A human peripheral lymphocyte cDNA library (39Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) was transformed into the L40 yeast strain expressing the LexA BRCT4+5 fusion. Colonies that grew on 1 mm 3-aminotriazole His− medium were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids isolated from primary positives were retransformed into L40 yeast in conjunction with either pLexBRCT4+5 or a number of control baits fused to LexA and tested for growth on His− medium and β-galactosidase activity. Full-length TopBP1 cDNA was also ligated to pVP16 vector and full-length hRad9 cDNA to LexA vector. In control experiments, BRCT domains 3 (amino acids 348–448) and 6 (amino acids 887–1004) of TopBP1, human lamin C (amino acids 66–230), and human Chk1 (amino acids 1–476) fused to LexA were tested together with hRad9. Human pol ε catalytic subunit (amino acids 1–2286) and human Cdc45 (amino acids 1–566) were fused to both LexA and VP16 for control experiments. An Ecdysone-inducible expression system (Invitrogen) was used for overexpression of the TopBP1 and hRad9. The full-length TopBP1 cDNA was subcloned into the pIND vector and full-length hRad9 cDNA into modified pIND vector that contained FLAG epitope and SV40 T-antigen type nuclear localization signal. The linearized constructs were transfected into EcR-293 cells using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). G418-resistant colonies were selected and cultivated further. TopBP1 expression was tested by induction with 2 µm Ponasterone A for 24 h and subsequent immunoblotting. Clone TopBP1–20 showed the highest expression out of 20 G418-resistant colonies tested, with 2–3-fold higher expression after induction. A similar procedure was utilized with Rad9–5 clone. Expression levels were studied by immunoblotting with α-FLAG M5 antibody. Subconfluent cell cultures on six-well plates were washed with PBS and suspended in 500 µl of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Cells were disrupted by sonication for 2 × 15 s (7.5-µm amplitude, Soniprep 150, SANYO) on ice. After incubation on ice for 15 min, cell extract was clarified by centrifugation. Preclearing was performed with 2 µl of preimmune rabbit serum. Preimmune IgG-binding proteins were collected on protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 10 µg of specific antibody. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein A- Sepharose/protein G-agarose, washed twice with lysis buffer, once with washing buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and once with washing buffer I (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The pellets were suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western analysis. Approximately 107 EcR-293 cells were metabolically labeled with 1–2 mCi of32Pi in 2 ml of phosphate-free medium for 4 h. Washed cells were lysed in 200 µl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 70 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 10 min. The samples were diluted up to 20 × volume (4 ml) with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). TopBP1 was immunoprecipitated from precleared samples by 10 µg of α-TopBP1.2 antibody and collected by protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated TopBP1 was analyzed by 6.25% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and autoradiographed. Chromosomal mapping of TopBP1 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was carried out by SeeDNA Biotech Inc. (Canada) from lymphocytes isolated from human blood using a 2062-base pair cDNA probe, which was biotinylated with dATP. We used homology searches to identify functional human homologs of budding yeast and fission yeast Cut5 and identified a human cDNA, KIAA0259 (40Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Ohira M. Kawarabayasi Y. Ohara O. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Miyajima N. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), predicted to encode a protein with eight BRCT domains. This protein was identified independently in a yeast two-hybrid screen searching for DNA topoisomerase IIβ-binding proteins and therefore named TopBP1 (29Yamane K. Kawabata M. Tsuruo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the two tandem BRCT domains of Cut5 and Dpb11 are most similar to BRCT domains 1–2 and 4–5 of TopBP1. Sequence similarities around the BRCT domains 1–2 of TopBP1 extend beyond the repeat, including amino acid residues 102–332, and this area is 35% similar (14% identical) and 44% similar (26% identical) to the N termini of Dpb11 and Cut5, respectively. In addition, the similarity around domains 4–5 covers amino acids 547–897, where TopBP1 is 27% similar (11% identical) and 41% similar (23% identical) to the C termini of Dpb11 and Cut5, respectively. However, TopBP1 contains additional BRCT domains, which are not present in either Dpb11 or Cut5 as shown schematically in Fig.1. TopBP1 is not able to suppress temperature-sensitive mutants of either budding yeast DPB11(dpb11–1) or fission yeast Cut5 (cut5-T401 or cut5-580) (data not shown; see “Experimental Procedures”). Nevertheless, the observed similarities imply that TopBP1 may be executing some tasks similar to those performed by the yeast proteins. This notion is supported by the recent identification of the apparentDrosophila TopBP1 homolog, which is encoded by themus101 locus (41Yamamoto R.R. Axton J.M. Yamamoto Y.Y. Saunders R.D.C. Glover D.M. Henderson D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 711-721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mus101 has been genetically linked to DNA synthesis (42Boyd J.B. Setlow R.B. Genetics. 1976; 84: 507-526PubMed Google Scholar), DNA repair, and chromosome condensation at mitosis (43Gatti M Smith D.A. Baker B.S. Science. 1983; 221: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 44Smith D.A. Baker B.S. Gatti M. Genetics. 1985; 110: 647-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted Mus101 protein contains seven BRCT domains, and the overall similarity with human TopBP1 is 38% (28% identity; see Fig. 1). Another apparent homolog is present in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where the predicted F37D6.1 protein contains six BRCT domains as three tandem repeats (Fig. 1) and shares 38% similarity (28% identity) with the N terminus of TopBP1 (amino acids 15–470) and 47% similarity (33% identity) with the C-terminal amino acids 1287–1465 of TopBP1, respectively. This homolog is not well characterized, however. In addition to the homologies described above, the C-terminal region of TopBP1 containing two BRCT domains shows similarity to the C-terminal region of the breast cancer susceptibility gene product Brca1. Amino acids 1014–1522 of TopBP1 share 35% similarity and 25% identity to amino acids 1335–1863 of Brca1, corresponding to the two C-terminal BRCT domains as well as the region upstream of the domains in Brca1. This region of Brca1 is important for many of the functions of Brca1, including tumor suppressor activity (45Friedman L.S. Ostermeyer E.A. Szabo C.S. Dowd P. Lynch E.D. Rowell S.E. King M.-C. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated whether the genomic locus of the TOPBP1 gene was a target for chromosomal abnormalities in human cancers. To this end we assigned the human TOPBP1 gene to chromosome 3, region q21-q23 by FISH (Fig. 2) using a 2 kilobase cDNA probe obtained from EST clone AA013344. This chromosomal region, however, has not been associated with disease genes of frequent abnormalities in human cancers according to the OMIM data base. To characterize the TopBP1 protein, we raised polyclonal rabbit antibodies against GST-TopBP1 fusion proteins. Two independent rabbit antisera, α-TopBP1.1 and α-TopBP1.2, specifically recognized a polypeptide from HeLa cell extracts with an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa (Fig.3 A), which is slightly larger than the calculated molecular mass of 171 kDa. This difference may be caused by phosphorylation, as in vivo phosphate labeling indicated that TopBP1 is a phosphoprotein (Fig. 3 B). The phosphorylation of TopBP1 occurred mostly on serine and to a lesser extent on threonine residues according to phosphoamino acid analysis (data not shown). No labeling was detected on tyrosine residues. We also studied TopBP1 expression levels in IMR-90 fibroblasts re-entering the cell cycle after serum starvation. Western blotting analysis indicated that the steady-state levels of TopBP1 started to increase 14 h after restimulation with serum (Fig. 3 C). The increase in TopBP1 protein levels is likely to be a result of increased transcription because RNase protection assays indicated a corresponding increase in TOPBP1 mRNA levels in a parallel experiment (Fig. 3 D). After a peak at 22 h, the mRNA levels decreased again as detected in the 26- and 30-h samples. This indicates that TopBP1 expression is induced concomitantly with S phase entry as demonstrated by thymidine incorporation analysis (Fig. 3 E). The induction is not specific to the first cycle after a cell cycle arrest because a similar S phase peak was observed in HeLa S3 cells, which were first synchronized at M phase with nocodazole and then released from the block (data not shown). These results indicate that TopBP1 expression is highest in S phase cells, suggesting that TopBP1 may be involved in DNA replication. The results presented above together with the requirement of both Cut5 and Dpb11 for DNA replication prompted us to investigate whether TopBP1 is required for chromosomal DNA replication in human cells. Replicative DNA synthesis in isolated HeLa cell nuclei was measured by incorporation of radioactive dCMP into newly synthesized DNA (46Krude T. Jackman M. Pines J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1997; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (270) Google Scholar). One of our polyclonal anti-TopBP1 antisera, α-TopBP1.1, efficiently inhibited replicative DNA synthesis by 44% (Fig. 4), whereas the preimmune serum or another TopBP1 antiserum, α-TopBP1.2, did not inhibit DNA synthesis. The inhibition by α-TopBP1.1 was almost as efficient as inhibition by neutralizing antibodies against human DNA polymerase α and ε employed previously in this assay (11Pospiech H. Kursula I. Abdel-Aziz W. Malkas L. Uitto L. Kastelli M. Vihinen-Ranta M. Eskelinen S. Syväoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3799-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, DNA replication could be inhibited even more dramatically (83%) by adding"

In accordance with the hypothesis, we found strong functional connectivity between activity in ventral LIFG and activity in occipital and temporal cortex only for words, and strong functional connectivity between activity in dorsal LIFG and activity in occipital and temporal cortex for words, pseudowords, and letter strings, but not for false font strings.

Mutations in the TNAP gene can lead to Hypophosphatasia, a rare inborn disease that is characterized by defective bone mineralization. TNAP is 74% homologous to human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) whose crystal structure has been recently determined at atomic resolution (Le Du, M. H., Stigbrand, T., Taussig, M. J., Ménez, A., and Stura, E. A. (2001) J. Biol. Chem, 276, 9158–9165). The degree of homology allowed us to build a reliable TNAP model to investigate the relationship between mutations associated with hypophosphatasia and their probable consequences on the activity or the structure of the enzyme. The mutations are clustered within five crucial regions, namely the active site and its vicinity, the active site valley, the homodimer interface, the crown domain, and the metal-binding site. The crown domain and the metal-binding domain are mammalian-specific and were observed for the first time in the PLAP structure. The crown domain contains a collagen binding loop. A synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence study confirms that the metal in the metal-binding site is a calcium ion. Several severe mutations in TNAP occur around this calcium site, suggesting that calcium may be of critical importance for the TNAP function.

They catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters (1Schwartz J.H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) with release of inorganic phosphate. Mammalian APs have low sequence identity with the Escherichia colienzyme (25–30%), although the residues involved in the active site of the enzyme and the ligands coordinating the two zinc atoms and the magnesium ion are largely conserved. Therefore, the catalytic mechanism deduced from the structure of the E. coli AP is believed to be similar in eukaryotic APs (2Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves the activation of the catalytic serine by a zinc atom, the formation of a covalent phosphoseryl intermediate, the hydrolysis of the phosphoseryl by a water molecule activated by a second zinc atom, and the release of the phosphate product or its transfer to a phosphate acceptor (3Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar).In humans, three out of four AP isozymes are tissue-specific: one is placental (PLAP), the second appears in germ cells (GCAP), and the third in the intestine (IAP). They are 90–98% homologous, and their genes are clustered on chromosome 2q37.1. The fourth, TNAP, 50% identical to the other three, is nonspecific and can be found in bone, liver, and kidney (4Millán J.L. Anticancer Res. 1988; 8: 995-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 5Millán J.L.

The disease is highly variable in its clinical expression, due to the strong allelic heterogeneity in the TNAP gene. Such expression ranges from stillbirth without mineralized bone to pathological fractures developing only late in adulthood (8Whyte M.P. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 439-461PubMed Google Scholar).

Correlation between genotype and phenotype are difficult to establish, because most patients are compound heterozygous for missense mutations, making difficult the determination of the respective roles of each mutation.This difficulty arises mainly from the lack of data concerning the precise role that TNAP plays in bone mineralization. This may be partly solved by the use of site-directed mutagenesis of TNAP cDNA and cell transfection to assay residual activity of the mutant AP enzyme (16Sugimoto N. Iwamoto S. Hoshimo Y. Kajii E.

Transfection assays cannot distinguish structural mutations from functional ones, and mutations that exhibit residual activity in vitro may yield protein that in vivo is incompletely processed or incorrectly addressed to the cell membrane. To complement the study of TNAP missense mutations, a three-dimensional model was built from E. coli AP (ECAP) structure (18Zurutuza L. Muller F. Gibrat J.F. Taillandier A. Simon-Bouy B. Serre J.L. Mornet E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, ECAP and human TNAP are only 25% identical, and the resulting model allows the assignment of mutated residues mainly around the active site and at the homodimer interface. The model omits a large number of regions of deletions and insertions in TNAP relative to ECAP, in particular concerning the putative functional regions of TNAP. Such insertions are also present in human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) which is 57% identical to TNAP in sequence and whose crystal structure has been recently solved to 1.8-Å resolution (26Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Ménez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). PLAP contains fewer insertions and deletions and provides a better framework from which to interpret TNAP mutations. Compared with ECAP, PLAP has extra domains that have been acquired during evolution, probably to mediate functional specialization of the enzyme. Among these domains, we point out the metal-binding domain with its bound calcium. The homology between PLAP and TNAP at this location suggests that such a site is also present in TNAP. The presence of calcium at this site was suggested on the basis of the metal coordination but remained to verify (26Le Du M.H. Stigbrand T. Taussig M.J. Ménez A. Stura E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9158-9165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Here we report the analysis of the metal composition of a dehydrated solution of PLAP by x-ray fluorescence using a synchrotron source. This study confirms the presence of calcium in PLAP and, by homology of the sequence, also in TNAP. We have built a three-dimensional model of TNAP on the basis of the PLAP structure, and we analyze the effect of the mutations that occur in TNAP and are associated with hypophosphatasia. Such a model allows us to map the distribution of the amino acid substitutions within the molecule. The correlation between the degree of severity of the mutations and their location within the specific domains of TNAP suggests a probable role for the enzyme in bone mineralization. In particular, an additional mutagenesis study at the calcium binding site suggests that this atom plays a fundamental role in TNAP function. The alkaline phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.1) (APs)1 form a large family of dimeric enzymes common to all organisms. They catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters (1Schwartz J.H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1961; 47: 1996-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) with release of inorganic phosphate. Mammalian APs have low sequence identity with the Escherichia colienzyme (25–30%), although the residues involved in the active site of the enzyme and the ligands coordinating the two zinc atoms and the magnesium ion are largely conserved. Therefore, the catalytic mechanism deduced from the structure of the E. coli AP is believed to be similar in eukaryotic APs (2Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves the activation of the catalytic serine by a zinc atom, the formation of a covalent phosphoseryl intermediate, the hydrolysis of the phosphoseryl by a water molecule activated by a second zinc atom, and the release of the phosphate product or its transfer to a phosphate acceptor (3Coleman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 441-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In humans, three out of four AP isozymes are tissue-specific: one is placental (PLAP), the second appears in germ cells (GCAP), and the third in the intestine (IAP). They are 90–98% homologous, and their genes are clustered on chromosome 2q37.1. The fourth, TNAP, 50% identical to the other three, is nonspecific and can be found in bone, liver, and kidney (4Millán J.L. Anticancer Res. 1988; 8: 995-1004PubMed Google Scholar, 5Millán J.L.

Its gene is located on chromosome 1p34–36 (7Greenberg C.R. Evans J.A. McKendry-Smith S. Redekopp S. Haworth J.C. Mulivor R. Chordiket B.N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 286-292PubMed Google Scholar), and mutations in the TNAP gene have been associated with hypophosphatasia, a rare inherited disorder, characterized by defective bone mineralization. The disease is highly variable in its clinical expression, due to the strong allelic heterogeneity in the TNAP gene. Such expression ranges from stillbirth without mineralized bone to pathological fractures developing only late in adulthood (8Whyte M.P. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 439-461PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on the age of onset, five clinical forms are currently recognized: perinatal, infantile, childhood, adult, and odontohypophosphatasia. To date, 89 different mutations associated with this disease have been characterized (9Weiss M.J. Cole D.E.C. Ray K. Whyte M.P. Lafferty M.A. Mulivor R.A. Harris H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2130231662,"Two manipulations of a visual search task were used to test the hypothesis that the discrimination of a target from distractors by visually responsive neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) marks the outcome and conclusion of visual processing instead of saccade preparation. First, search efficiency was reduced by increasing the similarity of the distractors to the target. Second, response interference was introduced by infrequently changing the location of the target in the array. Both manipulations increased reaction time, but only the change in search efficiency affected the time needed to select the target by visually responsive neurons. This result indicates that visually responsive neurons in FEF form an explicit representation of the location of the target in the image."
https://openalex.org/W2017293256,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Here we show a novel function of BMP-2 in human osteoblasts and identify a signaling pathway involved in this function. BMP-2 promotes apoptosis in primary human calvaria osteoblasts and in immortalized human neonatal calvaria osteoblasts, as shown by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling analysis. In contrast, TGF-β2 inhibits apoptosis in human osteoblasts. Studies of the mechanisms of action showed that BMP-2 increases the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, whereas TGβ-2 has a negative effect. Moreover, BMP-2 increases the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol. Consistent with these results, BMP-2 increases caspase-9 and caspase-3, -6, and -7 activity, and an anti-caspase-9 agent suppresses BMP-2-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of dominant-negative Smad1 effectively blocks BMP-2-induced expression of the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2 but not the activation of caspases or apoptosis induced by BMP-2, indicating that the Smad1 signaling pathway is not involved in the BMP-2-induced apoptosis. The proapoptotic effect of BMP-2 is PKC-dependent, because BMP-2 increases PKC activity, and the selective PKC inhibitor calphostin C blocks the BMP-2-induced increased Bax/Bcl-2, caspase activity, and apoptosis. In contrast, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A inhibitor H89, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the MEK inhibitor PD-98059 have no effect. The results show that BMP-2 uses a Smad-independent, PKC-dependent pathway to promote apoptosis via a Bax/Bcl-2 and cytochromec-caspase-9-caspase-3, -6, -7 cascade in human osteoblasts.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)1 are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family that play essential roles in osteogenesis (17Urist M.R.

Members of the Msx family or the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 have been implicated in the proapoptotic activity of BMPs (26Marazzi G. Wang Y. Sassoon D. Dev.

However, the signaling pathways by which BMPs induce the death program remain largely unknown (34Merino R. Ganan Y. Macias D. Rodriguez-Leon J. Hurle J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, no evidence exists to suggest that BMPs have an induction role of apoptosis in osteoblasts. BMPs signal through type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors that phosphorylate the downstream target proteins Smads. Activation of type I BMP receptor phosphorylates Smad1, Smad5, and presumably Smad8 and associates with Smad4 in a heteromeric complex that is translocated to the nucleus, where it activates transcription (35Heldin C.H Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3358) Google Scholar). TGF-β binding to receptors leads to phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3, which associate with Smad4, and the complex can translocate to the nucleus to regulate transcriptional activity (36Derynck R.

However, other signaling pathways, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), protein kinase C, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (41Lee Y.S. Chuong C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42Palcy S. Goltzman D. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43Lou J. Tu Y. Li S. Manske P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) may also be involved in the BMP-induced effects on bone cells. Another cascade is activated by TGF-β and BMP-4 and involves TGF-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase family, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (44Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 45Yamaguchi K. Nagai S.

The TAK1-p38 kinase pathway was recently found to be involved in BMP-2-induced apoptosis (44Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 46Kimura N. Matsuo R. Shibuya H. Nakashima K. Taga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17647-17652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, the molecular events underlying the effect of BMP-2 on apoptotic pathways in bone cells are not known. We have recently shown that BMP-2 has the capacity to induce osteoblast differentiation marker genes in primary human calvaria osteoblasts as well as in immortalized human neonatal calvaria (IHNC) osteoblastic cells (25Hay E. Hott M. Graulet A.M. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 47Hay E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have determined the effect of BMP-2 on apoptosis and investigated the signaling pathway that mediates the control of apoptosis by BMP-2 in human osteoblasts. We show here that BMP-2 promotes the cell death signaling pathway, whereas TGF-β2 inhibits apoptosis in human osteoblasts. Further experiments utilizing a dominant negative (DN) Smad1 vector showed that the apoptotic signal induced by BMP-2 in IHNC cells is independent of the Smad1 pathway. We also provide evidence that the BMP-2-induced apoptosis in human osteoblasts is mediated by activation of PKC, leading to activation of caspase-9, effector caspases, and DNA fragmentation. Establisment and characterization of primary human calvaria cells and IHNC cells have been previously described in detail (25Hay E. Hott M. Graulet A.M. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 47Hay E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Both primary human calvaria cells and IHNC cells express similar osteoblast phenotypic characteristics (alkaline phosphatase, type 1 collagen, the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2, and osteocalcin) (25Hay E. Hott M. Graulet A.M. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 47Hay E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Primary human calvaria cells and IHNC cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine (292 mg/liter), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin). Previous studies showed that recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) (kindly provided by Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) induces a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on alkaline phosphatase activity, an early osteoblast marker, with a maximal stimulatory effect at 50 ng/ml in these cells (25Hay E. Hott M. Graulet A.M. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 47Hay E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies were therefore performed at this optimal dose. To analyze the effect of serum withdrawal on cell proliferation and survival, IHNC cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 10% FCS or in serum-free conditions and then treated with rhBMP-2 or rhTGF-β2 for 24 h before detection of apoptosis. The cells cannot be cultured longer than 72 h in serum-deprived conditions, because they detach from the substrate. Truncated Rmad-1, the mouse homologue of human Smad1, was achieved by substitution of an AGC codon by the stop codon TAA at position 1623. This missmatch mutation causes a deletion of 118 base pairs in the NH2 domain, which is responsible for the nuclear assignment of the molecule. Truncated DNA was cloned in Neo pcDNA3.1 (+) (InVitrogen). The vector alone was used as control. Stable transfection cannot not be conducted in IHNC cells, because these cells do not escape senescence crisis. We thus performed transient transfections allowing effective expression of DN Smad1 for 72 h, which was sufficient to determine the changes in apoptosis induced by BMP-2 occurring at 24–48 h of treatment. Cells were plated at 5000 cells/cm2 the day before transfection. IHNC cells were cotransfected with the plasmid (15 µg/100-mm dish) and pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega) at a 10:1 ratio, by calcium phosphate precipitation according to standard procedures described by the manufacturer (Profection mammalian transfection systems; Promega). After 16 h, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium (1% bovine serum albumin, serum-free) overnight. Efficiency of transfection was controlled by determination of β-galactosidase activity in transfected cells and by the expression of Smad1 in transfected cells by Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses. The number of β-galactosidase-positive cells and the number of cells showing absence of a nuclear Smad1 immunostaining were counted 72 h post-transfection. Apoptosis and the activity of caspases in transfected cells were determined as described below. To detect apoptotic nuclei, DNA cleavage was assessed by the TUNEL assay as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primary human calvaria cells or IHNC cells (5000/cm2) cultured on Labtek chambers in serum-deprived conditions (1% BSA, serum-free) or in the presence of 10% FCS for 24 h were treated with rhBMP-2 or rhTGF-β2 for 24 h and then fixed with paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H2O2, and the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, at 4 °C for 2 min and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the TUNEL reaction mixture containing the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Incorporated fluorescein was detected by sheep anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The TUNEL signal was detected with peroxidase-labeled antidigoxigenin antibody, revealed with diaminobenzidine, and mounted. TUNEL-positive cells were detected by brown nuclei and nuclear fragmentation. Positive controls consisted of cells treated for 24 h with 50 µm etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor that induces DNA damage and nuclear fragmentation associated with apoptosis (48Ritke M.K. Rusnak J.M. Lazo J.S. Allan W.P. Dive C. Heer S. Yalowich J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 605-611PubMed Google Scholar). Additional positive controls consisted of cells treated with DNase I for 10 min. Negative controls were obtained by omitting the transferase from the reaction. In each experiment, the number of total and TUNEL-positive cells was counted. To further determine cell viability in vitro, trypan blue staining was used for determination of dead cells by dye exclusion. After the addition of trypan blue (0.4%), the percentage of primary human calvaria cells or IHNC cells exhibiting both nuclear and cytoplasmic trypan blue staining (dead cells) was determined. A total of 1500 cells were counted for each cell type, and the results were expressed as a percentage of total cells. IHNC cells (10,000/cm2) cultured in the presence or absence of rhBMP-2 were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and scrapped in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 1 mmNa3VO4) containing 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein samples were solubilized in 4× Laemmli SDS loading buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Fifty micrograms of proteins, determined using the DC Protein assay (Bio-Rad), were resolved on 12% acrylamide gel and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride-Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were saturated overnight with 1% blocking solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-Cbfa1/Osf2 (49Xiao G. Wang D. Benson M.D. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), polyclonal anti-human Bax (0.5 µg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (0.5 µg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-Smad1 (0.5 µg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or polyclonal anti-β-actin (1.5 µg/ml; Sigma) in 0.5% blocking buffer. After 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were washed twice with TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.5% blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Following incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies, the membranes were washed, and the signals were visualized with BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The specific bands on the autoradiograms were quantitated by densitometry. IHNC cells were treated with rhBMP-2 for 24 h, and mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation in buffer containing sucrose as described (50Yang J. Liu X. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1081-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar). Protein samples (400 µg) were loaded on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels, subjected to electrophoresis, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were probed with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody or a monoclonal mouse antibody recognizing Cox-4, a component of the mitochondrial membrane (CLONTECH) and then probed with appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and developed with BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To identify the caspases involved in rhBMP-2-induced apoptosis, IHNC cells (10,000/cm2) were cultured in 1% bovine serum albumin/serum-free medium in the presence or absence of rhBMP-2 (50 ng/ml). After 24 h, the cells were lysed in 400 µl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) for 30 min on ice and stored at −20 °C. The activity of effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7) and initiator caspases (caspase-8 and -9) was determined by the cleavage of synthetic fluorogenic substrates containing the amino acid sequence recognized by specific caspases. The substrates were as follows: DEVD (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp) for caspase-3-like; IETD (Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp) for caspase-8; LEHD (Leu-Glu-His-Asp) for caspase-9, combined with a fluorophore (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin). Upon cleavage of the substrate by caspases, free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin fluorescence emission was detected using a spectrofluorimeter. For the assay, aliquots of 100 µl were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 µl of reaction buffer (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4) containing 5 µl of specific substrate (20 µm final concentration). The fluorescence released in samples was measured by excitation at 367 nm, and analysis was made at 440 nm. The negative control was buffer mix, and the positive control was free 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (10 µm in phosphate-buffered saline). Results were expressed as arbitrary units and corrected for protein content. To further determine the role of caspases in the BMP-2-induced apoptosis, cells were treated with rhBMP-2 (50 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence of specific caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, or -9 inhibitors (10 µg/ml), and the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells was determined as described above. For direct analysis of PKC activation, IHNC cells (10,000/cm2) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0% FCS plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 24 h and then treated with rhBMP-2 (50 ng/ml) or the vehicle for 10–60 min. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). PKC activity was determined by measuring the transfer of32P-labeled phosphate to a biotinylated peptide substrate (AAKIQASFRGHMARKK) that is specific for PKC activity (51Chen S.J. Klann E. Gower M.C. Powell C.M. Sessoms J.S. Sweatt J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the Signa TECTTM PKC Assay System (Promega). To determine the signal transduction pathways involved in rhBMP-2-induced apoptosis, we used selective inhibitors of signaling pathways. We used calphostin C (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth, PA), a potent and selective inhibitor of PKC (52Tamaoki T. Nakano H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); 2′-amino-3-methoxyflavone (PD-98059; Biomol), a specific inhibitor of MEK activation (53Alessi D.R. Cuenda P. Cohen D.T. Dudley D.T. Satiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar); and 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazol (SB 203580; Calbiochem), a highly specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (54Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsh-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J. Jakubowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27723-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). IHNC cells were pretreated for 2 h with the indicated signaling inhibitor or the vehicle and then treated with rhBMP-2 (50 ng/ml) or the vehicle in the presence of the inhibitor or the vehicle for 24 h. Apoptotic cells were then detected by TUNEL analysis as described above. We previously showed that rhBMP-2 promotes osteoblast marker genes and differentiation in primary human calvaria osteoblasts as well as in the corresponding IHNC cell line (25Hay E. Hott M. Graulet A.M. Lomri A. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 47Hay E. Lemonnier J. Modrowski D. Lomri A. Lasmoles F. Marie P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether BMP-2 induces apoptosis in osteoblasts, we tested the effect of BMP-2 on DNA fragmentation revealed by TUNEL analysis in normal primary human calvaria osteoblasts as well as in IHNC cells. As shown in Fig.1, A and C, treatment with rhBMP-2 (50 ng/ml) for 24 h increased by 2-fold the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in primary human calvaria osteoblasts. TUNEL positivity in these cells reflected true apoptosis because all cells treated with etoposide were TUNEL-positively stained, confirming the validity of the TUNEL assay for detection of true apoptosis (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to the effect of rhBMP-2, treatment with rhTGF-β2 (10 ng/ml) decreased by 2-fold the number of TUNEL-positive primary human calvaria osteoblasts (Fig. 1, Aand C). In the IHNC cell line, the basal number of apoptotic cells was higher than in primary human calvaria cells, as expected from this immortalized cell line (Fig. 1, B and C). In these cells, BMP-2 also had a proapoptotic effect. rhBMP-2 increased the number of TUNEL-positive IHNC cells, and rhTGF-β2 reduced the number of apoptotic cells, confirming the effect of these factors documented in primary human calvaria osteoblasts (Fig. 1, Band C). To know if BMP-2-induced apoptosis was associated with decreased cell viability, we examined the effect of rhBMP-2 using trypan blue staining. We found that rhBMP-2 (50 ng/ml, 24 h) increased by 42% the number of unviable trypan blue-stained IHNC cells (controls: 15 ± 0.6% (S.E.) versus +rhBMP-2: 21.3 ± 1.6%, p < 0.05). In contrast, rhTGF-β2 (10 ng/ml, 24 h) decreased the number of trypan blue-stained IHNC cells (+rhTGF-β2: 12.5 ± 0.8% versus controls: 15 ± 0.6%, p < 0.05). Additional experiments using ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining indicated that BMP-2 induced apoptosis but not necrosis (not shown). To determine the influence of serum withdrawal on the effect of BMP-2 on cell survival, IHNC cells were grown in the presence or absence of serum fo"
https://openalex.org/W2043208930,"The linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is essential for signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR). Following TCR stimulation, LAT becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, creating docking sites for other signaling proteins such as phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), Grb2, and Gads. In this study, we have attempted to identify the critical tyrosine residues in LAT that mediate TCR activation-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and activation of the MAP kinase Erk2. By using the LAT-deficient Jurkat derivative, J.CaM2, stable cell lines were established expressing various tyrosine mutants of LAT. We show that three specific tyrosine residues (Tyr132, Tyr171, and Tyr191) are necessary and sufficient to achieve a Ca2+ flux following TCR stimulation. These tyrosine residues function by reconstituting PLC-γ1phosphorylation and recruitment to LAT. However, these same tyrosines can only partially reconstitute Erk activation. Full reconstitution of Erk requires two additional tyrosine residues (Tyr110 and Tyr226), both of which have the Grb2-binding motif YXN. This reconstitution of Erk activation requires that the critical tyrosine residues be on the same molecule of LAT, suggesting that a single LAT molecule nucleates multiple protein-protein interactions required for optimal signal transduction.

Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The initial steps of this process are carried out by the Src and Syk families of tyrosine kinases (3Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Targets of the Syk family of tyrosine kinases include an emerging class of proteins known as adaptors. Although these proteins lack intrinsic enzymatic activity, they function to promote intermolecular interactions utilizing multiple protein-protein interaction domains or motifs (4Tomlinson M.G. Lin J. Weiss A. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 584-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Examples of interaction domains include Src homology (SH) 2 domains, which bind phosphotyrosine residues, and SH3 domains, which bind proline-rich regions. One adaptor protein essential for T cell activation is the transmembrane adaptor protein, linker for activation of T cells (LAT) (5Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 6Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C.

Following TCR engagement, LAT becomes phosphorylated on multiple tyrosine residues thereby allowing other proteins important for T cell activation to be recruited by SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. Multiple proteins have been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments to be recruited to LAT, either directly or indirectly, such as phospholipase C-γ1(PLC-γ1), Grb2, Sos, Gads, SLP-76, Vav, Cbl, Itk, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (5Zhang W.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition to the many tyrosine residues, LAT also contains two cysteine residues proximal to the transmembrane domain. These two cysteine residues are palmitoylated resulting in localization of LAT into glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) within the plasma membrane (12Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Without correct localization into GEMs, LAT cannot mediate downstream signaling events induced by TCR stimulation (13Zhang W. Irvin B.J. Trible R.P. Abraham R.T. Samelson L.E. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 14Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Since LAT recruits so many proteins to one location, it appears likely that LAT, with the help of other adaptor proteins, functions as a platform where many signal transduction proteins colocalize to propagate and integrate the signals initiated by TCR stimulation. The essential role of LAT in T cell development has been demonstrated using targeted gene disruption in mice. LAT-deficient mice have a block in thymocyte development at the immature CD25+CD44−, CD4− CD8− stage and a complete lack of mature peripheral T cells (6Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M. Long E.O. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Blocks at this early stage of thymocyte development are similar to those observed in other mice lacking proteins, such as the Src kinases Lck and Fyn and the Syk kinases ZAP-70 and Syk, that mediate pre-TCR signaling events (15van Oers N.S. Semin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The LAT-deficient Jurkat derivative, J.CaM2, has provided considerable insight into the mechanism by which LAT mediates TCR-signaling events. This cell line is deficient in many pathways activated by TCR stimulation such as Ca2+ mobilization and Ras/MAP kinase activation (7Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Goldsmith M.A. Dazin P.F. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8613-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These defects are, in part, due to an inability to recruit PLC-γ1 to the membrane where it is phosphorylated and becomes activated. PLC-γ1 activation is essential for the generation of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. IP3 binds receptors that regulate the release of stored Ca2+, whereas DAG is required to activate proteins such as protein kinase C and Ras guanyl nucleotide releasing protein (RasGRP) (17Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 18Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M.

Immunol. 2000; 1: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The absence of LAT may also result in the loss of Ras activation through the inability to recruit the Ras exchange factor Sos to the membrane via the adaptor Grb2. Analysis of the various coimmunoprecipitation studies involving LAT has led to a model where a complex of adaptors involving LAT, Grb2, Gads, and SLP-76 are localized to GEMs within the plasma membrane in order to recruit other signaling proteins (5Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 8Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Grb2 is an adaptor protein with a central SH2 domain flanked on both sides with SH3 domains, which bind Sos. Human LAT contains four tyrosine residues that fit the Grb2-SH2 binding motif of YXN that are conserved between human, mouse, and rat (Tyr110, Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226). Three of these tyrosines (Tyr171, Tyr191, and Tyr226) when mutated have been shown to disrupt Grb2 recruitment to LAT. A Grb2-like molecule, known as Gads, also binds directly to LAT at only two of these sites (Tyr171 and Tyr191). Like Grb2, Gads contains two SH3 domains flanking a single SH2 domain. However, Gads also contains a proline-rich region between the SH2 domain and the C-terminal SH3 domain. Studies by Liu et al. (8Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Gads is responsible for mediating the recruitment of SLP-76 to LAT. The SLP-76 adaptor protein contains proline-rich regions, a C-terminal SH2 domain, and three N-terminal phosphotyrosine residues. All have been demonstrated to recruit other signaling proteins. The C-terminal SH3 domain of Gads binds to proline-rich sequences within SLP-76 for its recruitment to LAT (8Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). SLAP-130/Fyb and HPK1 both contain phosphotyrosine residues that can bind the SH2 domain of SLP-76 (21Musci M.A. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Motto D.G. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C.W. Koretzky G.A. J.

Perlmutter, submitted for publication. Proteins such as Itk, Rlk, and Vav are thought to bind directly to phosphotyrosine residues at the N terminus of SLP-76, explaining why they are detected in LAT immunoprecipitations (22Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 23Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A.

Immunol. 1999; 29: 3702-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruption of SLP-76 have a phenotype very similar to that of LAT-deficient mice, a profound block in thymic development with the absence of peripheral T cells (25Pivniouk V. Tsitsikov E. Swinton P. Rathbun G. Alt F.W. Geha R.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 229-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 26Clements J.L. Yang B. Ross-Barta S.E. Eliason S.L. Hrstka R.F. Williamson R.A. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1998; 281: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, the recently described Gads-deficient mice also have a similar, although less severe, phenotype (27Yoder J. Pham C. Iizuka Y. Kanagawa O. Liu S.K. McGlade J. Cheng A.M. Science. 2001; 291: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to a partial compensation by Grb2 in the absence of Gads. A Jurkat mutant cell line lacking SLP-76 displays a phenotype similar to J.CaM2 cells, yet somewhat less drastic. These cells, named J14, have decreases in Ca2+ flux and Ras activation in response to TCR stimulation (28Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that SLP-76 plays a critical role in LAT-dependent signal transduction. Indeed, overexpression of a LAT-SLP-76 chimera was recently shown to substitute for LAT function (29Boerth N.J. Sadler J.J. Bauer D.E. Clements J.L. Gheith S.M. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The multiple protein interactions that have been demonstrated with LAT led us to examine further the role of different tyrosine residues and the activities that they mediate. Human LAT has 10 total tyrosines, and 9 are conserved between human, mouse, and rat. Previous studies have shown the importance of some of these residues for recruitment of PLC-γ1, Grb2, and Gads (8Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 20Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In this study, we expand on the analysis of these and other tyrosine residues by identifying the minimal tyrosine residues required for LAT function. By utilizing the LAT-deficient J.CaM2 cell line, multiple stable lines expressing various tyrosine mutants of LAT were generated, and their abilities to mediate activation of downstream pathways were studied. Ca2+ mobilization is dependent on three of the tyrosines (Tyr132, Tyr171, and Tyr191), whereas full Ras pathway activation requires two additional tyrosine residues (Tyr110 and Tyr226). These two additional tyrosines contribute to the recruitment of Grb2 to the LAT complex. In addition, the critical tyrosine residues must also be on the same molecule of LAT for reconstitution of TCR-mediated signaling events. Therefore, these data provide evidence for the important function of an assembly of proteins on a single LAT molecule. Moreover, these studies show that the tyrosine residues have different roles in mediating events downstream of LAT. The LAT-deficient Jurkat mutant J.CaM2 (7Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 16Goldsmith M.A. Dazin P.F. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8613-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and subsequent stable lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. For stable and transient transfections, 2 × 107 J.CaM2 cells were resuspended in 400 µl of RPMI 1640 and electroporated at 250 V, 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). For generation of stable lines, transfected cells were plated 48 h after electroporation in media containing 2 µg/ml G418. For transient assays, cells were utilized 24 h after transfection. Myc-tagged Erk2 was expressed using the pEF-BOS expression plasmid. Myc-tagged LAT was expressed using the pCDEF3 expression plasmid, which also encodes a neomycin resistance gene for production of stable lines. Point mutants of LAT were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Clones presented in this report are as follows: wt LAT (clone 70), Y-F6 (clone 107), Y-F7,8 (clone 73), Y-F6–8 (clone 55), F-Y6 (clone 35), F-Y7,8 (clone 15), F-Y6–8 (clone 40.8). TCR stimulation was performed with the anti-Jurkat TCR β-chain monoclonal antibody (mAb) C305 (30Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-LAT, anti-PLC-γ1 mixed mAb, and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 mAb were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), whereas the polyclonal anti-Grb2 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-phospho-Erk was from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and the anti-Myc mAb was derived from the 9E10 hybridoma. To analyze intracellular Ca2+mobilization, 3 × 106 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and labeled in 3 µm of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye Indo-1AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed 3 times in Ca2+ buffer (0.1% glucose w/v, 25 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, w/v, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4), and the cell pellet was kept on ice. Prior to the assay, cells were resuspended in Ca2+ buffer and warmed to 37 °C. 106 cells were stimulated with C305 followed by ionomycin (1 µm). The fluorescence emission at 400- and 500-nm wavelengths was measured with an excitation at 355 nm using a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was calculated based on the ratio of the fluorescence at 400 and 500 nm. Cells, 2.5 × 107cells/ml, were first rested at 37 °C for 20 min and then stimulated with 1:250 dilution of purified anti-TCR (1 mg/ml stock solution, C305) in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed at 108 cells/ml in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6). For coimmunoprecipitation assays, 1% Brij in 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, was used instead. Both lysis buffers contained 2 mm EDTA and a combination of protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (31Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 45 min, followed by protein G-Sepharose beads for 45 min, and were then washed 3 times with lysis buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Membranes were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies followed by the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reactive proteins were visualized by Renaissance, a chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For quantitation of bands, chemiluminescence was assessed on a Kodak Imaging Station using Kodak one-dimensional image analysis software version 3.5 (Rochester, NY). J.CaM2 cells were transfected as before with 20 µg of a 3× NF-AT-luciferase reporter construct and 1 µg of the indicated LAT construct in pCDEF3. The TCR was stimulated with immobilized C305 for 8 h. Cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity (32Shapiro V.S. Mollenauer M.N. Greene W.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1663-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Lysates were also blotted for LAT expression. The LAT-deficient Jurkat-derived cell line J.CaM2 was used to produce cell lines stably expressing various tyrosine mutants of LAT. To aid in the description of the various tyrosine mutants of LAT, each of the 10 tyrosines was given a number. Fig.1 A depicts the location of the tyrosine residues in human LAT by amino acid numbers. The fourth tyrosine in human LAT was designated site 3.5 since it is not conserved between species. Throughout this paper, Y-F denotes mutant forms of LAT where tyrosine residues were changed to phenylalanine, whereas F-Y denotes mutants in which all tyrosines were initially changed to phenylalanine and then the specified residue mutated back to tyrosine. For example, F-Y6 describes a mutant of LAT that has only one tyrosine at position 132. Previous studies have identified multiple tyrosines within LAT that are phosphorylated and function as SH2-binding sites. Site 6 (YLVV) was shown to be important in the recruitment of PLC-γ1 to LAT (20Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), whereas site 7 and site 8 are identical motifs (YVNV) to which either of the adaptor proteins Gads or Grb2 can bind and thereby recruit SLP-76 or Sos, respectively (5Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 8Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Also conserved between human, mouse, and rat are two more YXN motifs found at site 4 and site 9 that could play roles in Grb2 recruitment. All of the tyrosine mutants of LAT we prepared contain a C-terminal Myc tag and were expressed using a vector containing the hEF-1a promoter. The cDNA constructs were electroporated into J.CaM2 cells, and clones with stable integration were selected for in G418-containing media. For each mutant, multiple clones were tested for LAT expression levels by Western blotting. Representative clones are presented here. Fig. 1 B shows that the clones presented in these studies had equivalent LAT expression. The levels of LAT in the transfectants were slightly higher than that of endogenous LAT in Jurkat. Uniform expression of the TCR was documented by staining for CD3 followed by analysis using flow cytometry (data not shown). Previous studies have demonstrated that the inability of J.CaM2 cells to flux Ca2+ is due to its deficiency in LAT expression (7Finco T.S. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To determine which tyrosine residues are required for a Ca2+ flux, cell lines expressing the tyrosine mutants of LAT were stimulated via the TCR, and the subsequent Ca2+flux was measured on a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The Y-F6 cell line had a markedly decreased Ca2+ flux, whereas Y-F7,8 had a normal response when compared with wt LAT (Fig.2 A). However, Y-F6–8 had a complete loss in its ability to flux Ca2+ in response to TCR stimulation. These results implicate sites 6–8 in mediating the Ca2+ response. To extend further this analysis, cells expressing forms of LAT containing only certain tyrosine residues on an all phenylalanine background were tested in the same manner. The F-Y6 version of LAT did not reconstitute Ca2+ signaling, and the F-Y7,8 version of LAT only restored a slight, almost undetectable flux. However, the F-Y6–8 form of LAT reconstituted the Ca2+flux following TCR stimulation to the same extent as wt LAT (Fig.2 A). For these experiments, multiple clones of all mutants gave similar results. These data demonstrate that sites 6–8 are necessary and sufficient for Ca2+ mobilization in the LAT-deficient J.CaM2 cell line. A potential explanation could come from previous studies that have shown that site 6 binds to PLC-γ1 and sites 7 and 8 bind Gads (5Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar, 8Liu S.K. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 20Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), thereby indirectly recruiting SLP-76 to LAT. This suggests that a LAT·PLC-γ1·Gads·SLP-76 complex may be necessary and sufficient for Ca2+mobilization. Since defective Ca2+ mobilization was observed with Y-F6, F-Y6, and F-Y7,8, we decided to investigate PLC-γ1 phosphorylation in these cell lines, given that PLC-γ1 is responsible for generating the IP3required for Ca2+ mobilization. Cells were stimulated with anti-TCR, PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitations were isolated from cellular lysates, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody indicated that PLC-γ1 was phosphorylated in J.CaM2 cells reconstituted with wt LAT, Y-F6, Y-F7,8, F-Y7,8, and F-Y6–8 (Fig.3 A, middle panel). Thus, the phosphorylation state of PLC-γ1 does not exactly correlate with the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. In support of this observation, phosphorylation-independent mechanisms of PLC-γ1 activation have been noted previously in the literature (33Sekiya F. Bae Y.S. Rhee S.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, our analysis fails to distinguish among the various reported sites of PLC-γ1 tyrosine phosphorylation (34Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). When the association of PLC-γ1 with phospho-LAT was examined, a direct correlation was observed between association and Ca2+ flux in response to TCR stimulation (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Due to the poor ability of the LAT antibody to recognize phosphorylated LAT, we were not able to show inducible association of LAT with PLC-γ1. However, a phosphorylated band that comigrates with LAT can be detected by phosphotyrosine blotting. Samples were also blotted with an anti-PLC-γ1antibody to show equal protein levels in the immunoprecipitations (Fig.3 A, upper panel). To ensure that the lack of a phospho-LAT band in the PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates is not due to an inability of these mutants of LAT to become phosphorylated, an additional study was done. Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were performed on the LAT mutant lines in which an interaction of PLC-γ1with phospho-LAT could not be detected but still exhibited PLC-γ1 phosphorylation upon stimulation. Immunoprecipitates from unstimulated or TCR-stimulated cells reconstituted with wt LAT, Y-F6, and F-Y7,8 were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Fig.3 B shows that the phosphorylation state of the Y-F6 mutant is very similar to that of wt LAT and that the F-Y7,8 mutant is still phosphorylated, although at a reduced level. These data suggest that phosphorylation of PLC-γ1 alone is not sufficient to elicit a Ca2+ flux. Mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ following TCR stimulation also requires PLC-γ1 recruitment to LAT. Since the F-Y6–8 form of LAT was sufficient to reconstitute the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+following stimulation through the TCR, we were interested to determine if any or all of these three sites could reconstitute other signaling pathways in J.CaM2. Previous studies performed with J.CaM2 have demonstrated a deficiency in the activation of the Ras pathway. One downstream indicator of this pathway is activation of the Erk MAP kinase. To investigate which of the tyrosines in LAT are sufficient for the activation of Erk, J.CaM2 cells were cotransfected with a Myc-tagged Erk2 construct and various LAT constructs that had sites 6–8 and 6–8 restored to tyrosines from an all-phenylalanine background. As controls, wt LAT and LAT with no tyrosines (“all-F”) were used. Cells were then stimulated through the TCR followed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc antibody to isolate the transfected proteins. An indicator of Erk kinase activity is phosphorylation on Thr202 and Tyr204, which can be followed with phospho-specific Erk Western blots. When J.CaM2 cells were transfected with Erk and a vector control or the all-F LAT, Erk did not become activated following TCR stimulation (Fig.4 A). If the cells were cotransfected with a wt LAT construct, Erk was phosphorylated following TCR stimulation. Neither the F-Y6 mutant nor the F-Y7,8 mutant form of LAT could reconstitute Erk phosphorylation in J.CaM2 cells. However, an F-Y6–8 form of LAT could partially reconstitute the defective signaling pathway, demonstrating the importance of all three of these sites (Fig. 4 A). For reasons unknown, mutants of LAT that have most or all of the tyrosine residues changed to phenylalanine reproducibly have a slightly faster mobility. One possible explanation is that the loss of hydroxyl groups on the tyrosine residues creates a protein that is now more hydrophobic resulting in a change in mobility. A time course of Erk activation was then performed to determine if the partial response at 3 min is due to a shift in kinetics or a decrease in th"

A computer simulation of an AL network was used to test the hypothesis that slow inhibitory connections between local neurons (LNs) and PNs are responsible for temporal patterning. Activation of slow inhibitory receptors on PNs by the same GABAergic synapses that underlie fast oscillatory synchronization of PNs was sufficient to shape slow response modulations. This slow stimulus- and neuron-specific patterning of AL activity was resistant to blockade of fast inhibition. Fast and slow inhibitory mechanisms at synapses between LNs and PNs can thus form dynamical PN assemblies whose elements synchronize transiently and oscillate collectively, as observed not only in the locust AL, but also in the vertebrate olfactory bulb."

Zyxin is a LIM protein found prominently at sites of cell adhesion, faintly in leading lamellipodia, and transiently in cell nuclei. Here we have performed a domain analysis to identify regions in zyxin that are responsible for targeting it to different subcellular locations. The N-terminal proline-rich region of zyxin, which harbors binding sites for α-actinin and members of the Ena/VASP family, concentrates in lamellipodial extensions and weakly in focal adhesions. The LIM region of zyxin displays robust targeting to focal adhesions. When overexpressed in cells, the LIM region of zyxin causes displacement of endogenous zyxin from focal adhesions. Upon mislocalization of full-length zyxin, at least one member of the Ena/VASP family is also displaced, and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton is perturbed. Zyxin also has the capacity to shuttle between the nucleus and focal adhesion sites. When nuclear export is inhibited, zyxin accumulates in cell nuclei. The nuclear accumulation of zyxin occurs asynchronously with approximately half of the cells exhibiting nuclear localization of zyxin within 2.3 h of initiating leptomycin B treatment.

Although much has been learned about a cell's capacity to recognize and respond to extracellular cues, in many cases we do not understand how engagement of a particular cell surface receptor triggers changes in cell behavior. One present challenge, for example, is to understand how engagement of integrin receptors for extracellular matrix can stimulate cell motility and changes in gene expression. In the past few years, several proteins that may contribute to these processes have been identified. For example, zyxin, a protein that is co-localized with integrins at sites of membrane-substratum adhesion, has properties that suggest it could participate in both localized actin polymerization and communication to the nuclear compartment. Zyxin is an elongate phosphoprotein composed of three C-terminal LIM domains, a proline-rich N-terminal region, and at least one nuclear export signal (NES)1 (Fig.1 A) (3Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C.

Although the molecular details remain to be elucidated, zyxin's binding partner repertoire implicates it in actin assembly and organization. Results from several lines of investigation are compatible with this possibility. For example, targeting of zyxin to the plasma membrane results in the elaboration of actin-rich cell surface projections (22Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and actin polymerization is induced in association with mitochondria when zyxin is targeted to the organelle surface. 2J. Fradelizi, V. Noireaux, B. Menichi, D. Louvard, J. Prost, C. Sykes, R. M. Golsteyn, and E. Friederich, submitted for publication. 2J. Fradelizi, V. Noireaux, B. Menichi, D. Louvard, J. Prost, C. Sykes, R. M. Golsteyn, and E. Friederich, submitted for publication. In a more global sense, zyxin appears to participate in cell movements that are known to depend on actin. Antibody-mediated inhibition of zyxin function results in disturbances in cell spreading, cell locomotion, and filopodial maintenance. 3B. A. Benson, F. Wang, D. G. Jay, and M. C. Beckerle, submitted for publication. 3B. A. Benson, F. Wang, D. G. Jay, and M. C. Beckerle, submitted for publication. Similarly, a peptide inhibitor of zyxin function, which causes it to be mislocalized in cells, also disturbs cell spreading and migration (12Drees B.E. Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to its cytoskeletal role, zyxin has also been postulated to participate in intracellular communication between the plasma membrane and the nucleus (4Nix D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Avian zyxin displays a leucine-rich nuclear export signal and can shuttle between the nucleus and sites of cell-substratum adhesion (4Nix D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Two other zyxin family members, the lipoma-preferred partner, which is present in a mutant form in many lipomas (25Petit M.M.R. Mols R. Schoenmakers E.F. Mandahl N. Van de Ven W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 26Ashar H.R. Fejzo M.S. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Chada K. Cell. 1995; 82: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), and the thyroid receptor-interacting protein, Trip-6, are also constituents of focal adhesions that display nuclear export signals (27Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 28Yi J. Beckerle M.C.

Although the precise role of zyxin family members within cell nuclei is not understood, both Trip6 and lipoma-preferred partner have the capacity to activate transcription under some experimental conditions (27Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 29Zhao M.K. Wang Y. Murphy K. Yi J. Beckerle M.C. Gilmore T.D. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 207-217PubMed Google Scholar); thus, zyxin family members may directly influence gene expression. Because zyxin appears to have distinct functions in association with the actin cytoskeleton and in the cell nucleus, the appropriate localization of zyxin to discrete subcellular domains is likely to be a critical determinant of its function. To better understand how the subcellular localization of zyxin is specified, we introduced a series of zyxin truncation proteins into cells and monitored their intracellular distributions. By this approach, we have identified several regions of the zyxin protein as key determinants of its subcellular localization. Plasmids used to express avian zyxin proteins in eukaryotic cells were created by subcloning polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified chicken zyxin cDNA (5Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) into the pcDNA1/Neo eukaryotic expression vector from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with Promega's Altered Sites kit (Madison, WI) to create PCR template for the deletion mutant cZyxΔ322–331. PCR stitching was used to create the cZyxΔ24–46 insert. This entails initially amplifying two fragments of zyxin that lack sequences encoding aa 24–46 but contain regions of homology in their primers that enable annealing and extension in a second round of PCR amplification. FLAG-tagged constructs were created by cloning PCR-derived template into a modified pcDNA1/Neo construct containing sequences designed to express zyxin protein fused with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK). The FLAG epitope allowed us to visualize the localization of zyxin deletion variants that could not be detected by existing anti-zyxin antibodies. The addition of a C-terminal FLAG epitope sequence had no effect on the ability of zyxin or its deletion variants to localize properly in cells. For GFP-tagged zyxin, DNA encoding all or part of zyxin was inserted into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH Laboratories), and the DNA encoding the GFP-fusion protein was transferred into the pUHD 10-3 vector (31Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar) for improved expression. GFP-hZyx (F71A,F93A, F104A,F114A) was constructed in four steps by site directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). RCAS proviral plasmids engineered to express FLAG epitope-tagged chicken zyxin protein in chicken cells were created by cloning PCR-derived zyxin-FLAG sequences into the ClaI restriction endonuclease site of the RCAS A (BH) vector as described previously (32Petropoulos C.J. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were sequence-verified prior to use. GST-fusion protein expression constructs were created by cloning PCR-derived chicken zyxin sequences into pGEX2T-128/129 as previously described (33Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). GST-zyxin fusion proteins were produced by inducing log phase BL21(DE3) bacteria containing the pGEX2T-128/129 construct with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h, purifying the recombinant protein with glutathione-agarose beads, and concentrating the eluate with a Centricon-10 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrate was equilibrated in calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline prior to microinjection. The human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell line (ATCC CCL-2) and the African green monkey kidney Vero cell line (ATCC CCL-81) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 10% CO2. HeLa and Vero cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate DNA precipitation method. 2 μg of pUHD 10-3 vector in which expression of the cDNA is under the control of a minimal promoter were co-transfected with 2 μg of pUHD 15-1 plasmid, which encodes the tTAs transactivator. Cells were analyzed 24 h after the addition of DNA. The rat embryo fibroblast cell line, REF-52 (34McClure D. Hightower M. Topp W. Sato G. Pardee A. Sirbasku D. Growth of Cells in Hormonally Defined Media. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 345-364Google Scholar) was grown on glass coverslips to ∼80% confluency prior to microinjection using an Eppendorf Micromanipulator/Transjector apparatus (Madison, WI). Cesium chloride-purified plasmids were microinjected at a concentration of 0.2–0.25 mg/ml in calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were mixed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bovine serum albumin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and injected at a final concentration of 5–10 mg/ml in calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline for each protein. Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts were isolated and cultured as described (35Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Proviral RCAS expression vectors were introduced into chicken embryo fibroblasts by calcium phosphate transfection and cultured for 5 days to allow for complete infection prior to visualizing zyxin protein expression.

Zyxin expression is roughly 10-fold greater than that of lipoma-preferred partner in fibroblast cells (36Fradelizi J. Friederich E. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M.

Cells were photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot Microscope (New York) or captured using a PI CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ).

Wolff-Winiski, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) and fixed 0, 90, 180, or 360 min after the addition of the drug. Zyxin displays an N-terminal proline-rich region and three C-terminal LIM domains that provide binding sites for several proteins associated with actin polymerization and intracellular signaling (Fig.1 A). The binding sites for both α-actinin and Ena/VASP proteins have been precisely mapped within the proline-rich region (12Drees B.E. Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). 5D. A. Nix, J. Fradelizi, S. Bockholt, B. Menichi, D. Louvard, E. Friederich, and M. C. Beckerle, unpublished observations. We used a mutagenesis strategy to define the critical domains in zyxin necessary for targeting the protein to these subcellular compartments. We focused first on an effort to map the domain(s) of zyxin required for targeting of the protein to focal adhesions. We have compared the subcellular distributions of full-length human and chicken zyxin to the distributions of several deletion variants and site-directed mutants (Fig. 1, B and C). GFP-tagged human zyxin displays a distribution pattern that is indistinguishable from that of the endogenous protein. At steady state, no protein is detected within cell nuclei. Rather, the protein is associated with the focal adhesions, the leading edge, and periodically along the actin stress fibers (Fig. 2,A and B). Within the leading edge, zyxin is present in small punctate patches against a diffuse background of accumulated protein (Fig. 2 A, arrow). Confocal microscopy reveals that there is a bona fideconcentration of zyxin within the actin-rich zone of lamellipodial projections above the level found in cytoplasm (data not shown). As observed previously in immunocytochemical studies, GFP-zyxin co-localizes with VASP and α-actinin in focal adhesions and is often observed in a periodic distribution along stress fibers (11Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol.

This periodic localization of zyxin on stress fibers is particularly striking in cell types that have well developed bundles of actin filaments, such as the Vero cells shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the ability to detect zyxin in association with stress fibers appears enhanced when visualizing live cells that express GFP-tagged zyxin, as compared with fixed specimens prepared for indirect immunofluorescence. This may reflect some difficulty with antibody accessibility in fixed material. To identify zyxin sequences that target it to focal adhesions, we first examined the effect of perturbing zyxin's ability to bind Ena/VASP proteins or α-actinin. Zyxin interacts with Ena/VASP proteins via four proline-rich repeats with the consensus (D/E)FPPPP (Fig.1 A; Refs. 14Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B.

Previous work has demonstrated that substitution of the conserved Phe residue with Ala completely eliminates Ena/VASP binding capacity both in vitro andin vivo (14Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R.

Compromising all four of zyxin's Ena/VASP binding sites resulted in no detectable inhibition of its ability to target to focal adhesions (Fig. 2, C and D). Likewise, deletion of residues 1–50, which contain the α-actinin binding site (12Drees B.E. Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), caused no appreciable inhibition of focal adhesion targeting (Fig. 2, E and F). Furthermore, deletion of residues 1–331, which eliminates nearly all sequence information outside the LIM region, did not eliminate focal adhesion targeting (Fig. 2, G and H), although we typically observed a higher level of diffuse cytoplasmic localization than with full-length protein. In contrast, elimination of the LIM region caused a dramatic reduction in focal adhesion targeting capacity (Fig. 2, I and J). These results suggested that none of zyxin's binding partners that dock on the proline-rich N-terminal domain are absolutely required for the targeting of human zyxin to focal adhesions. Our findings contrasted with those in a recent report (16Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in which precise deletion of zyxin's α-actinin binding site was observed to impair focal adhesion targeting. We therefore sought to clarify the role of α-actinin binding for subcellular targeting of zyxin by defining sequences required for focal adhesion localization of zyxin in a second species. Consistent with what we observed for human zyxin (Fig. 2), deletion constructs that eliminated up to 304 residues from the N terminus of chicken zyxin retained the capacity to target to focal adhesions (Fig. 1 C and Fig. 3,C–H). Although subtle reductions in the efficiency of zyxin targeting to focal adhesions are impossible to quantify using this approach, examination of a large number of cells supports the conclusion that the N-terminal domain is not essential for the focal adhesion targeting. As noted above, this conclusion contrasts with that of Reinhard et al. (16Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), who concluded that zyxin's α-actinin binding site represents an essential focal adhesion targeting determinant. In that study, an internal deletion of amino acid residues corresponding to the α-actinin binding site was made, and it was noted that focal adhesion targeting of zyxin was impaired. In our case, larger N-terminal deletions failed to eliminate focal adhesion targeting. In order to compare directly our system with that of Reinhard et al., we generated the comparable internal deletion construct in which amino acid residues 24–46 were eliminated from chicken zyxin. This region of chicken zyxin is 83% identical and 96% similar to the comparable sequence in human zyxin that was deleted by Reinhard et al. (16Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 M). Consistent with the report by Reinhard et al., we also observed a failure of zyxin lacking this sequence to target effectively to focal adhesions (Fig. 3, K and L), although robust expression was observed (data not shown). Because more extensive deletions of N-terminal sequences fail to compromise significantly the ability of zyxin to target to focal adhesions, targeting to these regions must involve a more complex mechanism than simple docking of zyxin at α-actinin-rich sites. Interestingly, although deletion of the N-terminal two-thirds of zyxin failed to eliminate focal adhesion targeting, sequential deletion of individual LIM domains did result in a progressive loss of focal adhesion targeting capacity (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). Strikingly, a construct lacking all three LIM domains showed only a rudimentary capacity to localize to focal adhesions (Fig. 3,I and J). These data illustrate that the LIM region of zyxin contains the primary focal adhesion targeting elements. Site-directed mutagenesis of the tyrosine residues within zyxin's LIM region failed to affect its ability to localize at focal adhesions (data not shown). Thus, although tyrosine kinases and their substrates are enric"
https://openalex.org/W2003878170,"Previous in vitro studies of cysteine-string protein (CSP) imply a potential role for the clathrin-uncoating ATPase Hsc70 in exocytosis. We show that hypomorphic mutations in Drosophila Hsc70-4 (Hsc4) impair nerve-evoked neurotransmitter release, but not synaptic vesicle recycling in vivo. The loss of release can be restored by increasing external or internal Ca(2+) and is caused by a reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity of exocytosis downstream of Ca(2+) entry. Hsc4 and CSP are likely to act in common pathways, as indicated by their in vitro protein interaction, the similar loss of evoked release in individual and double mutants, and genetic interactions causing a loss of release in trans-heterozygous hsc4-csp double mutants. We suggest that Hsc4 and CSP cooperatively augment the probability of release by increasing the Ca(2+) sensitivity of vesicle fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1998242737,"Brain functions are based on the dynamic interaction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Spillover of glutamate from excitatory synapses may diffuse to and modulate nearby inhibitory synapses. By recording unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) from cell pairs in CA1 of the hippocampus, we demonstrated that low concentrations of Kainate receptor (KAR) agonists increased the success rate (Ps) of uIPSCs, whereas high concentrations of KAR agonists depressed GABAergic synapses. Ambient glutamate released by basal activities or stimulation of the stratum radiatum increases the efficacy of GABAergic synapses by activating presynaptic KARs, which facilitate Ca2+-dependent GABA release. The results suggest that glutamate released from excitatory synapses may also function as an intermediary between excitatory and inhibitory synapses to protect overexcitation of local circuits."

All six subunits, essential for cell viability, collectively bind to the ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) consensus sequence in a sequence-specific manner and lead to the chromatin loading of other replication factors like CDC6 and MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance) that are essential for initiation of DNA replication (2Dutta A.

Endogenous ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 subunits have been reported to interact with each other in extracts of cancer cell lines (14Dhar S.K. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34983-34988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). ORC1 and ORC6 did not interact with other ORC subunits under these experimental conditions (14Dhar S.K. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34983-34988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore it is possible that a functional human ORC exists only during a very short period of the cell cycle or in a specific sub-nuclear compartment, making it difficult to extract such a complex from human cell lines. In fact, in a recent study hamster ORC1 was reported to be easily eluted from chromatin during mitosis and early G1phase (15Natale D.A. Li C.J. Sun W.H. DePamphilis M.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2728-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It became stably bound to chromatin again during mid-G1 phase with the appearance of a functional pre-replication complex at a hamster replication origin. In contrast, ORC2 was stably bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle. Difficulties in obtaining six protein human ORCs may also be attributed to the fact that we are still missing some of the unidentified important components of the human ORC. Indeed, immunoprecipitation from [35S]methionine-labeled HeLa cell lysate of ORC1, -2, -3, -4, and -6 showed many non-ORC proteins interacting specifically with the respective ORC subunits (14Dhar S.K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1289-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro transcription translation reaction, a similar six-protein ORC has been reported in yeast S. pombe (6Moon K.Y. Kong D. Lee J.K. Raychaudhuri S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12367-12372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). With all the six human ORC subunits in our hand, we attempted to produce recombinant human ORC from the baculovirus expression system in order to dissect the activities and architecture of human origin recognition complex/subcomplex(s). Because genetic experiments are difficult to perform in mammalian systems, the human ORC subunits have not been shown to have a role in replication or cell proliferation. Utilizing knowledge learned about the architecture of the human ORC, we created a dominant negative ORC subunit designed to disrupt the formation of endogenous ORC. Overexpression of this dominant negative ORC subunit blocked the cell cycle in G1, providing the first evidence of the importance of ORC in cancer cell proliferation.

Coding sequences of ORC1, ORC4, ORC5, ORC6, and ORC3N200 were cloned into pFastBac (Life Technologies, Inc.), and coding sequences of ORC2 and ORC3 were cloned into pFastBac Dual. ORC2, -4, and -5 were also cloned in pFB-GST vectors to express GST fusion proteins. ORC3 and all the related constructs for in vitro transcription and translation reactions were made into T7T3DPAC vector (GenBankTM accession number U13871). Full-length and C-terminal ORC2 fragments were cloned into pGEX-5X-3 (Invitrogen) to produce bacterial fusion proteins. Additional information regarding the constructs will be made available upon request. Baculoviruses were produced from the recombinant pFastBac or pFB-GST plasmids using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hi5 or Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were infected with these baculoviruses according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Cells were harvested 48 h post-infection. The cell pellet was washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mmTris/Cl, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cell suspension was homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer using a B-type pestle followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 7 min. The pellet containing the nuclei was lysed in buffer H/0.15 (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mmKCl, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The resulting suspension was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation (starting with 10% followed by 30% and finally 50%). The pellet after the 50% ammonium sulfate cut was resuspended in buffer H/0.0 (no salt) and then dialyzed overnight against buffer H/0.15. The dialyzed sample was then bound to GST beads (Sigma) and washed three times with buffer H/0.25. Proteins were eluted using reduced glutathione elution buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm reduced glutathione, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl). Gel filtration of glutathione eluate using a fast protein liquid chromatography Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column was performed as described previously (14Dhar S.K. Dutta A. J. Biol.

U2OS cells used for FACS analysis were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid DNA used for transfection were purified using Qiagen maxiprep kits. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Biol. 1994; 32: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation reactions to produce [35S]methionine-labeled full-length and different deletions of ORC3 were performed using the Promega TNT system (Madison, WI). Pull-down assays on glutathione-agarose beads were done as described previously (20Lin Y.L. Chen C. Keshav K.F. Winchester E. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17190-17198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). U2OS cells were transfected with farnesylated GFP (CLONTECH) alone or in combination with FLAGORC2, GFPC1-ORC3N, or GFPC1-ORC3C1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with cold 70% ethanol, and stored until further use. Before analysis, fixed cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 10 µg/ml RNaseA (Sigma), and 0.05% Noniodet P-40 and then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry. The data were further analyzed using FLOWJO software to calculate the percentage of cells residing in different cell cycle stages. ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 subunits have been shown to interact with each other in human cell extracts (14Dhar S.K. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34983-34988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In an attempt to purify recombinant six protein human origin recognition complex, we infected Sf9 insect cells with baculoviruses expressing human ORC1–6 subunits. One of the subunits, ORC5, was GST-tagged. After pull down on glutathione beads, we found that GSTORC5, -2, -3, and -4 can be purified as a complex (Fig. 1 A). ORC1 did not enter into the complex in a stoichiometric ratio, and the presence of very little ORC1 in Fig. 1 A was not reproducible in different preparations. ORC6 did not enter into the complex at all. Both ORC1 and ORC6 were expressed at a high level. In a control experiment, we expressed GST alone with other ORC subunits. Pull down on glutathione beads purified only GST but none of the ORC subunits. Therefore, the results in Fig. 1 A are due to the formation of a complex of ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 and not due to precipitation of the proteins on the glutathione beads. GST pull-down experiments using GST tags on different ORC subunits (GSTORC2 and GSTORC4) confirmed the previous result showing ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 form a core complex (data not shown). To further show that GSTORC5, -2, -3, and -4 subunits are in one complex, we analyzed the elution pattern of these proteins upon gel filtration. Proteins were eluted from the GST beads using reduced glutathione and subsequently passed through a Superose 12 gel filtration column. Upon Western blotting of different fractions with different anti-ORC antibodies, we found that GSTORC5, -2, -3, and -4 subunits were co-eluted in one fraction (Fig. 1 C). The molecular mass of this complex is ∼500 kDa, which is more than the combined molecular mass of the four ORC subunits. This may be because of the multimerization of the GST moieties to give a high molecular mass complex or because the complex has an atypical shape. Silver staining of the purified protein used for the gel filtration experiment indicated that GST-ORC5, ORC2, -3, and -4 were the only proteins present in the preparation in significant amounts (Fig.1 D). We were interested in seeing which of the four interacting subunits interact directly. Sf9 insect cells were infected with six different combinations of baculoviruses expressing two ORC subunits in each case. One of the two viruses was GST-tagged. Affinity purification on glutathione beads showed that only ORC2 and ORC3 directly interacted with each other (Fig. 2). None of the other dual combinations of baculovirus showed any interaction under our experimental conditions. Therefore, we conclude that ORC2 and ORC3 form a core component of the ORC2, -3, -4, -5 complex. The ORC2-3 complex is expected to recruit ORC4 and ORC5. We were interested in seeing whether ORC2-3 core complex can recruit ORC4 first, followed by ORC5, or vice versa. Sf9 cells were infected by baculoviruses expressing GSTORC4, -2, and -3 subunits or by viruses expressing GSTORC5, -2, and -3. GSTORC4 did not interact with ORC2 and ORC3, whereas GSTORC5 interacted with ORC2 and ORC3 (Fig. 3). Therefore, ORC2-3 core complex is capable of recruiting ORC5, but it cannot recruit ORC4 by itself. The fact that ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 form a complex suggests that ORC2, -3, and -5 complex is necessary to load ORC4. It is also possible that ORC4 and ORC5 can be loaded on ORC2-3 core complex simultaneously independent of each other, but ORC5 is necessary to stabilize the association of ORC4 with the other ORC subunits. Upon establishing the fact that ORC2 and ORC3 form a core complex, we mapped the interacting domains of ORC2 and ORC3. N-terminal fragments of ORC3 labeled with [35S]methionine were produced by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The proteins were incubated with bacterially expressed and purified GSTORC2 protein. Three polypeptides derived from ORC3 were capable of binding GSTORC2, whereas the control GST protein did not bind any of them (Fig.4 A). The smallest fragment that bound to ORC2 contained 200 amino acids from the N terminus of ORC3 (construct 3, ORC3N). To map the portion of ORC2 involved in the interaction with ORC3, we expressed and purified GSTORC2C, containing the C-terminal 225 amino acids of ORC2. Both full-length ORC3 and ORC3N bound to GSTORC2C (Fig. 4 B), whereas control GST alone did not bind to any one of them (data not shown). Therefore, the C-terminal 225 residues of ORC2 interact with the N-terminal 200 residues of ORC3 to form the ORC2-3 complex at the core of human ORC. In the reciprocal deletion, removal of the first 200 amino acids of ORC3 abolished its ability to bind to GSTORC2 (Fig. 4 C). Based on these results we conclude that N-terminal 200 residues of ORC3 are necessary and sufficient to interact with ORC2. If the N-terminal 200 residues of ORC3 are sufficient for binding ORC2, ORC3N might be able to compete with full-length ORC3 for binding to GSTORC2. [35S]Methionine-labeled ORC3 was bound to GSTORC2 beads under conditions where the latter was limiting. These beads were then incubated with increasing amounts of ORC3N. We found that ORC3N protein could compete with the full-length ORC3 protein for association with GSTORC2 (Fig.5). Next we asked whether ORC3N is capable of mediating the interaction of ORC2 with ORC4 and ORC5. Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing GSTORC5, ORC2, ORC4, and ORC3N. After affinity purification on glutathione beads and Western blotting, we confirmed the presence of GSTORC5 in the eluate from the beads. Interestingly, in contrast to the result in Fig. 1 A, none of the other ORC subunits came down with GSTORC5, although they were all present in the input lane at reasonable quantities (Fig.6 A). We confirmed the physical interaction between ORC2 and ORC3N in the insect cell lysates by co-immunoprecipitation reactions. The lysate was immunoprecipitated using either anti-ORC2 or anti-ORC3 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with both the antibodies. ORC2 was detected in anti-ORC3 immunoprecipitate and vice versa (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, ORC3N is capable of interacting with ORC2, but this interaction was not sufficient for further binding of ORC4 and ORC5. The C-terminal portion of ORC3 appears to be crucial for binding of ORC4 and ORC5 subunits to ORC2-3 subcomplex. Because ORC3N did not form a complex with ORC4 and ORC5 but still could interact with ORC2, we reasoned that ORC3N might show a dominant negative effect on the cell cycle if overexpressed in a human cancer cell line. ORC3N and ORC3C1 were cloned into GFPC1 (CLONTECH) expression vector to produce non-farnesylated GFP fusion proteins. U2OS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing farnesylated GFP alone or in combination with FLAGORC2 or GFPORC3N or GFPORC3C1 (1:3 molar ratio) followed by FACS analysis after 48 h. Cells transfected with GFP alone, FLAG-ORC2, or GFP-ORC3C1 showed normal cell cycle progression, whereas cells transfected with GFP-ORC3N were blocked mostly in G1 (73%) (Fig. 7). This is the first evidence for any cell cycle effect of any human ORC protein. Since ORC3N can still bind ORC2 but not ORC4 and ORC5, it is possible that over-expressed ORC3N interacts with ORC2 but prevents functional ORC formation. Consistent with this, over-expression of full-length ORC3, which interacts with ORC2 but allows functional ORC formation, did not block the cells in G1 (data not shown). We report here that human ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 form a core complex in baculovirus-infected insect cells. ORC1 and ORC6 did not interact with this core complex under these experimental conditions. This was confirmed by using different tags on different ORC subunits and is consistent with our previously published data showing that endogenous ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 in a HeLa cell extract physically interacted with each other but not with ORC1 and -6(14). Recently ORC1 has been shown to interact with ORC2 by co-immunoprecipitation reaction using high salt nuclear lysate from HeLa cells (21Kreitz S. Ritzi M. Baack M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 6337-6342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This study did not include ORC3-6 proteins. Unfortunately, we could not reproduce the co-immunoprecipitation of ORC1 with ORC2 in human cell lines using two different ORC1 antibodies, raised independently. Under the same conditions we still found strong interaction among ORC2–5 subunits. The data from HeLa cell extract and recombinant baculovirus proteins strongly suggest that ORC2–5 form a core complex with ORC1 and ORC6, joining the complex either at very restricted times or locations or in a very labile interaction that is easily disrupted upon cell lysis. We further found that ORC2 and ORC3 form a tight complex essential for binding ORC4 and ORC5. Gel filtration of 293T cell extract showed that ORC2 and 3 were the only two subunits that mostly co-eluted, consistent with the direct interaction between ORC2 and -3 reported here (16Thome K.C. Dhar S.K. Quintana D.G. Delmolino L. Shahsafaei A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35233-35241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, none of the other ORC subunits interact with each other directly. The N-terminal 200 amino acids of ORC3 were enough to interact with C-terminal portion of ORC2 but not sufficient to allow association with ORC4 and ORC5, suggesting that the C-terminal of ORC3 is required for ORC4 and ORC5 loading on ORC2-3 subcomplex. Recently, in yeast S. cerevisiae, ORC2 and ORC3 have been shown to interact directly (22Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Insect cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing yeast ORCs, and recombinant yeast ORC was purified and tested for its DNA binding ability. ORC6 was found dispensable for DNA binding property. Elimination of ORC3 during baculovirus infection led to formation of ORC sub-complex without the presence of ORC2, suggesting that yeast ORC3 recruits ORC2 to the complex. Likewise, yeast ORC4 and ORC5 were shown to interact with each other. In addition, when yeast ORC was bound to yeast ARS1, ORC1, -2, -4, and -5 subunits were shown to directly contact ARS1 DNA by UV cross-linking (22Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7159-7168Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The human ORC2–5 sub-complex, however, did not show any sequence-specific DNA binding activity (data not shown). Finally we showed that ORC3N has a dominant negative effect on cell cycle progression. U2OS cells expressing the same fragment were blocked in G1, whereas the ORC3C1 or ORC2 protein did not prevent the cells from normal cell cycle progression. This can be explained by the fact that ORC3N titrates out ORC2 or an unknown cellular protein in the cell, thereby blocking G1-S transition. Given that ORC2 and ORC3N form a very tight complex but the latter cannot support ORC2, -3, -4, -5 complex formation, we believe that ORC2 is the target that is titrated out by ORC3N. We cannot, however, overcome the effect of ORC3N by over-expressing ORC2 or ORC2C. 2S. K. Dhar and A. Dutta, unpublished information. ORC2 or ORC2C might not be expressed at high enough levels to titrate out the ORC3N. Alternatively, the ORC3N targets an unknown cellular factor to cause the G1-S block. Based on these results we propose a molecular architecture of human ORC (Fig. 8). ORC2 and ORC3 interact directly with the C terminus of the former subunit, in close proximity with the N terminus of the latter. This binding favors the loading of ORC4 and -5 subunits via the C-terminal residues of ORC3. Although none of the other ORC subunits interacted with each other, we cannot rule out weak inter-subunit interactions among themselves. Further experiments will address how the ORC2–5 complex recruits ORC1 and ORC6 to form human ORC and study how the complex interacts with DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2047143254,"The binding affinity of the cocaine analog [3H]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (WIN) for the dopamine transporter (DAT) is increased by the reaction of Cys-90, at the extracellular end of the first transmembrane segment, with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. Cocaine enhances the reaction of Cys-90 with the sulfhydryl reagents, thereby augmenting the increase in binding. In contrast, cocaine decreases the reaction of Cys-135 and Cys-342, endogenous cysteines in cytoplasmic loops, with MTS reagents. Because this reaction inhibits [3H]WIN binding, cocaine protects against the loss of binding caused by reaction of these cysteines. In the present work, we compare the abilities of DAT inhibitors and substrates to affect the reaction of Cys-90, Cys-135, and Cys-342 with MTS ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET). The results indicate that the different abilities of compounds to protect against the MTSET-induced inhibition of binding are attributable to differences in their abilities to attenuate the inhibitory effects of modification of Cys-135 and Cys-342 as well as to enhance the reaction with Cys-90 and the resulting potentiation of binding. The inhibitor benztropine was unique in its inability to protect Cys-135. Moreover, whereas cocaine, WIN, mazindol, and dopamine enhanced the reaction of Cys-90 with MTSET, benztropine had no effect on this reaction. These two features combine to give benztropine its weak potency in protecting ligand binding to wild-type DAT from MTSET. These results indicate that different inhibitors of DAT, such as cocaine and benztropine, produce different conformational changes in the transporter. There are differences in the psychomotor stimulant-like effects of these compounds, and it is possible that the different behavioral effects of these DAT inhibitors stem from their different molecular actions on DAT."

The long arm consists of heterotrimerization domains followed by a prominent globular structure, the α chain G domain, composed of five tandem repeats, called laminin G-like, or LG repeats. While LG monomers and dimers are found in other proteins, a continuous string of five LG modules are only found in the laminin α chains (21Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The five modules are linked together by short (∼5–10 residues) intermodular sequences, except between the third and the fourth module, where the linker sequence is ∼50 residues in length, essentially dividing the G domain into two separate structural components, the LG123 triplet and the LG45 pair (19Tsubota Y.

However, direct demonstration of integrin-dependent cell adhesion has not been reproduced with recombinant G domain fragments, possibly due to the conformation-sensitive nature of laminin functions and the difficulties in expressing soluble LG modules, especially the LG3 module (15Mizushima H.

In functional analyses, purified recombinant LG3 (rLG3), not rLG1 or rLG2, replicated key Ln-5 activities including cell adhesion, spreading, and migration.

Rat Ln-5 α3 cDNA was cloned from an 804G λ zap expression library (20Baker S.E. Hopkinson S.B. Fitchmun M. Andreason G.L. Frasier F. Plopper G. Quaranta V. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2509-2520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two overlapping rat laminin α3 cDNA clones, pCR5C5 (base pairs 874–3180) and pCRα3α4 (base pairs 3034–5178) were used as templates to amplify sequences encoding LG modules 1 and 3, respectively. Since neither pCR5C5 nor pCRα3α4 encodes complete LG2, it was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using mRNA isolated from 804G cells. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out with Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used were LG1–5′ (ACCTTCCCCGGGCCAATGACCTAGAAGAC), LG1–3′ (CTGTCCGCGGCCGCTCAATGATGATGATGATGGTGATTTTTGTCTGACTCTTC), LG2–5′ (ACCTTCGGATCCAATCTCAACACCACGGAGGTGGAGCCTAGT(C/S)AGGAGGAGAAAG), LG2–3′ (CTGTCCGCGGCCGCTCAATGATGATGATGATGGTGGGCGGTTCGCACAAGCTT), LG3–5′ (ACCTTCGGATCCAATGATACTGTGGGTGTAACCAAGAAGAGC(C/S)TCAGAAGACTGG), and LG3–3′ (CTGTCCGCGGCCGCTCAATGATGATGATGATGGTGGTGAGAGGCCTTGGTGTT). In addition to the coding sequence, all of the 3′ primers included a stop codon and a sequence encoding the histidine (His6) tag. LG1 was ligated into SmaI-NotI sites, and LG2 and LG3 were ligated into BamHI-NotI sites of pGEX-4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Induction of protein expression in Escherichia coli JM109 strain grown to midlog phase in Luria-Bertani medium was carried out with 1.0 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After protein induction for 5 h at 34 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min (Sorvall, GSA rotor). Cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until use. For protein purification, pellets were thawed and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cell lysis was carried out by passage of cell suspension through French Press (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 1500 p.s.i. twice. Clarified cell lysates were applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) column. The column was washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mmimidazole). Protein elution was carried out with 300 mmimidazole and 1 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) in wash buffer. Histidine-tagged (i.e. without glutathioneS-transferase (GST)) LG proteins were expressed using the pET-30a(+) expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) in E. coli. Recombinant His-tagged LG3 were also expressed in High FiveTM insect cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) under serum-free culture conditions using Pharmingen's Baculovirus Expression Vector System. Protein samples at 0.2–0.45 mg/ml were prepared in Tris-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol. CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV model 202SF stop-flow circular dichroism spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ), using a thermostatted cell of 0.1-mm path length. Protein samples were analyzed at 23 °C from 200 to 300 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm. Three repetitive scans were averaged and smoothed by binomial curve smoothing. The molar ellipticity (in degrees cm2 dmol−1) was calculated on the basis of protein concentration and molar mass for each rLG. Cell adhesion assays were performed in 96-well GSH-coated plates (Pierce) that were pretreated with SuperBlockTM, a proprietary blocking reagent containing a mammalian derived protein (Pierce). The GSH plates were first coated with rLGs overnight at 4 °C. Unbound protein was removed with phosphate-buffered saline washing. Cells were detached with 0.025% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA (Life Technologies). Serum-free trypsin-neutralizing solution (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) was used to neutralize trypsin. Cells were then washed twice with serum-free DMEM containing 25 mm HEPES, resuspended in serum-free DMEM/HEPES at a cell density of 8.0 × 105 cells/ml. For each well, 100 µl of cell suspension was seeded and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C. Nonadherent cells were removed; adherent cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde (3% (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline) and stained with crystal violet (3% (w/v) in methanol); and absorbance was measured at 595 nm. Cell spreading analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (version 1.61) available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/. For adhesion inhibition assays, cells were preincubated with antibodies at room temperature for 15 min prior to seeding. For cation studies, cells were washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies) containing 2 mm EDTA to deplete preexisting cations prior to trypsinization. Cells were then trypsinized, washed twice with cation-free Hanks' balanced salt solution, and resuspended in cation-free Hanks' balanced salt solution at 8.0 × 105 cells/ml (100 µl per well was used). Cations (i.e. CaCl2, MgCl2, and MnCl2) at the indicated concentrations were preincubated with the cells for 15 min at room temperature prior to seeding. Cell migration assays were carried out as previously described (31Koshikawa N. Giannelli G. Cirulli V. Miyazaki K. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 615-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Briefly, Transwell filters (Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated on the lower side with purified rLGs at 3.5 µg/ml. The lower side of the filter was then blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h. Cells were prepared as in adhesion assays. 8.5 × 104 cells in 600 µl of serum-free DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to the upper chamber and allowed to migrate for 18 or 36 h at 37 °C under tissue culture conditions. Cells that migrated to the bottom surface of the filter were fixed with methanol, stained with crystal violet, and counted. Each substrate was repeated in duplicate wells, and within each well counting was done in four randomly selected microscopic fields (× 300 magnification). FAK phosphorylation assays were performed as previously described (32Hintermann E. Bilban M. Sharabi A. Quaranta V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In brief, HT-1080 cells were trypsinized, washed, and kept in suspension in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C to reduce background FAK phosphorylation level. For the adherent FAK assay, cells were plated onto uncoated, Ln-5-coated (1 µg/ml), or LG3-coated (25 µg/ml) wells and allowed to attach for 1 h. For the suspension FAK assay, the same number of cells were kept in suspension in the presence of various test proteins at the same concentration used for the adherent assay. At the end of 1 h of incubation, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (40 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% lauryl sulfate, 1 mm Na2VO4; 25 mm Na4P2O7). Total FAK protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK pAb that was immobilized onto protein G-conjugated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitated FAK protein was subjected to Western blotting analyses with phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 to assess the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation and anti-FAK mAb to determine the amount of FAK. The relative -fold induction of FAK phosphorylation, which is defined as the increase in FAK phosphorylation of a sample relative to its corresponding background level (i.e. cells plated on plastic or kept in suspension) was determined as followed. First, densitometry intensity of phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK) and total FAK (t-FAK) signals from Western blots were measured with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The ratio of p-FAK to t-FAK (p-FAK/t-FAK) for each sample was then calculated to correct for differences in protein loading. This ratio was then normalized to the p-FAK/t-FAK ratio of the negative controls to obtain the relative -fold induction of FAK phosphorylation. The rLG3 affinity column was prepared with 1 ml of GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 mg of purified rLG3. Protein immobilization efficiency was ∼80%, as determined by absorbance readings (at 280 nm) of applied and flow-through fractions. Since the binding of GSH to GST is high affinity, no cross-linking was performed. The column was equilibrated with cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) until use. HT-1080 or HaCaT cells (1 × 108) were lysed with lysis buffer containing EDTA-free Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Cell lysates were clarified (Sorvall SS34, 10,000 × g, 20 min) and mixed in batch with rLG3-bound Sepharose on a rotator for 1 h. The mix was transferred into a column, and flow-through fractions were collected. The column was sequentially washed with 5 bed volumes of lysis buffer and lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl followed by lysis buffer containing 1.0 m NaCl. Bound material was eluted with 10 mm of EDTA in Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4). SDS-PAGE (4–12% gradient, nonreducing) was carried out on selected wash fractions (with high absorbance readings at 280 nm) and the first three elution fractions. Western blotting was carried out with antibodies to integrin subunits α3 (pAb 1948, 1:500), α5 (anti-α5 Cyt, 1:500), and β1 (TS2/16, 1:300). Western blots were visualized with the ECL+plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To identify integrin-binding, adhesive domains of Ln-5, the three proximal LG modules (i.e. LG1, -2, and -3) of Ln-5 α3 chain (Fig.1A and 2A) were expressed as monomers in E. coli. Amino acid sequence analyses of Ln-5 LG3 module orthologues (i.e. LG3 from rats, humans, and mice) revealed that the rat LG3 sequence was considerably more hydrophilic in three major regions (Fig. 1, B andC, highlighted by bars) than the corresponding human sequence. This observation may partially explain why the human Ln LG3 modules (derived from Ln α2 and α3 chains) failed to express recombinantly in previous attempts (15Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar, 28Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and suggested that the Ln-5 LG3 module from rat may be more amenable to recombinant expression. In addition to switching species, three additional strategies were used to facilitate recombinant protein expression: 1) each LG construct was extended by 10 amino acids into neighboring modules (Figs. 1 C and2 A, top panel) to facilitate protein folding; 2) the N-terminal nonbonding cysteine residue of each module was converted to serine, while the two C-terminal pairing cysteines were left intact (Figs. 1 C and 2 A, top panel) to favor correct disulfide bond formation; and 3) the recombinant LG modules were expressed as double-tagged fusion proteins, containing a GST moiety at the N terminus and a His6 tag at the C terminus (Fig. 2 A,top panel) to provide convenient handles on protein purification and functional assays.Figure 2Analyses of purified recombinant Ln-5 LG modules by SDS-PAGE and circular dichroism suggest proper folding. A, the three LG modules, LG1, LG2, and LG3, were expressed as GST- and His6-tagged fusion proteins. Recombinant LG modules (rLG) were purified first over nickel (Ni) and then GSH columns. Eluted material was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (11% acrylamide, reducing) and visualized by Coomassie staining. In the gel shown, purified rLGs were compared with GST, purified over a GSH column, and compared with a total cell lysate of the rLG3 clone before purification. B, gel mobilities of purified rLGs treated with β-mercaptoethanol (β-MeOH) were compared with nontreated rLGs under 10% SDS-PAGE conditions. Reduction of rLGs prior to electrophoresis resulted in reproducible decrease in gel mobility. C, circular dichroism analyses of rLGs in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, at 23 °C. The CD spectra of all three rLGs showed ellipticity minima at around 210–220 nm, indicating that the purified rLGs consist of predominantly β structure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) rLG modules were purified to near homogeneity with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose under nondenaturing conditions as determined by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2 A). Purification with GSH affinity column provided further improvement in purity (Fig. 2 A). The expression levels for all three rLGs were similar; on average, about 0.5 mg of purified rLG protein was obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture (data not shown). To determine whether or not an intramolecular disulfide bond formed in the rLGs, we subjected the purified recombinant proteins to SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and looked for mobility differences. Treatment of rLGs with β-mercaptoethanol (10%, v/v) prior to SDS-PAGE caused a small but reproducible reduction in gel mobility, suggesting that intramolecular disulfide bonds are present in all three recombinant proteins (Fig. 2 B). The secondary structure of rLGs was assessed by CD spectroscopy. With the GST-tagged rLGs, obtaining CD data of the LG portion of the fusion proteins requires CD spectral subtraction between the two recombinant proteins (i.e. GST-LGs and GST). This extra step requires protein concentrations to be precisely determined in order to avoid introducing errors due to over- or undersubtraction of CD data. To more directly and accurately determine the CD spectra of rLGs, they were subcloned into a pET vector, expressed as His6-tagged recombinant proteins (without the N-terminal GST moiety), and used in CD studies. CD spectra of recombinant His6-LG1, recombinant His6-LG2, and recombinant His6-LG3 showed ellipticity minima at 217, 215, and 214 nm, respectively (Fig.2 C), characteristic of proteins rich in β structure (33Johnson Jr., W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar,34Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Our findings are in good agreement with previously reported CD values for other LG homologs (27Yurchenco P.D. Sung U. Ward M.D. Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8356-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ott U. Odermatt E. Engel J. Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Eur. J.

Talts J.F. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In summary, these results suggest that the bacterially expressed LG modules from Ln-5 are sufficiently well folded to support potential functional activity. The adhesive activity of GST-tagged rLGs was evaluated in adhesion assays. Purified rLGs proteins were adsorbed onto GSH-coated microtiter wells via their N-terminal GST moieties in order to favor uniform protein orientation and minimize denaturation. rLG3 showed unequivocal adhesion activity with two distinct cell lines, the fibrosarcoma HT-1080 and the hepatoma HLF (Fig.3, A (left ofdashed line) and B). In contrast, rLG1 and rLG2 displayed minimal or no adhesion activity under our conditions, even at high coating concentrations, compared with the GST control (Fig. 3, A (left of dashed line) and B). HT-1080 adhesion on GST-tagged rLG3 was dose-dependent with maximal adhesion occurring at 25 µg/ml or 0.5 µm coating concentration. At this or higher coating concentrations, the adhesion activity of GST-tagged rLG1, rLG2, and GST remained negligible (Fig. 3 B). Adhesion assays were also performed with His6-tagged rLGs (without the N-terminal GST fusion) to rule out possible effects on biological activities by the presence of GST, if any, on the LG modules. The adhesion activity profile of His6-tagged rLGs was very similar to those of GST-tagged counterparts (Fig. 3 A,right of dashed line), suggesting that in the LG fusion proteins the GST moiety is functionally inert. In addition, His6-rLG3 was expressed in insect High FiveTM cells, purified to near homogeneity with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (data not shown), and tested in adhesion assays. Insect expressed His6-rLG3 was active in promoting cell adhesion of HT-1080 cells (Fig. 3 A,right of dashed line), suggesting that the adhesion activity observed with the bacterially expressed rLG3 is preserved in the rLG3 obtained from an eukaryotic expression host. The higher adhesion activity observed with the insect-derived rLG3, however, is probably due to more efficient and complete intramolecular disulfide bond formation in eukaryotic cells. Since protein yields were the highest with the bacterially derived, GST-tagged rLG fusion proteins (data not shown), and no gross functional difference was observed between the rLGs generated by these three expression approaches, all of the remaining assays in this paper were performed with the GST-tagged fusion proteins expressed in E. coli. To further evaluate the adhesion activity of rLG3, we examined adherent cells to distinguish between cell tethering to the substratum and cell spreading. HT-1080 and HLF cells adherent on rLG3 were microphotographed in the adhesion assay wells after washing, fixation, and staining with crystal violet. On rLG3, 64% of HT-1080 and 53% of HLF cells displayed spreading morphology; i.e. they adopted a flattened, polygonal shape, with filopodia- and lamellipodia-like extensions (Fig. 4). The remaining nonspread cells on rLG3 resisted washing and remained tethered to the plate surface (Fig. 4). As expected, no cell spreading was observed on either rLG1- or rLG2-coated plates (Fig. 4). These results indicate that rLG3"

Two Islet-2 molecules bind to the LIM domain binding protein (Ldb) dimers. Overexpression of the LIM domains of Islet-2 or the LIM-interacting domain of Ldb proteins prevented binding of Islet-2 to Ldb proteins in vitro and caused similar in vivo defects in positioning, peripheral axonal outgrowth, and neurotransmitter expression by the Islet-2-positive primary sensory and motor neurons as the defects induced by injection of Islet-2-specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotide. These and other experiments, i.e., mosaic analysis, coexpression of full-length Islet-2, and overexpression of the chimeric LIM domains derived from two different Islet-1 family members, demonstrated that Islet-2 regulates neuronal differentiation by forming a complex with Ldb dimers and possibly with some other Islet-2-specific cofactors."

In the mouse intestine, SI is initially expressed at low levels late in fetal development when the stratified endoderm cells transform into a columnar epithelium with nascent villi (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). This low level of SI expression is maintained through birth and the first two postnatal weeks of life (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). Between days 16 and 17, there is a dramatic induction in SI expression that occurs in concert with other changes in gene expression that results in the phenotype of the adult intestine (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). During this transition and throughout adult life, there is a prominent induction of SI mRNA in enterocytes located at the crypt-villus junction. SI mRNA is abundant in enterocytes from the base of villi to the midvillus toward the tip, resulting in low levels in villus tip cells (4Traber P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Traber P.G., Yu, L. Wu G.D. Judge T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G123-G130PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern of expression mirrors critical developmental and differentiation transitions in the intestine. Therefore, SI has served as a useful model to investigate the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate intestinal developmental transitions. We have mapped regions of the SI gene that are important to recapitulate its complex expression during mouse intestinal development using transgenic mice (1Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Birkenmeier E.H. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G526-G539PubMed Google Scholar, 2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis shows that the crucial regulatory elements that direct patterns of enterocyte expression are located between nucleotides −201 and +54 of the SI promoter. This short, evolutionarily conserved mouse SI gene promoter directs transcription to enterocytes in developmental and differentiation-dependent patterns (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). Since these transgenic constructs are able to recapitulate the expression profile of the endogenous gene during development, we conclude that increased expression of the SI gene at the suckling-weaning transition is due predominantly to induction of transcription. Moreover, the crucial regulatory elements that direct patterns of enterocyte expression are located between nucleotides −201 and +54 of the SI promoter. Further studies of the human SI promoter in cell lines have identified three major positive regulatory elements, sucrase-isomaltase footprint 1 (SIF1), SIF2, and SIF3 (6Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caudal-related homeodomain proteins (Cdx1 and Cdx2) interact with the SIF1 element and induce gene transcription in vitro (8Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell.

The SIF2 and SIF3 elements of the human SI promoter interact with HNF-1 proteins to regulate transcription (10Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is currently unclear whether these proteins interact with the SI promoter in vivo to regulate gene transcription during intestinal development. In this study, we investigate the role of HNF-1 proteins in the transcriptional regulation of the SI promoter during postnatal intestinal development. HNF-1α and HNF-1β are transcription factors distantly related to homeodomain proteins that bind to DNA as either homodimers or heterodimers (11Mendel D.B. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 677-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are expressed in a variety of tissues including liver, kidney, intestine, stomach, and pancreas and have been implicated in the regulation of multiple genes (12Baumhueter S. Mendel D.B.

In this report, we demonstrate that mutagenesis of the SIF3 element strongly impairs the activity of SI promoter in transgenic mice and Caco-2 cells. Using intact nuclear proteins from neonatal mouse intestinal epithelial cells and Caco-2 cells, we show that the pattern of protein binding to the SIF3 element changes at a period when SI expression is dramatically increased. We find that an increase in the ratio of HNF-1β to HNF-1α reduces SI promoter activity. Taken together, these data confirm an essential role for the HNF-1 element to regulate expression of the SI gene during intestinal development and enterocyte differentiation. The −201 to +54 mSI-hGH construct has been described elsewhere (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutagenesis of the −201 to +54 mSI-hGH plasmid was performed using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The following oligonucleotide was designed to create point mutations (underlined) within the SIF3 element: SIF3m, 5′-GTAGAAATAACACAGGTATTAAGTAACTTGGCATGTC-3′. Integrity of the mutant construct was confirmed by sequence analysis. The −8.5 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH plasmid was constructed in two steps. First, the −8.5 to +54 mSI-hGH construct (2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar) was digested withXbaI and SphI to discard the −3424 to +54 mSI/hGH portion. The remaining sequence was used to subclone theXbaI-SphI −201 to +54 SIF3m mSI/hGH insert digested from the −201 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH vector to create the −8.5 to −3.4/−201 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH vector. The −3424 to −201XbaI fragment digested from the −8.5 to +54 mSI-hGH plasmid was then inserted in the −8.5 to −3.4/−201 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH vector to create the −8.5 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH plasmid. Correct orientation of the −3424 to −201 integrated fragment as well as the presence of the SIF3 mutation in the −201 to +54 segment was confirmed by sequence analysis. Portions of the human and mouse ribosomal protein 36B4 mRNA and the human HNF-1α mRNA were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Reverse transcription reactions were performed as described previously (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar) with the use of either RNA extracted from Caco-2 cells or mouse small intestine. For PCR, the following paired primers were used for amplification: for h36B4, h36B4up (5′-ATGTGAAGTCACTGTGCCAG-3′) and h36B4down (5′-CTCAGGATTTCAATGGTGCC-3′); for m36B4, m36B4up (5′-ATGTGAGGTCACTGTGCCAG-3′) and m36B4down (5′-AGGTGTACTCAGTCTCCACA-3′); and for hHNF-1α, HNF1αup (5′-GGAAATGCCTGTGTGAGTAG-3′) and HNF1αdown (5′-GAAGGCCAGGTTCTCAGCAG-3′). PCR amplification was carried out for 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C, annealing of the primers at 55 °C, and reaction extension at 72 °C, each for 1 min. A 113-base pair fragment extending from positions 431 to 544 of h36B4, a 420-base pair fragment from positions 428 to 848 of m36B4, and a 643-base pair fragment from position 2465 to 3108 of hHNF-1α cDNA were subcloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The integrity of subcloned PCR products was confirmed by sequence analysis. The 132-bpEcoRI-SmaI m36B4 fragment was further subcloned in Bluescript KS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to create the KS-m36B4 plasmid. The promoter/reporter −8.5 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH construct was released by digestion with SalI andSphI and purified. Transgenic mice were produced by the Transgenic Core Facility at the University of Pennsylvania. The DNA construct was injected into the male pronucleus of fertilized eggs and implanted into pseudopregnant females using standard methodology. DNA from tail biopsies of resulting mice was extracted using the QIAamp Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The presence of the transgene in mouse genomic DNA was determined by PCR and Southern analysis as described previously (2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). Transgene founders of the BGSJL/F1 strain (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were bred with normal CD1 mice (Charles River), and offspring were analyzed for the transgene by PCR. A Caco-2 cell line was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The Caco-2–15 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. J.-F. Beaulieu (Université de Sherbrooke, Québec). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/literd-glucose, 25 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml of streptomycin in 5% CO2. Nuclear protein was isolated from neonatal mice by a modification of a method previously used by our laboratory for adult mouse intestine (6Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (0.15 ml for adult, 0.05 ml for neonatal mice), and the intestine was exposed through a midline incision. The distal small intestine was rinsed with 10 ml of 1× calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salts (CMF). The thoracic cavity was opened, and the left ventricle was perfused through a needle with 1× CMF for 3 min with a hydrostatic head of 5 feet. Perfusion fluid was allowed to exit through an incision in the right atrium. Adequacy of the perfusion was determined by homogenous blanching of the intestine and liver. The section of bowel that was initially rinsed was washed with 10 ml of 1× CMF buffer containing 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml bestatin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to collect epithelial cells. The cells were washed twice with 1× CMF containing proteinase inhibitors. Nuclear proteins were then isolated from the epithelial cell suspension using the same method as previously described for cells in culture (6Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Following each intestinal perfusion, the isolated epithelium was stained with trypan blue to examine cell integrity. Cell isolates with greater than 5% trypan blue-positive cells, indicating disrupted membranes, were discarded. Nuclear proteins were isolated from Caco-2 cells or intestinal epithelial cells (see above), and EMSA was performed exactly as described previously (8Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). HNF-1α affinity-purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping to the carboxyl terminus of human HNF-1α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and HNF-1β affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping to the N terminus of human HNF-1β 2F. Boudreau and P. G. Traber, unpublished results. were used for supershift experiments. For Western blot analysis, 20 µg of total protein extract was analyzed by a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween for overnight. The membrane was then incubated for 3 h with the primary antibody. The following antibodies were used: HNF-1 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping to amino acids 80–284 of human HNF-1α that reacts with HNF-1α and HNF-1β proteins (H-205, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Cdx2 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping to the N terminus of murine Cdx2. 3E. H. H. M. Rings and P. G. Traber, unpublished results. The membrane was washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween and incubated with the secondary antibody anti-rabbit/horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 45 min at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times and developed with the ECL-Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunohistochemistry, tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate (Fisher) and embedded in paraffin in Swiss roll orientation such that the entire length of the intestinal tract could be identified on a single section. Tissue sections were stained for hGH protein and counterstained with eosin as described previously (1Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Birkenmeier E.H. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G526-G539PubMed Google Scholar, 2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from multiple tissues using a CsCl gradient method as previously described (2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar) or from cultured cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ribonuclease (RNase) protection assays were performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Riboprobes for the detection of human SI and hGH mRNA were prepared as previously described (1Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Birkenmeier E.H. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G526-G539PubMed Google Scholar). The riboprobe for the detection of hHNF-1α was prepared by digesting pGEM-hHNF-1α with XhoI, and transcripts were synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase to yield a probe that protects a 326-bp region located in the 3′-noncoding region of the hHNF-1α cDNA. As a control for total RNA integrity, human and mouse riboprobes for the detection of the ribosomal protein 36B4 mRNA (18Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were synthesized. h36B4 riboprobe was prepared by digesting pGEM-h36B4 with SacII and with SP6 RNA polymerase to yield a probe that protected 113 nt. m36B4 riboprobe was prepared by digesting KS-m36B4 with HindIII and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to yield a probe that protected 132 nt. Northern blot was performed as described elsewhere (19Boudreau F., Yu, S.J. Asselin C. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NotI-XhoI mouse HNF-1β cDNA fragment digested from pBJ5-HNF-1β plasmid (16Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) was used to detect the human HNF-1β mRNA, since comparison of cDNA nucleotide sequences showed more than 91% homology. h36B4 was used as a control for RNA integrity. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells at 50–60% confluence were incubated with 1.5 µg of total DNA and 2.5 µl of LipofectAMINE/ml of OPTI-MEM for 5 h. The medium was then changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfections, luciferase activity was determined 48 h after the transfection using the luciferase assay kit (Promega Biotech, Madison, WI). Each experiment was repeated three times in triplicate. pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector was co-transfected in each experiment as a measure of transfection efficiency, and the results were reported as light units per unit of β-galactosidase. For stable transfections, Caco-2/15 cells were trypsinized 48 h following transfection and maintained in selection medium containing 1 mg/ml G418. To evaluate the functional role of the SIF3 element in the regulation of the SI gene in the intact mouse intestinal epithelium, we designed transgenic constructs harboring point mutations within this element that linked nucleotides −8.5 to +54 of the mSI gene to the hGH reporter gene (Fig.1A). The wild-type construct supports hGH expression in enterocytes of transgenic mice and has been shown to direct copy number-dependent and insertion site-independent transgene expression in multiple trangenic lines (2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar). The SIF3m mutation has been previously shown to abolish in vitro interaction with HNF-1 proteins (10Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four founders (numbers 17, 28, 29, and 41) derived from the construct −8.5 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH were found to have 1, 31, 7, and 10 copies of the transgene integrated into their genome, respectively (data not shown). The effect of the SIF3 mutation on hGH expression in these transgenic lines was compared with the previously characterized F0(17)F1(32) transgenic line that contained five copies of the wild-type −8.5 to +54 mSI-hGH transgene construct (2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA isolated from different portions of the intestine was analyzed by a RNase protection assay. Each RNA sample was incubated with probes for hGH and an internal control (36B4) in the same hybridization solution in order to correlate hGH mRNA levels among these different lines. The wild-type F0(17)F1(32) transgene line showed high level expression of hGH in the small intestine (Fig. 1 B), as previously reported (2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of hGH mRNA in the transgenic lines carrying the mutant construct was reduced by more than 95% in the duodenum and proximal and distal jejunum offounders 17, 29, and 41 and by 85% in founder 28 as compared with the expression found in the wild-type transgene line (Fig. 1, B–D). Expression levels were similarly decreased in the ileum, although the pattern was somewhat more variable (Fig.1 D). No hGH expression was detected in transgenic lines harboring the same SIF3 mutation within a shorter −201 to +54 mSI/hGH transgene as compared with the wild type short transgene (data not shown). To verify the cellular distribution of hGH expression in the −8.5 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH transgenic lines, immunodetection was performed. Intestinal sections obtained from offspring of transgenic mice containing the wild-type transgene construct showed high level expression of hGH in differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine (Fig. 2A). In contrast, weak expression was detected in enterocytes randomly distributed along the proximal jejunum villi from offspring of founders 28 and 41, as illustrated in Fig. 2, B and C. Expression was restricted to the proximal jejunum with no detectable hGH protein throughout the entire small bowel as opposed to the wild-type transgenic control (data not shown) (2Markowitz A.J. Wu G.D. Bader A. Cui Z. Chen L. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G925-G939PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the data obtained from these transgenic constructs demonstrate a crucial role for the SIF3 element to regulate SI promoter activity in the small intestinal epithelium. The molecular mechanisms involved in the SIF3-dependent regulation of SI gene expression was further examined in the Caco-2 cell line, which has been extensively used as a model of enterocytic differentiation (20Menard D. Beaulieu J.-F. Bkaily G. Membranes Physiopathology. Kluwer Academic Press, Norwell, MA1994: 319-341Google Scholar, 21Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M.-D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assmann P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar, 22Zweibaum A. Chantret I. Smith M.W. Sepulveda F.V. Adaptation and Development of Gastrointestinal Function. Manchester University Press, Manchester, United Kingdom1989: 103Google Scholar). We used the Caco-2/15 clone derived from the parent Caco-2 cell line that spontaneously differentiates in postconfluence with concomitant high induction of SI expression (23Beaulieu J.F. Quaroni A. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of the SIF3 element to regulate SI promoter activity during Caco-2 cell differentiation. The constructs −8.5 to +54 mSI-hGH and −8.5 to +54 SIF3m mSI-hGH were co-transfected with a neomycin resistance expression vector (pRC/CMV) to stably transfect Caco-2/15 cells. As a control, Caco-2/15 cells were co-transfected with the empty hGH reporter and pRC/CMV. Because of the heterogeneous properties of Caco-2 cell lines with regards to SI expression (24Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.F. Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 414-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the entire neomycin-resistant population was used for further analysis. Expression of human SI, hGH, and h36B4 was determined in RNA samples isolated at different times of cell confluence. Expression of the −8.5 to +54 mSI-hGH construct increased in a similar manner to endogenous human SI mRNA during cellular differentiation (Fig.3A). In contrast to the wild-type construct, the SIF3 mutant construct showed stable levels of hGH expression at postconfluent stages as demonstrated in day 7 and 14 samples (Fig. 3 A). The level of hGH expression in the preconfluent state was comparable with the level detected in Caco-2/15 co-transfected with the empty vector, suggesting that the SI promoter is transcriptionally inactive in preconfluent cells (Fig. 3). We next examined the pattern of nuclear protein interaction with the SIF3 element during mouse intestinal development. To obtain high quality nondegraded protein, we performed a whole-body perfusion to isolate enterocytes and extract nuclear proteins from mouse intestines at different time points throughout the suckling-weaning transition. To ensure that our method isolated both crypt- and villus-associated cells, we isolated mRNA from the epithelial cells, and the expression of specific intestinal epithelial genes was examined by Northern analysis. We found that both SI (villus marker) and cryptdin (crypt marker) mRNAs were found in cell extracts (data not shown). Therefore, both crypt and villus cells were represented in the epithelial cell preparations. EMSA was then performed using a labeled SIF3 DNA probe, and equal amounts of nuclear extracts from intestinal epithelial cell pools were collected at different time before and after weaning. The SIF3 element produced two specific complexes that were competed by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled SIF3 oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). Although both complexes were detected at each time points during intestinal development, the relative intensity of the two complexes varied. The lower complex (labeled B in Fig. 4 A) was more abundant than the upper complex (A) at postnatal day 13, a time at which SI mRNA is just detectable (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). By postnatal day 19, the ratio of A to B complexes shifted, resulting in more abundant complex A relative to B. Importantly, this period of time coincides with dramatic induction of SI mRNA levels in the small bowel (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar). The change in ratio of these complexes was further amplified in adult mice (Fig. 4 A). Analysis of nuclear extracts binding to the mouse SIF2 element showed no specific DNA-protein interaction during mouse intestinal development. A similar analysis was then performed using the labeled SIF3 DNA probe and an equal amount of nuclear extracts prepared from preconfluent and postconfluent Caco-2 cells. The SIF3 element produced two protein-DNA complexes (A andB in Fig. 4 B), both of which were eliminated by competition with a 10-fold excess of unlabeled SIF3 oligonucleotides. The intensity of complex A increased at postconfluent day 7 with a simultaneous decrease in intensity of complex B, a pattern that was maintained at postconfluent day 14 (Fig. 4 B). The addition of affinity-purified polyclonal HNF-1α antibodies to the binding reaction supershifted both complex A and complex B, while HNF-1β antibodies supershifted only complex B, confirming that complex A is composed of HNF-1α homodimers and complex B is composed of HNF-1α/HNF-1β heterodimers (Fig. 4 C). These observations suggested that HNF-1 isoforms are differentially regulated during the suckling-weaning transition and Caco-2 cell differentiation. Therefore, we examined the expression of HNF-1α and HNF-1β mRNA at different times during Caco-2 cell growth and differentiation. RNase protection assay performed with specific hHNF-1α and h36B4 probes showed no significant change in HNF-1α mRNA levels in comparison with 36B4 mRNA levels before or after Caco-2 cell confluence (Fig.5A). However, HNF-1β mRNA levels were reduced more than 3-fold at postconfluence as determined by Northern analysis (Fig. 5 B). Immunoblots were performed to test whether changes in protein expression correlated with RNA expression of these isoforms during Caco-2 cell differentiation. No major change in HNF-1α protein level was observed before or after Caco-2 cell differentiation (Fig. 5 C). However, HNF-1β protein level was decreased more than 2.5-fold at postconfluence (Fig.5 C). Interestingly, CDX2 protein content was not significantly modified during Caco-2 cell differentiation (Fig.5 C).Figure 5Expression of HNF-1 α and HNF-1 β during Caco-2 cell differentiation. A, total RNA was extracted at different days of Caco2 cell confluence (PC, preconfluent;C, confluent; +7, 7 days after confluence; +14, 14 days after confluence). RPA was performed using hHNF1α and h36B4 riboprobes. B, Northern analysis was performed using sequentially a mouse HNF1β 32P-labeled cDNA probe and a h36B4 32P-labeled cDNA probe as a control for total RNA loading. C, Western blot analysis was performed using HNF-1 and Cdx2 polyclonal antibodies on similar amounts of total protein extracted at different days of Caco2 cell confluence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then evaluated whether changes in the relative levels of HNF-1 isoforms have a functional effect on the regulation of SI gene transcription. Co-transfection of an HNF-1α expression vector with the −201 to +54 SI promoter construct produced an increase in transcriptional activity of the SI promoter construct in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, expression of HNF-1β led to minimal activation of the construct (Fig.6 A). A point mutation in the SIF3 element that abolishes binding of HNF-1 proteins to the site (10Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) eliminated the positive effect of HNF-1α on the SI promoter (Fig. 6 A). We then tested whether HNF-1β could counter the positive effect of HNF-1α. High amounts of HNF-1β expression vector resulted in decreased activation of the SI promoter construct when a constant amount of HNF-1α was maintained (Fig. 6 B). Nuclear complexes binding to the SIF3 element reflected the increased ratio of HNF-1β to HNF-1α in these co-transfection experiments where the HNF-1α homodimer complex decreased with associated augmentation in both HNF-1α/HNF-1β heterodimer and HNF-1β homodimer complexes (Fig.6 C). Both HNF-1α homodimer and heterodimer complexes were detected in the condition where HNF-1β was co-transfected alone (Fig.6 C, third lane), since Caco2 cells express both endogenous HNF-1α and HNF-1β proteins (Fig.5 C). These results confirm that the ratio of HNF-1 proteins binding to the SIF3 element is critical in the regulation of the SI promoter in intestinal epithelial cells. The epithelium lining the intestine undergoes a complex series of developmental transitions that result in the functional adult intestinal mucosa. Examination of the mechanisms that direct expression of developmentally regulated genes provides a better understanding of these developmental processes. In postnatal development, the suckling-weaning transition is marked by profound changes in intestinal gene expression and epithelial cell function. During this time, there is a marked induction of SI expression, which parallels other important developmental transitions in the intestine and therefore has served as a model for elucidating molecular regulation of developmental events (25Traber P.G. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1998; 353: 911-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our results show that one cis-acting DNA regulatory element is critically important to support SI gene transcription during postnatal development and intestinal epithelial cell differentiation. Moreover, the activity of this regulatory site is dependent on the relative amounts of two related transcription factors, HNF-1α and HNF-1β. Previous work from our laboratory has suggested a role for HNF-1 transcription factors to regulate human SI promoter activity (10Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The use of human nuclear extracts isolated from intestinal cell lines has led to the identification of two different elements, SIF2 and SIF3, both interacting with HNF-1 proteins (6Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10Wu G.D. Chen L. Forslund K. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the SIF3 element strongly reduced mouse SI promoter activity in transgenic mice and Caco-2 cells. HNF-1α-dependent induction of SI promoter activity was strongly reduced when the SIF3 element was disrupted in co-transfection experiments. The current studies show that the SIF2 element is not functionally important for the mouse SI promoter. No specific interaction was found with mouse intestinal nuclear extracts and the mouse SIF2 element, most likely because the second half of the mouse SIF2 element (AACATT) differs from the HNF-1 consensus site (ATTAAC). Moreover, there is one nucleotide difference between the human and mouse genes in the first half-region of the element. Therefore, we conclude that the SIF3 regulatory region solely interacts with HNF1 proteins to regulate mouse SI gene expression at the suckling-weaning transition. The increase of the HNF-1α homodimer complex that binds to the SIF3 regulatory element correlates very well with the induction of SI gene expression both at the suckling-weaning transition (3Tung J. Markowitz A.J. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G83-G92PubMed Google Scholar) and during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Changes in the binding activity of HNF-1α during Caco-2 cell differentiation have also been observed for specific elements found in the human α1-antitrypsin promoter (26Hu C. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1181-G1194PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, Northern analysis showed an increase in the HNF-1α mRNA level during Caco-2 cell differentiation (26Hu C. Perlmutter D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1181-G1194PubMed Google Scholar). We were unable to detect significant change in HNF-1α mRNA and protein levels with the use of two different Caco-2 cell lines. Differences in the nature of the probe and methods used to detect the messenger RNA may explain this discrepancy. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of HNF-1 dimerization and interaction with the chromatin in intestinal epithelial cells must be complex and will require additional studies. One explanation for the increase in HNF-1α homodimers without any important change in HNF-1α protein content is that the decrease in the ratio of HNF-1β to HNF-1α proteins would lead to a redistribution in the composition of HNF1 complexes that interact with the SIF3 element of the SI promoter. There are major differences in the transactivation domains of HNF-1 proteins (16Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). HNF-1β has a positive transcriptional effect on some binding sites such as those in albumin and α-fetoprotein (27Rey-Campos J. Chouard T. Yaniv M. Cereghini S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) or more commonly no functional effect at all, such as in the β-fibrinogen promoter (16Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and the CYP2E1 promoter (28Liu S.Y. Gonzalez F.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the relative abundance of both HNF-1 proteins can affect vitamin-D-binding protein gene transcription (29Song Y.H. Ray K. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28408-28418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of HNF-1β on HNF-1α has been suggested to be dependent on several DNA binding sites where HNF-1β acts as a trans-dominant inhibitor of HNF1-mediated enhancer activity (29Song Y.H. Ray K. Liebhaber S.A. Cooke N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28408-28418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HNF-1β reduces HNF-1α transactivation of the mouse SI promoter may be more complex, since a single DNA interacting site is involved. The transactivation properties of HNF-1α have been shown to rely on physical interactions with multiple coactivator proteins such as CREB-binding protein and CBP-associated factor (30Soutoglou E. Papafotiou G. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the region of HNF-1α necessary to interact with the CBP-associated factor protein is absent in the HNF-1β protein (30Soutoglou E. Papafotiou G. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12515-12520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Changes in the binding of HNF-1 complexes cannot fully explain the specificity of SI expression in the mature enterocyte, since HNF-1α is more abundant than HNF-1β in tissues where the SI gene is not expressed (16Mendel D.B. Hansen L.P. Graves M.K. Conley P.B. Crabtree G.R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1042-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SI promoter activity is equally detected in the mutant SIF3 and the wild-type mSI reporter constructs at the onset of Caco-2 cell differentiation when SI mRNA expression becomes detectable (Fig. 6). The SIF1 DNA regulatory element is crucial for regulation of the SI promoter in cell lines (6Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Wu G.D. Wang W. Traber P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7863-7870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The element contains two binding sites for Cdx proteins, which are able to activate SI promoter transcription via binding to this site. The Cdx regulatory element is likely to be involved in the specificity of SI gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells, because Cdx2 homeodomain protein regulates both proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells (31Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and is restricted to the intestinal epithelium during mouse postnatal development (32Silberg D.G. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). A close interaction between Cdx2 and HNF-1 proteins represents an interesting hypothesis for the spatial and time-dependent regulation of SI gene expression during postnatal development. Such an interaction has been suggested to promote lactase transcriptional activity as demonstrated by in vitro studies (33Mitchelmore C. Troelsen J.T. Spodsberg N. Sjostrom H. Noren O. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In summary, we have showed that the SIF3 cis-acting element is crucial to positively regulate an intestinal specific gene promoterin vivo. We propose that the SIF3 element maintains a pivotal role in the control of SI promoter activity where binding of a predominant HNF-1α homodimer complex promotes the interaction of intestine-specific transcription factors and co-factors with the promoter. Future studies on the in vivo interaction of HNF-1, Cdx2, and co-factors during postnatal development will provide insights to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of intestine-specific gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W1979240121,"We used an autoimmune serum from a patient with discoid lupus erythematosus to clone a cDNA of 2808 base pairs. Its open reading frame of 2079 base pairs encodes a predicted polypeptide of 693 amino acids named CDA1 (<i>c</i>ell<i>d</i>ivision <i>a</i>utoantigen-1). CDA1 has a predicted molecular mass of 79,430 Daltons and a pI of 4.26. The size of the cDNA is consistent with its estimated mRNA size. CDA1 comprises an N-terminal proline-rich domain, a central basic domain, and a C-terminal bipartite acidic domain. It has four putative nuclear localization signals and potential sites for phosphorylation by cAMP and cGMP-dependent kinases, protein kinase C, thymidine kinase, casein kinase II, and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDA1 is phosphorylated in HeLa cells and by cyclin D1/CDK4, cyclin A/CDK2, and cyclin B/CDK1 <i>in vitro</i>. Its basic and acidic domains contain regions homologous to almost the entire human leukemia-associated SET protein. The same basic region is also homologous to nucleosome assembly proteins, testis TSPY protein, and an uncharacterized brain protein. CDA1 is present in the nuclear fraction of HeLa cells and localizes to the nucleus and nucleolus in HeLa cells transfected with CDA1 or its N terminus containing all four nuclear localization signals. Its acidic C terminus localizes mainly to the cytoplasm. CDA1 levels are low in serum-starved cells, increasing dramatically with serum stimulation. Expression of the CDA1 transgene, but not its N terminus, arrests HeLa cell growth, colony numbers, cell density, and bromodeoxyuridine uptake in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of CDA1 to arrest cell growth is abolished by mutation of the two CDK consensus phosphorylation sites. We propose that CDA1 is a negative regulator of cell growth and that its activity is regulated by its expression level and phosphorylation."

Here we identify the Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) as a novel repressor of the collagen type α1(I) (COL1A1) gene. Collagen type I mRNA and protein levels decreased upon overexpression of YB-1 by transfection in NRK fibroblasts. The human, rat, and mouseCOL1A1 promoter −220/+115 contains three putative Y-boxes, one of these sites, designated collagen Y-box element (CYE), includes a Y-box plus an adjacent 3′ inverted repeat. DNase-I footprinting and Southwestern blotting with fibroblast nuclear extract demonstrated binding of several nuclear proteins across the CYE, one of which was identified as YB-1. Recombinant YB-1 bound the CYE sequence in gel shift assays with a preference for single-stranded templates. The entire sequence (−88/−48) was required for high affinity binding. Complex formation of endogenous YB-1 with the CYE was established by supershift studies. COL1A1 promoter-reporter constructs were suppressed up to 80% by cotransfection with YB-1 in a variety of cell types. In addition, CYE conferred YB-1 responsiveness on two heterologous promoters further demonstrating the importance of this repressor region.

J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological processes such as wound healing are dependent on tight spatial and temporal expression of collagen genes by mesenchymal cells, and a broad spectrum of fibrotic conditions is associated with collagen accumulation (2Trojanowska M. LeRoy E.C. Eckes B. Krieg T. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Interstitial collagen type I is a heterotrimeric protein composed of two α1 and one α2 chains encoded by separate genes, collagen α1(I) (COL1A1)1 and α2(I) (COL1A2), that are tightly and coordinately regulated in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner (2Trojanowska M.

A number of regulatory elements required for constitutive and inducible expression have been identified in the promoter and first intron of both the COL1A1 andCOL1A2 genes (2Trojanowska M. LeRoy E.C.

Much of the information on cis-acting elements and their respective binding activities is derived from work on the mouseCOL1A1 gene and, in particular, analysis of sequences between −220 and +115. The proximal promoter region of theCOL1A1 gene is highly conserved between species (7Ravazzolo R. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7382-7387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Known regulatory elements are summarized in Fig. 1 A and include a TATA-box, two regions containing inverted CCAAT sequences, one of which binds CBF (8Maity S.N. Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), as well as binding sites for Sp1 and NF-1/CTF (9Nehls M.C. Rippe R.A. Veloz L. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4065-4073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), c-Krox (10Galera P. Park R.W. Ducy P. Mattei M.G. Karsenty G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4915-4923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The CBF binding site between −100 and −96 has been shown to be required for basal activity, and an inhibitory factor, IF2, binds to sequences flanking this site (1Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 and NF-1 have been shown to bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the two sites located between −105 to −78 and −129 to −110. c-Krox binds preferentially to the purine-rich region (−190 to −170), whereas BFCOL1 shows stronger affinity for the pyrimidine-rich sequences between −160 and −130 (11Hasegawa T. Takeuchi A. Miyaishi O. Isobe K. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4915-4923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Inverted CCAAT-boxes can form the core of binding sites for Y-box binding proteins. The presence of two such regions in theCOL1A1 promoter together with the previously reported finding that YB-1 (also known as dbpB), a prominent member of this family of evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA binding factors, can up-regulate expression of the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) gene in activated mesangial cells (12Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raised the question whether YB-1 might also play a role in regulating COL1A1 expression. YB-1 has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of genes (14Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and may, depending on the cellular context, act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor even of the same gene (15Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Closer inspection of the COL1A1 gene sequences between −220 and +115 revealed a third putative Y-box protein binding site with striking similarity to the YB-1 binding element-1 (RE-1) in the rat MMP-2 promoter (12Mertens P.R.

Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Notably, the homology extended to a 3′ inverted repeat also present in the RE-1 (Fig. 1 C). Based on these homologies, the present study focused on the functionality of this site, which we have designated the collagen Y-box element (CYE). The data show that YB-1 is expressed in the nuclei of collagen-producing fibroblasts and that both recombinant and endogenous YB-1 bind specifically to the sense and antisense strands of the CYE. Furthermore, YB-1 suppresses the activity of the COL1A1promoter through this element. A potential insight into the functional activity of this protein is provided by the observation that YB-1 induced strand separation in the inverted repeat region of CYE, which may prevent or disrupt binding of positive regulatory factors and thereby repress transcriptional activity. Overexpression of YB-1 suppresses endogenous collagen gene expression and protein production. These data identify YB-1 as a novel transcriptional repressor ofCOL1A1 gene expression. The rat renal fibroblast cell line NRK-49F (European Collection of Animal Cell Culture, Porton Down, UK) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin-B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Confluent cells were made quiescent by incubation in 0.5% fetal calf serum for 48 h. A variety of other cell types were used, which, unless otherwise indicated, were maintained as described above: Chinese hamster ovary cells, rat mesangial cells (15Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), mouse 3T3 fibroblasts, and fetal Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat cardiac fibroblasts (passages 6–9 (16Butt R.P. Laurent G.J. Bishop J.E. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 330-335PubMed Google Scholar)). A YB-1 expression vector (pSG5-YB-1) containing the complete human YB-1 open reading frame cloned into the expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) was kindly provided by J.P.-Y. Ting (University of North Carolina). pGLα1–2.3 was constructed by subcloning a fragment containing sequences between −2310 and +115 of the mouse COL1A1 gene originating from the genomic clone pG70 (a gift from J. Rossert, INSERM, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France (1Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) into the HindIII site of pGL3Basic (Promega). The original 3′-end XbaI site was converted to aHindIII site by ligation to a linker, p-CAAGCTTG, and digested with HindIII prior to ligation into pGL3Basic. To create the pGLα1–220 construct containing sequences between −220 and +115, a BglII fragment was excised from pGLα1–2.3, and the plasmid was religated. Sequencing across the cloning sites revealed a discrepancy with the published sequence with an extra G between positions −11 and −12; however, this is not within or close to any putative transcription factor binding site. To avoid confusion with the numbering of transcription factor binding sites described by other investigators, we have used the published base pair numbering to identify regions of interest. The transcriptional start site is from GenBankTM accession number X54876. The sequence up to −1627 is available from GenBankTM, and the location of the 5′-end of pGLα1–2.3 is from an unpublished sequence. 2J. Rossert, personal communication. pColCAT3.6/1.6 (also known as B16) was a gift from A. Lichtler and D. Rowe (University of Connecticut Health Center). The plasmid contains ratCOL1A1 gene sequences between −3518 and +1594. It is identical to B15 (17Breault D.T. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31241-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) except for an EcoRV to ClaI conversion in the polylinker. To create the promoter deletion constructs pColCAT −1.3/+1.6 and −0.4/+1.6, B16 was digested withNheI (−3382) together with Tth111I (−1282) orMunI (−390), respectively, and religated. The intron-less pColCAT −2.3/0 is identical to B47 (17Breault D.T. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31241-31250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) except that it lacks the 5′HindIII fragment between −3544 and −2369 present in B16. A double-stranded oligonucleotide homologous to the −95 to −45 sequence of the mouse COL1A1 promoter, encompassing the entire CYE, was subcloned into the KpnI and BglII sites of pGL2Promoter (Promega) and designated pGL2P-CYE. The oligonucleotide was also cloned between the KpnI and SmaI sites in the pGL3B portion of pGL3-CMV850 (a gift from O. Schwickerath, University College London, UK) after blunting of theBglII site (designated pGL3-CMV850-CYE). This vector exhibits high basal activity in NRK fibroblasts. 3J. T. Norman, unpublished observations. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described in (18Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (T4-PNK; Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and gel-purified. EMSA were performed exactly as described (13Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using recombinant YB-1 (rYB-1) protein (5 ng/binding reaction) or nuclear extracts (5 µg/binding reaction). Recombinant YB-1 was prepared from a pRSET vector (Invitrogen) containing an insert coding for a hexahistidine T7 epitope-YB-1 fusion protein (a gift from Dr. Chien, University of California, San Diego) as described by Mertens et al. (12Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, unlabeled oligonucleotides or nonspecific DNA (500× excess) were added to the binding reaction 15 min prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotides followed by a 30 min incubation period and subsequent separation on polyacrylamide gels. Titration experiments demonstrated that at lower competitor concentrations (100- and 250-fold molar excess) specific competition was incomplete under the chosen conditions. Relative binding affinities were determined by quantitation of shifted bands using a PhosphorImager system (Bio-Rad). For supershift assays, affinity-purified rabbit anti-YB-1 antibody raised against a C-terminal epitope (13Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was added to the nuclear extracts 30 min prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotides, and the binding reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C. In controls non-immune IgG was added. A 32P-labeled probe corresponding to −220/+115 of mouse COL1A1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Briefly, 4 pmol of a forward primer (5′-CCGGGCTCGAGATCTGG-3′), corresponding to vector sequence plus the 5′ 8 bases of the promoter sequence in pGLα1–220, was end-labeled using T4-PNK and [γ-32P]ATP. pGLα1–220 was used as template for a standard polymerase chain reaction using the32P-labeled forward primer, the reverse GLprimer2 (Promega), 1 unit of Red Hot DNA polymerase (Abgene), and 1 mm MgCl2. The DNA probe was gel-purified (QIAquick kit, Qiagen). A 10-bp ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.), end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4-PNK, was used as a molecular weight standard. Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 50 µl. 32P-labeled DNA probe (∼0.1 ng of labeled DNA) was incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature in 20 µl of binding buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 µg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma)). Nuclear extract, prepared as above, was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 25 min. The binding reaction was transferred to a tube containing 2 µl of RQ1 DNase I (0.5–1 unit/reaction, Promega) and 1 µl of 250 mm MgCl2, 250 mmCaCl2 (final concentrations 5 mm). After 3 min at room temperature, the reaction was terminated with 100 µl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 95% formamide buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were electrophoresed on 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, dried, and autoradiographed. A mung bean nuclease (MBN) sensitivity analysis was performed as described previously (12Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32957-32965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The strictly double-stranded, asymmetrically end-labeled probe was prepared by digesting pT4-Luc-CYE Site I withBglII or KpnI, and the resultant overhanging 5′-ends were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4-PNK. The DNA fragment was released by BglII/KpnI digestion and gel-purified. About 105 cpm of probe was included in the binding reaction with either rYB-1 (10 ng) or mesangial cell nuclear proteins (10 µg) at saturating concentrations of MBN enzyme (50 units, Promega) as determined by titration. Southwestern blot analysis was performed as described (15Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using NRK nuclear proteins (50 µg) and 32P-end-labeled CYE oligonucleotide probes (106 cpm/ml). Western blotting with affinity-purified rabbit anti-YB-1 antibody (1:1000) was performed as described by Mertens et al. (15Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22905-22912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using NRK nuclear proteins (30 µg). For Western blot analysis of Southwestern blots, radioactivity was removed by repeated washing in 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol prior to blocking and incubation with anti-YB-1 antibody. For Western blot analysis of collagen type I protein, lysates were prepared from NRK cells 72 h after transfection with pSG5-YB-1 or pSG5. Proteins (30 µg/sample) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted, and probed with an anti-collagen type I antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates Ltd.), diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, followed by ECL detection. NRK fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and NIH3T3 fibroblasts (∼70% confluent) were transfected with purified plasmid DNA (Endotoxin-Free Qiagen Maxi-Prep Kit, Qiagen) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A mixture of collagen promoter-reporter constructs (0.5–2 µg) and the YB-1 (0.1–1.0 µg) expression vector or the pSG5 control vector was co-transfected using 6 µl of LipofectAMINE. The total amount of transfected DNA was equalized by the addition of pSG5 control plasmid. All transfections were carried out in triplicate. At least two different DNA preparations were tested to eliminate potential preparation artifacts. After 12 h, transfection medium was replaced with medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated for 24 to 48 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using passive cell lysis buffer (Promega) for luciferase-reporter constructs or CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for CAT reporter constructs. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and data calculated as units of luciferase/µg of protein (mean ± S.D.). CAT activity was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and data presented as pg of CAT/µg of protein. Protein concentration was measured using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Because many viral promoters are regulated by YB-1, transfection efficiency was measured by the Hirt's assay using [α-32P]dCTP-labeled vector DNA (20Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech-Hansen T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or pEGFP-YB-1 (CLONTECH) and was determined at 50–60% (20Clark I.M. Rowan A.D. Edwards D.R. Bech-Hansen T. Mann D.A. Bahr M.J. Cawston T.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rat cardiac fibroblasts (∼90% confluent) and mesangial cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's instructions using the calcium phosphate Profection mammalian transfection system (Promega) and Tfx-50 (Promega), respectively. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern blotting using an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled collagen α1(I) cDNA probe (Hf677, ATCC) was performed as described previously (21Orphanides C. Fine L.G. Norman J.T. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Total collagen production was measured by reverse phase HPLC as described previously (21Orphanides C. Fine L.G. Norman J.T. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Procollagen production is expressed as nm hydroxyproline/well. Sequence analysis of the region −220 to +115 of the mouse COL1A1 gene (19Swamynathan S.K. Nambiar A. Guntaka R.V.

A comparison with the YB-1 binding element in the rat (RE-1) and human (r1) MMP-2genes (13Mertens P.R. Alfonso-Jaume M.A. Steinmann K. Lovett D.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2480-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Mertens P.R. Harendza S. Pollock A.S. Lovett D.H. J. Biol.

Biol. 1990; 10: 6524-6532Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) revealed striking similarities of Site I (−83 to −72) to the RE-1 with seven consecutive matching bases in the Y-box. Site II showed stronger homology than Site I to the Y-box consensus sequence (22MacDonald G.H. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3527-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) but was more divergent compared with the RE-1. Site III showed a similar degree of homology to the Y-box consensus sequence as Site I but greater divergence compared with the RE-1 (Fig.1 B). In addition, the 3′ sequence adjacent to Site I included an inverted repeat (IR) similar to the one present in the RE-1 (Fig. 1 C). Based on these homologies the present study focused on this region (−83 to −59), which we designated the collagen Y-box element. Comparison of CYE in mouse, rat, and human genes showed strong sequence similarity across this element (Fig.1 D). The rat and mouse COL1A1 genes are identical across this region, although the human promoter is highly homologous with only two mismatches across the Y-box and 1 mismatch in the 3′ portion of the inverted repeat. DNase I footprinting of −220 to +115 of the mouseCOL1A1 gene with nuclear extracts from NRK fibroblasts was performed to determine the sites of protein interaction with the promoter. Six protected regions (A–F) were identified (Fig.2) that lie between −190 and −177 (region A), −177 and −155 (region B), −145 and −135 (region C), −130 and −105 (region D), −95 and −65 (region E), and −65 and −40 (region F). The Y-box of CYE is located within region E, and the IR lies at the boundary between E and F and coincides with a hypersensitive site between −70 and −60 (Fig. 2). Karsenty and de Crombrugghe (1Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

Region A, protected by NRK fibroblast nuclear extract, is identical to the synonymous region reported by these investigators. Our regions C, D, and E all lie within the protected regions previously identified; however, the regions we have designated B and F have not been described previously. For comparison, DNase I footprinting of the −220 to +115 segment with NIH3T3 extracts was also performed (data not shown). When 20–30 µg of NIH3T3 or NRK nuclear proteins were used, the footprints obtained were identical to the published ones (1Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9934-9942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However the addition of higher protein concentrations (48 µg) revealed the additional protected regions described herein. First, a series of DNA binding studies were performed with rYB-1 and oligonucleotides containing the complete CYE sequence (−88 to −48; Table I), both sense (SS1) and antisense (SS2) strands. As has been reported previously, double-stranded probes demonstrated only weak rYB-1 binding activity (data not shown), and therefore these studies focused on single-stranded binding assays. rYB-1 formed several specific complexes with both SS1 and SS2 consisting of closely migrating bands (SS1, lane 1, and SS2, lane 5 in Fig.3 A). Competition experiments were performed with truncated CYE oligonucleotides encompassing either the Y-box (Y, Table I) or the inverted repeat (IR, Table I). Homologous competitor DNA completely blocked rYB-1 binding to the CYE (SS1, lane 4, and SS2, lane 8), whereas competitor oligonucleotides Y and IR only partially inhibited binding. The Y oligonucleotide diminished the fastest migrating bands formed with SS1 and SS2 (lanes 2 and6), whereas the other complexes were unaffected. The IR oligonucleotide did not compete for rYB-1 binding to SS2 (lane 7). Thus, maximal rYB-1 binding to the CYE is dependent on the whole sequence including the Y-box and 3′ adjacent IR. To substantiate this finding, a direct comparison of rYB-1 binding to the SS1 of CYE, Y, and IR was performed (Fig. 3 B). Specific complex formation was observed with Y (compare lane 1 withlanes 4 and 5), whereas IR was not bound by rYB-1 (lane 2). A comparison of the relative binding affinities revealed an ∼10-fold higher affinity of rYB-1 for the complete CYE (lane 3) compared with the Y-box alone (lane 1). These results emphasize the importance of the whole sequence context for high affinity YB-1 binding. To extend this finding and further define the sequence requirements for binding, specific mutations (G to T substitutions) were introduced into the CYE sense strand in either the Y-box (CYEmut1, Table I) or the IR (CYEmut2, Table I). As seen in Fig. 3 C, rYB-1 binding was not, as expected, diminished with the introduced mutations in the Y-box but was even increased. In contrast, binding of rYB-1 to the CYEmut2 oligonucleotide was somewhat weaker than binding to the wild type oligonucleotide. These results emphasize the importance of the whole sequence context for high affinity YB-1 binding and indicate that simple base substitutions in the Y-box sequence do not necessarily result in weaker binding. An oligonucleotide spanning the region −112 to −83 encompassing the Site II Y-box at −100 to +96 (Fig. 1 A) failed to bind rYB-1 (lane 4 in Fig. 3 C). This finding again supports the notion that YB-1 binding not only requires a Y-box but is dependent on more complex sequence determinants, and although Site II displays high homology to the YB-1 binding consensus sequence, it is not a functional binding site for the recombinant protein.Table ICYE oligonucleotidesSequences for the sense (SS1) and antisense (SS2) oligonucleotides spanning the CYE (−88 to −48) showing the Y-box (bold) and the 3′ inverted repeat (bold italics, arrows). Oligonucleotides spanning the Y-box (Y), inverted repeat (IR), and with mutations were sense oligonucleotides.Figure 3R"

The machinery that regulates proper oligomerization and autoactivation of procaspase-8 and/or procaspase-10 during T lymphocyte activation determines whether the cells will undergo caspase-mediated apoptosis or proliferation. We screened a yeast two-hybrid library by using the DEDs contained in the prodomains of procaspase-8 and procaspase-10 and isolated a DED-associated factor (DEDAF) that interacts with several DED-containing proteins but does not itself contain a DED. DEDAF is highly conserved between human and mouse (98% amino acid identity) and is homologous to a nuclear regulatory protein YAF-2. DEDAF is expressed at the highest levels in lymphoid tissues and placenta. DEDAF interacts with FADD, procaspase-8, and procaspase-10 in the cytosol as well as with the DED-containing DNA-binding protein (DEDD) in the nucleus. At the cell membrane, DEDAF augmented the formation of CD95-FADD-caspase-8 complexes and enhanced death receptor- as well as DED-mediated apoptosis. In the nucleus, DEDAF caused the DEDD protein to relocalize from subnuclear structures to a diffuse distribution in the nucleoplasm. Our data therefore suggest that DEDAF may be involved in the regulation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear events of apoptosis.

CD95 (also known as FAS/APO-1) is a trimeric type I transmembrane receptor in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily with a cytoplasmic tail that harbors a death domain (DD) that promotes DISC formation (2Itoh N.

Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In the case of CD95-induced apoptosis, there are at least three components that form the DISC (1Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar), including the CD95 cytoplasmic tail, an adapter molecule FADD/Mort-1, and caspase-8 and/or -10. The aggregation of the caspase-8 zymogen leads to autoactivation of this protease which triggers downstream apoptosis events (4Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Martin D.A. Siegel R.M. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). FADD/Mort-1 is a cytoplasmic adapter protein that has a C-terminal DD that forms a homotypic interaction with CD95 and an N-terminal death effector domain (DED) that can homotypically associate with DED-containing caspases (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Under appropriate conditions, FADD is recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of CD95 through a homotypic association between the DDs of CD95 and FADD. Procaspase-8 and procaspase-10 are two aspartate-requiring cysteine proteases that are each composed of two DED domains and a caspase domain that contains the large and small subunits of the protease. Again homophilic interactions between the DEDs of FADD and procaspase-8/procaspase-10 allow these caspases to be recruited into DISC and undergo proteolytic autoactivation which causes apoptosis (7Boldin M.P.

The DED has a characteristic structure composed of a bundle of six highly conserved α-helices (10Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This tertiary structure is shared by two other homophilic interaction domains involved in apoptosis signaling, the “caspase recruitment domain” (CARD) and the “death domain” (DD), despite the low level of amino acid similarity between these domains (11Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The CARD domain is found in the N-terminal domain of a subset of caspases as well as adapter proteins that are involved in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. The DD is found in the cytoplasmic domains of death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily as well as the various adapter proteins such as FADD, TRADD, and RIP that interact with these receptors. These domains are typically encoded by a single exon. Thus, these domains may have been derived from a common prototype domain that has become specialized in evolution for different cellular functions including apoptosis, activation, and inflammatory response (12Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). DEDs have a pivotal role in apoptosis signaling interactions and can bind viral and cellular proteins that contain DEDs that inhibit apoptosis. Therefore new molecules that interact with DED-containing proteins are good candidates for playing novel roles in regulating apoptosis and other cellular functions. Recently, a DED-containing DNA-binding protein (DEDD) was identified (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It has been shown that DEDD resides in cytoplasm but can be found to translocate into nucleus after CD95 stimulation and caspase activation. DEDD does not associate with the DISC; however, its nuclear translocalization is toxic to cells. DEDD localizes to the nucleolus and can associate with the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery. DEDD also has the ability to bind to DNA with no apparent sequence specificity. By protein sequence comparison, DEDD is likely to contain the same prototypical six α-helical domains as the DED of FADD, caspase-8, and -10. It is therefore interesting to examine whether other nuclear factors can regulate the function of DEDD. To search for new molecules that potentially regulate death receptor-mediated apoptosis, we used the DED domains of procaspase-8 and procaspase-10 as molecular baits to screen human cDNA libraries by the yeast two-hybrid system. A novel protein, the DED-associated factor (DEDAF) that associates with DED-containing proteins but does not itself contain a DED was identified and analyzed. The human DEDAF protein is composed of 228 amino acids and is almost identical to mouse RYBP (Ring-1- and YY-1-binding protein) which is a 228-amino acid basic protein (14Garcia E. Marcos-Gutierrrez C. del Mar Lorente M. Mareno J.C. Vidal M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3404-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). RYBP shares 75.6% similarity and 69.4 identity with another nuclear factor YAF2 (YY-1-associated factor 2) at the protein level. Expressed as a nuclear protein, YAF2 itself does not bind DNA, but it regulates the transcription of multiple genes through its association with the transcription factor YY-1 (Yin-Yang 1) and other components of the polycomb complex (14Garcia E. Marcos-Gutierrrez C. del Mar Lorente M. Mareno J.C. Vidal M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3404-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that DEDAF is a general regulator of DED proteins since it interacts with the DEDs of caspase-8 and -10 in the cytosol, as well as with DEDD in the nucleus. Overexpression of DEDAF in mammalian cells enhances CD95-mediated, as well as DED-mediated apoptosis. Human cDNA was made from a pool of mRNA derived from resting and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. The cDNA was linked into the HybriZAP vector and converted to a pAD-GAL4 library according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The yeast strain YRG-2 was transformed with pBD-C8/C10.DED by the alkali-cation method (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA) and selected with growth medium lacking tryptophan. The bait-transfected YRG-2 cells were subsequently transfected with the human T cell-derived pAD-GAL4 library and selected with tryptophan-, leucine-, and depleted histidine-medium for 5 days. Selected colonies were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to a β-galactosidase assay according to Stratagene's instruction manual. Plasmids were retrieved from the positive clones by glass bead vortexing methods (15Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). The protein interactions were verified by switching between the bait and prey constructs and then checking their “drop-out” resistance and induction of β-galactosidase activity. Inserts from the verified plasmids were sequenced and searched in the NCBI GenBank™ database (16Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Human multiple tissue blots were obtained from CLONTECH. Northern blotting assay was performed according to the manufacturer's manual using human DEDAF full-length cDNA as the probe that was labeled with 32P by Ready-To-GoTM beads following the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human T cell lymphoma Jurkat-T and H9 cells were cultured in EHAA (Biofluid, Rockville, MD) complete medium. A 20% fetal calf serum medium was used to culture cells the day before transfection. Stable DEDAF expressing lines were generated by transfecting Jurkat-T and H9 cells with pCIneo-DEDAF and selecting with 500 µg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). HeLa, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and human embryonic kidney tumor line 293T cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's complete medium and kept at 50–70% confluence for transfection. Suspension cells were transfected by the electroporation method as described previously (5Martin D.A. Siegel R.M. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The adherent cells were mostly transfected by using “Fugene 6” reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Mammalian expression plasmids were constructed onto pCIneo backbone (Promega) by PWO (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) polymerase chain reaction using primers flanking with either AU1 or HA epitope tag sequences and appropriate restriction sites. pDEDAF:GFP and pCasp-10.DED:RFP was constructed in pEGFP.N1 and pDs.Red.N1 backbones (CLONTECH), respectively. DEDAF antisense expressing construct was made by inserting the DEDAF-coding sequence into the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA3(−) (Invitrogen). Anti-human CD95 CH11 and APO-1.3 were obtained from Kamiya Biomedical, Thousand Oaks, CA; anti-epitope tag antibodies AU1 and the purified and FITC-labeled HA.11 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Babco/Covance. Unconjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody was fromRoche Molecular Biochemicals and the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 was from Sigma. Anti-FADD antibody (A431) was purchased from the BD Transduction Laboratories. The transfected 293T cells were cultured for 40 h in presence of 50 µm benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD to prevent apoptosis. Harvested cells were lysed by TNTG lysis buffer (30 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 8 °C by appropriate antibodies and buffer-balanced protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The immunoprecipitated beads were washed with TNTG buffer and subjected to 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. For immunoprecipitation of nuclear proteins from cell extracts, the transfected 293T cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and tumbled for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were sonicated and cleared of debris by centrifuging at 4 °C with 14,000 ×g. To immunoprecipitate DEDAF, the extracts were first precleared with 10 µg of normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) bound to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and then tumbled with 10 µg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose was washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in reducing sample buffer. Lysates of DEDD/DEDAF double-transfected cells and their immunoprecipitates were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel-separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed at room temperature for 2 h with specific first antibodies as indicated and appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, along with 5 rounds of a 5-min PBS-T (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) wash after each antibody probing. The probed NC membranes were then developed using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent system (Pierce). Immunofluorescence microscopy was described previously (17Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa or CHO cells were cultured on 12-mm circular cover glass with appropriate media reaching 50–70% confluence. The cells were transfected with HA-tagged DEDAF derivative plasmids using Fugene 6 reagent and cultured for 24 h. The nuclear dye Hoechst 33342 (1 µg/ml) was added into culture for 1 h, and the cells were fixed at −20 °C for 15 min with methanol. The cells were washed twice by PBT buffer (PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Tween 20) and then stained with 1 µg/ml FITC-HA.11 epitope antibody in PBT buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The stained cells were washed twice with PBT buffer and briefly rinsed with water before mounting onto slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for fluorescence microscopy. For immunofluorescence analysis of DEDAF/DEDD interactions, 293T cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged DEDAF and 3′-FLAG-tagged DEDD by using the calcium precipitation method as described previously (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on poly-prep slides (Sigma), transfected, washed three times with PBS, 1 mmMgCl2, and fixed with methanol:acetone (1:1) at −20 °C for 4 min. The slides were allowed to dry, rehydrated with PBS, and incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (8 µg/ml). After washing three times with PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, the slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology) (1:200) for 1 h at room temperature, again washed three times with PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, and placed in distilled water and 100% ethanol for a few seconds. After drying, coverslips were mounted onto the slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The stainings were analyzed and documented using an Axiovert S100 immunofluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with an Axiocam digital camera and software (Zeiss). Jurkat and H9 lymphoma cells were transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids along with marker plasmid pSRα-H-2Ld by electroporation as described previously (5Martin D.A. Siegel R.M. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 8 ml of EHAA complete medium for 16–20 h. Live cells were obtained through Ficoll gradient centrifugation. For apoptosis assays, 2.5 × 105/ml of cells were treated with the indicated doses of anti-CD95 (CH11) antibody for 6–10 h. The DEDAF stably transfected Jurkat and H9 lines were directly treated with anti-CD95 or TRAIL. The harvested cells were stained with annexin V-FITC, anti-H-Ld-PE (PharMingen), and propidium iodide (Sigma). The CD95-mediated and spontaneous apoptosis was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis under constant time acquisition mode (30 s/sample). The propidium iodide-excluded H-2 Ld-positive population was analyzed for annexin V-positive (apoptotic) and -negative (live) correspondingly (the % loss of transfected live cells is shown in Fig. 5). To identify molecules that interact with DEDs and potentially regulate the activity of procaspases-8 and -10, we fused cDNA sequences of GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) with the sequences coding for the DEDs of procaspase-8 and procaspase-10 (Fig. 1A). The fusion pBD-GAL4 constructs were used as the baits to screen a yeast two-hybrid library that derived from activated human lymphocytes. The library represents 5 × 106 independent clones. More than 2 million individual colonies were screened through six transformations. Positive clones were selected under Trp−, Leu−, His− triple-deleted media and subjected to a β-galactosidase assay. The positive clones were verified through re-transformation using switched bait and prey constructs, re-selected by depletion medium, and re-analyzed by a β-galactosidase assay. Five groups of DED-interactive molecules were isolated as follows: DEDAF (2 hits from screening by the long isoform of caspase-10 DED), FADD (2 hits from caspase-8 DED screening), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9, 39 hits from screening by the long isoforms of both caspase-8 and caspase-10 DED), and 2 other groups that are currently under investigation. 2L.-X. Zheng and M. J. Lenardo, unpublished data. One DEDAF clone spanned a 1.04-kb sequence that encoded an open reading frame for 228 amino acids. As shown in Fig. 1, BLAST analysis against the non-redundant data base at National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) revealed that this DEDAF clone is a novel full-length cDNA that shares 75.6% similarity and 69.4% identity with mouse YAF2 (18Kalenik J.L. Chen D. Bradley M.E. Chen S.J. Lee T.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) at the protein level. Human DEDAF protein is also 98.7% identical to mouse RYBP, a mouse protein that interacts with YAF2 and RING protein (14Garcia E. Marcos-Gutierrrez C. del Mar Lorente M. Mareno J.C. Vidal M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3404-3418Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, DEDAF is likely to be the human homologue of this protein. The human DEDAF protein contains 228 residues by conceptual translation and has an estimated molecular mass of 25 kDa. There is a C2-C2 zinc finger motif at the N terminus (Fig. 1 B). We found a ubiquitous tissue distribution for DEDAF mRNA as detected by dot blot analysis using the Human RNA Master BlotTM from CLONTECH (data not shown). Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissues revealed a 4.5-kb transcript with abundant expression in placenta and lymphoid tissues, suggesting a predominant expression in hematopoietic cells (Fig.1 C). Sequence contig analysis against the nucleotide data base from NCBI assembled a 4.5-kb sequence that correlates with the observed size in Northern blots. A 4.5-kb DNA was also obtained by nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, which confirms the result from Northern blot (data not shown). By using BLAST search against the newly available Human Genome Draft data base, DEDAF was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p12–13). The locus sequence revealed two small 5′-exons followed by a giant intron (67 kb) and three additional protein-coding exons. The DEDAF transcript has a long 3′-untranslated region. To confirm the interactions between caspase-10 DEDs and DEDAF in mammalian cells, we cotransfected 293T cells with AU1 epitope-tagged procaspase-10, AU epitope-tagged DEDs of caspase-10, and HA epitope-tagged DEDAF and then performed immunoprecipitation/Western blotting analysis. This transfection showed that, indeed, the DEDAF cDNA encoded a 25-kDa protein (correcting for the epitope tag) that coprecipitated with caspase-10 (Fig. 2A, lane 2, top panel). We also observed that DEDAF interacts with FADD and caspase-8 through their DEDs (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Moreover, DEDAF specifically associated with the DEDs of caspase-10 (see below). Since a significant portion of DEDAF is expressed within the nucleus, we tested whether DEDAF also bound DEDD, a DED protein that was recently shown also to be mainly expressed in the nucleus under these conditions (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). DEDAF also associates with DEDD (Fig.2 C). A point mutation within DEDD (F47Y) resulted in strongly diminished binding to DEDAF (Fig. 2 C). Phenylalanine 47 lies within the N-terminal DED of DEDD. It has been shown previously that the replacement of the analogous conserved phenylalanine in the DED of FADD (F25Y) resulted in a reduced association between FADD and caspase-8 (10Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In all experiments we carefully tested whether each coexpressed protein would affect the expression levels, and conditions were chosen that ensured similar expression. The data support the notion that DEDAF could regulate DED-containing proteins. To map the DED interaction region of DEDAF, we tested a series of N- and C-terminal truncation mutants of DEDAF (see Fig.3A) for their ability to associate with DEDs of caspase-10 in 293T cells. We found that the DEDAF association with caspase-10 DEDs was lost in the DEDAF-(1–144) deletion mutant and greatly reduced in the DEDAF-(45–227) and DEDAF-(67–227) truncations, indicating that the DED interaction site is likely in the central portion of the DEDAF molecule (Fig. 3 B). To study the cellular expression pattern of DEDAF, the N-terminal HA-tagged proteins of DEDAF and its mutants were expressed in 293T and CHO cells that were then examined by fluorescence microscopy. Similar results were obtained in both cell lines. A typical DEDAF expression pattern is shown in Fig.4A. By using the Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining dye that defines nuclei, we observed that the majority of wild-type DEDAF protein is expressed in the nucleus as spread dots, although there is also evidence of DEDAF in the cytoplasm. However, the C-terminal truncated mutants, DEDAF-(1–112) and -(1–144), adopted a diffused and non-nuclear pattern as shown in the lower panels of Fig. 4 A (for DEDAF-(1–144)). These data indicate that the C terminus of DEDAF is essential for nuclear localization. We then transfected 293T cells with pDEDAF.wt:GFP and pCasp.10-DED:RFP and examined their fluorescent protein expression (Fig. 4 B). The result shows that caspase-10 DED is expressed in a unique perinuclear filamentous structure that was previously reported for the caspase-8 DEDs (17Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We also noticed that the nuclear dotted DEDAF expression was dramatically altered when caspase-10 DEDs were coexpressed, in a manner indicating that the cells were undergoing apoptosis. There appears to be partial colocalization of the two molecules at the perinuclear region as shown by bright yellow overlap regions in the aligned picture (lower right panel of Fig. 4 B). It was obvious however, that the overexpressed DEDAF and caspase-10 DEDs do not completely colocalize in the cells. DEDD is not toxic until it is translocated into the nucleus and localizes to nucleoli-like structures (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 3O. Schickling and M. E. Peter, unpublished data. To examine the potential of DEDAF to regulate DEDD, we cotransfected DEDD with either wild-type or mutant DEDAF and then examined the expression pattern of DEDD. We found that coexpression of DEDD with wild-type DEDAF changed the localization of DEDD within the nucleus. In the presence of DEDAF, DEDD was found in the nucleoplasm and not in the nucleoli-like structures (Fig. 4 C). This effect was even more pronounced when DEDAF was coexpressed with N-DEDD (a truncated DEDD mutant containing only the DED flanked by two of the three nuclear localization signals found in DEDD (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (data not shown)), suggesting that DEDAF interacts with the DED in DEDD, which is consistent with the coimmunoprecipitation results of DEDD and its DED mutant F47Y as shown in Fig. 2 B. Therefore, the data suggest that DEDAF might be an interaction partner for nuclear DEDD and support the notion that DEDAF is a protein that has the ability generally to bind to DED proteins both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Moreover, the expression of DEDAF may control the subnuclear localization of DEDD and may thereby regulate the activity of DEDD to inhibit RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription that is controlled by DEDD.3 Cross-linking CD95 does not trigger formation of the DISC in 293T cells that express barely detectable endogenous CD95, FADD, and caspase-8. However, we observed a greatly augmented DISC formation when DEDAF and procaspase-8 were coexpressed (Fig.5 A). We also noticed that DEDAF could substantially increase the interactions between FADD and procaspase-8 (data not shown). These results suggest that DEDAF may be involved in regulation of DISC formation through enhancing FADD/caspases-8 or -10 association. To test the role of DEDAF in death receptor-mediated apoptosis, Jurkat and H9 cells were transiently transfected with pHA.DEDAF, a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven DEDAF expression plasmid. We found that overexpression of DEDAF consistently rendered these T lymphoma cells more susceptible to anti-CD95-induced apoptosis. Similar phenomena were observed when examining the apoptosis response of Jurkat and H9 cells stably transfected with DEDAF to anti-CD95 stimulation (Fig. 5,B and C). However, overexpression of DEDAF-(1–144), a C-terminal truncation mutant that lost its nuclear expression pattern and its association with the DED of caspase-10 (Fig.3 B), does not seem to interfere with anti-CD95-induced death in Jurkat cells (data not shown). We also found that apoptosis stimulated by TRAIL, another member of the tumor necrosis factor gene superfamily, was similarly enhanced (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed that the expression of DEDAF antisense RNA could substantially (20%) inhibit anti-CD95-induced death in H9 cells (Fig.5 D). We have previously reported that overexpression of isolated caspase-8 DEDs could cause the formation of the death effector filaments that trigger HeLa cell apoptosis (17Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To test the role of DEDAF on the DED-induced apoptosis, we cotransfected HeLa cells with DEDAF and caspase-10 DEDs expressing plasmids. Our data suggest that DEDAF overexpression alone has little effect on the viability of the transfected cells; however, a substantial dose-dependent enhancement of DED-mediated apoptosis was observed when caspase-10 DEDs and DEDAF were coexpressed (Fig. 5, E and F). The “death effector domain” (DED) is one form of the prototypical protein interaction domain that governs apoptosis pathways, and DED-containing molecules play important roles in death receptor-mediated apoptosis (19Hofmann K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1113-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). FADD as an adapter protein contains one DED and serves to oligomerize procaspase-8, procaspase-10, and FLIP during death ligand occupancy of their receptors by recruiting these molecules to the DISC complex (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar, 20Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S.

Procaspase-8, procaspase-10, and cFLIP all have two DED domains and are involved in regulating the auto-cleavage and activation of a caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis (7Boldin M.P.

There are virus-encoded DED proteins that are capable of blocking caspase activation (23Bertin J. Armstrong R.C. Ottilie S. Martin D.A. Wang Y. Banks S. Wang G.H. Senkevich T.G. Alnemri E.S. Moss B. Lenardo M.J. Tomaselli K.J. Cohen J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1172-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). All these facts point to the idea that oligomerization of the DED-containing caspases is required for an irreversible execution of death signals. However, it remains unclear how this process is regulated. We have identified DEDAF as a protein that interacts directly with the DEDs of FADD, procaspase-8, procaspase-10, and DEDD through a non-homotypic mechanism. By using 293T cells that have a very low level of endogenous CD95 and FADD expression, we found that DEDAF promotes CD95/FADD/caspase-8 association (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). This correlates with its ability to enhance CD95-induced DISC formation. DEDAF augments CD95- and TRAIL receptor-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent pattern (Fig. 5, B andC and data not shown). Furthermore, we also observed that DEDAF antisense expression substantially protects H9 cells from CD95-induced apoptosis. Thus, DEDAF is potentially a positive regulator of DISC formation and enhances death signals mediated by death receptors at the cell membrane. Recent studies suggest that the DEDs may have functions besides mediating classical CD95-induced apoptosis (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I.

We have previously reported that overexpression of DED-containing molecules could cause formation of the perinuclear death filaments that correlate well with apoptosis induction (17Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our recent data show that expression of the DED domains of caspase-10 could potently kill caspase-8-deficient Jurkat lymphoma cells through CD95 pathway, and this DED-mediated cell death is hardly inhibitable by the pan caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD suggesting it may not involve caspases.2 Furthermore, mammalian DED proteins could cause bacterial cell death by increasing reactive oxygen species (24Lee S.W. Ko Y.G. Bang S. Kim K.S. Kim S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1540-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All these results indicate that DED proteins may participate in a distinct apoptosis pathway that needs to be clarified. We observed that coexpression of DEDAF and the prodomain of caspase-10 enhanced DED-mediated cell death (Fig. 5, E and F), indicating that DEDAF may also be involved in this alternative pathway. DEDAF is a nuclear protein with an inhomogeneous dotted expression pattern as detected by fluorescent microscopy of the DEDAF:GFP fusion protein in transfected 293T, HeLa, and Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Further truncation analysis indicates that this nuclear pattern correlates with its ability to associate the DED domains of procaspase-8 and procaspase-10. Mutants that lose the nuclear expression pattern also lose their association with caspase-10 DED (Fig. 3 B and Fig. 4 A). Moreover, DEDAF does not contain any obvious nuclear localization signals. However, when transiently overexpressed, it significantly localizes to the nucleus. In stable transfectants we found DEDAF expressed in the cytosol and the nucleus pointing to a function in both compartments (data not shown). DEDAF could therefore interact with both cytoplasmic and nuclear DED proteins. DEDD has been found to be expressed in the nucleus and may regulate RNA polymerase I transcription as well as nuclear apoptosis (13Stegh A.H. Schickling O. Ehret A. Scaffidi C. Peterhansel C. Hofmann T.G. Grummt I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5974-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We have observed that DEDAF mutants lacking the typical nuclear expression pattern lose their abilities to retain DEDD in nucleoplasm (Fig.4 C). Therefore, DEDAF could regulate DEDD function by its interaction with the DED. Our data suggest that DEDAF associates with nuclear and cytoplasmic DED-containing molecules, promotes CD95-mediated DISC formation, and augments death receptors as well as DED-induced apoptosis. The direct interactions between DEDAF and these DED-containing molecules suggest that DEDAF regulates distinct events in the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Here, we further characterized the core CaM and Gβγ binding sequences. In contrast to a previous report, we find that the CaM binding motif localized in the N-terminal region of the cytoplasmic tail domain of mGluR 7 is conserved in the related group III mGluRs 4A and 8 and allows these receptors to also bind Ca2+/CaM. Mutational analysis of the Ca2+/CaM binding motif is consistent with group III receptors containing a conventional CaM binding site formed by an amphipathic α-helix. Substitutions adjacent to the core CaM target sequence selectively prevent Gβγ binding, suggesting that the CaM-dependent regulation of signal transduction involves determinants that overlap with but are different from those mediating Gβγ recruitment. In addition, we present evidence that Gβγ uses distinct nonoverlapping interfaces for interaction with the mGluR 7 C-terminal tail and the effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase II, respectively. Although Gβγ-mediated signaling is abolished in receptors lacking the core CaM binding sequence, α subunit activation, as assayed by agonist-dependent GTPγS binding, was not affected. This suggests that Ca2+/CaM may alter the mode of group III mGluR signaling from mono- (α) to bidirectional (α and βγ) activation of downstream effector cascades.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors, such as AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors are involved in fast neurotransmission. In contrast, G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)1have been implicated in the short and long term modulation of synaptic transmission within many pathways of the brain. In particular, activation of mGluRs may regulate neuronal development and survival, transmitter release, electrical excitability, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation (1Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1031-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 2Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 3Conn P.J.

Okada M. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). At least eight different mGluR subtypes have been identified by molecular cloning. Based on sequence homology, pharmacology, and signal transduction mechanisms in heterologous expression systems, these receptors are classified into three groups. Group I receptors (mGluRs 1 and 5) are linked to phospholipase C, whereas members of the groups II (mGluRs 2 and 3) and III (mGluRs 4, 6, 7, and 8) couple to the cAMP signaling pathway. However, this effector coupling may not be stringent, since in cerebellar neurons mGluR 7-mediated inhibition of P/Q type calcium channels involves phospholipase C (5Perroy J. Prezeau L. de Ward M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The different groups of mGluRs not only use distinct signaling pathways but also display different subcellular localizations. Group I mGluRs are predominantly postsynaptic receptors located at perisynaptic membrane areas. Group II receptors can be found pre- as well as postsynaptically and appear to be distributed over the surface of axons and dendrites. Members of group III mGluRs are primarily presynaptic and concentrated at or near active zones (6Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 7Shigemoto R. Kulik A. Roberts J.D. Ohishi H. Nusser Z. Kaneko T. Somogyi P. Nature. 1996; 381: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 8Cartmell J. Schoepp D.D,. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 889-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). This selective localization of mGluRs to discrete subcellular domains has an important impact on receptor signaling. First, restricting expression to the pre- or postsynaptic compartment will define the sites at which mGluRs regulate synaptic transmission. Second, receptor distance from release sites will determine how readily the receptors are confronted by activating concentrations of glutamate. Finally, their precise subcellular localization will regulate the receptors' proximity to target ion channels, the transmitter release machinery, and/or enzyme cascades that regulate synaptic function. The relevance of such precise topological arrangements for the synaptic function of mGluRs is highlighted by the group III receptor, mGluR 7. This low affinity receptor is selectively targeted to presynaptic transmitter release sites, enabling it to sense high levels of released glutamate. This in turn allows for rapid autoinhibition of the neighboring Ca2+ channels, whose opening triggers neurotransmitter release (7Shigemoto R. Kulik A. Roberts J.D. Ohishi H. Nusser Z. Kaneko T. Somogyi P. Nature. 1996; 381: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Axon targeting of mGluR 7 has been shown to involve the cytoplasmic C terminus of the receptor (10Stowell J.N. Craig A.M. Neuron. 1999; 22: 525-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the formation of presynaptic clusters of mGluR 7 is also mediated by this C-terminal tail, which provides a binding motif for PICK1 (protein interacting with Ckinase; Refs. 11Boudin H.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the interaction with PICK1 was found to be essential for clustering, but not for axonal targeting, of mGluR 7 (11Boudin H. Doan A. Xia J. Shigemoto R. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Craig A.M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 485-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), PICK1 binding did not influence effector regulation via this receptor (12El Far O. Airas J.M. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R.B. Karschin A. Betz H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4215-4221PubMed Google Scholar). Different lines of evidence indicate that the C-terminal portion of mGluR 7 is essential for signal transduction. First, this region binds Gβγ subunits, which mediate Ca2+ channel closure and inhibition of neurotransmitter release (14Herlitze S. Garcia D.E. Mackie K. Hille B. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 15Ikeda S.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Second, Ca2+/CaM binding to this region of the receptor promotes G protein-mediated signaling by displacing Gβγ subunits from the C-terminal tail (9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Third, binding of Ca2+/CaM prevents phosphorylation of the C terminus by protein kinase C (16Nakajima Y. Yamamoto T. Nakayama T. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27573-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a reaction that may underlie receptor desensitization (17Macek T.A. Schaffhauser H. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6138-6146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of mGluR 7 may also be hindered by PICK1 binding (13Dev K.K. Nakajima Y. Kitano J. Braithwaite S.P. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further elucidate how the C terminus of mGluR 7 interacts with the various signaling components mentioned above, we investigated the determinants that mediate binding of the mGluR 7 C-tail to both Ca2+/CaM and Gβγ subunits. Previously, we and others have found that PICK1 interacts with the last three amino acids of the mGluR C-tail (11Boudin H. Doan A. Xia J. Shigemoto R. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Craig A.M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 485-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 12El Far O. Airas J.M. Wischmeyer E. Nehring R.B. Karschin A. Betz H. Eur. J.

Here, we show that Ca2+/CaM and Gβγ bind to partially overlapping domains located at the N-terminal part of the mGluR 7 C-tail. This region is conserved in the related group III receptors, mGluR 4A and mGluR 8A and 8B, which are also shown to interact with Ca2+/CaM. Mutations that prevent CaM binding selectively inhibit mGluR 7 signaling through Gβγ subunits but do not affect trimeric G-protein recruitment to the receptor. Our data are consistent with Ca2+/CaM causing group III mGluRs to switch from mono- (Gα) to bidirectional (Gα and Gβγ) signaling. EcoRI andSalI site flanked cDNA fragments encoding the C-terminal regions of mGluR 4A, 7A, 7B, 8A, and 8B, respectively, were generated by standard polymerase chain reactions on mouse brain cDNA using procedures similar to those described in Ref. 9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar. The polymerase chain reaction products were inserted in pGEX-5 × 1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mGluR 4B and 6 C-terminal tail regions were amplified using mGluR 4 and mGluR 6 full-length cDNAs (kindly provided by Dr. S. Nakanishi, University of Kyoto, Japan). Due to insolubility of mGluR 4B as a GST fusion protein, the cDNA sequences encoding the mGluR 7A and mGluR 4B C-terminal tails were introduced into the pMAL-c2 vector (New England Biolabs) to produce soluble maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion tails. The following truncated and mutated tail regions of mGluR 7A were also generated by polymerase chain reaction and fused to GST: mGluR 7A-N38 (GST-7A-N38), mGluR 7A-C27 (GST-7A-C27), mGluR 7A-N25 (GST-7A-N25), mGluR 7A-N25-Q857A (GST-N25-Q857A), mGluR 7A-R859E (GST-7A-R859E), mGluR 7A-R861P (GST-7A-R861P), mGluR 7A-F863A (GST-7A-F863A), mGluR 7A-M872A (GST-7A-M872A), mGluR 7A-M872E (GST-7A-M872E), mGluR 7A-N25-K860E (GST-N25-K860E), mGluR 7A-N25-S862E (GST-N25-S862E), mGluR 7A-N25-S862A (GST-N25-S862A), mGluR 7A-N25-K864E/A865E/V866E (GST-N25–3E), mGluR 7A-N25-F863E/K864E/A865E/V866E (GST-N25–4E), mGluR 7A-N25-S862E/T868E/T871E/S873E (GST-N25–4X), and mGluR 7A-ΔCaM (GST-7A-ΔCaM), where residues 864–876 (KAVVTAATMSSRL) were deleted. All amplification products were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Expression of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (Stratagene) was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–5 h. After passage through a French press, the 100,000 × g supernatants containing the soluble fusion proteins were kept frozen (−76 °C) until use. GST fusion protein binding to CaM-agarose (Sigma) was performed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA, respectively. For every binding reaction, 20 µl of CaM-agarose were preequilibrated in the corresponding binding buffer (+CaCl2 or +EGTA) and incubated in the presence of either CaCl2 or EGTA with 0.5 ml of 100,000 × gsupernatant prepared from bacterial extracts containing ∼0.2 mg/ml GST fusion protein. After 2 h of rotary agitation at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml each of the corresponding binding buffer prior to elution with SDS sample buffer. Binding of purified CaM to GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was performed as described (9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Eluates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12 or 15% gels and examined after Coomassie Blue staining. Native mGluR 7 (or mGluR 4A) was solubilized from rat hippocampal (or cerebellar) synaptosomal membranes that were prewashed with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mmKCI, protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Diagnostics)), containing a 1 mm concentration each of EDTA and EGTA. Stripped membranes were centrifuged at 30,000 × g and solubilized in binding buffer containing 1.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the extract was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1.5 mg of CaM-agarose. After removing unbound material, the beads were divided and washed three times with binding buffer containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 and either 5 mmEGTA or 1 mm CaCl2. Bound material was eluted with SDS sample buffer, and fractions were processed for Western blotting with mGluR 7 antibody, a generous gift from Dr. R. Shigemoto (National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan), or mGluR 4A antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Fluorescence spectra were recorded in a Hitachi F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer under continuous stirring at room temperature in a final volume of 0.2 to 0.25 ml. Dansyl-CaM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was diluted in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2to final concentrations between 0.1 and 0.8 µm (where indicated, nominally Ca2+-free solution was used). The excitation wavelength was 350 nm; the emission monochromator was changed at a rate of 200 nm/s between 400 and 600 nm. Subsequently, GST-7A, GST-7A-N25, or an equivalent concentration of GST were added in 2–5-µl aliquots to generate cumulative concentration-response curves in the concentration range from 0.1 to 4 µm. Data were fitted to the Hill equation by curvilinear regression to estimate EC50 values for GST-7A and for GST-7A-N25. At each dansyl-CaM concentration, three independent concentration-response curves were obtained using different preparations of both recombinant fusion proteins, and dansyl-CaM. EC50 values are given as means ± S.D. G proteins were solubilized from porcine brain membranes using the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS; βγ dimers were chromatographically resolved from the α-subunits (18Nanoff C. Waldhoer M. Roka F. Freissmuth M. Neuropharmacol. 1997; 36: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins or GST (20 µg/reaction) were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (50 µl of preequilibrated 1:1 slurry) in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, and 8 mm CHAPS. After three washes, the beads were incubated with purified G protein βγ-subunits (80 pmol/reaction) for 2 h at 4 °C in 100 µl of buffer. Where indicated, either 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm CaCl2 plus 10 µm CaM was added to the mixture. After three washes, bound proteins were eluted with 40 µl of buffer containing 15 mm glutathione (pH adjusted to 8.0 with NaOH), subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit antiserum 7 that recognizes the predominant forms Gβ1 and Gβ2 (19Nanoff C. Mitterauer T. Roka F. Hohenegger M. Freissmuth M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 806-817PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The short splice variant of recombinant Gαs (rGαs-s) was expressed in E. coli (BL21DE3) and purified from bacterial lysates. Where applicable, rGαs-s (10 µm) was preactivated for 60 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgSO4, 100 µm GTPγS, and 0.025% (w/v) Lubrol; the nucleotide was subsequently removed by gel filtration (20Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21907-21914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sf9 cell membranes expressing mammalian adenylyl cyclase type II (21Weitmann S. Wursig N. Navarro J.M. Kleuss C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3409-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were a generous gift of C. Kleuss (Freie Universität, Berlin). For the determination of adenylyl cyclase activity, Sf9 membranes (10 µg/assay) were incubated in a final volume of 50 µl containing 50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm[α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity 20–40 cpm/pmol), 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 0.1 mm RO201724 (Sigma). The carry-over from the preactivation of rGαs-s and the dilution of βγ dimers resulted in the presence of 1 mmMgSO4 and 0.01% (w/v) Lubrol, which both have no appreciable effect on catalysis (22Kudlacek O.

Where indicated, the final concentrations of rGαs-s, βγ dimers, and GST-7A-N25 (or GST) were 0.3 µm, 25 nm, and 100 µm, respectively. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C for 20 min; [32P]cAMP formed during the incubation was quantified according to Ref. 23Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. The synthesis of the agonist radioligand [125I]HPIA, the generation of HEK293 cell lines stably expressing the human A1-adenosine receptor, and the assay conditions for A1-adenosine receptor binding have been described previously (24Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, EGTA-stripped HEK293 cell membranes (9–15 µg of protein/assay) were incubated in 40 µl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 8 µg/ml adenosine desaminase, and [125I]HPIA (final concentration 0.8–1.2 nm). The binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 1.5 h at 20 °C in the presence of GST, GST-7A, GST-7A-N25, GST-N25-Q857A, or GST-N25-S862E, at concentrations of 10–70 µm. Incubations were performed in the absence and presence of 2 mm Ca2+ or of 2 mmCa2+ and 20 µm CaM, respectively. Control experiments with the antagonist 3H-labeled 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine showed that none of our experimental conditions affected antagonist binding. All assays were performed in duplicate and repeated 3–4 times. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids driving the expression of wild-type mGluR 7A or mGluR-7A-ΔCaM and the human D2-dopamine receptor (25Bofill-Cardona E. Kudlacek O. Yang Q. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32672-32680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). FLAG epitopes and c-Myc epitopes were present at the N termini of mGluR 7A (or mGluR-7A-ΔCaM) and of the D2-dopamine receptor, respectively, to verify cell surface expression of the receptors. Agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was determined as described (19Nanoff C. Mitterauer T. Roka F. Hohenegger M. Freissmuth M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 806-817PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, membranes (15–20 µg of protein/assay) prepared from the transiently transfected cells were preincubated for 15 min in 40 µl of 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1.5 mmMgCl2 at 20 °C in the presence of either the group III mGluR agonist l-AP4 (300 µm), or the antagonist MPPG (100 µm); quinpirol (1 µm) and sulpirid (10 µm) were used for the D2-dopamine receptor. Thereafter, the reaction was started by adding 10 µl of buffer containing 50 µm GDP and 100 nm [35S]GTPγS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity ∼1600 cpm/fmol) and quenched at the indicated time points by adding 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm GTP). Bound and free nucleotides were separated by filtration over glass fiber filters, and bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Data represent means ± S.D. from three experiments carried out in duplicate. We have previously shown that Ca2+/CaM and Gβγ bind in a mutually exclusive manner to the C-terminal tail region of mGluR 7 (9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since both known splice variants of mGluR 7, 7A and 7B, bound Ca2+/CaM and since these variants differ only in their C-terminal half (Fig. 1 A), we assigned the CaM binding site to the N-terminal portion of the tail regions. To confirm this idea and to exclude a contribution of the divergent sequences at the extreme C terminus, we used binary interaction assays with truncated receptor tail GST fusion constructs. Pull-down assays employing CaM immobilized on agarose beads proved superior to the previously used binding assay with purified CaM and GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. Fig.1 B shows that both of the N-terminal region constructs, GST-7A-N38 and GST-7A-N25, bound CaM-agarose in the presence of Ca2+ but not EGTA, whereas the C-terminal GST-7A-C27 fusion protein failed to bind CaM even in Ca2+-containing buffer. Ca2+/CaM binding to mGluR 7 sequences was not a fusion protein artifact, since native mGluR 7 solubilized from hippocampal membranes with Triton X-100 also bound CaM-agarose in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 1 C). The C-terminal tail of mGluR 7A also contains a binding site for Gβγ, and Ca2+/CaM is known to inhibit binding of Gβγ to GST-7A (9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the binding site for Gβγ also resides in the N-terminal region of mGluR 7A by incubating GST-7A-N38, GST-7A-N25, and GST-7A-C27 with purified Gβγ. GST-7A-C27 did not retain Gβγ, while comparable amounts of Gβγ were recovered with both GST-7A-N38 and GST-7A-N25 (Fig.1 D, top panel). When directly compared with GST-7A, GST-7A-N25 was as effective in retaining Gβγ as the full-length tail region (see Fig. 5 A). Finally, binding of Gβγ to GST-7A-N25 was abolished in the presence of CaM (Fig.1 D, lower panel). We therefore conclude that the first 25 residues in the N-terminal region of the mGluR 7 tail domain suffice to support both Ca2+/CaM and Gβγ binding. In order to obtain an estimate of the affinity of the C-terminal tail of mGluR 7A for Ca2+/CaM, we incubated dansylated CaM (dansyl-CaM) with GST, GST-7A, or GST-7A-N25 fusion proteins and measured the changes in fluorescence emission induced by its interaction with the binding motif. In the absence of Ca2+, fluorescence emission by dansyl-CaM was modest (Fig.2 A, trace 1). Binding of Ca2+ induces a conformational change in CaM, which in dansyl-CaM reduces the exposure of the fluorophore to the aqueous environment and could be detected as an enhancement and a blue shift in the emitted fluorescence (Fig.2 A, trace 2). The addition of GST had no effect on the spectrum of dansyl-CaM in both the presence (Fig.2 A, trace 3) or absence of Ca2+ (data not shown). In contrast, GST-7A (trace 4 in Fig. 2 A) and GST-7A-N25 (trace 5 in Fig. 2 A) caused substantial fluorescence enhancement; this increase in light emission probably reflects shielding of the fluorophore by binding of the C-terminal peptide. Because of an excellent signal/noise ratio, the concentration-dependent effects of GST-7A (and of GST-N25) were readily detected (Fig. 2 B and data not shown). Notably, however, the apparent EC50 values of GST-7A depended on the concentration of dansyl-CaM (see Fig. 2 B); this was most readily evident when data were normalized to maximal fluorescence enhancement (Fig. 2 C). This concentration dependence can be attributed to the depletion of free GST-7A, which is most pronounced at low concentrations of GST-7A. Depletion is most easily corrected for by determining EC50 values over a reasonably large range of dansyl-CaM concentrations; for infinitely low concentrations of dansyl-CaM, depletion should be nonexistent, and the EC50value should hence be a true affinity estimate. Fig. 2 Dshows that the EC50 estimates for both GST-7A or of GST-7A-N25 indeed depended in a linear manner on the dansyl-CaM concentration employed. The slope of the regression line was close to unity, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry; the true affinity value calculated from the y intercept was in the range of 70 nm. Fig. 2 D also indicates that the EC50 values for GST- 7A (closed symbols) and for GST-7A-N25 (open symbols) fell onto the same line. We therefore conclude that GST-7A-N25 comprises all residues required for high affinity binding of CaM. To unravel whether other members of group III mGluRs also might interact with Ca2+/CaM, we tested the CaM binding of fusion proteins of all known group III mGluR tail sequences to CaM-agarose. Fig. 3 A shows that GST fusion proteins encoding the C-terminal tails of mGluR 4A, 8A, and 8B (GST-4A, -8A, -8B) bound CaM-agarose in the presence of Ca2+, but not of EGTA. Notably, GST-6 failed to interact with CaM agarose even in the presence of Ca2+ (not shown). To confirm this observation by a different approach, we immobilized GST-6 on glutathione-Sepharose and incubated the resulting matrix with purified CaM. Again, no CaM binding was detected (Fig. 3 C). This result is consistent with several substitutions in the putative CaM binding region of mGluR 6 (Fig. 1 A). A high intrinsic insolubility of GST-4B precluded assaying its potential CaM binding potential (data not shown). To overcome this problem, we generated an MBP fusion construct encoding the C-terminal tail of mGluR 4B. The resulting fusion protein (MBP-4B) showed improved solubility upon expression in bacterial cells. As a positive control, the mGluR 7A tail region was also fused to MBP. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that MBP-7A but neither MBP nor MBP-4B interacted with CaM-agarose in the presence of Ca2+. This again is consistent with the predicted CaM binding consensus sequence highlighted in Fig.1 A that is conserved in all group III mGluRs except mGluR 4B and mGluR 6. Confirming our assignment of the CaM binding region, a previously described fusion protein lacking amino acids 864–876 within the CaM binding region of GST-7A (GST-7A-ΔCaM; see Ref. 9O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) also failed to bind to CaM agarose (data not shown). Since this fusion protein was very sensitive to proteolysis, we also immobilized GST-7A-ΔCaM on glutathione-Sepharose. Again, the resulting matrix displayed no detectable CaM binding (Fig. 3 C). Our results contrast with previous observations showing that CaM binding is a unique feature of mGluR 7 (16Nakajima Y. Yamamoto T. Nakayama T. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27573-27577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To corroborate that indeed native group III mGluRs other than mGluR 7 bind Ca2+/CaM, we also performed CaM affinity adsorption of mGluR 4A solubilized from cerebellar membranes. Native mGluR 4A receptors were specifically retained on CaM-agarose in the presence of Ca2+ but not EGTA. 2V. O'Connor, unpublished data. This result corroborates the pull-down results wit"

The present study has determined a region critical for filament formation of vertebrate smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin II. A monoclonal antibody recognizing the 28 residues from the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil domain of smooth muscle myosin II completely inhibited filament formation, whereas other antibodies recognizing other parts of the coiled-coil did not. To determine the importance of this region in the filament assembly in vivo, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged smooth muscle myosin was expressed in COS-7 cells, and the filamentous localization of the GFP signal was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Wild type GFP-tagged smooth muscle myosin colocalized with F-actin during interphase and was also recruited into the contractile ring during cytokinesis. Myosin with the nonhelical tail piece deleted showed similar behavior, whereas deletion of the 28 residues at the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil domain abolished this localization. Deletion of the corresponding region of GFP-tagged nonmuscle myosin IIA also abolished this localization.

The molecular structure of conventional myosin is characterized by its globular head domain and the filament forming α-helical coiled-coil tail domain. Although the former characteristic is shared by a number of unconventional myosins, only conventional myosin, classified as the second class of myosin in myosin super family (1Kellerman K.A.

Fibrous Proteins: Scientific Industrial and Medical Aspects. Academic Press, New York1979: 393-427Google Scholar), and in addition to this, the myosin tail shows a 28-residue repeat in which charged residues face toward the outside of the coiled-coil structure (8Parry D.A.

Because filament formation of myosin is abolished at high ionic strength, these charged residues in the tail have been thought to be responsible for the assembly of myosin molecules. Use of proteolytic fragments (12Nyitray L. Mocz G. Szilagyi L. Balint M. Lu R.C. Wong A. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13213-13220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cross R.A.

J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 823-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has revealed that the C-terminal region of LMM1 is important for the assembly of the rod. For skeletal myosin, deletion of the N-terminal residues of LMM did not affect the solubility at low ionic strength, but deletion of 92 residues from the C terminus caused an increase in solubility (16Atkinson S.J. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 823-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hodge et al. (17Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported that, by expressing the rod portion of nonmuscle myosin II by Escherichia coli expression system, the 35-residue C-terminal nonhelical region influences filament formation. Recently it was reported that the deletion of 29 residues near the C terminus of skeletal myosin heavy chain disrupts the filament formation (18Sohn R.L. Vikstrom K.L. Strauss M. Cohen C. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Leinwand L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for amoeba myosin, the C-terminal 100 residues are critical for assembly of bipolar myosin minifilaments (15Sinard J.H. Rimm D.L. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2417-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the case ofDictyostelium myosin, an expressed peptide having the C-terminal 600 residues showed the formation of paracrystals with a 14.3-nm repeat, a characteristic of thick filaments (19DeLozanne A. Berlot C.H. Leinwand L. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2999-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Subsequently it was shown that the deletion of the C-terminal 297 amino acid residues does not affect the myosin assembly properties, whereas the deletion of an additional 35 residues significantly reduces the assembly of myosin (20Lee R.J. Egelhoff T.T. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that, whereas the critical region for myosin assembly for vertebrate skeletal myosin is near the C terminus, for Dictyostelium myosin it is away from C terminus. The difference may be related to the difference in tail lengths between the myosins. The location of the critical region for myosin assembly may be related to the regulation mechanism for myosin assembly, because the assembly of Dictyosteliummyosin is regulated by heavy chain phosphorylation at sites located away from the C terminus (20Lee R.J. Egelhoff T.T. Spudich J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2875-2886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assembly properties of vertebrate smooth muscle myosin are unique in several respects. In contrast to striated muscle myosin and amoeba myosin, smooth muscle myosin forms “side polar” filaments rather than “bipolar” filaments (21Craig R. Megerman J. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Cross R.A. Geeves M.A. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Xu J.Q. Harder B.A. Uman P. Craig R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin and vertebrate nonmuscle myosin filaments are also unstable in the presence of ATP, and phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain is required to form stable filamentsin vitro (24Suzuki H. Onishi H. Takahashi K. Watanabe S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 1529-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Scholey J.M. Taylor K.A. Kendrick-Jones J. Nature. 1980; 287: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These characteristics of smooth muscle myosin assembly could be at least partly due to the difference in the structure of the region critical for filament formation. By proteolytic digestion of gizzard LMM, it was shown that the C-terminal 13-kDa domain specifies the insolubility of gizzard LMM (13Cross R.A. Vandererckhove J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 200: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); however, the region critical for thick filament formation of smooth muscle myosin both in vitro and in vivo has not yet been determined. In the present study, we produced a monoclonal antibody that disassembles smooth muscle myosin filaments. The binding site of this antibody is determined to be within the C-terminal 28 residues of the coiled-coil structure of myosin rod. The GFP-tagged truncated myosin mutant lacking these 28 residues in cells failed to show evidence of filamentous structure. The results indicated that the C-terminal 28 residues of the predicted coiled-coil domain of myosin are critical for the thick filament formation of smooth muscle myosin. The corresponding region of human nonmuscle myosin II was also shown to be critical for filament formation. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The pT7-7 E. coli expression vector containing the T7 promotor (26Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12054-12061Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Ikebe M. Kamisoyama H. Matsuura M. Mitani Y. Ikebe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the smooth muscle heavy chain cDNA in pT7-7 vector as a template. ANdeI site was created at codon 1396 of the heavy chain cDNA. The vector was digested with NdeI to remove a cDNA fragment encoding the amino acids 1–1395. To delete the C-terminal amino acid residues of the smooth muscle myosin rod, a stop codon was created at codons 1849, 1910, and 1937, respectively, for Δ1, Δ2, and ΔNHL. After confirming the mutation by direct sequencing analysis, the truncated myosin rod expression vectors were transferred to BL21(DE3). The expression of the truncated rod was monitored by Western blot using various monoclonal antibodies recognizing the myosin rod. The entire coding region of chicken gizzard myosin heavy chain cDNA (smooth muscle myosin isoform 1) was created and subcloned into pFastbacHTb baculovirus transfer vector atNcoI/SalI sites in the polylinker region. ANcoI site was created at codon 859 of the heavy chain cDNA, and the vector was digested to remove a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–858 and then self ligated. This construct was used to produce myosin rod. A stop codon was created at codon 1910 of the myosin heavy chain cDNA to produce the construct expressing the 28-amino acid residue deletion mutant of myosin or myosin rod. The plasmids were transformed into DH10BAC E. coli. Recombinant bacmids (recombinant virus DNA) were isolated and used to transfect Sf9 insect cells. The proteins were expressed by infection of fresh Sf9 cells with viral stock for 72 h. Smooth muscle myosin or myosin rod was purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). A smooth muscle myosin heavy chain cDNA from chicken gizzard containing entire coding region (smooth muscle myosin isoform 1) was subcloned into pEGFPC1 expression vector containing GFP sequence. A uniqueXhoI site was created at the 5′ side of the initiation codon of myosin heavy chain, and then a 2.3-kilobase fragment of myosin heavy chain cDNA containing 5′ region of the coding region was excised byXhoI/EcoRI digestion. The fragment was inserted in frame into the multicloning site of pEGFPC1 vector. Then aEcoRI/XbaI 4.0-kilobase fragment encoding the C-terminal domain of myosin heavy chain was inserted into the pEGFPC1 vector containing the 5′ myosin heavy chain cDNA fragment at theEcoRI/XbaI sites. The sequence orientation was confirmed with restriction mapping and direct sequencing analysis, and the produced plasmid was used as a GFP-smooth muscle myosin chimera expression vector. To create the truncation myosin mutant expression vectors, a stop codon was created at the codons 1849, 1910, and 1937, termed Δ1, Δ2, and ΔNHT, respectively. Human myosin IIA heavy chain cDNA fragments were kindly supplied by Dr. R. S. Adelstein (National Institutes of Health). These clones contain nucleotides −19 to 1200, 295 to 4155, and 4155 to 7236 of the human myosin IIA heavy chain cDNA, respectively. AHindIII site was created at the 5′ side of the initiation codon, and the 0.35-kilobase fragment including the initiation codon was excised by HindIII/BsiwI digestion and subcloned into the pBluscript vector containing the myosin IIA cDNA (295–4155) digested with HindIII/BsiwI. The cDNA (1–4155) was excised with HindIII/EcoRI and subcloned into pEGFPC1 vector atHindIII/EcoRI sites in the polylinker region. The myosin IIA cDNA fragment containing the nucleotides 4155–7236 was excised with EcoRI and ligated in frame with pEGFPC1 vector containing myosin IIA cDNA (1–4155). The sequence orientation of this GFP-nonmuscle myosin IIA expression vector was confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping, and the sequence was confirmed by direct sequencing analysis. To create the truncated GFP-myosin IIA, a stop codon was created at codon 1899. COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 µg/ml of streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells (about 106 cells/ml) on a coverslip were transfected with SuperFectTMtransfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin with PBS at room temperature for 1 h, they were incubated with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with PBS three times, the samples were mounted in 3% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma), 90% glycerol in PBS. Images of labeled cells were acquired with a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope equipped with a 100W Hg arc lamp for epifluorescence microscopy. The cells were viewed with 60× (NA 1.4) or 40× Nikon (NA 1.3) Planapo objectives with a 2.5× or 5× camera eyepiece, and images were projected onto the face of a Photometrics thermoelectrically cooled CCD camera. Monoclonal antibodies were produced against chicken gizzard myosin as described previously (31Higashihara M. Young-Frado L. Craig R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5218-5225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clones were expanded and finally grown in ascitic fluid in pristane primed BALB/c mice. IgG class antibodies were purified by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient slab gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards used were myosin heavy chain (200 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), calbonic anhydrase (27 kDa), myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). The steady-state heavy meromyosin ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C as described previously (27Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gizzard myosin in solution containing 0.3 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol, was mixed with each monoclonal antibody and then absorbed onto a freshly cleaved mica surface for 30 s. Unbound proteins were rinsed away, and then the specimen was stabilized by brief exposure to uranyl acetate (33Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The specimen was visualized by the rotary shadowing technique according to Mabuchi (34Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1990; 103: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with an electron microscope (model EM300; Phillips Electronic Instruments, Mahwah, NJ) at 60 kV. The C-terminal truncated smooth muscle myosin and myosin rod were also visualized by the rotary shadowing technique. The effect of antibody on filament formation was studied by mixing 0.5 mg/ml gizzard myosin with 0.3 mg/ml of each antibody in 0.5m KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, followed by dialysis against 0.15 m KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Each antibody was also added to filaments previously formed in the absence of antibody. The samples were applied to thin carbon supported by copper mesh grids and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate before visualization in the electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Smooth muscle myosin was dialyzed against buffer A containing 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to form filaments. 0.4 µm myosin was then mixed with 2 µm of each antibody or buffer A at room temperature for 5 min. The mixture was then centrifuged (15,000 × g) for 15 min to precipitates the myosin filaments. The pellets and the supernatants were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by densitometry to determine the amount of precipitated myosin filaments. The recombinant smooth muscle myosin rod and the C-terminal truncated rod expressed by baculovirus expression system (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated in the buffer containing 0.12 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C for 15 min. The samples were subjected to sedimentation assay as described above. We produced 20 monoclonal antibodies against turkey gizzard smooth muscle myosin. These were subjected to Western blot analysis with myosin fragments digested by papain. Papain digestion of myosin produces 68-, 26-, and 130-kDa fragments. The first two peptides are derived from S1, and the last peptide is derived from the myosin rod. Among the antibodies tested, mm5, mm8, mm16, mm18, and mm19 recognized the 130-kDa fragment (not shown). To further determine the binding site, each antibody was mixed with intact gizzard myosin, and the antibody-myosin complex was examined by electron microscopy using the technique of rotary shadowing. All the antibodies tested bound to the rod portion of myosin molecule (Fig. 1). mm5 and mm8 bound at the middle of myosin tail, whereas mm18, mm16, and mm19 bound toward the C-terminal end. The position of each antibody binding site from the tip of the tail was estimated from the electron micrographs (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the antibody binding sites were nearly identical to the flexible regions of the rod that are predicted according to the amino acid sequence and electron microscopic observation (13Cross R.A.

J. 1995; 312: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that the flexible regions have high antigenicity (Fig. 2). It should be noted that most of the antibody binding sites have two antibodies bound, with one sticking out on each side.Figure 2Localization of the binding sites of anti-smooth muscle myosin antibodies on the smooth muscle myosin molecule. Location of each antibody binding site was estimated from the electron micrographs. The distance from the tip of the tail of myosin was measured with over 50 images for each antibody, and the mean distance was calculated. The predicted flexible regions of myosin rod are indicated with red circles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is plausible that the binding of antibodies interferes with the intermolecular interactions of myosin heavy chains, thus inhibiting filament assembly, if the antibody binding site overlaps with regions critical to the filament assembly. To examine the effect of the antibodies on myosin filament assembly, we added each monoclonal antibody to gizzard myosin at low ionic strength, where myosin molecules assemble to form filaments, and the myosin-antibody mixture was subjected to sedimentation analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, mm19 dramatically diminished the fraction of myosin sedimented by centrifugation, suggesting that mm19 inhibited myosin filament assembly. To further confirm this notion, the effect of antibodies on myosin filament formation was directly monitored by visualization of the filaments with electron microscopy (Fig. 4). Two different methods were used to evaluate the effect of the antibodies on filament formation. First, smooth muscle myosin was mixed with antibodies at high ionic strength where myosin exists as a monomer, and then the mixture was dialyzed against low ionic strength buffer to induce filament formation. Second, smooth muscle myosin was initially dialyzed against low ionic strengths buffer to form thick filaments, and then the antibodies were added. For both methods, mm19 antibody markedly inhibited smooth muscle myosin filament formation (Fig.4 B), and most of the myosin remained depolymerized in the background. On the other hand, mm18, mm8, and mm5 did not did not prevent myosin filament formation (Fig. 4, C–E), but the resulting filaments were generally shorter than those formed in the absence of antibody (Fig. 4 A). Some aggregation and cross-linking of filaments occurred in the presence of these antibodies, particularly in the case of mm5 and mm8, which also produced the shortest filaments. It appears that, with the exception of mm19, the antibodies studied had a significant effect on the process of filament formation even though they did not prevent filaments from forming. However, mm19 was the only antibody to essentially prevent filament formation from occurring and to also dissolve preformed filaments.Figure 4Electron microscopic observation of the effect of the anti-smooth muscle myosin antibodies on myosin filament formation. Either smooth muscle myosin filaments were formed in the presence of antibody, or antibody was added to preformed filaments. Both methods produced similar results for any given antibody.A, absence of antibody; B, mm19; C, mm18; D, mm8; E, mm5. Bar, 1.0 µm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the mm19 binding region, various C-terminal fragments of smooth muscle myosin rod were produced. The expressed fragments were subjected to Western blot analysis using the mm19 antibody as a probe. As shown in Fig. 5, mm19 recognized both the fragment containing entire C-terminal sequence (AA1396–1979) and that which contained the entire C-terminal coiled-coil region but not the nonhelical tail piece (AA1396–1935). On the other hand, mm19 failed to recognize the fragments of AA1396–1907 and AA1396–1856. The results clearly indicate that the 28 residues at the C-terminal end of the α-helical coiled-coil domain, but not the C-terminal nonhelical tail, is the mm19 binding site and suggest that this region is critical for the filament formation of smooth muscle myosin. One potential explanation for the disruption of the filament formation by C-terminal deletion would be that the C-terminal residues are critical for formation of the coiled-coil structure. To test this possibility, we produced myosin and myosin rod in which the 28 residues from the end of the coiled-coil as well as the nonhelical tail are deleted and visualized by rotary shadowing technique. As shown in Fig.6 A, the C-terminal residue deleted myosin showed the two heads connected with a long rod that is indistinguishable to native myosin. The tail length of the C-terminal 28-residue truncated myosin was nearly identical to the nontruncated myosin. On the other hand, the C-terminal residue deleted myosin rod also showed an elongated rod without the head domain. The images were practically identical to those of nontruncated rod, and there was no indication of the disruption of the coiled-coil (Fig. 6 B). These results clearly indicate that the deletion of the C-terminal residues does not disrupt the coiled-coil formation of the myosin rod. The C-terminal residue deleted rod was examined for the filament formation by sedimentation analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). The result demonstrated that the deletion of the C-terminal sequence significantly diminished the filament formation. Only 8% of the nontruncated myosin rod remained in the supernatant after centrifugation in physiological ionic strength, whereas 95% of the truncated rod was found in the supernatant. To examine the importance of the 28 residues from the end of the coiled-coil domain of the rod in the thick filament formationin vivo, we produced GFP-tagged smooth muscle myosin variants and expressed them in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig.7, the wild type smooth muscle myosin tagged with GFP at the N-terminal end showed stress fiber localization and submembrane localization in interphase cells that coincided with the actin localization. Similar filamentous localization of GFP-myosin was also observed for ΔNHT myosin in which the entire nonhelical tail sequence is deleted. In contrast, the two other constructs, in which 28 and 79 residues from the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil sequence were deleted, showed completely diffuse localization. The results clearly indicate that the C-terminal 28 residues of the coiled-coil domain are critical for the formation of functional myosin filamentsin vivo. It is known that myosin is recruited at the equator of cells at late telophase of mitosis to form a contractile ring that is important for cytokinesis. We examined whether the 28 residues defined above are critical for the incorporation of myosin into the contractile ring during cytokinesis. The wild type GFP-tagged smooth muscle myosin localized at the equator of the cells at the beginning of cytokinesis to form the contractile ring (Fig.8 A). ΔNHT myosin showed the same localization during cytokinesis (Fig. 8 D). On the other hand Δ1 and Δ2 myosin constructs both showed diffuse localization throughout mitosis (Fig. 8, B and C). The results are consistent with the finding in interphase cells and indicate that myosin forms thick filaments during cytokinesis at the equator of the cells and the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil region is critical for the filament formation of myosin. The results also show that smooth muscle myosin can be recruited into the contractile ring during cytokinesis. To clarify whether the finding is specific to smooth muscle myosin or is in common with nonmuscle type myosins, nonmuscle myosin IIA and its variants were tagged with GFP and expressed in COS-7 cells. The wild type GFP-tagged myosin IIA showed filamentous localization that is superimposed on actin filaments in interphase (Fig.9). Deletion of 32 residues from the end of the coiled-coil sequence completely abolished the filamentous localization of myosin IIA (Fig. 9), whereas the deletion of the nonhelical tail sequence (34 residues from the C terminus) did not affect the filamentous localization (not shown). The present study clearly shows that the 28 residues from the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil domain of smooth and nonmuscle myosin rod are critical for filament formation both in vitro andin vivo. The deletion of this region, but not the deletion of the C-terminal nonhelical tail piece, completely abolished the filamentous localization of myosin in both interphase and cytokinesis. The results strongly suggest that the filament formation of myosin is disrupted by the deletion of this region in vivo. It may be possible that the deletion interferes with the recruitment of myosin filaments into larger structures but not filament formation itself, but this is less likely because mm19 binding to this region, but not the binding of other antibodies to various other regions of the rod, completely abolished filament formation. It is possible that the inhibition of the filament formation by C-terminal deletion is due to the disruption of the coiled-coil formation, but this is not the case because both the C-terminal truncated myosin and rod showed an elongated rod structure that is indistinguishable to the nontruncated ones (Fig. 6). It is known that there is a nonhelical region present at the C-terminal end of the myosin II molecule that is very diverse among different myosins. Several groups have shown that this region may modulate filament assembly in smooth, skeletal, and nonmuscle myosins (16Atkinson S.J. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 823-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,41Ikebe M. Hewett T.E. Martin A.F. Chen M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7030-7036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that Mts1, a 9-kDa S100 family protein, binds to the nonhelical tail of nonmuscle myosin II, thus destabilizing filaments (42Ford H.L. Silver D.L. Kachar B. Sellers J.R. Zain S.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16321-16327Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The present finding is consistent with these earlier reports, and it is plausible that the nonhelical tail influences the stability of myosin II filament formation because it resides adjacent to the region critical for filament formation. It has been known that the α-helical coiled-coil structure carries a characteristic seven-residue repeat pattern with hydrophobic residues that create a major stabilization energy for the coiled-coil structure (7Parry D.A.D. Parry D.A.D. Creamer L.K. Fibrous Proteins: Scientific Industrial and Medical Aspects. Academic Press, New York1979: 393-427Google Scholar). The myosin rod also contains this feature, thus forming a coiled-coil, but, in addition to this heptapeptide pattern, there is a 28-residue periodicity (4.1 nm) with alternating bands of positive and negative charges (9McLachlan A.D. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 164: 605-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 10Strehler E.E. Strehler-Page M.-A. Perriard X.X. Periasamy M. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Mol.

A. 1986; 83: 9433-9437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This feature, present throughout the rod, has been thought to be essential for rod aggregation. Recently, it has become evident that the C-terminal domain of the rod is important for the aggregation of myosin (18Sohn R.L. Vikstrom K.L. Strauss M. Cohen C. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Leinwand L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 43Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study are consistent with this earlier work and further define the critical region for filament formation as a very short stretch of the coiled-coil structure at the C-terminal end. The sequence alignment of the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil domain shows that most of the charged residues are well conserved among myosin II from nonmuscle and smooth muscle tissues (39Yanagisawa M. Hamada Y. Katsuragawa Y. Imamura M. Mikawa T. Masaki T. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 44Shohet R.V. Conti M.A. Kawamoto S. Preston Y.A. Brill D.A. Adelstein R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7726-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 45Phillips C.L. Yamakawa K. Adelstein R.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell. Motil. 1995; 16: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The charged residues are clustered on the outside of the coiled-coil dimer with alternate positive and negative charges. This pattern of the charged residues in the coiled-coil structure could be responsible for the filament stabilization. However, it is unclear why the C-terminal end of the predicted coiled-coil region is so critical for filament formation, because the charged residues are present throughout the rod domain of myosin molecule. Therefore, it is likely that this region adopts a specific structure. One possibility is that it is not rigidly incorporated into the coiled-coil structure but is more flexible. The charged residues in this region could interact with the counterpart of the adjacent myosin with an appropriate conformation that is not readily possible for the charged residues present in the interior of the rigid coiled-coil domain. This is consistent with the fact that all the produced monoclonal antibodies against LMM domain recognized “flexible” patches of LMM. Considering that mm19 recognizes the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil, this suggests some structural freedom of this region. Another possibility is that this region adopts a unique structural feature that favors intermolecular interaction to form filaments. Recently Cohen and Parry (43Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) analyzed the structure of the C-terminal region of paramyosin and myosin. They reported that the 63-residue domain from the C-terminal end of the coiled-coil structure has a structural distinct from the rest of the coiled-coil region. This region has a unique charge profile that lacks the periodic variation in charge found in the rest of the coiled-coil rod and a high proportion of large apolar residues in surface position. The importance of large hydrophobic residues for the interaction between molecules was also suggested for Caenorhabditis elegans myosin assembly (46Hope P.E. Waterson R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results of the present study are consistent with this structural consideration for the intermolecular association of the coiled-coil. Sohn et al. (18Sohn R.L. Vikstrom K.L. Strauss M. Cohen C. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Leinwand L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that, in striated muscle myosin, the amino acids between 54 and 25 residues from the C-terminal end of the predicted coiled-coil are important for filament formation. They expressed various rod fragments in E. coli and examined the solubility and the formation of paracrystals in vitro. Paracrystal formation was diminished by deleting residues 1874–1902. Furthermore, deletion of this segment disrupted the needle-shaped structures that are thought to represent arrays of thick filaments (47Vistrom K.L. Rovner A.S. Saez C.G. Bravo-Zehnder M. Straceski A.J. Leinwand L. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 26: 192-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This region is closer to the N terminus of the coiled-coil compared with the region identified in the present study. This difference could be due to the difference in the type of myosin, because it is known that the filament structure of smooth muscle myosin is quite different from that of striated myosin (21Craig R. Megerman J. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 990-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Cross R.A. Geeves M.A. Kendrick-Jones J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Xu J.Q. Harder B.A. Uman P. Craig R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that they examined paracrystal formation of partial segments of the rod but not filament formation of the whole myosin molecule. Although the deletion of this segment from striated myosin diminished the needle-shaped structure in cells, it is likely that the deletion disrupts the entire downstream structure of myosin including the region homologous to the sequence identified in the present study. In contrast to the earlier model (17Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the present results clearly show that the nonhelical tailpiece of the rod does not play a significant role in filament formation. In the earlier model, the tailpiece favors the formation of staggered intermediates for filament assembly as opposed to the accumulation of unstaggered intermediates. It is plausible that the C-terminal 28 residues identified in this study may play a role as the tailpiece originally proposed by Hodge et al. (17Hodge T.P. Cross R. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although the identity of such a putative tailpiece was possibly misassigned as the “nonhelical tailpiece.” We thank Dr. R. S. Adelstein (National Institutes of Health) for providing us with the cDNA fragments encoding human nonmuscle myosin IIA heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W2046274893,"Ca+2/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are activated upon binding of Ca+2/calmodulin. To gain maximal activity, CaMK I and CaMK IV can be further phosphorylated by an upstream kinase, CaMK kinase (CaMKK). We previously isolated cDNA clones encoding human CaMKK β isoforms that are heterogeneous in their 3′-sequences (Hsu, L.-S., Tsou, A.-P., Chi, C.-W., Lee, C.-H., and Chen, J.-Y. (1998)J. Biomed. Sci. 5, 141–149). In the present study, we examined the genomic organization and transcription of the humanCaMKK β gene. The human CaMKK β locus spans more than 40 kilobase pairs and maps to chromosome 12q24.2. It is organized into 18 exons and 17 introns that are flanked by typical splice donor and acceptor sequences. Two major species of transcripts, namely the β1 (5.6 kilobase pairs) and β2 (2.9 kilobase pairs), are generated through differential usage of polyadenylation sites located in the last and penultimate exons. Additional forms ofCaMKK β transcripts were also identified that resulted from alternative splicing of the internal exons 14 and/or 16. These isoforms display differential expression patterns in human tissues and tumor-derived cell lines. They also exhibit a distinct ability to undergo autophosphorylation and to phosphorylate the downstream kinases CaMK I and CaMK IV. The differential expression of CaMKK β isoforms with distinct activity further suggests the complexity of the regulation of the CaMKK/CaMK cascade and an important role for CaMKK in the action of Ca+2-mediated cellular responses. Ca+2/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are activated upon binding of Ca+2/calmodulin. To gain maximal activity, CaMK I and CaMK IV can be further phosphorylated by an upstream kinase, CaMK kinase (CaMKK). We previously isolated cDNA clones encoding human CaMKK β isoforms that are heterogeneous in their 3′-sequences (Hsu, L.-S., Tsou, A.-P., Chi, C.-W., Lee, C.-H., and Chen, J.-Y. (1998)J. Biomed. Sci. 5, 141–149). In the present study, we examined the genomic organization and transcription of the humanCaMKK β gene. The human CaMKK β locus spans more than 40 kilobase pairs and maps to chromosome 12q24.2. It is organized into 18 exons and 17 introns that are flanked by typical splice donor and acceptor sequences. Two major species of transcripts, namely the β1 (5.6 kilobase pairs) and β2 (2.9 kilobase pairs), are generated through differential usage of polyadenylation sites located in the last and penultimate exons. Additional forms ofCaMKK β transcripts were also identified that resulted from alternative splicing of the internal exons 14 and/or 16. These isoforms display differential expression patterns in human tissues and tumor-derived cell lines. They also exhibit a distinct ability to undergo autophosphorylation and to phosphorylate the downstream kinases CaMK I and CaMK IV. The differential expression of CaMKK β isoforms with distinct activity further suggests the complexity of the regulation of the CaMKK/CaMK cascade and an important role for CaMKK in the action of Ca+2-mediated cellular responses. calmodulin Ca+2/CaM-dependent protein kinase CaMK kinase bacterial artificial chromosome cAMP response element-binding protein kilobase(s) polymerase chain reaction 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid glutathioneS-transferase base pair(s) nucleotides reverse transcription Ca2+, an important second messenger in eukaryotic cells, regulates many cellular processes including muscle contraction, neurotransmmiter secretion, gene expression, and cell cycle progression (1Santella L.

Upon stimulation, elevated intracellular Ca2+mediates its effects via interaction with calmodulin (CaM),1 and Ca2+/CaM binds to and induces the activity of a wide range of regulatory proteins. The family of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) consists of specific enzymes, e.g. myosin light chain kinase, phosphorylase kinase, and the multifunctional enzymes, such as the various isoforms of CaMK I, CaMK II, and CaMK IV (3Hanson P.I.

The multifunctional CaMKs have been shown to be involved in regulating gene expression by phosphorylating various transcription factors. A number of documents have demonstrated that the CaMK pathway is analogous to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in that it requires an upstream protein kinase, CaMK kinase (CaMKK), to phosphorylate and fully activate CaMK I and CaMK IV (6Lee J.C.

CaMKK purified from pig brain phosphorylates the threonine residue localized in the “activation loop” of CaMK I (Thr177) and CaMK IV (Thr196), respectively, and increases their activity 20–50 times. Mutation of the Thr residue to Ala abolishes both the phosphorylation and the activation of CaMK I/CaMK IV by CaMKK (12Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Huang Q.-H. Goldstein E.G. Means A.R. Edelman A.M. J.

They share 69% homology in amino acid sequence and are localized in different regions of the brain (14Edelman A.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Selbert M.A. Anderson K.A. Hook S.S. Stapleton D. Goldstein E.G.

CaMKK α is widely distributed in neurons throughout the brain, except in the cerebellar cortex, whereas CaMKK β is relatively restricted in some neuronal populations, particularly in the cerebellar granule cells (17Sakagami H. Saito S. Kitan T. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,18Sakagami H. Umemiya M. Saito S. Kondo H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Like other members of the CaMK family, CaMKK is composed of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a regulatory domain at its C terminus, which contains the CaM-binding site overlapped with the autoinhibitory domain (9Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 20Schulman H. Curr. Opin.

Co-expression of CaMKK with CaMK I or CaMK IV was shown to enhance the activity of CaMK I or CaMK IV toward phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and cAMP response element-dependent reporter gene expression in a Ca2+-dependent manner (15Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.-H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol.

The CaMKK/CaMK/CREB pathway was recently successfully reconstituted in theCaenorhabditis elegans (22Eto K. Takahashi N. Kimura Y. Masuho Y. Arai K. Muramatsu M.A. Tokumitsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22556-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Other than CREB, CaMK IV-mediated signaling is also known to be involved in Ca2+-regulated gene expression through activation of serum response factor (SRF) and activating transcriptional factor-1 (ATF-1) (23Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, CaMKKs and CaMK IV have been shown to exhibit different subcellular localization in the brain. In contrast to the nuclear localization of CaMK IV, both rat CaMKK α and β are localized in the perikaryal cytoplasm, dendrites, and nerve terminals (18Sakagami H. Umemiya M. Saito S. Kondo H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The distinct subcellular expression patterns suggest the presence of a complicated mechanism for the activation of CaMK IV by CaMKK. The CaMKK/CaMK IV cascade has also been indicated to interact with the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade to activate c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 (26Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). CaMKK was also suggested to play a role in cell survival. The rat CaMKK α was shown to phosphorylate and activate protein kinase B (PKB) which can then phosphorylate BAD protein. The phosphorylated BAD will then bind to 14-3-3 protein instead of Bclx and, thus, prevent apoptosis (27Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). We previously isolated different cDNA clones corresponding to human CaMKK β that shared more than 90% amino acid sequence homology to rat CaMKK β (28Hsu L.-S. Tsou A.-P. Chi C.-W. Lee C.-H. Chen J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). These cDNA clones are heterogeneous at their 3′-termini. To delineate the transcription of these CaMKKβ transcripts, in the present study we examined the genomic structure and transcription of human CaMKK β gene. We found that the human CaMKK β gene contains 18 exons that span more than 40 kb. Multiple transcripts are encoded by the CaMKK β gene through alternative RNA processing. The properties and expression patterns of the various CaMKK β isoforms were investigated. Human glioblastoma/astrocytoma U-87 MG cells and glioblastoma U-138 MG cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human non-small cell lung cancer H-1299 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. These cell lines were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified chamber at 37 °C. Tissues from normal brains and brain tumors were obtained from patients who underwent surgery at the Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan. Informed consent was obtained from each patient. Tissues were snap-frozen immediately after resection. Total RNA was prepared from pulverized tissues or cell lines using the guanidine isothiocyanate method and pelleted through a 5.7 m CsCl cushion (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 7.19-7.22Google Scholar). The pelleted RNA was dissolved, subjected to DNase I digestion to remove residual DNA, and stored at −80 °C for future use. To extend the 5′ cDNA sequence, a human brain marathon cDNA library was constructed utilizing a MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 10 µg of total RNA prepared from human brain tumor tissue with a CaMKK β-specific primer (5′-CAACTTGACGACACCATAGGAGC-3′) followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis. The double-stranded cDNA was then amplified by PCR using an adapter primer (5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and the gene specific primer under the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. The PCR product was diluted 10-fold, and 1 µl was used as the template in the nested PCR. The nested PCR was performed using a gene-specific nested primer (5′-TCTTGCAGAGACAGCTTGCG-3′) and a nested adaptor primer (5′-ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC-3′) under the conditions described above except that the annealing temperature was set at 50 °C. The PCR products were ligated to a pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Colonies containing the CaMKK β cDNA fragment were scored by PCR amplification using CaMKK β-specific sense (5′-CTCATCCTTGAGCATCCACC-3′) and antisense (5′-TCTTGCAGAGACAGCTTGCG-3′) primers under the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles. The positive clones were sequenced in both directions for CaMKK β cDNA sequences using OmniBaseTM DNA cycle sequencing system (Promega). The CaMKK β1 and β2-specific cDNA fragments were purified from K5 and K6 clones after restriction digestion with SacI (located near the 3′-termini of the CaMKK β cDNAs) and KpnI (located within the polyclonal sites of pGEM-T) (28Hsu L.-S. Tsou A.-P. Chi C.-W. Lee C.-H. Chen J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal common fragment was amplified by PCR using K6 as template with oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTCCTGGAGGCTGCATC-3′ and 5′-CCAGGCGCTGACAGTGAGCG-3′ as primers. The cDNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Rediprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Messenger RNAs were prepared from 400 µg of total RNA using the OligotexTM mRNA midi kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), separated by electrophoresis on 1.2% MOPS-formaldehyde agarose gel, and blotted to a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by capillary transfer. After UV cross-linking, blots were prehybridized in ExpressHybrid solution (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) at 65 °C for 30 min. Hybridization was performed by reacting with fresh ExpressHybrid solution containing the denatured probes at 65 °C for 16 h. The blots were washed twice with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) and 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 20 min, then washed once with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. The signal was obtained by autoradiography. The 1.8-kb K6 cDNA fragment and the 0.6-kb fragment obtained from 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used as probes to screen a human placenta λ FIX II genomic DNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After lifting the plaques, hybridization of the filters was performed at 65 °C overnight in hybridization buffer (6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 µg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) containing denatured probes (1 × 106 cpm/ml). The filters were washed twice with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min, and once with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 55 °C. Three positive clone, G5-1, G2-1, and G3-1 were isolated upon hybridization of 1 × 107plaques. The genomic DNA fragment was excised by NotI and subcloned into a pBluescript-KS vector for sequencing analysis. BAC clone 2283L16 was obtained by PCR screening of the BAC library D1 (Research Genetics, Inc.) using CaMKK β-oligonucleotides 5′-CGTATGCTGGACAAGAACCC-3′ and 5′-TCTCGACCTCCTCTTCAGTC-3′ as primers under the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min for 30 cycles. To prepare BAC DNA, a single colony of BAC clone was cultured in 5 ml of LB medium containing 12.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C overnight. The overnight culture was transferred into 500 ml of TB medium (12 g bacto-trypton, 24 g bacto-yeast extract, and 4 ml glycerol in 1 liter of 0.017 M KH2PO4and 0.072 M K2HPO4) containing 12.5 µg/ml chloramphenicol and cultured at 37 °C for 16–20 h. The BAC DNA was isolated using the alkaline lysis method, treated with RNase A (final concentration 10 µg/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C, and precipitated with 2 m NaCl and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min, the DNA pellet was dissolved in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, extracted with phenol/chloroform twice, and precipitated by ethanol. After centrifugation, the DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and re-dissolved in 100 µl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) buffer for sequencing analysis. The oligonucleotide 5′-GATCACTGCAACCTCTGCCTCCCAG-3′ was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by heat inactivation at 90 °C for 2 min. For primer extension analysis, 2 µg of mRNA prepared from H-1299 or U-87 MG cells was annealed to the labeled primer (∼ 0.1 pmol) at 50 °C for 60 min and then reverse-transcribed using the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, 200 unit, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-µl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP, 20 units RNasin, and actinomycin D (final concentration 50 µg/ml). The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min followed by heat inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min. The reaction mixture was incubated with RNaseA (0.5 µg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and extracted twice with phenol/chloroform. The reaction product was ethanol-precipitated and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel together with a sequence ladder obtained by dideoxy sequencing of the control DNA using the OmniBaseTM DNA Cycle Sequencing System (Promega). Five µg of total RNA prepared from U-87 MG cells, U-138 MG cells, human placenta tissue, or brain tissues were converted to cDNA by Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, 200 unit, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 50-µl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm dNTP with 0.625 µg of random primer following the manufacturer's instructions. Using cDNAs as templates, 30 cycles of PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) were performed with the following oligonucleotides as primers. The sense primer F1 (5′-CGTATGCTGGACAAGAACCC-3′) was mapped to exon 13 of the human CaMKK β gene, whereas the antisense primers R1 (5′-TCTCATAAGGACACAAAGCC-3′) and R2 (5′-TCTCACAAGAGCACTTCCTC-3′) were complementary to sequences of exons 17 and 18, respectively. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and examined under UV after ethidium bromide staining. The pGEX-CaMK I plasmid encoding the human CaMK I fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Anthony R. Means (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The pGEX-CaMK IV plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification of the coding region of the human CaMK IV gene from brain cDNA and subcloned into pGEX-KG in the way that CaMK IV was fused in-frame with GST. The GST-CaMK I and GST-CaMK IV were expressed in Escherichia coli XA90 cells and affinity-purified as described (28Hsu L.-S. Tsou A.-P. Chi C.-W. Lee C.-H. Chen J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). To express human CaMKK β isoforms, the cDNA encoding each isoform was amplified from the brain cDNA or corresponding EST clones by PCR and subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). The identity of the resultant plasmids was confirmed by sequence analyses. Plasmids of pFLAG-CMV-CaMKK β and pFLAG-CMV were transfected into human non-small cell lung cancer cell line H-1299 by electroporation as described (30Chen J.-Y. Funk W.D. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cell lysates were prepared by incubating cells for 10 min on ice in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, leupeptin (1 µg/ml), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged CaMKK β protein, cell lysates (300 µg protein) were preincubated with 1 µg of mouse IgG at 4 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 7 µl of protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for an additional 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants were incubated with 3 µg of mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 4 °C for 1 h, and the antigen-antibody complex was precipitated by a further incubation of the mixture with 10 µl of protein G-agarose beads for 3 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer twice, followed by two washes with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm MgCl2). For autophosphorylation assay, the precipitates were resuspended in 10 µl of kinase buffer containing 0.1 mm ATP, 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 plus 10 µmCaM. For reactions carried out in the absence of CaM, 2 mmEGTA was added instead of 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 µm CaM. For kinase activity assay, 4 µg of GST-CaMK I or 1 µg of GST-CaMK IV was added to kinase buffer. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated by boiling in Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample electrophoresis buffer followed by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Phosphorylation was examined by autoradiography of the dried gel. BAC DNA was labeled with biotin-14-dATP with the BioNickTM DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human metaphase slide (Vysis Inc., Downers Grove, IL) was denatured in 70% formamide and 2× SSC at 76 °C for 5 min, dehydrated sequentially in 70, 80, and 90% ethanol, and air-dried. The labeled probe (200 ng) was mixed with 10 µg of Cot-1 DNA and precipitated by ethanol. After centrifugation, the probe was re-dissolved in 10 µl of hybridization buffer (70% formamide and 2.8× SSC) and loaded on the slide. After hybridization at 37 °C overnight in a humid chamber, the slide was washed 3 times with 50% formamide and 2× SSC at 45 °C for 10 min each, 1 time with 2× SSC at room temp for 5 min, and 3 times with PN buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P40) at room temp for 10 min each. After blocking in PN buffer containing 5% nonfat dry milk at room temp for 1 h, the slide was incubated with 100 µl of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin (obtained from Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) solution (0.6 µg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin in blocking buffer) at 37 °C for 5 min. After washing twice with PN buffer at 37 °C for 10 min each, the slide was blocked in blocking buffer for 30 min and then incubated with 100 µl of biotin-anti-avidin antibody (Vector) solution (1.2 µg biotinylated-anti-avidin antibody in blocking buffer) at 37 °C for 5 min. After washing with PN buffer followed by another blocking procedure, the slide was incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin as described above. After washing with PN buffer, the slide was counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. We previously reported the isolation of two human CaMKK β cDNA fragments, termed K5 and K6, that have different 3′-sequences (28Hsu L.-S. Tsou A.-P. Chi C.-W. Lee C.-H. Chen J.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1998; 5: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). To further delineate the expression of these two cDNAs, Northern blot analyses were performed using probes derived from the common 5′ region and the 3′-sequences specific to the individual cDNA species (Fig. 1 A). A signal of 5.6 kb was readily detected when a human multiple tissue blot was hybridized against the probe derived from the 5′-sequences common to both CaMKK β cDNAs (Fig. 1 B). The 5.6-kb mRNA species was highly expressed in brain and to a lesser degree in other tissues. We also noted a weak signal corresponding to 2.9 kb in the brain tissue. When the same blot was differentially hybridized with K5- or K6-specific probes, the 5.6-kb species was detected only by the K5-specific probe; on the contrary, the 2.9-kb species was detected only by the K6-specific probe. Similar results were observed when Northern analysis was performed with RNA prepared from human glioblastoma/astrocytoma U-87 MG cells (Fig. 1 C). These results indicated that the two human CaMKK β cDNAs previously identified were derived from two distinct transcripts. Both transcripts are expressed predominantly in the brain, with the 5.6-kb transcript as the major species. Full-length sequences of these two cDNAs were obtained through a combination of approaches. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments were carried out to further extend the sequences of the 5′-end. A BAC clone containing the humanCaMKK β gene was screened and analyzed for exonic regions encoding the 3′-ends. The human expressed sequence tag (EST) database was also searched for entries that match the sequence of humanCaMKK β. The major transcript (5592 bp), designated asCaMKK β1, encodes an open reading frame of 588 amino acids that are identical to the recently published human CaMKK β sequence (15Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.-H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The minor transcript (2960 bp) encodes the CaMKK β2, which contains 533 amino acids. The CaMKK β1 and β2 share an identical 532 amino acids at the N termini. The kinase catalytic domain and CaM binding domain are located at residues 165–419 and 475–500, respectively. A Pro/Arg-rich region was also identified in the catalytic region at residues 204–225.

Sequence analysis of these genomic clones was performed using oligonucleotide primers derived from the cDNA sequences. The intron-exon boundaries were mapped by sequencing each exon in its entirety along with portions of the adjacent introns (Table I). The approximate size of each intron was estimated by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers flanking each intron. The human CaMKK β gene spans more than 40 kb and is organized into 18 exons. A graphic representation of theCaMKK β gene is shown in Fig.3. All the exons are flanked by the canonical consensus splice sites, AG at the 3′ splice site and GT at the 5′ splice site (Table I). The exons range in size from 22 nucleotides (nt) (exon 8) to 3174 nt for the last exon. The introns range in size from 143 nt (intron 8) to 6 kb (intron 1). Exon 1 is non-coding. The translation initiation codon ATG is located in the second exon, which is separated from the first exon by the large intron 1. An in-frame termination codon is located 276 bp upstream of the ATG codon in the coding sequence.

https://openalex.org/W2103010767,"The small conductance calcium-activated K+ channel geneSKCa3/KCNN3 maps to 1q21, a region strongly linked to schizophrenia. Recently, a 4-base pair deletion inSKCa3 was reported in a patient with schizophrenia, which truncates the protein at the end of the N-terminal cytoplasmic region (SKCa3Δ). We generated a green fluorescent protein-SKCa3 N-terminal construct (SKCa3–1/285) that is identical to SKCa3Δ except for the last two residues. Using confocal microscopy we demonstrate that SKCa3–1/285 localizes rapidly and exclusively to the nucleus of mammalian cells like several other pathogenic polyglutamine-containing proteins. This nuclear targeting is mediated in part by two polybasic sequences present at the C-terminal end of SKCa3–1/285. In contrast, full-length SKCa3, SKCa2, and IKCa1 polypeptides are all excluded from the nucleus and express as functional channels. When overexpressed in human Jurkat T cells, SKCa3–1/285 can suppress endogenous SKCa2 currents but not voltage-gated K+ currents. This dominant-negative suppression is most likely mediated through the co-assembly of SKCa3–1/285 with native subunits and the formation of non-functional tetramers. The nuclear localization of SKCa3–1/285 may alter neuronal architecture, and its ability to dominantly suppress endogenous small conductance KCa currents may affect patterns of neuronal firing. Together, these two effects may play a part in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders."

In human submandibular gland cells, carbachol (CCh) induced flickery channel activity while thapsigargin (Tg) induced burst-like activity, with relatively lower open probability (NPo) and longer mean open time. Tg- and CCh-activated channels were permeable to Na+ and Ba2+, but not to NMDG, in the absence of Ca2+.

Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Physiologically, Ca2+ store depletion is typically achieved following receptor-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis, generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), and release of Ca2+ via the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) by the binding of IP3 to the IP3R. According to the capacitative Ca2+ entry hypothesis (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar) SOCC inactivation occurs when the internal Ca2+ store(s) is refilled, primarily by the uptake of Ca2+ into the store(s) by the sarcoendoplasmic Ca2+ pump (SERCA). Although the general assumption is that inactivation of SOCC involves a reversal of the activation mechanism, this has not yet been established. Moreover, the precise molecular mechanism(s) that senses the status of the internal Ca2+store to either activate (upon depletion), or inactivate (upon refill), SOCC is not known. Three main mechanisms currently proposed for the activation of SOCC include involvement of a diffusible messenger, recruitment of intracellular vesicles, and a physical interaction between the SOCC and IP3R (4Putney Jr., J.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 5Holda J.R. Klishin A. Sedova M. Huser J. Blatter L.A. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 157-163PubMed Google Scholar). According to the latter, i.e. the conformational coupling model (2Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar), the IP3R acts as the sensor of the internal Ca2+ store and conveys the signal to the SOCC via a conformational change that results in activating the plasma membrane channel. However, store-operated calcium influx is efficiently activated in a variety of cells by the intracellular Ca2+ pump (SERCA) inhibitor, thapsigargin, that depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores without changing cellular levels of IP3 (6Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Thus, there has been much discussion about the direct involvement of PIP2 hydrolysis, IP3, or IP3R in the regulation of SOCC (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Bootman M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 1604-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently studies with the Trp family of putative Ca2+channel proteins, which have been proposed as molecular components of the SOCC, have provided information regarding the possible involvement of IP3R and PIP2 hydrolysis in store-operated Ca2+ influx (9Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For example, some Trps, such as Trp-3 and Trp-6, are activated by PIP2 hydrolysis, likely via an involvement of IP3, diacylglycerol, or PIP2itself (9Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 211-217PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Other Trps, such as Trp-1, can be activated by an agonist or by thapsigargin alone, i.e. without PIP2 hydrolysis (8Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 1604-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Liu X Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it can be suggested that agonists, which result both in an increase in IP3 and store depletion activate a different SOCC channel than that activated by thapsigargin, which induces store depletion without increase in IP3. Alternatively, it can be suggested that both reagents activate the same channel. Since there is little information regarding the single channel properties of the endogenous SOCC(s) in nonexcitable cells, these possibilities have not yet been fully resolved. Previous studies using fura-2 to measure changes in [Ca2+]i have shown that although the rate of activation of store-operated Ca2+ influx by thapsigargin is slower, the final level and the characteristics of the Ca2+influx are similar to that achieved with maximal concentrations of an agonist (3Parekh A.B.

Similar conclusions have been made based on electrophysiological studies, which have mainly involved measurements of whole cell currents (3Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 13Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In these studies the SOCC-associated current was activated by the inclusion of IP3 in the pipette solution. Thus, these studies suggest that SOCC activation might not be due to PIP2 hydrolysis per se but rather due to IP3, acting either directly on the SOCC or indirectly via an effect on the IP3R. Other recent reports are consistent with the involvement of the IP3R in the activation of SOCC (16Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S.

In the present study, we have examined the single channel characteristics of SOCC activated by the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, the SERCA inhibitor, thapsigargin, and the permeant divalent cation chelator, TPEN, in the human submandibular gland cell line (HSG) by using the cell-attached patch clamp technique. We have previously shown that both carbachol and thapsigargin strongly induce store-operated Ca2+ entry and the store-operated Ca2+ current (I SOC) in these cells (13Liu X. O'Connell A. Ambudkar I.S.

The present data demonstrate that carbachol, thapsigargin, and TPEN activate the same SOCC in HSG cells. Importantly, we show that the gating of this channel is regulated by the function of SERCA, which determines the [Ca2+] in the internal Ca2+ store and in the vicinity of SOCC. HSG cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 For electrophysiology and [Ca2+]i measurements, confluent cells were detached from tissue culture dishes and plated on glass coverslips. Measurements were done after 24 h. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 2-APB, xestospongin, or BAPTA-AM for 3 to 30 min, as indicated. CCh and Tg were perfused to the bath at a rate of 5 ml/min. Patch clamp experiments were performed in the cell-attached configuration with pipette solution containing 100 mm Na/HEPES and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2 (HCl). In some experiment 100 mm NMDG/HEPES was used. Total Cl− ion concentration in the pipette was estimated to be about 6 mm. Cells were bathed in a standard bath solution containing (mm): 145 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (with NaOH). This solution was replaced by a high KCl solution containing (mm) 145 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 (with KOH), after the seal was formed. For measurement of Ba2+ or Na+permeabilities, pipette solution contained either 2 mmBaCl2 or 2 mm NaCl, 100 mmNMDG/HEPES, pH 7.2 (HCl), and 0.1 mm EGTA. In addition, 2 mm NMDG-Cl was added to the buffer during Na+current measurements in order to maintain equal [Cl−]. Liquid junction potentials (8.0, 4.3 and 4.2 mV for Ca2+, Na+, and Ba2+ currents measurement, respectively) were calculated using P-Clamp7 software. Currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier and digitized with Digidata 1200 (Axon instrument) at a rate of 4 kHz by filtering at 1 kHz. All experiments were done at room temperature. P-Clamp 7 (Axon instrument) and Origin 6 (Microcal) were used for analyses of data. The probability of the channel being open (P 0) was defined as the ratio of open channel area to the total area in all-point amplitude histogram. The mean amplitudes of the single channel currents were determined from all-point amplitude histogram fit to a sum of Gaussian distributions and were used to calculate the slope conductance. Mean open times were determined from the total open time of the channel. Fura-2 fluorescence in single cells was measured as described earlier (11Liu X Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J.

Images were acquired using an enhanced CCD camera (CCD-72, MTI) and the Image-1 software (Universal Imaging Corp., PA). Analog plots of the fluorescence ratio (340/380) in single cells are shown. HSG cells did not display any significant spontaneous currents at membrane potentials between −80 to +80 mV (115/123 cells, Fig. 1 A shows representative traces in a cell clamped at −40 and +40 mV). However, stimulation of the cells with either CCh (1 mm) or Tg (1 µm) induced channel activity in 67/123 cells (about 54%). Most of the cells activated by CCh (31/35, 94%) displayed currents with a “flicker” mode, i.e. with relatively short openings (representative traces are shown in Fig. 1 B. Note that the traces in Fig. 1, A and B, were recorded from the same cell). Closed “C” (indicating the 0 current level) and open “O” states are indicated in the current recordings at −40 and +40 mV (the pipette solution contained 100 mmNa-Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm Ca2+). The activity was quite stable for 3 to 5 min after which there was a gradual decay. The all-point amplitude histogram for the current at −40 mV (Fig.1 E) revealed one major peak with unitary amplitude of about −1 pA. Occasional overlapping channel openings were seen corresponding to multiples of the unitary conductance level (about −2 pA, see expanded trace in Fig. 1 B which shows simultaneous openings of multiple channels). Since the number of events in the second peak (>1 pA) was relatively low, data analysis was focused on the major peak. The amplitude-voltage (I-V) relationship (Fig. 1 D) of the CCh-induced major current peak (−1 pA), showed a linear fit, reversing at about 0 mV, with a slope conductance of 20 pS (each point was derived from 6 to 14 patches). The NPo of the channel with CCh was 19.6 ± 2.6% (see Table I). Consistent with our previous studies of store-operated Ca2+entry and the store-operated current (I SOC) in HSG cells, CCh activation of the current (both inward and outward) was not observed when either Gd3+ (1 mm, 6/6 cells, see Fig. 1 D) or La3+ (1 mm, 6/6 cells, data not shown), was included in the pipette solution. Zn2+ did not block channel activity (data not shown).Table ISingle channel characteristics of SOCC in HSG cellsActivationNPoMOT%msCCh19.6 ± 2.61.7 ± 0.1CCh + calcium-free bath19.0 ± 1.82.6 ± 0.3CCh + BAPTA loading20.1 ± 2.72.1 ± 0.3CCh + Tg13.8 ± 1.22.2 ± 0.6Tg9.8 ± 0.82.5 ± 0.5Tg + BAPTA loading24.8 ± 4.22.5 ± 0.4TPEN16.1 ± 1.92.7 ± 0.8All measurements were made with 100 mm Na-Hepes and 2 mm Ca2+ in the pipette solution.

Open table in a new tab All measurements were made with 100 mm Na-Hepes and 2 mm Ca2+ in the pipette solution. All activating reagents were added to the bath solution (100 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMg2+). Store-depletion by inhibition of SERCA with Tg also stimulated single channel events in HSG cells (Fig. 1 C), although the channel characteristics were markedly different from those seen with CCh (compare traces in Fig. 1 B with those in Fig.1 C). Majority of cells (26/32, 81%) stimulated with Tg displayed “burst-like” channel activity that displayed longer openings at one current level, than that stimulated by CCh. However, the major peak revealed in the all-point amplitude histogram (Fig.1 F) with unitary current amplitude of about −1 pA, was similar to that in CCh-stimulated cells. Furthermore, Tg also stimulated occasional events corresponding to multiples of this unitary conductance level. In general, the number of these events was less than that obtained in CCh-stimulated cells and could not be clearly resolved in the all-point amplitude histogram. The NPo of channel activation with Tg (9.8 ± 0.8%) was significantly less than that with CCh (see Table I). Thus, there is apparently less channel activity with Tg than with CCh. The I-V relationship of the major (−1 pA) current (Fig. 1 D) revealed a linear fit with a single channel conductance of 20 pS, which was not different from that obtained with CCh. Additionally, Tg-stimulated channel current, both inward and outward, was also blocked by inclusion of Gd3+(1 mm, n = 5) or La3+ (1 mm, n = 6), but not Zn2+, in the pipette solution (data not shown). To further characterize the CCh- and Tg-stimulated channel activities, we measured the relative permeability of the respective channels to various cations. In the presence of 100 mm NMDG + 0.1 mm EGTA in the pipette, no inward currents were seen with either Tg or CCh (Fig.2, A and B,n = 7). However, an outward current was seen between −40 mV and +80 mV. This outward current likely represents K+ efflux via SOCC, as it was insensitive to the Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker, charybdotoxin (added to the pipette and bath solutions) but was blocked when Gd3+ or La3+ were added to the pipette solution (data not shown). When the pipette solution contained 100 mm NMDG + 2 mm Ca2+, both inward and outward currents were seen between −80 mV and +80 mV in CCh-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 B). The I-V curve displayed a linear fit and reversed at 0 mV. The amplitude of this current at the various voltages was similar to that seen when 100 mmNa+ + 2 mm Ca2+ was used in the pipette solution (see Figs. 1 F and 2, B andD). Increasing the [Ca2+] in the pipette solution to 20 mm induced a linear current-voltage relationship, however, the reversal potential shifted to about +20 mV (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained when Tg was used to stimulate SOCC (Fig. 2 A). The permeability of the Tg- or CCh-stimulated channel to Na+ was measured by including 100 mm of Na-Hepes + 0.1 mm EGTA or 100 mm Na-Hepes + 2 mm Ca2+ in the pipette solution. The I-V plots of the currents stimulated by Tg is shown in Fig. 2 C and that by CCh in Fig. 2 D. The calculated conductances for Na+ were 44 and 42 pS with CCh and Tg, respectively. When 2 mm Ca2+ was included in the pipette, the current was reduced. Importantly, similar currents were obtained with 2 mm Ca2+ + 100 mm Na+ or 2 mm Ca2+ + 100 mmNMDG+. The relative current amplitudes measured at −40 mV under these different conditions are shown in Fig. 2, G andH. These data suggest that under physiological conditions (i.e. below −10 mV, with 1 mm Ca2++ 100 mm Na+ in the external medium) the channel activated by either CCh or Tg primarily permitted Ca2+ influx. Na+ did not contribute to this inward current. Na+ influx was seen only when Ca2+ was removed from the external medium. Similar results have been reported for CRAC, a calcium-release activated Ca2+ channel in T lymphocytes. It has been shown that cation currents via CRAC are increased by removing divalent cations (14Kerschbaum H.H.

Our data show that the channel conductance, with either CCh or Tg, is increased about 2-fold when Ca2+ is removed from the pipette solution (note that in our experiments the pipette solution did not contain Mg2+ but the bathing solution contained 1 mm Mg2+).

Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) reported characteristics of the CaT1-induced cation channel activity. This channel also displayed similar Na+ conductance (between 40 and 50 pS) in divalent cation-free conditions. Furthermore, the relative increase in the Na+ current upon removal of Ca2+ and Mg2+ was less than that seen with CRAC. Importantly, the Na+ conductances of CRAC, CaT1, and the channels stimulated by either Tg or CCh in HSG cells appear to be similar. However, the cation selectivity and Ca2+conductance of CRAC is quite distinct from that seen for the channel activated in HSG cells. Permeability of the channels to Ba2+ was also examined by including 2 mm Ba2+, instead of Ca2+, with 100 mm NMDG in the pipette solution. Similar Ba2+ currents were induced by Tg (Fig.2 E) and CCh (Fig. 2 F). In either case, the Ba2+ currents were slightly smaller than Ca2+currents (see Fig. 2 G for the relative amplitudes). The calculated Ba2+ conductance was 15 pS with both CCh and Tg. In aggregate, the data presented in Fig. 2 strongly indicate that CCh and Tg activate the same calcium-permeable cation channel in HSG cells. The activation of this channel by Tg suggests that it is a store-operated cation channel, SOCC. Another interesting similarity in the channel behavior between CCh- and Tg-stimulated cells was that the Po of the channel (with 2 mm Ca2+ in the pipette solution) increased at more negative membrane potentials (data not shown). This behavior is also similar to that recently reported for the CaT1 channel (12Ambudkar I.S. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A major problem in identifying store-operated channels is the lack of specific pharmacological tools. As we have shown above, inorganic cations, such as La3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Gd3+, appear to have some selectivity in blocking various calcium influx pathways. Recently, there has been much focus on the effects of 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) (25Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar), which was first reported to block store-operated calcium channels by intervening with IP3-induced Ca2+ release (19Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, as reported more recently, 2-APB might directly block SOCC and some Trp channels (20Luo D. Broad L.M. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 20186-20189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Braun F.J. Broad L.M. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) but not other calcium channels; e.g.arachidonic acid-activated calcium influx. Irrespective of how 2-APB inhibits store-operated calcium channels, Ma et al. (27Ma H-T. Venkatachalam K. Li H-S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18888-18896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have suggested that this inhibitory effect represents an important functional similarity between invertebrate Trp channels, mammalian Trp channels, and mammalian store-operated channels. Thus, we tested the effect of 2-APB on CCh- and Tg-stimulated [Ca2+]ichanges and channel activation. In control cells both CCh and Tg induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]i, due to internal Ca2+ release in a Ca2+-free media. After reintroduction of Ca2+ into the bath [Ca2+]i was significantly increased, demonstrating activation of Ca2+ influx (Fig.3, A and E). However, when the cells were exposed to 2-APB prior to reintroduction of Ca2+, [Ca2+]i increase due to store-operated influx was completely inhibited (Fig. 3, Band F). This was further confirmed by measuring SOCC activity in cell-attached patches in HSG cells. Cells were preincubated with 2-APB for 3 to 5 min before either CCh or Tg were added. No currents were detected in either case at membrane potentials between +40 and −80 mV (Fig. 3, C and G, shows currents measured at −40 mV, n = 6 in each case). We also tested the effects of xestospongin C (16Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 19Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) on SOCC activation. As seen with 2-APB, SOCC activation by either CCh or Tg was completely blocked by xestospongin C treatment (Fig. 2, D andH, n = 6). Xestospongin C also blocked [Ca2+]i increases due to Ca2+ influx in Tg and CCh-stimulated cells (data not shown, number of cells imaged per experiment was more than 50, experiments were repeated three times). While xestospongin has been suggested as an inhibitor of the IP3R, it appears to be structurally similar to a dimeric form of 2-APB (28van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H-T. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28562-28568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and thus could also have direct effects on SOCC. This possibility has to be further examined. In aggregate, the data described above demonstrate that the channels activated by Tg and CCh have similar pharmacological characteristics. These data provide further evidence that Tg and CCh activate the same SOCC in HSG cells. Fig. 1 illustrates a dramatic difference in the channel characteristics seen in Tg- and CCh-stimulated cells. Possible explanations for this are (i) activation of different channels by Tg and CCh, and (ii) lack of internal Ca2+ accumulation in the Tg-stimulated cells. The data described above strongly suggest that CCh and Tg do not activate different cation channels in HSG cells. To further rule out this possibility and to test the role of SERCA, Tg was added to cells after the channel had been activated by CCh. Tg addition induced a dramatic change in the channel behavior (Fig.4 A shows traces recorded from the same cell used in Fig. 1, A and B. Tg was added to the cell after CCh-stimulated channel activity was recorded. 7/9 cells displayed this change in channel activity.) The rapid and transient openings of the channel induced by CCh were converted to more stable activity, with longer mean open times at the −1 pA current level (see the expanded traces). The resulting channel behavior was more like that in cells treated with Tg alone (compare with Fig.1 C). Additionally, the major current level seen in the all-point histogram, −1 pA (Fig. 4 B), was similar to that seen in CCh- or Tg-stimulated cells. The I-V relationship of the −1 pA current (Fig. 4 C) revealed a linear fit with a single channel conductance of 20 pS, which was not different from that obtained in cells stimulated by either Tg or CCh. The mean open times calculated for CCh + Tg or Tg were significantly longer than that seen with CCh (p < 0.05, n = 6 for each group (see Table I). NPo of the channel with CCh was significantly (p < 0.05, n = 6) higher than the channel with CCh + Tg or Tg alone. These data demonstrate that inhibition of SERCA activity in CCh-stimulated HSG cells induces a dramatic change in the activity of SOCC. We suggest that the “flicker” mode of SOCC seen with CCh is due to the following sequence of events: (i) activation by IP3-dependent release of Ca2+ from the internal Ca2+ store, (ii) Ca2+-dependent feedback inhibition of the IP3R and SOCC, (iii) SERCA-dependent uptake of Ca2+ into the store, and (iv) refill-dependent inactivation of SOCC. Thus, inhibition of"

We used the whole-cell patch-clamp technique on surgically excised human retina to examine whether human photoreceptors can elicit action potentials. We discovered that human rod photoreceptors express voltage-gated Na+ channels, and generate Na+ action potentials, in response to membrane depolarization from membrane potentials of −60 or −70 mV. Na+ spikes in human rods were elicited at the termination of a light response that hyperpolarized the potential well below −50 mV. This served to amplify the release of a neurotransmitter when a bright light is turned off, and thus selectively amplify the off response to the light signal."

Currently, four ligand-binding subunits (α1–4) have been identified, all of which are able to form functional homomeric receptor channels. A structural β subunit, which contributes to synaptic anchoring of receptor complexes, does not form functional channels on its own (1Becker C.-M.

Mutant alleles of the glycine receptor α1 subunit gene (GLRA1) have been shown to underlie the hereditary human motor disorder hyperekplexia (startle disease, stiff baby syndrome, OMIM 138491). This disease is characterized by excessive startle reactions, increased muscle tone, and myoclonia. Hyperekplexia mutations cluster within the pore-lining transmembrane segment TM2 and its flanking regions, including TM1 (2Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Curr. Pharm.

Similar to other ligand-gated ion channels of the acetylcholine receptor superfamily, glycine receptor subunits comprise distinct functional domains: ligand binding determinants have been localized to segments of the extracellular N-terminal region and the short extracellular TM2–3 loop. Channel gating, i.e. the transition between the fully liganded closed and open states, has been associated with an intramolecular movement of TM2 (4Becker K. Becker C.-M. Breitinger H.-G. Lehmann-Horn F. Jurkat-Rott K. Channelopathies. Elsevier, Amsterdam2000: 199-224Crossref Google Scholar). Based on the effects of hyperekplexia mutations on channel function, the short loops flanking TM2, i.e. the intracellular TM1–2 and the extracellular TM2–3 loop, have been postulated to act as hinges controlling TM2 positioning and movement (4Becker K.

(Lond.). 1998; 15: 25-40Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) have characterized the TM2–3 missense mutant α1(K276E), which exerts pronounced effects on channel gating. This mutation drives the channel to a predominantly closed form, leaving ligand affinity and channel conductance largely unaffected. In contrast, the amino acid exchange P250T, situated within the intracellular TM1–2 loop, gives rise to channels that desensitized rapidly and completely in the continued presence of glycine (8Saul B. Kuner T. Sobetzko D. Brune W. Hanefeld F. Meinck H.M. Becker C.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation α1(P250T) exerts almost no effect on the open-close equilibrium of the channel, whereas apparent kinetic affinity for glycine and single-channel conductance are reduced (8Saul B. Kuner T. Sobetzko D. Brune W. Hanefeld F. Meinck H.M. Becker C.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1 Here, position α1(250), situated within the short intracellular TM1–2 loop, was characterized as a crucial determinant of ion channel function. Molar volume was identified as the principal chemical parameter governing receptor function: bulky, hydrophobic residues gave rise to receptors displaying up to 200-fold reduced apparent affinity for glycine. In contrast to the wild-type channel, desensitization for these mutants was rapid and complete. Increased polarity at position α1(250) produced opposite effects, favoring wild-type-like receptor properties. For each mutant, channel behavior was best predicted by a combined hydropathy/volume index describing the molecular properties of individual amino acid side chains. Single-nucleotide exchanges corresponding to codon α1(250) were introduced by PCR2-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using an overlap extension PCR approach (9Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) contained nucleotides specific for the amino acid exchange together with a silent restriction site for a rapid check of mutated clones (Fig. 1). PCRs were set up as follows: 1 ng of template DNA; 50 µm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 100 pmol of each primer, and 2 units of high-fidelity Taq polymerase were in the supplied buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). PCR conditions were 5 min at 95 °C for denaturation, 5 min at 50 °C for annealing, and 5 min at 72 °C for elongation in the first cycle, followed by 28 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 50 °C, and 2.5 min at 72 °C. The last cycle ended with a 10-min 72 °C amplification step. The final fragments were cut with restriction enzymes as close as possible to the mutated site to minimize the PCR-generated sequence and reinserted into GlyR α1. All mutated clones were sequenced across the PCR-generated sequence to verify successful mutagenesis using the ABI sequencer system (ABI Systems, Weiterstadt, Germany). HEK293 cells were cultured and transfected, and crude membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (10Sontheimer H. Becker C.M. Pritchett D.B. Schofield P.R. Grenningloh G. Kettenmann H.

Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibody MAb4a was carried out as described previously (11Kling C. Koch M. Saul B. Becker C.M.

For glycine displacement, [3H]strychnine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Zaventem, Belgium; specific activity, 47.8 mCi/mol) was used at a final concentration of 19.2 nm. Using Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA), data were fit to the equation below. dpmspec=(dpmobs−dpmunspec)1+KD[Str]1+[glycine]Ki+dpmunspec(Eq. 1) Here, dpm spec represents specific binding expressed as scintillator counts (decays per minute),dpm obs is the observed radioactivity, anddpm unspec is unspecific binding; [glycine] and [Str] are the concentrations of glycine (varied) and [3H]strychnine, respectively; K D andK i are the equilibrium dissociation constants for strychnine (11 nm) and glycine, respectively.K D was determined for GlyR α1(wt), P250F, and P250L subunits by displacement of unlabeled strychnine with 9.6 nm [3H]strychnine as described. The same equation was used, replacing [glycine] with [cold strychnine], andK i by K D. K D = 11 nm was then used for analysis of glycine displacement data. Whole-cell recording experiments were performed using a HEKA EPC9 amplifier (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) controlled by Pulse software (HEKA). Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany) using a Sutter P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter, Novato, CA). Ligand was applied using a U-tube (12Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 2325-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) that bathed the suspended cell in a laminar flow of solution, giving a time resolution for equilibration of 10–30 ms (13Udgaonkar J.B.

Given the extremely fast desensitization of mutants P250I and P250L, an underestimation of their EC50 and τdesens values at near-saturating ligand concentrations cannot be excluded. The external buffer consisted of 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 5.0 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH); the internal buffer was 120 mm CsCl, 20 mmN(Et)4Cl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 11 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Current responses were measured at room temperature (21 °C–23 °C) at a holding potential of −60 mV. Dose-response curves were constructed from the peak current amplitudes obtained with at least seven appropriately spaced glycine concentrations in the range 5–10,000 µm glycine. Using a nonlinear algorithm, dose-response data were fitted to the Hill equation shown below.IglycineIsat=[Glycine]nHill[Glycine]nHill+EC50nHill(Eq. 2) Iglycine is the current amplitude at a given glycine concentration, Isat is the current amplitude at saturating concentrations of glycine, EC50 is the glycine concentration producing half-maximal current responses, andn Hill is the Hill coefficient. Currents from each individual cell were normalized to the maximum response at saturating glycine concentrations. For desensitization analysis, the decaying current phase was fitted with either a single or a double exponential decay function plus a constant as shown by the following equation.Iobs=I1×exp(−t/τ1)+I2×exp(−t/τ2)+Iconst(Eq. 3) Iobs is the observed current, I1 is the fraction of current amplitude decaying with time constant τ1, I2 is the fraction of current amplitude decaying with time constant τ2, and Iconst.is the nondesensitizing current fraction. Generally, only a single exponential function was required to fit current desensitization. To establish a combined index reflecting the effects of both molar volume and charge of residue 250, the mean molar volume (vol(mean)) of all investigated residues was calculated (88.8 ml/mol) based on data by Zamyatnin (15Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The index was then computed as shown below.[vol(residue)−(vol(mean)]10(Eq. 4) Values ranged from −4.5 to 3.5. These volume index values were added to the corresponding hydropathy indices as described by Engelmanet al. (16Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar), yielding the combined hydropathy/volume index (HVI).

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a series of GlyR α1(250) point mutants was generated using an overlap extension PCR protocol for site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). After transfection of HEK293 cells with wild-type and mutant GlyR α1 subunits, Western blot analysis using the monoclonal antibody MAb4a verified significant levels of expression with all newly generated mutants (Fig. 2). All subunits gave whole-cell current responses to glycine stimulation (Fig.3).Figure 3Whole-cell current traces of glycine receptor α1(250) mutants.

Whole-cell current traces were obtained at saturating concentrations of glycine (500 µmfor α1(wt) and α1(P250A/G/S), 2 mm for P250C/T/Y/Q/E/R/F, 5 mm for P250V, and 10 mmfor α1P250I/L).

The time resolution for equilibration of a single cell with ligand was 10–30 ms (14Hess G.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Breitinger H.-G. Neuroscientist. 2001; 7: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which was fast enough to separate the individual steps of receptor activation from the slower process of desensitization. In our system, homomeric α1 wild-type GlyRs showed practically no desensitization (<5%) during a 10-s application of glycine, and whole-cell currents returned to baseline after removal of glycine (Fig. 3). Dose-response curves for GlyR α1 mutants are presented in Fig.4. Comparison of the channel properties of mutant receptors revealed significant differences in both desensitization behavior and apparent ligand affinities in whole-cell current recordings (Figs. 3 and 4; TableI).Table IFunctional properties of glycine receptor α1(P250) mutantsTable IFunctional properties of glycine receptor α1(P250) mutants These functional changes were found to relate to the chemical structure of residue 250, permitting a classification of GlyR α1(250) mutants into the four categories below. (i) A wild-type-like group of homomeric GlyRs, comprising the constructs P250 (wild type), P250G, P250A, and P250S, showed nondesensitizing current responses and a high apparent glycine affinity (EC50, ∼10 µm). (ii) A group comprising the constructs P250V/I/L/F, which desensitized rapidly and displayed dramatically increased EC50 values (200–1800 µm), also included the hyperekplexia mutant α1(P250T) (Table I). (iii) Constructs exhibiting intermediate channel properties included P250C and P250Y. EC50 values were increased approximately 5-fold, and desensitization was pronounced, albeit slow. (iv) A group of nondesensitizing constructs displaying a 5–8-fold reduced ligand affinity included P250E/R/Q. Aliphatic amino acids do not differ significantly with respect to the molar properties of their side chains such as polarity, dielectric constant, hydrophilicity/polarity, and so forth. Thus, the aliphatic series A-P-V-I-L-F permitted the isolated analysis of the molecular parameter side chain volume. Indeed, the EC50 values determined for mutants P250A/P/V/I/L correlated with molecular volume (15Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and desensitization rates and EC50 values changed in parallel (Fig. 5; Table I). No such correlation was observed for amino acids containing heteroatoms. With the exception of α1(P250T) (EC50 = 192 µm; Table I), EC50 values were below 100 µm. Due to the limits of time resolution of the application system, Imax and τdesens values observed for the rapidly desensitizing mutants P250I/L might even be underestimated at higher glycine concentrations (e.g. [glycine] > EC70). A comparison of whole-cell currents recorded from the mutants P250Y and P250F showed that tyrosine caused a pronounced but slow desensitization (τdesens = 2.8 s), whereas desensitization induced by phenylalanine was rapid (Table I; Fig. 4). For P250F, only three cells produced significant current responses to 2000 µmglycine, with desensitization being rapid and complete. Still, the ligand concentration used may have been nonsaturating. Introduction of cysteine, the thiol homologue of serine, into position 250 also resulted in distinct desensitization (τdesens = 3.3 s), most likely due to increased bulk. Desensitization for P250T, however, was significantly faster than that for P250C, despite similar side chain volumes (Table I; Fig. 4). Based on the observation that the volume effect of aliphatic side chains was counteracted by polarity, an attempt was made to establish an index combining both parameters. An index for relative molecular volumes was generated based on data by Zamyatnin (15Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), ranging from −4.5 (G) to 3.5 (Y). To account for polarity, hydropathy index values according to Engelman et al. (16Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar) were added without further weighting of these index scales. This procedure yielded a combined HVI ranging from −10 (R) to 7 (F). As shown in Fig. 5 (inset), HVI was predictive for receptor desensitization, because desensitization was only observed for α1(250) amino acid residues characterized by HVI values ≥ 0. Negative HVI values corresponded to nondesensitizing channel behavior (Table I). Consistent with similar HVI values for residues with hydrocarbon side chains and their hydroxylated counterparts, comparison of aliphatic and hydroxylated α1(250) residues showed that aliphatic OH-groups were without detectable effect on receptor function. Small α1(250) residues like alanine and serine both gave rise to wild type-like channels. Threonine and valine also produced almost identical receptor channels (P250T, τdesens = 0.12 s and EC50 = 192 µm; P250V, τdesens = 0.25 s and EC50 = 391 µm). Apparent affinities from kinetic studies do not allow an isolated characterization of the ligand binding step of receptor activation. Whereas equilibrium ligand binding studies may favor the desensitized receptor state, they nevertheless permit a comparison of relative ligand affinities between receptor mutants. Using [3H]strychnine displacement by unlabeled strychnine, antagonist binding was found to be unaffected by the chemical nature of residue α1(250): equilibrium K Dvalues were 11 nm for the wild type, 9 nm for P250F, and 14 nm for P250L (Fig.6 A). Likewise, glycine-displaceable [3H]strychnine binding for wild-type and P250A/C/V/F/L subunits (Fig. 6 B) yieldedK i values ranging from 25 to 98 µm. In contrast to pronounced alterations of apparent ligand affinities (EC50) observed in electrophysiological studies, no significant differences in equilibrium agonist affinities were found. These results indicate that the molecular structure of the ligand binding region is not significantly altered by the amino acid exchanges studied here. Apparently, the intracellular mutation site had no effect on the extracellular process of ligand reception, consistent with findings from an alanine scan of the same region (6Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Strychnine-sensitive GlyRs are the principal carriers of inhibitory synaptic transmission in mammalian spinal cord and brain stem. The human neurological disorder hyperekplexia has been associated with mutant alleles of GLRA1, the gene encoding the GlyR α1 subunit (1Becker C.-M. Neuroscientist. 1995; 1: 130-141Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Breitinger H.G. Becker C.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998; 4: 315-334PubMed Google Scholar, 4Becker K. Becker C.-M. Breitinger H.-G. Lehmann-Horn F. Jurkat-Rott K. Channelopathies. Elsevier, Amsterdam2000: 199-224Crossref Google Scholar). Among these, the mutation GlyR α1(P250T), which causes an amino acid exchange within the short cytoplasmic loop linking transmembrane segments 1 and 2, results in dramatically increased desensitization and reduced single-channel conductance (8Saul B. Kuner T. Sobetzko D. Brune W. Hanefeld F. Meinck H.M. Becker C.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we identified molecular parameters of position α1(250) that govern GlyR channel function. After verifying that recombinant expression was not detectably affected by amino acid exchanges in position 250, the functional effects of amino acid substitutions in position α1(250) of the human GlyR were studied on recombinant receptors using patch-clamp techniques. This led to the identification of the four subunit categories below. (i) Small side chains (P/G/A/S) gave rise to wild-type-like channels, showing nondesensitizing current responses and a high apparent glycine affinity. The wild-type proline is in fact the bulkiest of these residues. (ii) Bulky aliphatic residues produced a dramatically reduced apparent ligand affinity and desensitized rapidly. The extent of functional impairment correlated with side chain volumes of A/P/V/I/L/F and hydroxylated residue T. (iii) Intermediate constructs (C/Y) showed slightly reduced apparent ligand affinity in whole-cell current measurements and slow but distinct desensitization. Because both side chains are expected to be partially ionized at physiological pH, the effects on receptor function may be attributed to their electrostatic properties. This suggests that side chain volume is not an exclusive determinant of receptor channel function but is counteracted by polarity or charge. (iv) Polar residues (Q/E/R) were nondesensitizing and displayed moderately reduced apparent ligand affinities (TableII). Similar to P250C/Y, the presence of a full charge or a polar center in these mutants counteracted the effect of bulk, favoring nondesensitizing, high-affinity channels.Table IIRadioligand displacement dataSubunitStrychnine K DGlycineK inmµmα1 wt11 ± 568 ± 7α1(P250A)n.d.1-an.d., not determined.75 ± 16α1(P250C)n.d.31 ± 6α1(P250F)9 ± 424 ± 4α1(P250V)n.d.98 ± 18α1(P250L)14 ± 866 ± 81-a n.d., not determined. Open table in a new tab Among the aliphatic set of subunits, rapid desensitization corresponded to reduced apparent ligand affinity as observed in current recordings, an effect not paralleled by alterations in equilibrium ligand binding affinities. Apparently, increased side chain volume favored the rapidly desensitizing, low-affinity receptor form. This resembles the modulation of GlyRs by aliphatic alcohols and anesthetics, where the molar volume of a single amino acid residue was found to influence drug responses (18Wick M.J. Mihic S.J.

Becker, H.-G. Breitinger, and C.-M. Becker, manuscript in preparation.With all the other subunit mutants analyzed here, an amino acid substitution effected the change of more than one chemical parameter. Our observations indicate that molecular volume and polarity exerted opposing effects on receptor function: increased polarity opposed the effects of volume. This was most evident from those amino acids that carry either a fully charged (R and E), or a polar (C, Y, and N) side chain (note that the pK A for sulfhydryl groups is around 7, so partial deprotonation of this group can be expected, rendering the side chain of cysteine more polar than that of threonine). Given similar side chain volumes, increased polarity thus favored wild-type-like channel properties. When the effects of bulk and polarity in position α1(250) were described by a combined HVI, receptor desensitization was observed only for amino acids displaying an HVI ≥ 0, whereas negative HVI values were indicative of nondesensitizing channel variants. Indeed, preponderance of HVI values showed that the two isotropic forces volume and hydropathy were sufficient to account for the observed effects of residue α1(250) on recombinant GlyR function. It should be emphasized that the definition of the volume and hydropathy index, and thus the zero point of HVI, was arbitrary. Still, this index shows that the combined effects of volume and hydropathy (polarity) are sufficient to describe the effects of residue 250 side chain structure on receptor function. The amino acid bond introduced into the protein backbone by proline usually favors kinks or narrow turns in polypeptide chains, breaking α-helical formations. However, as shown in Fig. 5, the molecular volume of proline alone, and not its conformation, was sufficient to account for the observed functional properties. The functional characteristics of GlyR α1(250) mutants were (i) unaltered equilibrium ligand binding, (ii) unaltered channel gating (close-open transition), and (iii) a change in the signal transduction process. This suggests that the amino acid exchanges induced a subtle reorientation of the receptor protein, which did not extend to the extracellular ligand binding pocket. In structural terms, the tether holding TM1 and TM2 is altered so that the shape of the ion pore is changed, leaving the gating movement of TM2 unaffected. This model is consistent with a reduced single-channel conductance observed for the α1(P250T) mutant (8Saul B. Kuner T. Sobetzko D. Brune W. Hanefeld F. Meinck H.M. Becker C.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 869-877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).1 Receptor desensitization was greatly favored by increased hydrophobic volume at the hyperekplexia locus α1(250). The effects of these mutations on the overall spatial structure of the receptor protein seem minor yet are sufficient to affect single-channel conductance and the internal signal transduction process T in the sequential R-T-E-D model of ligand-gated receptor function (Reception of ligand-Transduction of signal within the protein-Effect (channel opening/closing)-Desensitization). Structurally, increased steric demand could disturb the geometry of the intracellular hinge that defines the position of TM2, thereby driving the channel-forming part of the receptor to the closed, desensitized state. Alternatively, the increased hydrophobic surface may promote interactions with other intracellular domains of receptor polypeptides. In this case, the structural transition underlying desensitization may include an intrinsic block of the open channel, effected by motile elements within the cytosolic TM3–4 loop (21Nikolic Z.

Tools for the investigation of elementary steps of ligand-gated ion channel function are presently available, whereas identification of the structural origin of receptor desensitization still requires further investigation.

The ATPase activity of the D1 but not of the D2 domain is required for intra-Golgi protein transport and in vitro SNARE complex disassembly (34Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29182-29188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies revealed that individual N domains consist of two subdomains with an intervening groove. Both the side chains that line the groove between the N subdomains (38Yu R.C. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and a flexible loop connecting the subdomains (39May A.P. Misura K.M.S. Whiteheart S.W. Weis W.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have been suggested to serve as a SNAP-binding site. However, the nature and the stoichiometry of the NSF-SNAP interaction remain largely unknown. To investigate the NSF-SNAP interaction further, we determined the stoichiometry of these proteins in 20 S particles and the overall mass of 20 S particles. Our results indicate that three αSNAP monomers are present in a 20 S particle, and we hypothesize that this oligomerization of αSNAP by SNARE complexes is sufficient to recruit a single NSF hexamer into a 20 S particle. These data led us to develop a binding assay to examine the requirement for oligomerization in the interaction between αSNAP and NSF. NSF and SNAP (or domains thereof) were expressed as fusion proteins with synthetic oligomerization domains derived from heptad repeat sequences that form oligomeric coiled-coils. Heptad repeats share the sequence periodicity (abcdefg)n with hydrophobic amino acids at positions a and d, and n indicates the number of repeats (40McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These sequences were initially identified in tropomyosin where they mediate homodimerization (41Hodges R.S. Sodek J. Smillie L.B. Jurasek L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 299-310Crossref Google Scholar). Heptad repeat domains have subsequently been shown to direct trimerization, tetramerization, and pentamerization of polypeptides (42Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T.

Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The identity of the amino acid residues in positions a and d can determine the degree of homo-oligomerization (42Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), and cysteines can stabilize oligomers by forming interhelical disulfide bridges (44Efimov V.P.

We prepared fusion proteins consisting of the following: (i) the N domain of NSF and the pentamerization domain of the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, while omitting the D1 and the D2 (oligomerization) domains of NSF; and (ii) αSNAP and the trimerization domain of thrombospondin. In the latter case, the trimerization domain replaces the function of the SNARE complexes that act as an oligomerization domain by providing three αSNAP-binding sites (25Hayashi T. Yamasaki S.

Binding studies with these fusion proteins demonstrated that oligomerization of the N domain of NSF and trimerization of αSNAP are a driving force behind their interaction. For scanning transmission electron microscopy, 20 S particle preparations (16Hohl T.M. Parlati F. Wimmer C. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Engelhardt H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were stabilized with 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and applied to thin carbon films, supported by a fenestrated carbon layer that covered the gold-coated copper grid. The grids were washed in 6 drops of quartz double-distilled water and freeze-dried at −80 °C overnight in the STEM HB-5 microscope. Digital images were subsequently recorded from the unstained samples at a nominal magnification of × 200,000, using doses of 200–400 electrons/nm2 and an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The mass evaluation was performed with the specialized program package IMPSYS run on a VAX computer system (46Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Individual particles visually discernible on the images were selected by enclosing them in circles. For each of these defined areas, the total number of electrons elastically scattered by the particle and its supporting carbon film was calculated, and the signal from an equivalent area of carbon film alone was subtracted. For thin samples, this signal is directly proportional to the mass. Details of the instrument's calibration and the technique of STEM mass measurement may be found in Refs. 46Müller S.A. Goldie K.N.

The beam-induced mass loss was determined experimentally by repeatedly scanning the same grid region and monitoring the change in sample mass (46Müller S.A. Goldie K.N. Bürki R. Häring R. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 317-334Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The mass analysis data sets were corrected accordingly. Three different 20 S particle purification procedures were utilized in the quantitative amino acid analysis. In the first procedure (Table I, experiment 1), 20 S particles were assembled on immobilized GST-αSNAP and purified by velocity centrifugation as described (16Hohl T.M. Parlati F. Wimmer C. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Engelhardt H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions containing 20 S particles were mixed with HPC-1 (anti-syntaxin) antibodies covalently cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle shaking. The beads were washed three times in buffer A (25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm ATP, and 1 mmdithiothreitol), and bound proteins were eluted with 100 mmglycine, pH 2.7, 0.1% Triton X-100, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with acetone, and boiled in Laemmli buffer. In the second 20 S particle purification procedure (Table I, experiment 2), glycerol gradient fractions containing 20 S particles (assembled on GST-αSNAP) were concentrated and loaded on a TosoHaas TSK500SWXL size exclusion column attached to an HPLC system. The column was run in buffer A, and the fractions containing 20 S particles were collected and precipitated for electrophoresis as above. In the third 20 S particles purification procedure, 20 S particles were assembled in solution by mixing 3.0 mg of bovine brain extract, 120 µg of αSNAP, and 500 µg of His6-NSF-myc in buffer A (final volume 450 µl) and sedimented into glycerol gradients (16Hohl T.M.

Fractions containing 20 S particles were immunoprecipitated with HPC-1 antibodies and processed as above. All immunoprecipitates and column fractions were resolved by electrophoresis on High-Tris-urea gels as described (16Hohl T.M. Parlati F. Wimmer C. Rothman J.E. Söllner T.H. Engelhardt H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Gel slices containing αSNAP or NSF were forwarded to the W. M. Keck Facility (Yale University) for quantitative amino acid analysis using tritiated norleucine as an internal standard. Polypeptides embedded in the gel slices were completely acid-hydrolyzed into their constituent amino acids. The hydrolysis products were separated by ion exchange chromatography, stained with ninhydrin, and quantitated spectroscopically. For each gel slice containing NSF or αSNAP, a control gel slice (matching the sample slice in weight and migration position) from an adjacent empty lane of the gel was utilized for background subtraction. In each experiment, the amount (in nanomoles) of 12 amino acids and amino acid derivatives (Asx, Thr, Ser, Glx, Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Tyr, Phe, His, and Lys) was obtained for His6-NSF-myc and αSNAP. The amount of each amino acid or amino acid derivative was divided by the frequency of the corresponding residue(s) in His6-NSF-myc or αSNAP, respectively. The resulting values for His6-NSF-myc were divided by the corresponding values for αSNAP to obtain a NSF:αSNAP ratio for each of the 14 amino acids or amino acid derivatives measured. For each experiment, the NSF to αSNAP molar ratio listed in Table I represents the average of these 14 ratios.Table IMolar ratio of NSF to α-SNAP in 20 S particlesExperiment 12.15 ± 0.21Experiment 22.42 ± 0.40Experiment 32.32 ± 0.29Experiment 42.21 ± 0.21Preparations of 20 S particles were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R.

The position of a Myc epitope and relevant restriction sites are outlined in Fig.2 B. To obtain pTRI-HIN, a cDNA coding for amino acids 265–314 of thrombospondin (GenBankTM accession number M25631) was generated by PCR using TSP1 as template. The cDNA encoded, in sequential order, a 5′ KpnI site, amino acids 265–314 of thrombospondin, the amino acids CDACG, a camel IgG hinge (HIN), a Myc epitope, a stop codon, and 3′ NotI andHindIII sites. The amplification product was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into pHIN-PEP linearized with KpnI and HindIII. To generate pHIN-TRI, a cDNA encoding the trimerization motif of thrombospondin and the flanking elements was amplified by PCR as outlined in Fig.2 B with a 5′ BglII and a 3′ HindIII site. The PCR product was ligated into pQE9 linearized withBamHI and HindIII. The DNA sequences of the inserts described are deposited in GenBankTM. To obtain an expression vector for αSNAP trimerized at its C terminus (αSNAP-tri), a cDNA encoding αSNAP was synthesized by PCR with a 5′ BamHI and a 3′ EcoRI site. The PCR product was ligated into pHIN-TRI linearized withBamHI and MunI. For expression vectors encoding αSNAP (tri-αSNAP) and αSNAP (residues 157–295) trimerized at the N terminus (tri-αSNAP-(157–295)), DNA fragments encoding full-length αSNAP and the amino acids 157–295 were prepared and ligated as outlined for αSNAP-tri. A expression vector for the N domain of NSF (NSF-(1–207)) was obtained by amplifying DNA coding for the amino acids 1–207 by PCR with a BamHI site at the 5′ end and a stop codon TGA followed by a HindIII site at the 3′ end. The fragment was ligated into pQE9 linearized with the same enzymes. To obtain an expression vector for the pentamerized N domain of NSF (pent-NSF-(1–207)), the corresponding DNA fragment was synthesized by PCR with a BamHI site at the 5′ end and a MunI site at the 3′ end and ligated into pHIN-PEP linearized with the same enzymes. In all cases the restriction sites were added immediately before or after the indicated amino acid codons.

For the purification of all trimeric fusion proteins, E. coli from 12 liters of culture were each lysed in 170 ml of buffer B (25 mm imidazole, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The monomeric and pentameric N domain of NSF was expressed in E. coli in a volume of 6 liters. The bacteria were lysed in 120 ml of buffer B. The lysates were incubated with 0.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 2 h, washed 4 times in buffer B, and eluted with 3 ml of buffer B containing 500 mm imidazole. Aliquots of the eluates were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C.

After removal of the majority of enzyme-bound copper, apoBLO exhibits a decrease in the LTQ content, as evidenced by the drop of the 510–520-nm absorbance, suggesting that the copper may play a structural role in stabilizing the LTQ. The remaining intact LTQ in the apoBLO reacted with phenylhydrazine, both in the presence and absence of the chelator, 10 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl. When benzylamine was used as the substrate, the apoBLO turned over at a rate of 50–60% of the native BLO (after correction for the residual copper and the change of LTQ content). Copper contamination from the assay buffer was ruled out by comparison of enzyme activity using different apoBLO concentrations.

It is well established that decreased LO activity in connective tissues is observed in diseases of impaired copper metabolism, such as the human type IX Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Menke's syndrome, both of which are chromosome X-linked, recessively inherited disorders (2Kagan H.M.

In vitro assays of LO, using tritium-labeled elastin (prepared from chick embryo aorta) as substrate, have led to the conclusion that lysyl oxidase requires copper for enzyme turnover (4Siegel R.C.

Trackman P.C. Shah M.A. O'Gara C.Y. Spacciapoli P. Greenaway F.T. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19022-19027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the lysine tyrosyl quinone (LTQ) has been identified as the active site carbonyl cofactor in bovine lysyl oxidase (7Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Using the UV-visible spectra of LTQ as a probe, we now report the effects of copper removal on the reactivity of BLO with benzylamine and its analog, phenylhydrazine. For the first time, it is observed that BLO retains its ability to interact with amines in the absence of copper. These results are related to the studied role for copper in the analogous 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine-containing copper amine oxidases (8Su Q. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1251-12525Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9897-9904Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We propose that the established physiological requirement for copper in LO (3Kuivaniemi H. Peltonen L. Palotie A. Kaitila I. Kivirikko K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is a consequence of an essential role for copper in LTQ biogenesis, together with a role for copper in the maintenance of cofactor and/or protein structural integrity. Lysyl oxidase was purified from bovine aorta using a modified procedure. 2Manuscript in preparation. The modified method yielded more reproducible results, which are less dependent on the tissue sources, as compared with the published method (10Cai P. Kagan H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 258: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The final purified lysyl oxidase is a two-banded material with the contaminant band content ranging from 10 to 50% of the total protein concentration as estimated from the relative density of the Coomassie-stained bands in SDS-PAGE gels. Earlier studies showed that the contaminating band is free of LTQ (7Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the BLO was assayed in a buffer of 1.2 m urea, 16 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.8), and 10 mm benzylamine at 37 °C. The production of benzaldehyde was monitored by the change in absorbance of 250 nm, using 12,800m−1 cm−1 as the molar extinction coefficient. The BLO activity was typically 0.02–0.04 units/mg after correction for the contaminating band. Unless specified specifically that other methods were used, the protein concentration was measured with Bio-Rad protein assay (Bradford assay) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The removal of copper from bovine lysyl oxidase was similar to that described by Gacheru et al. (6Gacheru S.N. Trackman P.C. Shah M.A. O'Gara C.Y. Spacciapoli P. Greenaway F.T. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19022-19027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some changes. Specifically, the enzyme was dialyzed first in a chelating buffer containing 6 m urea, 16 mm potassium Pi, 10 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl, pH 7.8, at 4 °C overnight and then against the buffer of 6 m urea, 16 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.8, extensively for 24 h. Except for the 2,2′-dipyridyl-containing dialysis buffer, the buffers used for apoBLO preparation and assay were run through columns packed with chelating resin (Chelex 100; Sigma) to remove residual copper. Trace metal analysis was performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 300DV inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer, using commercially available metal standard solution. The copper content of buffers was found to be below 0.1 µm(<6 ppb), close to the detection limit. For the activity assay with two different apoBLO concentrations, the apoBLO was dialyzed against a buffer of 3 m urea, 16 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.8, after removal of copper by 2,2′-dipyridyl-containing buffer. BLO has been shown to catalyze amine oxidation via a ping-pong mechanism (11Williamson P.R. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9477-9482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the copper dependence of the reductive half-reaction, we first tested the accessibility of the LTQ cofactor in both the native and apoBLO to the substrate analog and irreversible inhibitor, phenylhydrazine. Table I shows that in the native BLO, the copper content was 11 µm, and the molar ratio of copper to enzyme was about 1:1 (Table I). The LTQ content of the native BLO was 6 µm, meaning that about 50% of the native enzyme was titratable by phenylhydrazine and was catalytically functional, consistent with previous reports (7Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 12Liu G. Nellaiappan K. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32370-32377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, in the presence of 10 mm 2,2′-dypyridyl, the apoBLO reacted with phenylhydrazine and formed a derivative, which absorbed at 454 nm. The copper and zinc contents in the reaction mixture were found to be 0.52 and 0.71 µm (Table I), respectively, which is much less than the amount of the LTQ (4.7 µm). Without the chelator, 2,2′-dipyridyl, the apoBLO also reacted well with phenylhydrazine (Fig.1 B). If the enzyme was denatured with 1% SDS before addition of phenylhydrazine, no appearance of the 454-nm peak was observed within 20 min (not shown). These results indicate that the reaction of phenylhydrazine with the LTQ in the apoBLO is conformation-specific and that transition metal ions such as copper or zinc are not required to keep the LTQ in the correct conformation(s) for reaction with phenylhydrazine. These findings contrast with those observed for the yeast amine oxidase from Hansenula polymorpha expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (HPAO) (9Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9897-9904Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was found that the apo-form of HPAO cannot react with phenyhydrazine until Cu2+, Zn2+, or Co2+ are added back to the enzyme. It has been suggested that the binding of a metal ion to the active site of HPAO alters the conformation such that it can react with phenylhydrazine. Because the LTQ cofactor has a cross-linked structure (between a tyrosine and a lysine side chain (7Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar)), it is likely that the LTQ in BLO is more rigid than the TPQ in HPAO, such that metal ions are not required to orient the LTQ for the reaction with phenylhydrazine.Table IThe LTQ content, activity, and metal content of native and apoBLOEnzymeLTQ content1-aThe LTQ content was calculated from the absorbance at 454 nm using an extinction coefficient of 15.4 mm−1 cm−1 for the phenylhydrazone adduct (7).Activity1-bThe benzylamine activity assay was carried out in a buffer containing 1.2 m urea, 16 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.8), 10 mmbenzylamine at 37 °C by dilution of 20 µl of enzyme stock solution into 80 µl of assay buffer.

The LTQ content reached 4.7 µm, about 74% of that of the native BLO, after dialysis against chelating buffer. The amount of LTQ decreased further to 4 µm, 65% of the original after removal of the chelator. Under certain conditions such as lowering the pH (<7.0) of the chelating buffer, the final apoBLO showed little absorbance at 510–520 nm (Fig.2 A), and its reactivity with phenylhydrazine was down to the base-line level (Fig. 2 B). Addition of Cu (II) ion to this apoBLO preparation did not restore the LTQ peak or its reactivity with phenylhydrazine (data not shown). Noticeably, a new peak at 350 nm appeared in all the apoBLO preparation. Although the exact nature of this new peak still remains to be explored, it is likely derived from the modification of the LTQ and probably represents an unreactive form of LTQ following copper removal at reduced pH levels. As shown in Fig.3, the preparation of apoBLO that was no longer reactive toward phenylhydrazine was still able to conduct redox cycling, suggesting that the modified LTQ in this apoBLO preparation is either able to renature back to its native state during the electrophoresis process or is capable of catalyzing the redox-cycling reaction itself. These results imply that copper may play a structural role in stabilizing the BLO in a conformation that maintains the LTQ cofactor in its correct configuration. It is also possible that the copper-related conformation in BLO may be important in binding of its natural substrates, elastin and collagen molecules.Figure 3Redox staining of apoBLO that no longer reacts with phenylhydrazine. 30 µl of BLO solution (0.67 mg/ml of total protein stock) was used for each lane in SDS-PAGE (12% gel). Protein transfer from the gel onto nitrocellulose paper (0.45-µm membrane; Bio-Rad) was performed at 120 mA overnight. The blot was stained with NBT as described by Paz et al.

Protein markers were in the lanesbefore lane 1 and after lane 2. Theband that runs faster than BLO in A is typically co-purified with lysyl oxidase and has been previously identified as a tyrosine-rich acidic matrix protein (16Cronshaw A.D. MacBeath J.R.E.

Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Table I shows that apoBLO containing 7% of its copper retained 51% of reactive LTQ after correction for the residual copper content and the decrease of LTQ content. The presence of β-aminopropionitrile, an active site inhibitor of native LO (13Tang S.-S. Trackman P.C. Kagan H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4331-4338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), completely inhibited the apoBLO activity (data not shown). Incubation of apoBLO with 4 µm Cu2+, which was equivalent to the amount of reactive LTQ, at room temperature for 10 min did not increase the activity; however incubation at 4 °C for 48 h did increase the activity by 36% (data not shown), implying that the reincorporation of copper at its original site may be slow. To rule out the possibility that a trace amount of copper from the assay buffer was contributing to the activity measured for the apoBLO, two different concentrations of the apoBLO were used to conduct the assays, and their activity was compared. As shown in TableII, when the LTQ content of the diluted apoBLO in the assay was 0.4 µm, the activity was 54% of that of the native BLO after correction for the decrease of the LTQ and for the residual copper content in the apoBLO. A similar activity (51% of the native BLO activity) was obtained when 5-fold the amount of apoBLO (2.0 µm LTQ) was used in the assay. The level of trace Cu2+ in the assay buffer was measured to be <0.1 µm, which is 4-fold less than the LTQ when using 15.6 µg of protein and 20-fold below the LTQ level with the higher protein concentration. One would expect higher specific activity to be associated with the diluted apoBLO if trace copper from the buffer contributed significantly to the activity measured. Thus, it is unlikely that benzylamine activity observed with apoBLO arises from trace copper contamination in the assay solution.Table IIComparison of apoBLO activity assayed with two different enzyme concentrations77.9 µg of Protein15.6 µg of Protein2-aA 5-fold dilution of the same enzyme stock studied at 77.9 µg of protein.LTQCuActivityLTQCuActivityµm%µm%Native BLO5.0111.91001.002.38100ApoBLO2.000.652-bThe level of trace Cu2+ in the assay buffer was <0.1 µm.27 (51)0.400.132-bThe level of trace Cu2+ in the assay buffer was <0.1 µm.28 (54)The assay buffer contained 3 m urea, 16 mmpotassium Pi (pH 7.8), 5 mm benzylamine, and 77.9 or 15.6 µg of total protein in a final volume of 100 µl at 37 °C.

In an earlier study of HPAO, Su and Klinman (8Su Q. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1251-12525Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar) presented evidence that active site Cu2+ need not change its valence state during turnover of amine substrates. This view is supported by recent studies of Co2+-substituted HPAO (9Mills S.A. Klinman J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 9897-9904Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For this TPQ-containing system, it has been proposed that the active site metal plays a role as electrostatic catalyst in dioxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide. Evidence against an essential role for metal in the oxidation of reduced quino-cofactors comes from model studies of TPQ analogs, together with the fact that the tryptophan tryptophylquinone-containing methylamine dehydrogenase can function catalytically in the absence of active site metal (14Zhu Z. Davidson V.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We have not yet tested the catalytic ability of apoBLO using elastin or collagen as substrate, and more detailed kinetic and spectroscopic studies will be needed to establish that the mechanism of apoBLO is the same as the native enzyme. However, the data presented within establish the ability of BLO to function in the absence of copper using a small substrate or its analog. The well established physiological requirement for copper in LO (3Kuivaniemi H. Peltonen L. Palotie A. Kaitila I. Kivirikko K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) is attributed to an essential role for copper in the biogenesis of the LTQ cofactor and to a role for copper in the maintenance of cofactor and/or protein structural integrity."

Using recombinant KATP channels that lack sensitivity to MgADP, expressed in COSm6 cells, we demonstrate that similar on-cell activity can be observed with widely varying apparent submembrane [ATP] ([ATP]sub). Metabolic inhibition leads to a biphasic change in the channel activity; activity first increases, presumably in response to a fast decrease in [ATP]sub, and then declines. The secondary decrease in channel activity reflects a marked increase in ATP sensitivity and is correlated with a fall in polyphosphoinositides (PPIs), including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, probed using equilibrium labeling of cells with [3H]myo-inositol. Both ATP sensitivity and PPIs rapidly recover following removal of metabolic inhibition, and in both cases recovery is blocked by wortmannin. These data are consistent with metabolism having a dual effect on KATP channel activity: rapid activation of channels because of relief of ATP inhibition and much slower reduction of channel activity mediated by a fall in PPIs. These two mechanisms constitute a feedback system that will tend to render KATP channel activity transiently responsive to a change in [ATP]subover a wide range of steady state concentrations.

He hypothesized that this channel may be responsible for the outward current that is activated during hypoxic conditions and that is inhibited by intracellular injection of ATP. That KATPchannels serve to couple cellular metabolic status to the membrane electrical activity has essentially been confirmed by subsequent work in a variety of tissues. In pancreatic β-cells, inhibition of KATP channels leads to a depolarization of the membrane, provoking calcium entry and insulin secretion (2Miki T. Nagashima K. Seino S. J. Mol.

Results derived from a combination of transferred nuclear Overhauser effect NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the mobile loop adopts a β-hairpin structure with a Type I, G1 Bulge turn. This structure is distinct from the conformation of the loop in the co-crystal of GroES with GroEL-ADP but identical to the conformation of the bacteriophage-panned “strongly binding peptide” in the co-crystal with GroEL. Analysis of sequence conservation suggests that sequences of the mobile loop and strongly binding peptide were selected for the ability to adopt this hairpin conformation.

Escherichia coli GroEL and GroES are, respectively, the prototypical chaperonin and co-chaperonin pair. Together, they comprise the GroE intracellular machine that binds, unfolds, and refolds nascent and misfolded proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Braig K. Curr. Opin. Struct.

GroEL and GroES undergo cyclic interactions of binding and releasing, which are under the control of an “ATP clock,” in which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to cycling (7Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Each functional cycle starts with binding of substrate to hydrophobic sites on GroEL (8Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Subsequent binding of ATP and GroES to GroEL causes a major conformational change in GroEL involving a rotation and twist of the GroES-binding apical domains of GroEL. This conformational change and GroES binding sequester the hydrophobic sites on GroEL and release the substrate into the cavity formed by the GroES·GroEL·ATP complex (9Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 10Weissman J.S. Kashi Y. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). GroES seems to be acting both as an allosteric modulator of GroEL and a competitor of substrate. The GroES 7-mer binds to the GroEL 14-mer via mobile loops located on each of the GroES subunits (11Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The entire mobile loop becomes structurally ordered upon binding to GroEL, although only a hydrophobic tripeptide in the mobile loop physically interacts with GroEL (11Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 12Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Therefore, the folding of at least 16 residues is coupled to the binding of 3 residues to GroEL. A multitude of mutations in the mobile loops of GroES and other co-chaperonins is known to affect function (11Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M.

A. 1997; 94: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since many of these mutations occur away from residues directly involved in forming the binding interface, we have hypothesized that the mutations affect the folding transition (16Richardson A. van der Vies S.M. Keppel F. Taher A. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 52-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, amino acid substitutions within the mobile loop of GroES but outside of the GroEL-binding tripeptide were shown to increase the affinity of GroES for both GroEL and Hsp60, the human mitochondrial homologue (19Richardson A. Schwager F. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4981-4987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The increase in affinity was explained as being a result of decreasing the disorder of the mobile loop or, conversely, preordering the binding structure of the mobile loop. Likewise, changes in GroEL-GroES binding affinity of the bacteriophage T4 co-chaperonin were shown to be controlled by amino acid preferences for β-sheet, which modulate the formation of a GroEL binding β-hairpin conformation (16Richardson A. van der Vies S.M. Keppel F. Taher A. Landry S.J. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 52-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, an understanding of the structure and folding of the mobile loop is essential to understanding the functional interaction between co-chaperonins and chaperonins. Two very different conformations have been described for the GroEL-bound GroES mobile loop. Landry et al. (21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C.,. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) determined the conformation of a GroEL-bound mobile loop peptide using transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (trNOE)1 NMR spectroscopy. Eighty-four trNOE distances constrained the central nine residues of the peptide into a β-hairpin. Subsequent crystallographic studies on the GroES·GroEL·ADP complex indicated that the mobile loop of GroES adopts a “loop” conformation, which does not conform to a particular secondary structure (12Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 22Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Here, we refine the GroEL-bound GroES mobile loop peptide conformation determined by trNOE NMR using unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation in solvent water. We find that the peptide retains a β-hairpin conformation but adopts a standard Type I, G1 Bulge-turn geometry, a structure that explains the sequence conservation in co-chaperonin mobile loops. NMR studies show that substitution of a conserved glycine weakens binding of a synthetic mobile loop peptide and reduces turn formation by the mobile loop in GroES. The refined β-hairpin conformation is virtually identical to the conformation described by x-ray crystallography for the GroEL-bound strongly binding peptide (SBP) selected by bacteriophage-panning (22Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We propose that SBP more precisely mimics a co-chaperonin mobile loop rather than a typical GroEL substrate. The molecular dynamics simulations of GroES mobile loop residues 19–27 were performed using the AMBER force field (23Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) and the particle mesh Ewald (24Essman U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (16022) Google Scholar) method for calculation of long range electrostatic interactions. Explicit aqueous solvation was performed with the TIP3P water model (25Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (30557) Google Scholar), and the simulation systems contained ∼1300 water molecules. The simulation box had dimensions 38.61 × 42.20 × 36.96 Å for Run1 and Run2 and dimensions 37.54 × 43.32 × 35.67 Å for the co-crystal loop structure. Simulations were carried out in an ensemble with a temperature of 300 K and pressure of 1 atm. The time step was 2 fs, and SHAKE (26Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (17193) Google Scholar) was applied to all bonds involving hydrogen. All simulations were executed on a 250-MHz SGI R10000 processor using the software package AMBER 5.0 (27Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.A. Cheatham T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A.

University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar). The 11-residue consensus sequence of the chaperonin binding loop of 77 co-chaperonins was determined by visually aligning the homologous sequences and choosing the residue that was most frequent at each site. All residues within the consensus sequence have at least 40% identity at their respective positions. GroEL and GroES were expressed inE. coli from the plasmid pMESL (28Castanie H.P. Berges H. Oreglia J. Prere M.F. Fayet O. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 254: 150-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a derivative of pET29c+(KMR) (Novagen) withgroESgroEL inserted between the NdeI andEcoRI sites. GroES(G23A) and GroES(G24A) were expressed from derivatives of pMESL, which were constructed using standard site-directed mutagenesis protocols. All proteins were purified using modifications of previously published procedures (29Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the GroES mutant proteins were purified in an identical manner as the procedure described for GroES. E. coli cells were lysed using a French pressure cell, and the lysates were centrifuged at 3 × 105 ×g for 2 h. The supernatant was exchanged into Buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA) and loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column that was equilibrated with the same buffer. The proteins were eluted with a 0–1m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing GroES and GroEL were collected, pooled, and loaded on a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column that was equilibrated using Buffer A. The proteins were eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing GroES were dialyzed 2 times, 1000-fold each, into 50 mmsodium succinate, pH 4.6, at 4 °C over a total of 48 h. A majority of the contaminating proteins precipitated during this step, and GroES appeared to be greater than 90% pure by visual inspection after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The fractions containing GroEL from the Q-Sepharose column were collected, pooled, and exchanged into Buffer B (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl). The GroEL solution was then made 2.5 mm in MgCl2 and 1.0 mm in ATP before passing over a Cibracon Blue 3GA column (Sigma). GroEL eluted in the flow-through and appeared to be greater than 90% pure by visual inspection after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). The GroES mobile loop peptides (Table I) were synthesized as carboxamides using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry, acetylated off-line, and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Identities of the peptides were checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.Table IThe GroES mobile loop peptides used in the trNOE experimentsGroES residue No.:131415161718*19202122232425*26*27*282930313233GroES:Ac-KRKEVETKSAGGIVLTGSAAA-NH2GroES (G23A):Ac-KRKEVETKSAAGIVLTGSAAA-NH2GroES (G24A):Ac-KRKEVETKSAGAIVLTGSAAA-NH2GroES (G24dA):Ac-KRKEVETKSAGdAIVLTGSAAA-NH2Turn position:i+1+2+3+4Residues 21–25 compose the proposed turn structure and are labeled accordingly.

All NMR data were recorded on a GE Omega PSG 500 MHz spectrometer and processed using Felix 98.0 (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Chemical shifts were referenced to internal 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate (0 ppm). For analysis of trNOEs in GroES mobile-loop peptides (Table I), two-dimensional NOESY spectra (30Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar, 31Macura S. Huang Y. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1981; 43: 259-281Google Scholar) were acquired at 30 °C with mixing times of 75, 150, and 300 ms. The NMR samples contained 40 mm potassium phosphate buffer in 8% (v/v) D2O, pH 6.0, 2 mm GroES peptide, and 40 µmGroEL. Peptide resonances were assigned using two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) with a 65-ms MLEV-17 spinlock (32Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2821-2822Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and NOESY spectra recorded at 10 °C, and then assignments were transferred to spectra recorded at 30 °C. The water resonance was suppressed by low power solvent saturation in the TOCSY experiment and by “jump and return” pulses (33Plateau P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) in the NOESY experiment. Two-dimensional spectra were acquired using a spectral width of 8000 Hz in each dimension, 512 increments in t1 and 1024 complex points in t 2. The residual water resonance was removed by convolution before the Fourier transformation (34Marion D. Ikura M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 84: 425-430Google Scholar). All protein NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C, and protein samples were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) with 10% D2O. Protein concentrations were 2.4, 2.6, and 3.0 mm for GroES, GroES(G23A), and GroES(G24A), respectively. None of the 20 structures previously generated by Landry et al. (21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C.,. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) exhibited standard geometry in the turn formed by GroES residues 21–24. This might be due to a paucity of trNOE restraints in the turn or to NMR restraints that derive from an ensemble of conformations. Thus, we chose a single member of the family of 20 structures (frame 17 of Protein Data Bank; code 1EGS) for further refinement by molecular dynamics simulations in solvent water without NMR restraints, reasoning that in the context of the otherwise well defined β-hairpin, the turn may adopt a single preferred conformation. The β-hairpin structure consisted of GroES residues 19–27, with an acetyl group capping the amino terminus and an amino group capping the carboxyl terminus. These nine residues contain the hydrophobic tripeptide that makes direct contact with GroEL. Beginning with this β-hairpin, two simulations (Run1 and Run2) were conducted at 25 °C for 1.3 and 4.2 ns, respectively, using AMBER 5.0. Throughout both simulations, the peptides remained as β-hairpins with the original antiparallel hydrogen-bonding register (Fig.1, A, E, andF). Previous trNOE NMR data indicated that the Hα atoms of residues corresponding to GroES Lys-20 and Val-26 are near each other when the mobile loop peptide is in the GroEL-bound conformation (11Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For both Run1 and Run2, the Hα of Lys-20 and Val-26 remain in close proximity (Fig.1 B). Deviation from the NMR-determined conformation was assessed in terms of the violations of long range trNOE restraints (spanning at least three residues in the sequence). The starting structure violated none of the 12 long range restraints by more than 0.3 Å (21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C.,. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After 1.25 and 2.25 ns, respectively, the structures in Run1 and Run2 violated none of the 12 long range restraints by more than 2.0 Å. This tolerance level is sufficient to accommodate side-chain dynamics but distinguish alternate backbone conformers. For comparison, the GroES-GroEL-ADP loop conformation violated 10 long range restraints by more than 2.0 Å. During both simulations, identical crankshaft conformational changes occurred that involved the rotations of the ψ dihedral angle of Ala-22 and the φ dihedral angle of Gly-23 (Fig. 1, C andD). The conformational changes finished ∼1 ns into Run1 and ∼2 ns into Run2, and the geometry of each turn had changed to that of a Type I turn with a G1 Bulge. Once adopted, this structure remained throughout the duration of each simulation. To compare the intrinsic stability of alternative conformations in the simulation environment, another molecular dynamics simulation was performed using the loop crystal structure determined by Xu et al. (12Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar) as the starting conformation. This simulation ran for 1.4 ns, and the initial loop structure was lost early in the simulation (Fig. 1, A, B, and G). The GroEL binding loop sequences of 77 GroES homologues were examined to determine if sequence conservation is consistent with the formation of a β-hairpin with a Type I, G1 Bulge turn. A schematic of the consensus sequence corresponding to GroES residues 18–28 is shown in Fig.2. The peptide segment representing the consensus sequence is clearly amphipathic, with polar and charged residues before the turn and hydrophobic residues after the turn. The first and last residues within the turn, positions i and i+4, are predominately occupied by threonine and isoleucine, respectively. A β-hairpin structure with a Type I, G1 Bulge turn requires that the amino acids at these positions adopt dihedral angles within β-sheet φ/ψ space (35Sibanda B.L. Thornton J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Studies on the β-sheet propensity of the 20 amino acids show that threonine has the greatest propensity at a site on the solvent-exposed edge of a β-sheet and that isoleucine has the greatest propensity at a site in the hydrophobic interior (36Minor D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1994; 367: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 37Minor D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1994; 371: 264-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Indeed, position i is not immobilized as much as positioni+4 in GroEL-bound mobile-loop peptides (11Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C.,. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, position i is solvent-exposed in the GroEL-bound state, whereas position i+4 is packed against the apical domain (12Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Therefore, conservation at these sites in the mobile loop is compatible with a GroEL-bound hairpin conformation. The glycine observed at position i+3 of the proposed Type I turn is the most highly conserved residue and occurs at this position in nearly 95% of the 77 co-chaperonin sequences. This is consistent with a statistical study that found glycine to be significantly favored at the i+3 position of all Type I turns (38Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The predominance of glycine is explained by its ability to more easily adopt a positive φ angle, which is necessary at this site within Type I turns. The positive φ angle probably facilitates the reversing of the polypeptide backbone to run in the antiparallel direction (38Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The alanine at i+1 and the glycine at i+2 are less well conserved; likewise, there is a high degree of amino acid variation at these sites in all Type I turns (38Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). TrNOE experiments using synthetic peptides and GroEL were conducted to test the hypothesis that peptide sequences that most favor the formation of a Type I turn with a G1 Bulge bind most effectively to GroEL. Four synthetic peptides corresponding to GroES mobile loop residues 13–32 were designed (Table I). Positions 23 and 24 are, respectively, the i+2 and i+3 sites of the Type I turn in the proposed GroEL-bound hairpin conformation. Alanine at position 24 should be detrimental to the turn conformation, whereas alanine at position 23 or d-alanine (dA) at position 24 should be compatible with the turn conformation. The compatibility or incompatibility of the substitutions should be manifest as changes in the affinity of the peptides for GroEL. All the trNOE volumes in Fig. 3 were found to be increasing at 75 ms of NOESY mixing time; thus, the relative affinities of the different peptides for GroEL can be determined by the degree of cross-relaxation observed for each peptide (39Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar, 40Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 423-442Google Scholar, 41Landry S.J. Methods. 1993; 5: 233-241Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Qualitative inspection of the spectra suggests that the G24A peptide does not bind GroEL as well as the wild type peptide, whereas the G24dA peptide and possibly even the G23A peptide bind more effectively. The 1H NMR spectrum of each peptide was assigned by standard methods (42Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) at 10 °C. The trNOE experiments were performed at 30 °C, and the volumes of the nonoverlapping Hαi/HNi+1 trNOE cross-peaks were calculated. Spectra of the peptides in the absence of GroEL yielded no trNOE cross-peaks. The relative volumes of selected trNOE cross-peaks corresponding to interactions within the proposed β-hairpin structure are shown in Fig. 4. Relative to the wild type peptide, a lesser degree of cross-relaxation is observed for the G24A peptide, and a greater degree of cross-relaxation is observed for the G24dA peptide. The values determined for the G23A peptide are almost identical to those of the wild type peptide. Due to the flexible disorder of the loop, the spectrum of GroES contains sharp 1H NMR signals. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy was used to compare structural characteristics of the mobile loops of GroES and two GroES mobile loop mutants, GroES(G23A) and GroES(G24A). 1H resonance assignments were obtained for residues 18–32 of GroES(G23A) and GroES(G24A). As expected for disordered loops, no long range NOE cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra were found for either protein. Furthermore, as previously observed for the GroES mobile loop (11Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), all the Hα chemical shifts are very close to random coil values (43Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). However, for equivalent residues surrounding the nascent β hairpin, the Hα chemical shifts of GroES(G24A) tend to be up-field of the GroES Hα chemical shifts (Fig. 5), whereas the Hα chemical shifts of GroES(G23A) are almost identical to those of GroES (Fig. 5). Upfield deviations in Hαchemical shift are indicative of less β-sheet structure (43Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar, 44Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar). Since the degree of cross-relaxation in the NOESY experiment is related to interproton distance, we measured the volumes for nonoverlapping cross-peaks in the Hαi/HNi+1 region of the spectrum. These protons are in close proximity when a polypeptide is in a β-sheet conformation (42Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Three amino acid pairs produced Hαi/HNi+1 cross-peaks that were well isolated and measurable for all three proteins: Ile-25/Val-26, Val-26/Leu-27, and Leu-27/Thr-28. These volumes were normalized against the Hβ/Hγ cross-peaks of Thr-19 and Thr-28 within the same spectrum. The normalized volumes indicate that a higher degree of β-sheet structure is present at these positions of GroES and GroES(G23A) than in GroES(G24A) (Fig. 6). Furthermore, as was seen with the chemical shift deviations, GroES(G23A) appears to be much more similar to GroES than does GroES(G24A). A combination of experiment and simulation has produced a detailed model for the structure of the GroEL-bound GroES mobile loop. Beginning with a mobile loop conformation determined by trNOE NMR, two unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations produced identical conformational changes. In both cases the β-hairpin adopted a Type I, G1 Bulge-turn conformation. All of the long range NMR restraints remain satisfied at a tolerance of 2 Å, indicating that the relaxed conformation retains the features imposed by GroEL binding. Analysis of 77 co-chaperonin homologues revealed that the amino acid sequence conservation is consistent with this GroEL binding mode. The trNOE experiments revealed that substitutions within the GroES mobile loop peptides favored or disfavored binding to GroEL as predicted by their effect on the GroEL-bound hairpin conformation. When an alanine was substituted for glycine at the i+3 position (G24A), there was a significant decrease in binding. However, ifd-alanine was substituted for glycine at the i+3 position (G24dA), there was an increase in binding of the peptide to GroEL. The i+3 site of a Type I turn possesses atypical dihedral angles, φ ∼ 90° and ψ ∼ 0°. This region of Ramachandran space is occupied most often by glycine because it possesses no side chain (35Sibanda B.L. Thornton J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 59-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, d-alanine is also compatible with these dihedral angles, and therefore, it favors GroEL binding when substituted for glycine at position 24. The structural role of glycine at this position explains why it is almost perfectly conserved among GroES homologs. In contrast, substitution with alanine at the i+2 site has little consequence because there are no stringent structural requirements at this position. The dihedral angles of thei+2 site of a Type I turn characteristically occupy an intermediate region between the α-helix and β-sheet spaces of the Ramachandran plot. Any amino acid other than proline should be acceptable at this site (38Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 45Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1993: 225-226Google Scholar). The slightly enhanced binding of the G23A peptide may be the result of decreased conformational dynamics imposed by the addition of a side chain or possibly a slight increase in the turn propensity. It is probably not due to new intermolecular interactions since a substitution with a polar side chain, serine, had the same effect (data not shown). Since the molecular simulations and trNOE studies dealt with mobile loop peptides, it is important to consider whether the mobile loop has comparable conformational freedom in the context of the entire protein. The GroES mobile loop extends away from the GroES oligomer and is centered within a 27-residue loop that connects two strands of an antiparallel β-sheet. Due to the GroES mobile loop length and general disorder, many conformations are accessible. Inspection of the GroES crystal structures indicates that the mobile loop could easily adopt the proposed β hairpin, whether in free GroES or bound to GroEL. NMR data indicate that the conformational ensemble of the GroES mobile loop is altered by substitutions that favor or disfavor the binding conformation. Alanine substitutions at positions 23 and 24 were examined in the context of the entire GroES protein. A comparison of Hα chemical shifts shows that the substitution at position 24 affects the structure of the mobile loop, whereas the substitution at position 23 has almost no effect. In GroES(G24A), for residues that are biased toward β-sheet in wild-type GroES, Hα chemical shifts move up-field, and Hαi/HNi+1 NOE volumes decrease, indicating that the G24A substitution reduces the bias toward the GroEL-binding β-hairpin conformation by disfavoring the Type I, G1 Bulge turn. However, the extent that binding of GroES(G24A) to GroEL is affected remains to be determined. In preliminary studies, GroES(G24A) has reduced function in vivo and in vitro, whereas GroES(G23A) is nearly indistinguishable from wild type GroES (data not shown). The effects resulting from the substitutions of alanine for glycine at position 23 or 24 are similar to in vivo observations of twogroES mutant E. coli strains that each possess a single aspartate substitution for glycine at position 23 or 24. When the alleles are present in single copy, the groES(G24D) strain does not grow at 43 °C, whereas the groES(G23D) strain grows nearly as well as wild type at 43 °C (11Landry S.J. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The Type I, G1 Bulge-turn conformation is shared by another molecule that binds to GroEL. Chen and Sigler (22Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) selected the SBP by biopanning with the apical domain of GroEL. The crystal structure of the GroEL-bound SBP is a β-hairpin and was discussed in terms of what it reveals about binding of substrates to GroEL. Interestingly, the backbone conformation of SBP and the structures resulting from the simulations Run1 and Run2 are nearly indistinguishable (Fig.7). The SBP structure has a Type I turn with a G1 Bulge and has the same antiparallel hydrogen-bonding register as the NMR-derived GroES mobile loop hairpin conformation. Backbone atoms of the central seven residues from Run1 (1.25 ns) and Run2 (2.25 ns) superimpose on SBP with root mean square deviations of 0.6 and 0.4 Å, respectively. When superimposed on SBP, the highly conserved isoleucine of the GroES hydrophobic tripeptide projects directly into the substrate/GroES-binding site of the apical domain of GroEL. This contrasts with the poor similarity to the loop conformation in the GroES·GroEL·ADP structure, on which they superimpose with root mean square deviations of 2.3 and 2.5 Å, respectively. Perhaps NMR and crystallography have converged on a mode of co-chaperonin binding. Table IIdisplays an alignment of sequences for SBP and the homologous regions of GroES and three other co-chaperonins. These diverse co-chaperonins have as much identity to SBP as they do to GroES. Since SBP, GroES, bacteriophage T4 Hsp10, and bacteriophage RB43 Hsp10 all interact with GroEL, it is possible that SBP is a co-chaperonin mimic in that it possesses sequence elements that are employed by these co-chaperonins for binding GroEL. These features include the highly conserved glycine at position i+3 in the Type I turn, threonine at position i, and two of three hydrophobic residues in the GroEL binding tripeptide. Furthermore, the proline at the last position in SBP is in the same position as a proline in yeast Hsp10. The affinity of Hsp10 for Hsp60 decreased when the proline was changed to histidine or serine (14Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Dubaquie Y. Looser R. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9011-9016Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and conversely, the affinity of GroES for GroEL and Hsp60 increased when the corresponding threonine was changed to proline (19Richardson A.

Open table in a new tab The five positions composing the hairpin turn are indicated asi through i+4. The glycine in bold is the only residue common to all the sequences. The underlined segment of SBP represents the turn residues that are superimposed with the GroES-turn structure in Fig. 7. M. lep, Mycobacterium leprae. These observations suggest that the GroEL-bound conformation of SBP represents the GroEL-bound conformation of co-chaperonin mobile loops. The manner of SBP binding to GroEL was originally proposed to be indicative of a theoretical substrate. However, the backbone conformation of SBP is identical to that of our independently determined GroES mobile loop structure, and SBP is similar in sequence to co-chaperonin mobile loops. Therefore, the manner of SBP binding to GroEL might be better described as that of a theoretical co-chaperonin, thus corroborating the conclusion that the mobile loop of GroES employs a β-hairpin structure with a Type I, G1 Bulge turn when interacting with GroEL. However, this conclusion does not repudiate the reverse argument that SBP and co-chaperonin mobile loops bind to GroEL in the same manner as some substrates. The GroES mobile loop β-hairpin described here differs from the mobile loop observed in the GroES·GroEL·ADP co-crystal structure, which was described as having a loop conformation (22Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Perhaps, conformational plasticity in GroEL binding loops of GroES and other co-chaperonins is functionally significant. Alternate modes of binding were observed for CheA and CheY, which are involved in the chemotaxis signal transduction pathway of E. coli. A crystal structure of a heterodimer, consisting of CheY and the CheY binding domain of CheA, revealed two different binding modes within the same asymmetric unit (48McEvoy M.M. Hausrath A.C. Randolph G.B. Remington S.J. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7333-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the plasticity at the interface was essential to function. Plasticity in the mobile loop might facilitate GroES binding to GroEL in the course of nucleotide- and substrate-dependent conformational transitions by the GroEL apical domains. Given the large displacement of the GroES-binding sites of GroEL during a functional cycle (49Falke S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Rye H.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), plasticity of the mobile loop would permit a dynamic interaction between GroES and GroEL. Furthermore, the binding mode of the mobile-loop could be different for alternate GroEL conformations. The GroEL conformational transitions could affect the GroES-GroEL interaction in a way that would not affect the peptide-GroEL complexes. Although the β-hairpin conformation is accessible to the mobile loop in the GroES·GroEL·ADP crystal structure, the observed loop conformation may be stabilized by constraints imposed by the ADP state of GroEL and/or the crystal lattice. We note that the ATP state of GroEL is thought to have the highest affinity for GroES (7Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We have previously proposed that disorder in the loops moderates binding affinity while preserving specificity (21Landry S.J. Taher A. Georgopoulos C.,. van der Vies S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11622-11627Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); however, the existence of alternate GroEL-bound conformations suggests an additional role. It is possible that, after the mobile loops make the initial hydrophobic interaction with the apical domains of GroEL, subsequent folding of the loops into the preferred β-hairpin promotes the coordinated translational and rotational transitions of the GroEL apical domains. We thank C. Georgopoulos and D. Ang for results before publication and for helpful discussion, O. Fayet for providing pMESL, and K. Steede for technical assistance in protein purification."
https://openalex.org/W2050993210,"A solvent kinetic isotope effect study of electron transfer in two complex flavoproteins, xanthine oxidase and trimethylamine dehydrogenase, has been undertaken. With xanthine oxidase, electron transfer from the molybdenum center to the proximal iron-sulfur center of the enzyme occurs with a modest solvent kinetic isotope effect of 2.2, indicating that electron transfer out of the molybdenum center is at least partially coupled to deprotonation of the Mo(V) donor. A Marcus-type analysis yields a decay factor, β, of 1.4 Å<sup>−1</sup>, indicating that, although the pyranopterin cofactor of the molybdenum center forms a nearly contiguous covalent bridge from the molybdenum atom to the proximal iron-sulfur center of the enzyme, it affords no exceptionally effective mode of electron transfer between the two centers. For trimethylamine dehydrogenase, rates of electron equilibration between the flavin and iron-sulfur center of the one-electron reduced enzyme have been determined, complementing previous studies of electron transfer in the two-electron reduced form. The results indicate a substantial solvent kinetic isotope effect of 10 ± 4, consistent with a model for electron transfer that involves discrete protonation/deprotonation and electron transfer steps. This contrasts to the behavior seen with xanthine oxidase, and the basis for this difference is discussed in the context of the structures for the two proteins and the ionization properties of their flavin sites. With xanthine oxidase, a rationale is presented as to why it is desirable in certain cases that the physical layout of redox-active sites not be uniformly increasing in reduction potential in the direction of physiological electron transfer."

P45 is a weak ATPase that assembles into a large ring-shaped oligomeric complex comprising about 10 subunits. The protein shows no significant homology to any known protein. P45 forms complexes with halophilic malate dehydrogenase during its salt-dependent denaturation/renaturation and decreases the rate of deactivation of the enzyme in an ATP-dependent manner. Compared with other halophilic proteins, the P45 complex appears to be much less dependent on salt for its various activities or stability.

Halophilic archaea that live in environments where salt has been concentrated by evaporation have to face an unusual type of stress. These organisms balance the extremely high external salt concentration by accumulating multimolar KCl concentration in their cytosol (1Ginzburg M. Sachs L. Ginzburg B.Z. J. Gen. Physiol. 1970; 55: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Their proteins are themselves halophilic and function in conditions where “normal” proteins would denature or aggregate because of low water activity and strong salting out effects (for review, see Ref. 2Madern D. Ebel C. Zaccai G. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The stabilization and solvation of halophilic proteins are related to the cooperative interaction of acidic surface residues with hydrated solvent ions (3Bonnete F. Madern D. Zaccai G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Halophilic proteins are salt-binding proteins that unfold when the salt concentration decreases. It is commonly accepted that in the crowded cytosolic environment of all types of cells, the accumulation of exposed hydrophobic surfaces causes irreversible aggregation of misfolded proteins which ultimately leads to cell death (4Ellis R.J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 5van den Berg B. Ellis R.J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6927-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Therefore, a decrease in salt concentration could represent a major stressor for halophilic Archaea that are exposed to hyposaline shock after rain or flooding. Very little is known about the antistress mechanisms that enable these cells to avoid the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cytosol during low salt shock. Cells usually respond to various stressors with the synthesis of a distinct set of proteins known as heat-shock proteins (Hsps), which are ubiquitous in organisms ranging from Escherichia coli to humans (6Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 437-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 7Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar). Most of the stress proteins assist in protein folding as molecular chaperones (8Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3118) Google Scholar), which share the general property of interacting with many non-native proteins and influencing the conformational state of the bound proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (9Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). It is commonly accepted that these properties are also involved in unstressed cells in facilitating protein synthesis, folding, and assembly processes. Among the chaperones, the Clp/Hsp100 family and Hsp60 play a key role as antistress factors by preventing the aggregation of a large spectrum of improperly folded and damaged proteins (10Houry W.A. Frishman D. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 11Leroux M.R. Hartl F.U. Curr.

Sci. 2000; 25: 210-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Hsp100 self-assembles in oligomeric rings whereas Hsp60s, also called chaperonins, are rod-shaped particles made up of double stacked rings (13Ranson N.A. White H.E. Saibil H.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Muller S.A. Huang H.C. Engel A. Baumeister W. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These large oligomeric complexes create hydrophobic cellular subcompartments where misfolded proteins can be trapped. The small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) also consist of large oligomeric complexes that trap misfolded proteins (15Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, their role under stress conditions is confined to creation of a reservoir of non-native refoldable proteins. These can eventually be refolded to the native state in cooperation with true chaperones in an ATP-dependent reaction (16Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 17Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In addition to their antiaggregation effect, Hsp100 and chaperonin complexes have been shownin vivo and in vitro to function in stress conditions by slowing down the protein denaturation process in an ATP-dependent manner (18Hartman D.J. Surin B.P. Dixon N.E. Hoogenraad N.J. Hoj P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2276-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Interestingly, there appears to be an interplay between protein folding and hydrolysis as illustrated by the fact that members of the Hsp100 chaperone family can also associate with the proteasome or its bacterial ClpP counterpart and thus regulate proteolysis through an ATP-dependent unfoldase activity (20Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The study of stress proteins in Archaea is much less advanced than in the other two domains (for review, see Ref. 21Macario A.J. Lange M. Ahring B.K. De Macario E.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 923-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Archaea are prokaryotes that, based on phylogenetic studies and their biochemical properties, can be grouped in a third kingdom of life distinct from those of the Bacteria and the Eukarya (22Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4500) Google Scholar, 23Brown J.R. Doolittle W.F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 456-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Chaperones of the Hsp100 class occur in Archaea as was shown by the characterization of an homolog of the eukaryotic 26 S proteasome-activating complex inMethanococcus jannaschii (24Zwickl P. Ng D.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 923-967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been studied mainly in the thermophilic Archaea where it has been named thermosome (26Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Klumpp M. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and found to be related to the eukaryotic chaperonin system TCP-1 (28Trent J.D. Nimmesgern E. Wall J.S. Hartl F.U. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1991; 354: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The thermosome can function autonomously, in contrast to the bacterial chaperonin, GroEL, which requires the binding of a cochaperonin complex, GroES, for the release of the protein substrate (29Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Little is known about the role of these macromolecular machines in the specific salt stress response of halophilic Archaea. The genes encoding the thermosome subunits from the halophile Haloferax volcanii (cct1 andcct2) were found to be induced both by heat and hyposaline shock (30Kuo Y.P. Thompson D.K. St. Jean A. Charlebois R.L. Daniels C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6318-6324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the conventional heat-shock system could also be adapted to function during low salt stress in extreme halophiles. However, a number of other potential stress response factors have been detected on two-dimensional gels, suggesting the existence of a defense system specific for salt stress (31Mojica F.J. Cisneros E. Ferrer C. Rodriguez-Valera F. Juez G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5471-5481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a attempt to characterize such a system, we describe here the purification of a new ring-shaped ATPase complex from the extreme halophilic Archaeon Haloarula marismortui. To characterize its function, we used the malate dehydrogenase enzyme (HmMalDH) from the same organism as a natural substrate for in vitrochaperone assays. HmMalDH can be unfolded and refolded in vitro by a simple modification of the solvent salt concentration. We were able to demonstrate that the complex, which is not homologous to any known chaperone, displays polypeptide binding capability and hampers the low salt denaturation of the halophilic enzyme in an ATP-dependent manner. In vivo experiments showed that the P45 protein, which forms the complex, is induced when halophilic cells are exposed to a low salt stress. P45 has, therefore, the characteristics of a molecular chaperone involved in stress response. H. marismortuicells were kindly provided by A. Oren (University of Jerusalem). Cells were cultivated in 2-liter flasks at 37 °C with gentle agitation in a growth medium containing 3.5 m NaCl (32Mevarech M. Eisenberg H. Neumann E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3781-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested when the A 660 nm reached 2 by centrifugation for 1 h at 12,000 × g and stored at −80 °C until use. Halobium salinarium S9 strain was from the laboratory of D. Oesterhelt (Max Planck Institute, Munich). Cells were cultivated as described by Oesterhelt and Stoeckenius (33Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). The HmMalDH gene from H. marismortui was expressed in E. coli cells, and the protein was purified and renaturated as described previously (34Cendrin F. Chroboczek J. Zaccai G. Eisenberg H.

Bovine serum albumin was from Sigma. Cell pellets (corresponding to about 30 liters of culture) were thawed and resuspended in 1 volume of buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 2.2m (NH4)2SO4, 40 mm MgAc2, pH 7,6) containing 20 mg of DNase I grade II from Roche. After a 30-min agitation at room temperature, the cell lysate was homogenized by ultrasonication (6 × 10 s) and centrifuged for 60 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged for 2 h at 160,000 ×g. The S160 supernatant was dialyzed for 48 h at 4 °C versus buffer A and then loaded on a Superose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) 5.5 × 30-cm column equilibrated in buffer A. The protein was eluted with a decreasing linear (NH4)2SO4 gradient (2.2–0.4m in a total of 950 ml of buffer A). The P45 protein was detected by immunoblot in the fractions at ∼0.9 m(NH4)2SO4. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to increase the concentration of the pooled fractions to 1.9m. The sample was applied to a DE52-cellulose column (2.6 × 25 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 2m (NH4)2SO4, pH 7.6. Bound proteins were eluted using a decreasing (NH4)2SO4 gradient (1.9–0.5m) and an increasing NaCl gradient (0–2 m) over 500 ml. The fractions containing P45, obtained at 0.8m NaCl, 1.2 m(NH4)2SO4, were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 4m NaCl. The protein sample was applied to a column (1.5 × 10 cm) of hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The protein was eluted at 18 ml/h using a 200-ml linear phosphate gradient from 20 to 300 mm phosphate in 4m NaCl. The fractions containing P45 were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The protein mixture was loaded on a Mono Q HR 5 × 5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 0 to 2m KCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6. P45 was eluted at 1.1 m KCl. The fraction was dialyzed against 3m KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and contained native P45 protein complex purified homogeneously as judged by mass spectrometry and analytical centrifugation analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215879) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207084) Google Scholar). The protein was immunodetected in the fractions as described previously by Franzetti et al. (37Franzetti B. Sohlberg B. Zaccai G. von Gabain A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide deduced from the N-terminal sequencing of the P45 protein (ADLHDPNAEYTMRELSAETM). The P45 protein was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the peptides were purified by HPLC with a reverse phase column according to a procedure published previously (38Cannac-Caffrey V. Hudry-Clergeon G. Petillot Y. Gagnon J. Zaccai G. Franzetti B. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The N-terminal peptide and four others were sequenced using a protein sequencer. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and an AN-60 rotor (Beckman Instruments). 300 µl of diluted protein at about 0.15 mg/ml (A 280 nm) = 0.07) in 3 m KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, was loaded into two-channel 1.2-cm path cells and centrifuged with a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm at 20 °C. Scans were recorded at 227 nm using 0.003-cm radial spacing. Using Sednterp software (version 1.01; developed by D. B. Haynes, T. Laue, and J. Philo) we estimated the solvent density ρ to be 1.132 g/ml, the solvent viscosity η to be 1.019 mPa.s. Direct boundary modeling of the sedimentation profiles by Lamm equation solutions was applied using the program Sedfit (39Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) considering two noninteracting species and taking advantage of a procedure of algebraic systematic noise decomposition (40Schuck P.

In the framework of the model of analysis both the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients sand D are obtained. The diffusion coefficient is related tof/f 0, the frictional ratio, expressing the asymmetry of the macromolecule. The Svedberg equation allows obtaining from s and D the buoyancy molar mass Mb, from which the molar mass Mcan be derived.Mb=M·(1−φ′ρ)=RTs/D(Eq. 1) Because the solvent is composed of two components, an apparent partial specific volume φ′ is used instead of the usual partial specific volume V. We consider φ′ = 0.72 ml/g, which is the mean value obtained in 3 m KCl for halophilic polypeptide elongation factor Tu (41Ebel C. Guinet F. Langowski J. Urbanke C. Gagnon J. Zaccai G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and HmMalDH (3Bonnete F. Madern D. Zaccai G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). V and φ′ are close because the composition of the solvation shell is closed to that of the bulk solvent for these halophilic proteins. The corrected s 20,w was obtained using ρ20,w and η20,w, the density and viscosity of water at 20 °C.s20,w=((1−φ′ρ20,w)/(1−φ′ρ))·(η/η20,w)s(Eq. 2) Protein samples at ∼0.1 mg/ml (in 3m KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6) were applied to the clean side of carbon on mica (carbon/mica interface) and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Micrographs were taken under low dose conditions with a JEOL 1200 EX II microscope at 100 kV and a nominal magnification of 40,000 times on SO163 Kodak film. The ATPase activity assay of the purified P45 protein was performed by using [γ-32P]ATP according to the procedure of Viitanen et al. (42Viitanen P.V. Lubben T.H. Reed J. Goloubinoff P. O'Keefe D.P. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5665-5671Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). 2 µg of P45 or GroEL was incubated in 200 µl of reaction buffer containing various amount of KCl. The ATPase activity was defined as the µmol of Pi liberated/min/µmol of protein. The level of spontaneous ATP hydrolysis has been corrected for in the rate calculations. Conformational analysis of the P45 complex made use of the emission of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained on a fluorescence spectrophotometer at 20 °C. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. The concentration of protein was 10 µg/ml. HmMalDH was denatured at a final concentration of 1.8 µm (60 µg/ml) by adding the denaturation solvent (0.5 m KCl, 50 mm Tris HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6) into the native protein. Spontaneous renaturation was initiated by a 10-fold dilution with 3 m KCl, 50 mm Tris HCl, 10 mmMgCl2 pH 7.6. To test the effect of P45, GroEL, or GroEL-GroES on HmMalDH deactivation, the chaperones were mixed with the native enzyme at the indicated molar ratio. To test the effects of P45 and GroEL on HmMalDH refolding, the denatured enzyme was diluted in the renaturation buffer containing the chaperone complexes. To test the effect of ATP hydrolysis, 5 mm buffered MgATP was added to the association buffer. Bovine serum albumin was also added in a 10-fold excess over HmMalDH as a nonspecific competitor. All incubations were carried out at 30 °C. Aliquots were taken at the times indicated, and the MalDH activity was measured as described (43Zaccai G. Cendrin F. Haik Y. Borochov N. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The activity measurements were carried out at 40 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 m KCl, pH 7.6. The denaturation or renaturation mixtures (final volume, 50 µl) were prepared and incubated for 1 h as described above. Size exclusion chromatography with samples containing P45 were run on an SW G3000 column (0.78 × 60 cm, TosoHaas) mounted on a HPLC chain with a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The samples containing GroEL were analyzed with a Superose 6 (HR 10 × 30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Running buffers were the same as the denaturation and renaturation buffers. The proteins were precipitated from the fractions with 12% trichloroacetic acid using tRNA as the carrier. Precipitates were washed with cold acetone and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with antibodies against HmMalDH. The immunoreacted bands were visualized with an ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After stripping off the antibody, the blots were reprobed with antibodies against GroEL or P45. To investigate the accumulation of the P45 protein under stress conditions, H. marismortuicultures (A 660 = 0.7–0.8) growing in complex hypersaline medium containing 3.6 m (20.8%) NaCl were subjected to reduced salt concentration. The cells were peletted, resuspended in medium containing 1.35 m (5%) NaCl, and incubated at 37 °C with shaking. A time course was effected in which cell aliquots of 1 ml were removed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h. Cells were peletted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were resuspended in 0.4 ml of a buffer containing 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 µg/ml RNase, and 10 µg/ml DNase. The lysates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and cell debris were eliminated by centrifugation. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Franzetti et al. (37Franzetti B. Sohlberg B. Zaccai G. von Gabain A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1180-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples loaded into the gel contained equal amounts of total proteins. The P45 protein was immunodetected by using the antibodies raised against the N-terminal peptide. The blots were reprobed with polyclonal antibodies raised against HmMalDH and the catalase peroxidase enzymes fromH. marismortui. H. marismortui cells, which normally grow optimally in salt concentrations between 3 and 4 m NaCl, were progressively adapted to lower salt conditions such as 2.5 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE of total protein from these cells revealed an abundant protein with an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa. The protein was first purified from this strain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the N-terminal peptide of the protein, allowing its detection in the chromatography fractions. Because the adapted strain that was growing in low salt conditions could not be stored or maintained for a long period, the protein was purified subsequently from wild type H. marismortui cells that were grown under normal hypersaline conditions. The N-terminal sequence of the protein purified from the wild-type cells was found to be identical to the one obtained from the mutant strain. A stained SDS-PAGE showing the different purification steps is presented in Fig. 1. All operations were performed in hypersaline conditions to maintain the solubility and the stability of the halophilic proteins before the last step of the purification where the proteins were denatured by low salt conditions before being resolved by ion exchange chromatography. This last step was necessary to obtain a high purification yield, and the resulting P45 protein shows the same oligomeric properties and biochemical activities (from electron microscopy and chaperonin assays) as those obtained when avoiding the low salt condition, by using an alternative purification protocol in which gel filtration chromatography was used in the last step. We routinely obtained about 0.4 mg of pure protein from 60 g of cell paste. The protein purified from H. marismortui cells was partially sequenced. This allowed the unambiguous identification of the H. salinarium homolog gene by Prof. D. Oesterhelt, who kindly agreed to screen the unpublished sequenced H. salinarium genome obtained by his group. Fig. 2 shows that the sequences obtained had strong homologies with an open reading frame (AAG18988.1) coding for a protein of 45.025 kDa in the sequenced extreme halophile H. salinarium genome (44Ng W.V. Kennedy S.P. Mahairas G.G. Berquist B. Pan M. Shukla H.D. Lasky S.R. Baliga N.S. Thorsson V. Sbrogna J. Swartzell S. Weir D. Hall J. Dahl T.A. Welti R. Goo Y.A. Leithauser B. Keller K. Cruz R. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Maddocks D.G. Jablonski P.E. Krebs M.P. Angevine C.M. Dale H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12176-12181Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The discrepancy between the molecular mass deduced from the protein sequence and the one that we estimated on a denaturing gel is attributed to the strong excess of negatively charged acidic amino acids (the calculated Pi is 4.2), which affects the mobility of the protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as has frequently been observed for halophilic proteins. Because no homologous sequence was found in the complete genomes of other Archaea, we concluded that the protein is, if not specific to halophilic stains, at least very well conserved in halophiles. Furthermore, the AAG18988.1 sequence had no homologies with other known proteins that were strong enough to specify the function of the protein. We concluded that that we have purified a new protein, designed in this paper as P45, and we proceeded to characterize its potential functions. To compare the H. marismortui P45 protein with its H. salinarium counterpart, Western blot experiments were performed on total H. salinarium and H. marismortui extracts using the antibodies raised against the N-terminal peptide from theH. marismortui protein. The result (not shown) indicated that the H. salinarium gene was indeed transcribed and translated as a protein and that both proteins displayed similar characteristics as they migrate on denaturing gels with an identical apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa. We also purified the protein fromH. salinarium with a protocol similar to the one used forH. marismortui (data not shown). Electron microscopy studies showed that the H. salinarium protein assembles in large oligomeric complexes that were similar in size and in shape to those observed with the H. marismortui protein (see below). Therefore, the quaternary structure of P45 is well conserved between two different archaeal strains. Gel filtration experiments suggested that P45 was an oligomeric assembly. This prompted us to examine the size of the native purified complex by sedimentation velocity experiments. Fig.3 A shows the sedimentation profiles of pure P45 at about 0.15 mg/ml. It displays two boundaries nicely modeled considering two noninteracting species. The major species (85% of the material) has a sedimentation coefficient of 10.8 S (s 20,w = 16.4 S) and the minor one (15%) of 4.0 S (s 20,w = 6.1 S). In the absence of complementary experiments performed at other protein concentrations, we cannot ascertain if the presence of the minor species is related to the presence of misfolded protein or to the reversible dissociation of the large complex. For these reasons, we can derive only a default value of 7.7 subunits for the stoichiometry of the complex from the modeling of s and Dfrom the sedimentation profiles. Also, the true value of the sedimentation coefficient s 20,w of the complex could be larger than 16.4 S. However, this value is still quite large; its interpretation requires assumptions about the shape of the oligomer. It would correspond to a complex of 11 subunits if the shape was similar to that of GroEL, 12 subunits considering the more asymmetrical shape of GroES (frictional ratio of 1.3 and 1.44, respectively (45Behlke J. Ristau O. Schonfeld H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5149-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, the sedimentation velocity experiment confirms that P45 stays in solution mainly as a large oligomers. In electron micrographs, the quaternary structure of P45 appeared essentially in negative stain as a ring-shaped complex of homogeneous size (Fig. 3 Ba). Some other views could be found, however, where P45 has an oval shape (see Fig. 3 Bb). The dimensions of the oval shapes are 10 × 11 nm, and they might correspond to a side view of the rings. The ring shape complexes are circular, 11 nm in diameter, with a 3-nm hole in the center (Fig. 3 Bc).There is always one half of the ring which appears clear, and the other is smeared out. By analyzing the clear part (see the enlargment in Fig.3 Bc) and by extrapolation to the other half of the ring, we derived that there are 2 × 5–6 monomer/ring. The total number of monomers in the complex thus appears to be 10–12. Proteins purified from extreme halophiles have been shown to display an unusual salt-dependent solvation mechanism that leads to their denaturation in low salt conditions (below 2 m) (43Zaccai G. Cendrin F. Haik Y. Borochov N. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, we checked the salt-dependent stability of the P45 complex to specify its halophilic character. For this, the protein denaturation rates were studied by measuring the residual fluorescence signal at 332 nm after a 12-h incubation in different salt conditions. The data presented"

The extremely high affinity of these two proteins has been utilized as a powerful tool in many biotechnological applications. Although avidin and streptavidin have similar tertiary and quaternary structures, they differ in many of their properties. Here we show that avidin enhances the alkaline hydrolysis of biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester, whereas streptavidin protects this reaction even under extreme alkaline conditions (pH > 12). Unlike normal enzymatic catalysis, the hydrolysis reaction proceeds as a single cycle with no turnover because of the extremely high affinity of the protein for one of the reaction products (i.e. free biotin). The three-dimensional crystal structures of avidin (2 Å) and streptavidin (2.4 Å) complexed with the amide analogue, biotinyl p-nitroanilide, as a model for the p-nitrophenyl ester, revealed structural insights into the factors that enhance or protect the hydrolysis reaction. The data demonstrate that several molecular features of avidin are responsible for the enhanced hydrolysis of biotinylp-nitrophenyl ester. These include the nature of a decisive flexible loop, the presence of an obtrusive arginine 114, and a newly formed critical interaction between lysine 111 and the nitro group of the substrate. The open conformation of the loop serves to expose the substrate to the solvent, and the arginine shifts thep-nitroanilide moiety toward the interacting lysine, which increases the electron withdrawing characteristics and consequent electrophilicity of the carbonyl group of the substrate. Streptavidin lacked such molecular properties, and analogous interactions with the substrate were consequently absent. The information derived from these structures may provide insight into the action of artificial protein catalysts and the evolution of catalytic sites in general.

This powerful approach has facilitated the localization, identification, and assay of an almost unlimited number of biological molecules (1Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 2Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 14-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Historically, the development and extensive application of the avidin-biotin system was a definitive breakthrough in the area of nonradioactive labeling and detection of biologically active molecules. Chicken egg white avidin and its bacterial analogue streptavidin share a similarly high affinity (K a∼1015m−1) for the vitamin biotin (3Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Despite the relatively modest sequence homology (∼30% identity and 40% overall similarity), the two proteins share the same tertiary fold, similar tetrameric quaternary structures, and a nearly identical arrangement of amino acid residues within the respective binding pockets (4Livnah O.

On the other hand, these two proteins also differ from one another in many of their molecular properties. For example, streptavidin is a neutral nonglycosylated protein, as opposed to avidin, which is glycosylated and positively charged (pI ∼ 10.5). Perhaps because of the differences in their respective molecular surfaces, the two proteins lack immunochemical cross-reactivity. Moreover, when introduced in vivo, avidin and streptavidin exhibit different profiles of tissue uptake, organ distribution, and blood clearance properties (8Schechter B. Arnon R. Freedman Y.E. Chen L. Wilchek M. J. Drug Target. 1996; 4: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Despite the architectural similarity of the respective biotin-binding pockets, minor differences appear to be evident. For example, streptavidin binds peptides containing a His-Pro-Gln (9Devlin J.J. Panganiban L.C. Devlin P.E. Science. 1990; 249: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar) sequence motif, whereas avidin fails to recognize such peptides. In contrast, avidin recognizes a His-Xxx-His motif (10Gissel B. Jensen M.R. Gregorius K. Elsner H.I. Svendsen I. Mouritsen S. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 11Ostergaard S. Hansen P.H. Olsen M. Holm A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), which is not recognized by streptavidin. Moreover, whereas both proteins bind the dye 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid (HABA),1 the binding constant (K a), although moderate in both cases, is about 20-fold stronger in avidin (3Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In an early communication (1Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), we reported yet another puzzling difference between avidin and streptavidin in their capacity to catalyze the hydrolysis of certain biotinyl ester derivatives. Specifically, avidin was found to augment the hydrolysis of biotinylp-nitrophenyl ester (BNP), whereas streptavidin was found to strongly protect the same biotin derivative from hydrolysis. In the current study, we describe the interaction of avidin and streptavidin with a number of ester and amide derivatives of biotin. Based on the three-dimensional crystal structures of avidin and streptavidin that harbor a model biotin-containing nitrophenyl analogue in their binding sites, we propose a mechanism that accounts for the observed differences in catalytic properties. This study may shed light on the role of proximity and orientation in generating new catalytic interactions among selected submolecular components. The information bears general relevance to how catalytic sites are formed. BNP, nor-BNP, and homo-BNP were synthesized according to Bayer et al. (12Bayer E.A. Viswanatha T. Wilckek M. FEBS Lett. 1975; 60: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Avidin or streptavidin (16 nmol of subunit) was diluted in 0.9 ml of weak phosphate buffer (<0.1 mm, pH 4). BNP or other derivative (15 nmol), diluted in 5 µl of dimethylformamide, was added to the desired protein solution and incubated for 5 min at 23 °C. The appropriate pH value was then attained by the addition of 0.1 ml of a suitable buffer (0.1–1.0 m). The hydrolysis was determined by following the release of p-nitrophenol (ε400 = 17,500 cm−1m−1). Autohydrolysis of BNP was determined in a similar manner, except the weak buffer solution contained no protein. Hydrolysis of biotinyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (in 0.1 mammonium carbonate, pH 8) was observed spectrophotometrically (ε400 = 10,000 cm−1m−1). Hydrolysis of other biotinyl and non-biotinyl derivatives was determined by TLC, whereby a solution of avidin, incubated with the desired substrate for various time intervals, was lyophilized to dryness, denatured in 99% formic acid, applied to a TLC plate, and developed with butanol-acetic acid-water (4:1:1). The biotin-containing spots were visualized usingp-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde spray (13McCormick D.B. Roth J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18A: 383-385Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Lysine groups of avidin were acetylated using acetyl N-hydroxysuccinimide ester according to the previously described procedure (14Bayer E.A. Ehrlich-Rogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Tyrosine groups were nitrated using tetranitromethane as described (15Morag E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Carboxyl side chains of aspartic and glutamic acids were modified using glycine ethyl ester in the presence of a water-soluble carbodiimide (16Wilchek M. Frensdorff A. Sela M. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Arginine residues were modified selectively using phenyl glyoxal (17Takahashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6171-6179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and histidines were modified using diethyl pyrocarbonate (18Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Biotinyl p-nitroanilide (BNA) was synthesized as described previously (19Becker J.M. Wilchek M. Katchalsky E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2604-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The complex between core streptavidin and BNA was prepared by introducing several grains of biotinyl derivative into a 30-mg/ml solution of streptavidin containing 5% ethanol. The solubility of BNA in aqueous solutions is low, and the streptavidin-BNA complex was established by mixing the solution for 20 h at 37 °C. Formation of the streptavidin-BNA complex was monitored via the orange-colored dye, HABA, which becomes red upon binding to avidin or streptavidin (20Green N.M. Biochem. J. 1965; 94: 23c-24cCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). A stock solution was prepared by diluting a saturated HABA solution 1:100 with water. The HABA stock (2 µl) was added to 2 µl of the streptavidin-BNA complex solution on a glass cover slide. The transformation of the solution from red to orange (usually after an incubation period of about 20 h) indicated that the biotin-binding sites of streptavidin were fully occupied by BNA. Crystals of the streptavidin-BNA complex were obtained by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method using a Hampton Research crystal screen I (21Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2077) Google Scholar) at room temperature. The 1-ml reservoir solution contained 0.2m sodium citrate, 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), and 20% isopropanol. A 3-µl drop contained 1.5 µl of the protein complex and 1.5 µl of the reservoir solution. An amorphous precipitation appeared after 3 days. Crystals grew from the precipitation after 3 months and reached a final size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group I222, with two streptavidin monomers in the asymmetric unit and cell dimensions a = 47.121 Å, b = 95.160 Å, c = 105.304 Å. Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at room temperature on an RAXIS-IIc image plate mounted on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode generator with short Charles Supper mirrors. Data were integrated and scaled using the DENZO/SCALEPACK programs (22Minor W. Otwinowski Z. Bourne P.F. Watenpaugh K. Proceedings from the Macromolecular Crystallography Computing School. Western Washington University, WA1996Google Scholar,23Otzinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Crystals of “Lite” avidin (deglycosylated avidin (24Bayer E.A. De Meester F. Kulik T. Wilchek M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1995; 53: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)) were obtained by the vapor diffusion hanging drop method at 20 °C from a 4.2-mg/ml protein solution, mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 15% polyethylene glycol 2000 (PEG 2000) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.3). These conditions were refined further to produce the largest possible avidin crystals using a reservoir solution consisting of 12% PEG 2000 in 0.1m imidazole malate buffer (pH 5.8). Each hanging drop contained 1.5 µl of protein solution and 1.5 µl of reservoir. The crystals reached a final size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm after 1 week. To enlarge the crystals, multiple macroseeding techniques were applied (25Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 158-165Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) until the crystals reached a final size of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm. Crystals suitable for x-ray crystallographic analysis were initially soaked in a solution containing 1% HABA. The crystals immediately became red at their edges, and the red color continued to disperse throughout the crystals until they became completely colored. The HABA-dyed crystals were transferred to a 1% BNA solution, which became colorless within 24 h of soaking, indicating that the BNA replaced the HABA in the binding sites of avidin. Crystallographic data were collected at room temperature from a single crystal on an RAXIS-IV image plate mounted on a Rigaku ULTRAX 18S rotating anode generator with confocal Max FluxTMoptics. The crystal belonged to the orthorhombic P21212 space group with cell parameters of a = 72.27 Å, b = 80.36 Å, c = 43.40 Å, and an avidin dimer in the asymmetric unit. Data were integrated, reduced, and scaled using the DENZO/SCALEPACK program (22Minor W. Otwinowski Z. Bourne P.F. Watenpaugh K. Proceedings from the Macromolecular Crystallography Computing School. Western Washington University, WA1996Google Scholar, 23Otzinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The structure was solved via molecular replacement methods using AMoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) implemented in the CCP4 suite (27Collaborative Computing Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). The search model, with hydrogen atoms and the biotin molecule removed, was used in both monomeric and dimeric forms to validate the results. The structure was then refined using rigid body refinement CNS at the resolution range of 50–4.0 Å. The structure was further refined using simulated annealing and individual temperature factor refinement protocols in CNS, and after two cycles the BNA molecule was added into the structure. The crystallographic data were of an identical symmetry and similar cell parameters as the avidin-biotin complex structure (25Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 158-165Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and thus molecular replacement was not necessary. The structure was initially refined using rigid body refinement at the resolution range of 50–4 Å. The structure was then refined using the simulated annealing procedure followed by individual temperature factor refinement using CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The BNA ligand was added to the structure after the second cycle.

Open table in a new tab During the course of our studies on the biotin-binding site of chicken egg white avidin, we attempted to affinity label avidin using the active-ester derivative of biotin, biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester. When BNP was added to avidin at pH 4 and the pH was increased, a rapid release ofp-nitrophenol was observed (Fig.1). However, tryptic digestion of heat-denatured avidin failed to yield any biotin-containing peptides. Moreover, denaturation of avidin using 70% formic acid served to release free biotin, thus indicating that simple hydrolysis of BNP occurred instead of covalent labeling of avidin by the reagent. The hydrolysis reaction thus resulted in the formation of biotin and freep-nitrophenol such that the biotin was retained almost irreversibly but noncovalently in the binding site of avidin. The resultant avidin-biotin complex could no longer serve to catalyze additional molecules of BNP. Other biotin derivatives, including several other biotinyl esters, were not affected (TableI). The avidin-mediated hydrolysis of BNP appeared to depend on a very precise interaction between a residue (or residues) at or near the biotin-binding site. By increasing or decreasing the length of the derivative by a single methylene group in the side chain, the hydrolysis was essentially prevented (Table I). Thus, norbiotin and homobiotin analogues of BNP failed to undergo substantial hydrolysis in the presence of avidin (Fig.2).Table IHydrolysis of biotin derivatives by avidinTable IHydrolysis of biotin derivatives by avidinFigure 2Selective avidin-mediated hydrolysis of BNP analogues. Equimolar amounts of avidin subunit and either BNP or the indicated analogue were mixed at pH 9, and the appearance of freep-nitrophenol was monitored as a function of time. Control samples comprised one of the analogues in the absence of avidin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When BNP was combined with bacterial streptavidin, the protein failed to hydrolyze the ester. In fact, the observed autohydrolysis of BNP was protected by streptavidin up to pH 12 (Fig.3). This observation indicates that there is a hitherto undetected qualitative difference in or near the binding domains of avidin and streptavidin. In an attempt to identify which amino acid(s) are involved in the observed avidin-mediated hydrolysis, avidin was subjected to group-specific modification reagents prior to interaction with BNP (Fig. 4). Using this approach, the direct involvement of tyrosine, arginine, and aspartic and glutamic acids could be excluded. Modification of histidine appeared to provide partial protection of BNP hydrolysis. Acetylation or succinylation of lysine groups in avidin, however, appeared to confer complete protection against hydrolysis of BNP. Fully acetylated or succinylated avidin preparations were still capable of binding biotin and BNP. This result suggested that one or more lysine groups may be involved in the hydrolysis of the biotinyl active-ester derivative. In contrast, lysine does not appear to serve as a nucleophile in the hydrolysis of BNP, because repeated efforts failed to yield a peptide of avidin with covalently bound biotin. Therefore, we searched for an alternative explanation that would account for the promotion of BNP hydrolysis by avidin and its protection by streptavidin. We therefore decided to crystallize avidin and streptavidin with appropriate biotin-containing derivatives. Because of the rapid hydrolysis of BNP by avidin, we synthesized a comparable chemically stable analogue, biotinyl p-nitroanilide, for this purpose, and crystallized the two proteins in its presence.Figure 4Effect of chemical modification of functional groups of avidin on the hydrolysis of BNP. Avidin was modified using different group-specific reagents selective for tyrosines (Y*), arginines (R*), histidines (H*), lysines (K*), and aspartate plus glutamate residues (DE*). Inhibition of BNP hydrolysis was observed only for Lys-modified avidin, suggesting that lysines may be involved in the hydrolysis reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Core streptavidin (31Bayer E.A.

Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 776-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The initial electron density maps (F o− F c and 3F o − 2F c), calculated after rigid body refinement in the absence of BNA, provided a clear indication of the location of the BNA molecule (Fig. 5A). The structure was further refined using simulated annealing with slow cooling protocol in CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

TheF obs were scaled anisotropically (B11 = −4.44 Å2, B12 = 0.0 Å2, B22 = 0.68 Å2, B13 = 0.0 Å2, B23 = 0.0 Å2, B33 = 3.76 Å2), and a bulk solvent correction was applied (33Jiang J.S. Brünger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The structure was built into electron density maps using the graphics program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The model of the streptavidin-BNA complex consists of residues 15–135 for monomer 1 and residues 14–135 for monomer 2 with 143 solvent molecules. The model was refined to a resolution range of 50–2.4 Å with a crystallographic R value of 17.7% (R free value of 25.0%). Crystals of the deglycosylated avidin (Lite avidin) complexed with BNA belonged to the same space group with similar cell parameters to those of the native avidin and its complex with biotin (Protein Data Bank code 2AVI) (4Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The 2AVI model (without biotin, carbohydrate, and solvent molecules) was initially refined using rigid body protocols in CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar). The electron density maps calculated from the model indicated the location of the ligand and remaining GlcNac sugar moiety. Difference maps showed significant negative electron density for the segment of the L3,4 loop (connecting the β3 and β4 strands) as taken from the model of the avidin-biotin complex (Fig. 5 B), indicating that the loop either displays a significantly different conformation or is completely disordered. Further refinement using simulated annealing protocols at 2.0 Å resolution (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16948) Google Scholar) indicated that the L3,4 loop has an open conformation compared with the biotin complex; three residues in each monomer (39 to 41) had no clear electron density and were thus not modeled into the structure. TheF obs were scaled anisotropically (B11 = −2.26 Å2, B12 = 0.0 Å2, B22 = 0.36 Å2, B13 = 0.0 Å2, B23 = 0.0 Å2, B33 = 1.90 Å2), and a bulk solvent correction was applied (33Jiang J.S. Brünger A.T. J.

Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The structure of the avidin-BNA complex thus consists of residues 3–38 and 42–123 for monomer 1, and residues 2–38 and 42–123 for monomer 2. The structure contains 82 solvent molecules and was refined to a resolution of 2.0 Å with a crystallographic R value of 20.4% (R free value 23.4%). The coordinates of avidin-BNA (1IJ8) and streptavidin-BNA (1I9H) complexes are available at the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics. In both the avidin- and streptavidin-BNA complexes, the overall fold of the monomers and their tetrameric arrangements are similar to those of the native and biotin-complexed proteins described earlier (4Livnah O.

Each monomer is constructed of eight anti-parallel β-strands, which form a classical β-barrel with the biotin-binding site at the wide end of the barrel. The main structural difference between the avidin and streptavidin monomers lies in the size and conformation of five of the hairpin loops between the β-strands. The quaternary structures of avidin and streptavidin can be regarded as a dimer of dimers. The quaternary contact areas of avidin and streptavidin are very similar and consist of three intermonomeric interface regions. The interface previously defined as 1–2 (4Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) is crucial for the high affinity binding of biotin and other ligands. In this 1–2 interface, a tryptophan residue (Trp-110 in avidin and Trp-120 in streptavidin) is contributed from one monomer to the biotin-binding site of its neighbor, thus forming a tight hydrophobic cage (4Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) that contributes an essential component for biotin binding.

Schutz G. Schmale H Richter D. Nature. 1982; 295: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 2Breslow E. Burman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 1-67PubMed Google Scholar). Oxytocin biosynthesis is similar (3Land H. Grez M. Ruppert S. Schmale H. Rehbein M. Richter D. Schutz G. Nature. 1983; 302: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), with the exception that the precursor lacks the copeptin segment, the function of which is unclear (4Kim J.K. Summer S.N. Wood W.M. Brown J.L. Schrier R.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1863-1869PubMed Google Scholar). The NP components of the two precursors (VPNP) and (OxyNP) are highly homologous; the two bovine neurophysins have almost identical properties in vitro, including similar affinities for each of the two hormones (e.g. Ref. 2Breslow E. Burman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 1-67PubMed Google Scholar). Following processing, which cleaves the hormones from NP, the mature hormones remain noncovalently bound to NP by forces basically analogous to those pre-existing within the precursor, leading to analogous NP self-association properties (5Ando S. McPhie P. Chaiken I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12962-12969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of NP, the nature of the noncovalent interactions between hormones and NP, and the effects of these interactions on NP properties have been extensively investigated in solution (e.g. Ref. 2Breslow E. Burman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 1-67PubMed Google Scholar) and by crystallographic analysis (6Chen L. Rose J.P. Breslow E. Yang D. Chang W.R. Furey Jr., W.F. Sax M. Wang B.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1996; 3: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, the central role of NP in vasopressin elaboration has become evident by the demonstration that familial neurogenic diabetes insipidus (FNDI), an autosomal dominant disease characterized by vasopressin deficiency, appears most frequently to be due to mutations in NP (e.g. Refs. 8Ito M. Mori Y. Oiso Y. Saito H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and 9Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C. Kovacs L. Gregersen N. Nyborg J. Pedersen E.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar) accompanied by loss of the proper targeting of the hormone to regulated neurosecretory granules (e.g. Refs. 10Ito M. Jameson L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar and 11Nijenhuis M. Zalm R. Burbach J.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21200-21208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); retention of the mutated precursor in the endoplasmic reticulum is generally considered the cause of the ultimate death of the affected neurons (10Ito M. Jameson L. Ito M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Many of the mutations involved in diabetes insipidus can be predicted, on the basis of what is already known, to exert their effects by directly or indirectly interfering with NP folding and/or dimerization (e.g. Refs. 12Breslow E. Regul. Pept. 1993; 45: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar and 13de Bree F.M. Burbach J.P. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 18: 173-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein targeting to regulated neurosecretory granules is thought to depend at least in part on self-association, although the nature of the requisite self-association process is not well defined (reviewed in Ref. 14Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In the case of oxytocin and vasopressin precursors, the self-association arises from the self-association properties of their NP segments. The central element of this self-association is the dimer, the formation of which occurs through specific β-sheet interactions between folded NP subunits (6Chen L. Rose J.P. Breslow E. Yang D. Chang W.R. Furey Jr., W.F. Sax M. Wang B.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Rose J.P. Wu C.K. Hsaio C.D. Breslow E. Wang B.-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and is strongly enhanced by the binding of hormone or related peptides to the binding site (15Nicolas P. Batelier G. Rholam M. Cohen P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The efficiency of NP folding is in turn critically linked to the correct but metastable (16Deeb R. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) pairing of its 7 disulfides and depends, with one known exception (17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), on the ability of the protein to bind hormone and thereby provide the necessary thermodynamic stability to drive formation of the correct disulfides to completion. Thus, mutations (e.g. Ref. 9Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C. Kovacs L. Gregersen N. Nyborg J. Pedersen E.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar) that interfere with disulfide formation by deleting or adding half-Cys residues, or that alter binding site residues, can be expected to affect adversely both folding and targeting. However, there are a number of FNDI mutations for which the molecular mechanisms underlying their biological effects are ambiguous and therefore have the potential to provide new information on the relationship between structure and function in this system. These include mutations in residues involved neither in binding nor dimerization, such as those in external β-turns or in the 55–60-loop region that connects the two NP domains, or a premature STOP mutation that deletes both copeptin and the disordered (6Chen L. Rose J.P. Breslow E. Yang D. Chang W.R. Furey Jr., W.F. Sax M. Wang B.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4240-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Rose J.P. Wu C.K. Hsaio C.D.

Pedersen E.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar). They also include mutations affecting more clearly essential residues. Accordingly, we have investigated the effects of these mutations on NP physical-chemical properties. Mutations studied that do not involve obviously essential residues are G57S and G57R in the inter-domain loop (8Ito M. Mori Y. Oiso Y. Saito H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C. Kovacs L. Gregersen N. Nyborg J. Pedersen E.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar), G17V in the first β-turn (18Bahnsen U. Oosting P. Swaab D. Nahke P. Richter D. Schmale H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and 87STOP near the carboxyl terminus (9Rittig S. Robertson G.L. Siggaard C. Kovacs L. Gregersen N. Nyborg J. Pedersen E.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 107-117PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we investigated the C67STOP mutation, which deletes most of the second domain of the protein, together with half of the subunit interface and one cysteine, and the ΔE47 mutation that deletes the critical binding site residue Glu-47 (e.g. 9), located in the 3,10 helix of the protein. The effects of these mutations were principally investigated by introducing them into bovine OxyNP and in one case into the oxytocin precursor, for both of which we have developed an expression system. This takes advantage of the strong homology in structure and function between OxyNP and VPNP within and among different mammalian species (2Breslow E. Burman S. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 1-67PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chauvet M.T. Hurpet D. Chauvet J. Acher R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2839-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fig.1 compares the amino acid sequences of bovine OxyNP (BNP-I), bovine VPNP (BNP-II), and human VPNP. With the exception of the carboxyl-terminal tail, for which no function is known, there are only 4 amino acid differences between bovine and human VPNP, and none involve residues at the hormone-binding or dimerization sites. Also, with the exception of the carboxyl-terminal tail, which is eliminated when the protein is terminated with residue 86, all the mutated residues are strictly conserved. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that the similarity in behavior between bovine OxyNP and bovineVPNP will be paralleled by a similarity between bovineOxyNP and human VPNP; a single exception to this may be evident in these studies. It is also relevant that the present study emphasizes the effects of mutation on mature NP, as opposed to the NP segment of the precursor. We selected this route because of the inefficiency associated with the in vitrofolding of the wild type precursor (20Eubanks S. Lu M. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13530-13541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which contrasts with the efficiency of folding the wild type processed protein using added dipeptide to drive the folding process (16Deeb R. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Huang H.-B. Breslow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6750-6756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the single case in which the effects of mutation on both the processed protein and precursor are compared, the same effect is seen. A few studies of the effects of chemical or enzymatic modification of the two bovine NPs are also presented.

Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were used for all studies of the wild type (WT) mature proteins. The preparation of recombinant WT mature BNP-I and oxytocin precursor and mutagenesis of wild type cDNA have been described previously (17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Eubanks S. Lu M. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13530-13541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The recombinant mature mutant proteins in the present study were expressed in Escherichia coli, folded at pH 8.0 in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol and 10 mm Phe-Tyr-NH2, and purified by affinity chromatography as described for the recombinant mature WT protein (17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A large fraction of the protein so prepared is covalently damaged prior to folding (17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Eubanks S. Lu M. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13530-13541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and the remaining protein folds with variable efficiency depending on its structure (see below). The covalent structures of mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmids from which they were prepared and by mass spectrometry. With proteins that fold efficiently, the binding-competent and binding-incompetent proteins are distinguished by clear differences in mass, reflecting the covalent damage of the binding-incompetent protein (20Eubanks S. Lu M. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13530-13541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This was not the case for several of the mutants, indicating the inability of undamaged protein to fold efficiently (“Results”). None of the ΔE47 mutant was retained by the affinity column after folding (as expected because of its incomplete binding site), but because of CD evidence of folded product within the binding-incompetent fractions (245 nm positive ellipticity), this mutant was further fractionated by reverse phase HPLC using a Vydac C18column, 10× 250 mm, and a gradient from 100% solution A (25% CH3CN, 40 mm ammonium acetate) to 100% solution B (80% CH3CN, 40 mm ammonium acetate) at 150 min. A sharp peak at 13 min gave a CD spectrum characteristic of folded protein and was used for further analysis. The same HPLC protocol was applied to the C67STOP mutant, but only a diffuse peak eluting approximately between 14 and 24 min was obtained (“Results”). The G57S mutation was also introduced into the full-length oxytocin precursor. The precursor was folded, and the folded precursor was purified essentially as described previously for the WT precursor (20Eubanks S. Lu M. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13530-13541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although purified WT BNP-I refolds from the reduced state with ∼90% efficiency under our folding conditions (21Huang H.-B. Breslow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6750-6756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the yield from the initial folding reaction of folded recombinant WT protein, or of its stable mutants, is considerably lower than 90% and is somewhat variable, reflecting the covalently damaged protein formed during expression. Nonetheless, the folding efficiencies of the G57S, G57R, and P87STOP mutants were within the experimental range of that of WT and other stable proteins, whereas yields of the ΔE47 mutant and turn AG insertion mutant were reduced by factors of ∼50 and 80% respectively. The folding efficiency of the G17V mutant was significantly lower than that of the turn AG mutant, but was too low for accurate estimates. Note that the theoretical folding efficiency of the WT protein under the conditions used here can be calculated to be ∼95%, indicating an equilibrium heavily in favor of the folded form. Therefore, only relatively large reductions in stability should be manifest as a significant reduction in yield. Succinylated BNP-I was prepared from native BNP-I as described elsewhere (25Huang H.-B. LaBorde T. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10743-10749Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Following succinylation, protein retarded by the affinity column is succinylated at its two Lys residues and randomly succinylated at Ser residues exclusive of Ser-56, whereas protein not retarded by the affinity column differs from the retarded fraction by its succinylation at Ser-56 (25Huang H.-B. LaBorde T. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10743-10749Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For preparation of BNP-I with a specific internal clip after Lys-18, 13 mg of native BNP-I was digested with 3 units of endoproteinase Lys-C (Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 0.1 mNH4HCO3 buffer, pH 9. Residual native protein was separated from the cleaved protein by affinity chromatography (15Nicolas P. Batelier G. Rholam M. Cohen P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3565-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the cleaved protein not binding to the affinity column. On native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5, the non-binding protein gave two bands, a major product (≥80% of the protein) migrating with the expected additional negative charge relative to the native protein and a minor band with the same mobility as the native protein. Automated Edman sequencing confirmed cleavage after Lys-18 but gave no evidence of any undigested protein. Two controls were run in order to determine whether factors other than cleavage after Lys-18 could account for the altered conformational properties (see “Results”) of the digested protein. No significant effect on conformation was noted if the native protein was subjected to enzymatic digestion conditions in the absence of enzyme or if protein succinylated at its two Lys residues was subjected to enzymatic digestion conditions in the presence of enzyme. Des-1–6 BNP-II was prepared as described earlier (26Zheng C. Peyton D. Breslow E. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 50: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The des-1–6,des-87–95 protein was prepared from the purified des-1–6 derivative by limited digestion with trypsin (1% by weight) at room temperature in 0.16 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.2. Digestion was monitored by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5 and was terminated by snap-freezing aliquots at −80 °C. The crude modified protein was purified by HPLC on a Vydac C18 reverse phase column using a gradient from time 0 (25% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to 40 min (35% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water). The method separates the des-1–6,des-87–95 protein (retention time = 20 min) from des-1–6,des-93–95 protein (retention time = 22 min) and from most of the more completely digested protein; the latter is completely removed by a subsequent affinity chromatography (24Rabbani L. Pagnozzi M. Chang P. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) step. Binding fractions from affinity chromatography, representing the des-1–6,des-87–95 protein, were dialyzed against water and lyophilized. Purity and identity were confirmed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino acid analysis. Relative to the initial native BNP-II used, the yield of the final des-1–6,des-87–95 protein was ∼4%. Peptide binding constants were determined by CD using the mononitrated derivatives of the different mutants and binding methodology described elsewhere (e.g. Ref. 27Breslow E. LaBorde T. Bamezai S. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7990-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); the peptides used were Phe-Tyr-NH2 or Abu-Tyr-NH2, depending on availability. Dimerization constants were determined from one-dimensional proton NMR spectra obtained in D2O as described previously (17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), measuring the intensity ratio at different protein concentrations of signals at ∼6.4 and 6.2 ppm representing dimer and monomer, respectively; the validity of the use of these signals in the mutants was verified by demonstrating that the calculated dimerization constants were independent of protein concentration. Stabilities to denaturation by guanidine HCl were determined by one or both of the two methods. In the conventional method, applied earlier to this system, CD spectra were obtained by a constant concentration of protein in different concentrations of guanidine HCl (17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Eubanks S. Lu M. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13530-13541Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the second method (28Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: A.3A.1-A.3A.4Google Scholar), carefully weighed quantities of solid guanidine HCl are added serially to a sample of protein; the guanidine concentration is calculated from the weight of guanidine added and known dilution factors. This method, which was used for many preparations because of its smaller protein requirement, is intrinsically less accurate, due in part to the concentration dependence of the stability of WT mature NP and many of its mutants (17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, good agreement between the two methods was seen where the two methods were applied to the same sample (TableI). Both methods assume a two-state denaturation system, and both typically have a reproducibility of better than 5%, although occasional exceptions are evident.Table IStabilities to guanidine HCl denaturation of wild type and mutant proteinsProteinConcentrationm−ΔG 0ABmmkcal molm−1kcal/molBNP-I0.041.13.1 ± 0.11-aData are those previously reported (20).BNP-I0.051.2 (±0.0)2.9 (±0.03)WT precursor0.041.66.8 ± 0.41-aData are those previously reported (20).WT precursor0.021.6 (±0.06)7.0 (±0.2)WT precursor0.051.7 (±0.03)7.4 (±0.06)G57S0.051.1 (±0.07)3.1 (±0.1)G57S precursor0.0251.7 (±0.09)6.6 (±0.15)G57S precursor0.051.8 (±0.04)7.1 (±0.15)ΔE470.061.0 (0 ± 0.1)2.7 (±0.2)P87Stop0.051.1 (±0.07)3.0 (±0.05)BNP-II1-bData were obtained at pH 8 in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer.0.10.94 (±0.35)2.5 (±0.07)Des-1–6,des-87–95 BNP-II1-bData were obtained at pH 8 in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer.0.10.84 (0 ± 0.06)2.5 (±0.05)BNP-II1-cData are averages of results at 252 and 280 nm.0.10.64 (±0.1)2.1 (±0)Des-1–6 BNP-II1-cData are averages of results at 252 and 280 nm.0.10.68 (±0.04)2.3 (±0.4)Studies were conducted at pH 6.0 in 0.1 m ammonium acetate unless otherwise noted.

Protein modeling utilized the Swiss Protein Data Bank modeling system and the crystal structures of des-1–6 bovine NP-II in its unliganded state 2C. K. Wu, B. Hu, J. P. Rose, Z.-J. Liu, T. L.

Breslow E. Wang B.-C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the G57S mutant folded with an efficiency within the range of the WT protein (see “Materials and Methods”). The near-ultraviolet CD spectrum of the affinity-purified G57S mutant (Fig.3), which represents the contribution of NP disulfides, is identical to that of the WT protein (Fig. 3), consistent with a similarity in conformation. Note that this spectrum is very sensitive to NP folding; the 245-nm positive band is absent in misfolded protein, and the 280-nm negative band is reduced in intensity and shifted to shorter wavelengths (e.g. Ref. 29Menendez-Botet C.J. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3825-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One-dimensional NMR spectra were also largely similar to spectra of BNP-I, but significant differences were evident in the intensity ratio of monomer and dimer signals at ∼6.2 and ∼6.4 ppm at the same protein concentration (Fig. 4). Calculation of this ratio as a function of concentration indicated a dimerization constant 20–30% that of BNP-I (Table II). Surprisingly (cf. Ref. 17Eubanks S. Nguyen T. Peyton D. Breslow E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8085-8094Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the stability to guanidine denaturation was unaffected (Table I), suggesting that the reduced dimerization might reflect increased monomer stability. The peptide binding constant of the G57S mutant was also reduced by 20–30%, but as with the WT protein the binding affinity increased with protein concentration, signifying stronger binding by dimer than by monomer (Table III). NMR studies (not shown) confirmed the peptide-induced conversion of monomer to dimer. The effects of concentration on binding and of binding on dimerization are tentatively consistent with estimates of an ∼10-fold higher binding constant to a dimer site than to a monomer site found for the WT protein (27Breslow E.

https://openalex.org/W2037959640,"Sam68 is an RNA-binding protein that contains a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K homology domain embedded in a larger RNA binding domain called the GSG (GRP33,Sam68, GLD-1) domain. This family of proteins is often referred to as the STAR (signaltransduction and activators of RNA metabolism) proteins. It is not known whether Sam68 is a general nonspecific RNA-binding protein or whether it recognizes specific response elements in mRNAs with high affinity. Sam68 has been shown to bind homopolymeric RNA and a synthetic RNA sequence called G8–5 that has a core UAAA motif. Here we performed a structure function analysis of Sam68 and identified two arginine glycine (RG)-rich regions that confer nonspecific RNA binding to the Sam68 GSG domain. In addition, by using chimeric proteins between Sam68 and QKI-7, we demonstrated that one of the Sam68 RG-rich sequences of 26 amino acids was sufficient to confer homopolymeric RNA binding to the GSG domain of QKI-7, another STAR protein. Furthermore, that minimal sequence can also give QKI-7 the ability (as Sam68) to functionally substitute for HIV-1 REV to facilitate the nuclear export of RNAs. Our studies suggest that neighboring RG-rich sequences may impose nonspecific RNA binding to GSG domains. Because the Sam68 RNA binding activity is negatively regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, our data lead us to propose that Sam68 might be a specific RNA-binding protein when tyrosine phosphorylated.

In addition to the KH domain, the GSG domain contains ∼75 amino acids N-terminal and ∼25 amino acids C-terminal to the KH domain called the NK (N-terminal of KH) and CK (C-terminal of KH) regions, respectively (schematically represented in Fig. 1).

The physiological importance of the GSG domain is demonstrated by the fact that many genetic mutations that result in growth or developmental defects have been identified in this protein module. In the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, the GSG protein GLD-1 functions as a tumor suppressor that is required for normal oocyte development (35Francis R. Maine E. Schedl T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 607-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,36Francis R. Barton M.K. Kimble J. Schedl T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 579-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty-two gld-1 mutations have been identified that fall into six phenotypic classes (17Jones A.R. Schedl T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In mice, a missense mutation in the quaking gene (qk) has been identified (24Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that is known to be embryonic-lethal (37Bode V.C. Genetics. 1984; 108: 457-470PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation, altering glutamic acid 48 to glycine (24Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), occurs in the NK region of the GSG domain and has been shown to prevent QKI dimerization (19Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, HOW plays a critical role in skeletal muscle development, because weak alleles result in the “held-out-wings” phenotype (33Baehrecke E.H. Development. 1997; 124: 1323-1332PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zaffran S. Astier M. Gratecos D. Semeriva M. Development. 1997; 124: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phenotype of the quaking viable and lethalmice suggests that the QKI proteins are involved in myelination and early embryogenesis (24Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 38Hogan E.L. Greenfield S. Myelin. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1984Google Scholar). The mouse qk gene expresses at least five alternatively spliced mRNAs including QKI-5, QKI-6, and QKI-7 that differ in their C-terminal 30 amino acids (24Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Thequaking viable mutation, which prevents the expression of QKI-6 and QKI-7 isoforms in oligodendrocytes (39Hardy R.J. Loushin C.L. Friedrich V.L. Chen Q. Ebersole T.A. Lazzarini R.A. Artzt K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7941-7949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), severely impairs myelination, and as a result the mice develop a characteristic tremor after birth (40Sidman R.L. Dickie M.M. Appel S.H. Science. 1964; 144: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The specific RNA targets of QKI have not been identified, but the sequence identity between C. elegansGLD-1 and mouse QKI proteins has led Goodwin and co-workers (41Saccomanno L. Loushin C. Jan E. Punkay E. Artzt K. Goodwin E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) to examine whether the introduction of QKI-6 in C. elegans can regulate the specific RNA target of GLD-1. Indeed QKI-6, similar to GLD-1, translationally suppressed the expression of TRA-2 and bound with high affinity to the “tra-2 and GLIelements” (TGEs) (41Saccomanno L. Loushin C. Jan E. Punkay E. Artzt K. Goodwin E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that the Sam68 GSG domain in addition to 50 amino acids at its C terminus are necessary and sufficient for RNA binding (10Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the C-terminal amino acids in RNA binding, we generated chimeric proteins between two STAR proteins, Sam68 and QKI. Because the primary amino acid sequence of QKI-5, -6, and -7 isoforms are identical except for the last 6–30 amino acids (depending on the isoform) and are predicted to have identical RNA binding specificity, we chose QKI-7 for our analysis. Here we identified two small regions harboring arginine-glycine repeats in Sam68 that can confer nonspecific RNA binding activity to an adjacent GSG domain. In addition, a novel Sam68 dimerization region has been identified in its C-terminal sequences. The constructs encoding Myc-QKI-7, Myc-QKI-7:E48G, Myc-Sam68, and Myc-Sam68Δ1–67 (now renamed SΔN) were described previously (5Richard S., Yu, D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Myc-S-Q encodes a chimeric protein containing the N-terminal region of Sam68 and the C-terminal region of QKI-7. The DNA sequence encoding the C-terminal 180 amino acids of Myc-Sam68Δ1–67 was removed by restriction endonuclease digestion using EcoRV and KpnI and replaced with a sequence encoding the C-terminal 136 amino acids of QKI-7. The QKI-7 fragment was generated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Myc-QKI-7 as the DNA template and the universal reverse primer and 5′-GAC GAT ATC AAG AAG ATG CAG CTG ATG-3′ (theEcoRV site is underlined) as oligonucleotides. The chimeric protein Myc-Q-S contains the N-terminal region of QKI-7 and the C-terminal region of Sam68. The plasmid expressing this protein was constructed as follows: a DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal 188 amino acids of Sam68 was generated with PCR using Myc-Sam68 as the DNA template, 5′-CCT GGT ACC AGA TAT GAT GGA T-3′ as the forward primer, and universal reverse primer as the reverse primer, the fragment was digested with KpnI (the restriction site is underlined) and subcloned into Myc-QKI-7, the C-terminal 145 amino acids of which had been removed with KpnI digestion. Myc-Q-S:E→G was constructed using the same strategy as that of Myc-Q-S except that Myc-QKI-7:E48G, instead of Myc-QKI-7, was used to subclone the Sam68 DNA fragment. The construct encoding Myc-Q-S:A→N was generated by inverse PCR using Myc-Q-S as the DNA template and 5′-ATT CAA CTT GAA GCA GAA ACG GGA-3′ and 5′-ATT TGT AAG TCC TCT AGG TCC AAG-3′ as primers (underlined nucleotides denote changes introduced). The Myc-Q-S and Myc-S-Q C-terminal deletion constructs, Myc-Q-S330, Myc-Q-S294, Myc-S-Q284, and Myc-S-Q205, were generated with PCR using Myc-Q-S and Myc-S-Q as the DNA templates, respectively. The T7 promoter primer was used as the forward primer and the following oligonucleotides were used as reverse primers: 5′-AGG AAT TCA TGG CAC CCC TCG AGT CAC A-3′ (for Myc-Q-S330), 5′-TAG AAT TCA GGC AGC TCC TCG TCC TCT CAC-3′ (for Myc-Q-S294), 5′-AGG GAA TTC AGA TTA ACC CAG CTT CAG GCC-3′ (for Myc-S-Q284), and 5′-ATG GAA TTC TAT CTG TAG GTG CCA TTC AG-3′ (for Myc-S-Q205). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and subcloned into Myc-Bluescript KS(+) (5Richard S., Yu, D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding Myc-Q(GSG)-S, Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ4RG, and Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ6RG were constructed by a two-step subcloning strategy. DNA fragments encoding the C-terminal regions of Sam68 were amplified by PCR with universal reverse primer and 5′-GTG GTC GAC GGG TAT CTG TGA GAG GAC-3′ for Myc-Q(GSG)-S, 5′-GGA GTC GAC CCT CCT CCT CCA CCT GT-3′ for Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ4RG or 5′-GTG GTC GAC CAC CTA GAG GAG CTT-3′ for Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ6RG as primers. The fragments were digested with SalI (the restriction site is underlined) and KpnI (the site is in the vector) and inserted in the same sites of pBluescript KS(+). The resulting plasmids were then used to subclone the DNA fragments encoding Myc-tagged N-terminal regions of QKI-7. The Myc-QKI-7 fragments were generated by PCR using Myc-QKI-7 as template, T7 promoter primer as the forward primer, and the following oligonucleotides as reverse primers: 5′-CTG GTC GAC TAA TGT TGG CGT CTC TGT-3′ for Myc-Q(GSG)-S, 5′-AGT GTC GAC AAG AGA AAA GGC AAG GGC-3′ for Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ4RG, and 5′-CAG GTC GAC GCC CAG TGA TGA TCC TTG-3′ for Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ6RG. These fragments were digested with BamHI (the site is in the vector) and SalI (the site is underlined) and subcloned in the corresponding Sam68-pBluescript plasmids described above. The construct encoding Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ11RG was also generated in two steps. A PCR fragment encoding the Myc-epitope tag and the N-terminal 256 amino acids of QKI-7 was first subcloned in the BamHI andSalI sites of pBluescript KS(+), and the XhoI fragment (C-terminal 112 amino acids) of Sam68 was then inserted in theSalI site of the resulting plasmid. To generate the Myc-QKI:1–256 fragment, Myc-QKI-7 was used as DNA template and T7 promoter primer and 5′-GTA GTC GAC TGA TCA AAG GCA TTA-3′ as primers (the SalI site is underlined). Myc-QKI-5RG is a chimeric protein in which a Sam68 sequence harboring five RG repeats is introduced in QKI-7. The plasmid encoding this protein was generated as follows: a PCR fragment encoding the C-terminal 65 amino acids of QKI-7 was first inserted in the HindIII and KpnI sites of pBluescript KS(+), and a second PCR fragment containing coding sequences for the Myc tag, QKI-7 amino acids 1–231 and Sam68 amino acids 308–333, was then subcloned in the BamHI andHindIII sites of the resulting plasmid. The first PCR fragment was generated using Myc-QKI-7 as template and universal reverse primer and 5′-AGA AAG CTT TCA TGC CAA ACG GAA CTC-3′ as primers. The second PCR fragment was generated using Myc-Q(GSG)-SΔ6RG as template and T7 promoter primer and 5′-GTGAAG CTT GCA CCC CTC GAG TCA CAG-3′ as primers (theHindIII site is underlined). The constructs encoding Myc-SΔN:315RG→AS, Myc-SΔN:320RG→AS, Myc-SΔN:325RG→AS, Myc-SΔN:315,325RG→AS, Myc-SΔN:Δ3RG, Myc-Sam68:Δ3RG, Myc-Sam68R→A:10,13,17, Myc-Sam68R→A:43,45, and Myc-Sam68R→A:52,56 were all generated by inverse PCR. The DNA templates used were Myc-SΔN (for Myc-SΔN:Δ3RG and -SΔN:RG→AS constructs except Myc-SΔN:315,325RG→AS), Myc-SΔN:315RG→AS (for Myc-SΔN:315,325RG→AS), Myc-Sam68 (for Myc-Sam68:Δ3RG), and Myc-Sam68:Δ3RG (for Myc-Sam68R→A constructs), and the primer pairs were: 5′-AGCACC CCA GTG AGA GGC TCC-3′ and 5′-AGC AAC CAA AGC TCC TCT AGG-3′ (for Myc-SΔN:315RG→AS), 5′-AGC TCC ATC ACC AGA GGT G-3′ and 5′-AGC CAC TGG GGT TCC ACG AAC-3′ (for Myc-SΔN:320RG→AS), 5′-AGC GCC ACT GTG ACT CGA GGG-3′ and 5′-AGC GGT GAT GGA GCC TCT CAC-3′ (for Myc-SΔN:325RG→AS and -SΔN:315,325RG→AS), 5′-AGC GCC ACT GTG ACT CGA GGG-3′ and 5′-AGC AAC CAA AGC TCC TCT AGG-3′ (for Myc-SΔN:Δ3RG and -Sam68:Δ3RG), 5′-AGC TCG GGC GCC AGC TGC TCC AAG GAC CCG-3′ and 5′-AGC GGT GAG GGC CGA GGC AGG ATC GTC CCG-3′ (for Myc-Sam68R→A:10, 13, 17), 5′-AGC GGG GGA GGT GGG CCC AGA-3′ and 5′-AGC GGG CGC GTG AGG AAG CGG CGA CGG-3′ (for Myc-Sam68R→A:43,45), and 5′-AGC GGC GCTGCG GCC TCG CCCGCC ACC CAG-3′ and 5′-AGC GGG CCC ACC TCC CCC TCC-3′ (for Myc-Sam68R→A:52,56). Underlined nucleotides denote changes introduced. The construct encoding the G8–5 RNA sequence (12Lin Q. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27274-27280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), 5′-GGG UGA CAC ACU AGC UAU AGC AUU AAA AGA CCG AGC AAG U-3′ (the UAAA motif is underlined), was generated by annealing two oligonucleotides (5′-GCCGAA TTC GGG TGA CAC ACT AGC TAT AGC ATT A-3′ and 5′-AGCTCT AGA CTT GCT CGG TCT TTT AAT GCT ATA GCT-3′) and filling in the ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. This DNA fragment was digested with EcoRI and XbaI (the restriction sites are underlined) and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+). The plasmids encoding the tra-2 3′ UTR and a deletion mutant of tra-2 3′ UTR, (−108) 3′ UTR, were kindly provided by Tim Schedl (Washington University). The identities of all the above plasmid constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Proteins were expressed in HeLa cells, using the vaccinia virus T7 expression system as described previously (5Richard S., Yu, D. Blumer K.J. Hausladen D. Olszowy M.W. Connelly P.A. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 186-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), 50 mm NaF, 100 mm sodium vanadate, 0.01% phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg of aprotinin/ml, and 1 µg of leupeptin/ml), and the cellular debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated on ice with the specified antibody for 1 h. Then 20 µl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose slurry was added and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with constant end-over-end mixing. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with PBS. Protein samples were analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using the anti-Myc (9E10), anti-hemagglutinin (HA), or anti-p59fyn antibodies. The rabbit anti-p59fyn antibody was provided kindly by AndréVeillette (Institut de Recherche Clinique de Montréal, Université de Montréal, McGill University). The designated primary antibody was followed by goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (ICN), and chemiluminescence was used for protein detection (DuPont). 32P-labeled G8–5 RNA and tra-2 3′-UTR RNA were transcribed in vitrowith the T7 RNA polymerase following the protocols recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). After in vitro transcription, the template DNA was digested with DNase I (Promega), and the RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water at a concentration of 106 cpm/µl. For the poly(U) binding assay, Myc-tagged proteins expressed in HeLa cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with poly(U)-Sepharose beads or control Sepharose beads in lysis buffer supplemented with 2 mg/ml heparin. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibodies. For G8–5 or tra-23′-UTR RNA binding, Myc-tagged proteins expressed in HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc antibody or mouse IgG (control), and the immunoprecipitates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 1 µl (106 cpm) of 32P-labeled RNA in lysis buffer supplemented with 2 mg/ml heparin. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with PBS, and the bound radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. To verify the identity of the radiolabeled RNA bound to beads, the bound RNA was eluted with sample buffer and analyzed with nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. To verify protein expression, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody. REV assays were performed as described previously (7Derry J.J. Richard S.

STAR proteins contain a GSG domain, which is a tripartite protein module containing from N to C terminus the NK region, the KH domain, and the CK region (Fig. 1 B). The Sam68 KH domain is necessary for RNA binding because its deletion prevents RNA binding (10Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C. Lasko P. Richard S. Mol. Cell.

To investigate whether the RNA binding specificity of the STAR proteins resides only in the KH domain or whether neighboring regions can regulate RNA binding, we constructed chimeric proteins between QKI-7 and Sam68. These two proteins show a high degree of homology in their GSG domain (Fig. 1 A) but possess distinct RNA binding specificities. Sam68 has been shown to bind homopolymeric RNA poly(U) and poly(A) (2Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Nature. 1994; 368: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 10Chen T. Damaj B.B. Herrera C.

The QKI proteins bindC. elegans GLD-1 target, tra-2 (41Saccomanno L. Loushin C. Jan E. Punkay E. Artzt K. Goodwin E.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chimeric proteins were generated between Sam68 and QKI-7 in such a way that the CK region and the C terminus of one protein was replaced by the corresponding region of the other protein (Fig. 1 B). Q-S (QKI-7-Sam68 chimeric protein) contains the NK region and the KH domain of QKI-7 and the CK region and the C terminus of Sam68 (Fig. 1 B"
https://openalex.org/W2065650749,"The cytochrome b(6)f complex is an obligatory electron transfer and proton-translocating enzyme in all oxygenic photosynthesis. Its operation has been described by the Q-cycle. This model proposes that electrons are transferred from plastoquinol to plastocyanin (the reductant of P700 in Photosystem I) through, obligatorily in series, the iron-sulfur and the cytochrome f redox centers in the cytochrome b(6)f complex. However, here we demonstrate that (a) the iron-sulfur center-dependent reductions of plastocyanin and P700 are much faster than cytochrome f reduction, both in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cytochrome f mutants and in the wild type, and (b) the steady-state photosynthetic electron transport does not correlate with strongly inhibited cytochrome f reduction kinetics in the mutants. Thus, cytochrome f is not an obligatory intermediate for electrons flowing through the cytochrome b(6)f complex. The oxidation equivalents from Photosystem I are delivered to the high potential chain of the cytochrome b(6)f complex both at the cytochrome f level and, independently, at another site connected to the quinol-oxidizing site, possibly the iron-sulfur center."
