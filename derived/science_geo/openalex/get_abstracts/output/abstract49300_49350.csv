https://openalex.org/W2083726090,"Modulation of the growth of human and murine cell lines in vitro by recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) and recombinant human interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) was investigated. rTNF-alpha had cytostatic or cytolytic effects on only some tumor cell lines. When administered together with rIFN-gamma, rTNF-alpha showed enhanced antiproliferative effects on a subset of the cell lines tested. In contrast to its effects on sensitive tumor cells, rTNF-alpha augmented the growth of normal diploid fibroblasts. Variations in the proliferative response induced by rTNF-alpha were apparently not due to differences in either the number of binding sites per cell or their affinity for rTNF-alpha. These observations indicate that the effects of rTNF-alpha on cell growth are not limited to tumor cells, but rather that this protein may have a broad spectrum of activities in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2133616332,"Within the group of maternal effect genes necessary for the establishment of the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo, the Toll gene mutates to give a singular variety of embryonic phenotypes. Lack of function alleles produce dorsalized embryos as a recessive maternal effect. Dominant gain of function alleles result in ventralized embryos. Other recessive alleles cause partial dorsalization or lateralization of the embryonic pattern. Gene dosage studies indicate that the dominant ventralized phenotype results from an altered activity of the Toll product. Complementation studies show specific trans interactions between copies of the Toll product. Double mutant phenotypes suggest that the products of several other dorsal-group genes regulate the activity of Toll."

Maximally effective doses of epinephrine, angiotensin II, and vasopressin increased DAG by approximately 65, 80, and 180-250%, respectively, with maximal increases being observed at 8-10 min. Depletion of cellular Ca2+ resulted in a 50% decrease in DAG accumulation elicited by vasopressin. Other agents which increased DAG levels were the tumor promoter 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (120% increase at 10(-6) M), the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (385% increase at 10(-5) M), and ATP (180% increase at 1 mM). The concentration dependence of DAG accumulation in response to epinephrine, angiotensin II, and vasopressin was similar to that found for myoinositol triphosphate accumulation (Charest, R., Prpic, V., Exton, J. H., and Blackmore, P.F. (1985) Biochem. J. 227, 79-90), which was approximately 5-10 times less sensitive to hormone than was phosphorylase activation. Fatty acid analysis revealed that hormonally induced DAG was partially derived from sources other than inositol phospholipids. It is proposed from these studies that Ca2+-mobilizing hormones elicit a prolonged increase in the levels of hepatocyte DAG, which may activate protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W1538429332,"Two of the earliest known events in platelet activation include formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+ release from the platelet dense tubular system. Although the mechanism which triggers Ca2+ release from the dense tubular system is unknown, recent evidence suggests that the IP3 plays a role. In the present studies, human platelets permeabilized with saponin were used to examine Ca2+ movements and dense granule secretion in response to IP3. At low concentrations, saponin caused complete loss of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase without liberating enzyme markers for the dense tubular system. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, the permeabilized platelets were able to sequester 45Ca in both mitochondrial and nonmitochondrial pools. IP3 released up to 70% of the nonmitochondrial 45Ca in less than 5 s. Half-maximal Ca2+ release occurred at 1 microM IP3, a concentration compatible with the amount of IP3 produced during platelet activation. The absolute quantity of Ca2+ released, approximately 400 pmol/10(8) platelets, is similar to the Ca2+ content of the platelet dense tubular system estimated from steady-state exchange studies in intact platelets. Increases in pH, but not Na+ or Ca2+, comparable to those thought to occur during platelet activation potentiated the effect of IP3. IP3 was also able to cause serotonin release from the saponin-treated platelets. This effect was inhibited by EGTA and had a dose-response curve identical to that for IP3-induced Ca2+ release, which suggests that the IP3-induced secretion is mediated by the released Ca2+ and not directly by the IP3. Therefore, these data demonstrate: 1) that IP3 is able to trigger the rapid release of large amounts of Ca2+ from the platelet dense tubular system, 2) that other early events in platelet activation can affect this process, and 3) that the Ca2+ released by IP3 can serve as a trigger for subsequent events including secretion of the contents of the platelet dense granules."
https://openalex.org/W1981057134,"Phototransduction is the process by which light-stimulated photoreceptor cells of the visual system send electrical signals to the nervous system. Many of the steps that follow the initial event in phototransduction, absorption of light by rhodopsin, are ill-defined. The fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides a means to dissect phototransduction genetically. Mutations such as transient receptor potential (trp) affect intermediate steps in phototransduction. In order to facilitate molecular studies of phototransduction, the trp gene was isolated and its identity was confirmed by complementing the mutant trpCM allele of the trp gene by P-element mediated germline transformation of a 7.1-kilobase DNA fragment. Expression of the trp gene begins late in pupal development and appears to be limited to the eyes and ocelli."
https://openalex.org/W1947800358,"We have previously reported that endothelial cells synthesize a cytosol-associated, lipoxygenase-derived metabolite, LOX, which acts as a chemorepellant and, in so doing, maintains the vessel wall thromboresistance. In this study we demonstrate that LOX is a 13-hydroxylinoleic acid (13-OH-18:2) derived from linoleic acid and identical to 13-hydroxy-9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid, as measured by both reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In addition, we demonstrate that 13-OH-18:2 is produced in significantly greater quantities by endothelial cells than by smooth muscle cels or by fibroblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 13-OH-18:2 is produced in microgram amounts under basal conditions and is decreased by thrombin, calcium ionophore, and trypsin stimulation. And finally, we demonstrate that endothelial cells do not synthesize any significant amounts of lipoxygenase-derived arachidonic acid metabolites either under basal or stimulated conditions unless exogenous arachidonic acid is added. These observations indicate that the major lipoxygenase-derived, chemorepellant metabolite produced by the endothelial is 13-hydroxy-9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoic acid."

Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions revealed a major polypeptide species with a molecular weight of 40,000 and a minor form at Mr 42,000 for the alpha 1—-3-galactosyltransferase and a major polypeptide with Mr 51,000 for the beta 1—-4-galactosyltransferase. Analytical gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 yielded a monomeric form for each of the galactosyltransferases with Mr 43,000 and 59,000 respectively, in addition to peaks of activity at higher molecular weights. Isoelectric focussing of the alpha 1—-3-galactosyltransferase revealed a significant charge heterogeneity with forms varying in pI values between 5.0 and 6.5. Acceptor specificity studies indicated that the purified alpha 1—-3-galactosyltransferase was free from contaminating galactosyltransferase activities such as those involved in the synthesis of Gal beta 1—-4GlcNAc-R and Gal beta 1—-3GalNAc-R sequences, the blood group B determinant, the Pk antigen, trihexosylceramide, and ganglioside GM1. The alpha 1—-3-galactosyltransferase appeared to be highly active with glycoproteins, oligosaccharides, and glycolipids having a terminal Gal beta 1—-4GlcNAc beta 1—-unit such as asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (Km = 1.25 mM), Gal beta 1—-4GlcNAc beta 1—-2Man alpha 1—-3Man beta 1—-4GlcNAc (Km = 0.57 mM), and paragloboside. The action of the alpha 1—-3-galactosyltransferase was found to be mutually exclusive with that of the NeuAc:Gal beta 1—-4GlcNAc-R alpha 2—-6-sialyltransferase from bovine colostrum. In addition alpha 1—-3-fucosylation of the N-acetylglucosamine residue in the preferred disaccharide acceptor structure completely blocked galactosylation of the alpha 1—-3-galactosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1498511542,"Ornithine decarboxylase, which catalyses the formation of putrescine, is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines in mammalian cells. The enzyme is highly regulated, as indicated by rapid changes in its mRNA and protein during cell growth. Here we report that ornithine decarboxylase is regulated at the translational level by polyamines in difluoromethylornithine-resistant mouse myeloma cells that overproduce the enzyme due to amplification of an ornithine decarboxylase gene. When such cells are exposed to putrescine or other polyamines, there is a rapid and specific decrease in the rate of synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase, assayed by pulse-labeling. Neither the cellular content of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA nor the half-life of ornithine decarboxylase protein is affected. Our results indicate that polyamines negatively regulate the translation of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA, thereby controlling their own synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1536572717,"Prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase reacts with organic hydroperoxides and fatty acid hydroperoxides on a millisecond time scale to generate an intermediate that is spectrally similar to compound I of horseradish peroxidase. Compound I of PGH synthase is converted to compound II within 170 ms. Compound II decays to resting enzyme in a few seconds. Thus, the peroxidase reaction of PGH synthase appears to involve a cycle of native enzyme, compound I, and compound II, typical of heme-containing peroxidases. The Soret absorption maximum of compound I appears to occur at 412 nm but a small amount of compound II may be present. Soret maxima occur at 420, 433, and 419 for compound II, the ferrous enzyme, and the oxyferrous enzyme (compound III), respectively. Rapid scan analysis of the reaction of PGH synthase with arachidonic acid reveals the absorbance of compound II but no evidence for ferrous or oxyferrous enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1588330609,"The cell-surface glycoprotein of Halobacteria contains oligosaccharides of the type Glc4----1GlcA4----1GlcA4----1GlcA (where GlcA indicates glucuronic acid) with a sulfate group attached to each of the GlcA residues. We report here that in addition to this cell-surface glycoprotein, the halobacterial flagellar proteins (recently described by Alam, M., and Oesterhelt, D. (1984) J. Mol. Biol. 176, 459-475) also contain the same type of sulfated oligosaccharides. These flagellins have the following features. All of the individual flagellar proteins contain identical sulfated saccharide moieties linked to the amido nitrogen of Asn through a Glc residue (the novel type of N-glycosidic linkage that has been found in the cell-surface glycoprotein from Halobacteria (Wieland, F., Heitzer, R., and Schaefer, W. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 5470-5474)). The amino acid sequence of one carbohydrate-binding region is Gln-Ala-Ala-Gly-Ala-Asp-Asn-Jle-Asn-Leu-Thr-Lys. This surrounding sequence CHO is consistent with the general formula Asn-X-Thr(Ser), common to all N-linked glycopeptides determined so far. Biosynthesis of flagellar glycoconjugates involved sulfated oligosaccharides linked to dolichol monophosphate. The individual glycoproteins making up the flagella are structurally closely related to one another."
https://openalex.org/W1602201841,"An understanding of the mechanism of biological methane oxidation has been hampered by the lack of purified proteins. We describe here a purification protocol for the previously uncharacterized protein B of the soluble methane monooxygenase from the obligate methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Soluble methane monooxygenase is a multicomponent enzyme consisting of a hydroxylase component, protein A, a reductase component, protein C, and protein B. All three proteins are required for monooxygenase activity. Protein B proves to be a low molecular weight (16,000) single subunit protein devoid of prosthetic groups. The protein is a powerful regulator of soluble methane monooxygenase activity, possessing the capacity to convert the enzyme from an oxidase to an oxygenase. Proteins A and C together catalyze the reduction of molecular oxygen to water, a reaction prevented by protein B. The uncoupling of soluble methane monooxygenase in this manner displays a number of novel features. First, the product of the uncoupled reaction is water, and second, the uncoupling is independent of substrate. Free hydrogen peroxide is not an intermediate in the reduction of oxygen by the incomplete methane monooxygenase enzyme complex. Finally, electron transfer can occur between protein C and protein A in the absence of protein B and protein B prevents the steady-state transfer of electrons in the absence of an oxidizable substrate, such as methane. It is demonstrated that oxygen reduction occurs at the active site of the hydroxylase component, protein A. A unifying mechanism, describing the interaction of the three proteins of soluble methane monooxygenase, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1508509665,"Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) purified from monkey interphotoreceptor matrix contains relatively high concentrations of endogenous fatty acids, 6.51 mol/mol of protein. Sixty-five percent of the total fatty acid bound to IRBP was found to be noncovalently attached, with the remainder covalently bound. The fatty acids are not residual components of phospholipids or neutral lipids, as judged by microchemical methods. The major fatty acids bound to IRBP are: palmitic (35%), stearic (21%), palmitoleic (7%), oleic (29%), linoleic (6%) and docosahexaenoic acids (2%). These fatty acids account for about 90% of the total fatty acid bound to interphotoreceptor matrix proteins extracted with organic solvents. Thus, IRBP may function as an intercellular fatty acid carrier and may depend on the covalently bound fatty acids for anchoring in the outer leaflet of cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1561939009,"The primary structure of rat liver microsomal glutathione transferase has been determined. The 14C-carboxymethylated protein was fragmented with CNBr and proteolytic enzymes. The basis of the analysis was information from sequenator degradations of the intact protein, the largest CNBr fragment, and a large COOH-terminal fragment derived from a digest with Glu-specific staphylococcal protease. Remaining, smaller fragments were analyzed with the manual dimethylaminoazobenzene isothiocyanate method. Pepsin and limited acid hydrolysis were used to obtain peptides to confirm and overlap hydrophobic structures in the COOH-terminal half of the protein where trypsin and chymotrypsin failed to give any cleavage. Combined, these data permit the deduction of a 154-residue amino acid sequence. No evidence for micro-heterogeneity was obtained. The NH2-terminal alanine residue has a free alpha-amino group and the cysteine residue involved in activation of the enzymatic activity by sulfhydryl reagents is at position 49. The protein chain contains three regions with predictions for long beta strand secondary structures (positions 11-26, 103-120, and 131-145). Predictions may be inaccurate in membrane-associated proteins, but two of these regions also affect the three most hydrophobic segments. Thus, residues 11-35 form a long, largely hydrophobic part interrupted by only one charged residue (Lys-25), and residues 81-97 and 114-126 constitute the most hydrophobic segments directly noticeable from the hydrophilicity curve of the protein chain. These special parts of the molecule are of interest in relation to membrane interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2100611378,"Yeast α and a cells transcribe distinct sets of genes involved in mating behavior, α-specific genes and a-specific genes, respectively. The α1 product of the α mating type locus (MATα) has been the only known activator of either set of genes; it is required for synthesis of RNA from the α-specific genes, one of which is the major α-factor gene. By screening for mutants that are no longer able to express this gene, we have identified the STE12 gene product as another positive regulator of the α-factor gene, α ste12 cells are also defective in RNA production from the other known α-specific genes. Moreover, a ste12 cells fail to produce wild-type levels of RNA from the a-specific genes. The STE12 gene product is therefore an activator of two sets of genes involved in yeast cell type specialization."
https://openalex.org/W1872251307,"The effects of essential fatty acid (EFA) deprivation on the arachidonate content and phospholipid composition of different tissues are quite diverse. When C57B1 mice were placed on a fat-free diet, hepatic liquids were readily depleted of arachidonate. In contrast, the renal cortex tenaciously retained arachidonate, whereas surprisingly the heart showed a doubling of its content of arachidonate. This increase in cardiac arachidonate was due to a four-fold increase in arachidonylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The renal cortex showed preservation of its arachidonate content in PE, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine. Only phosphatidylinositol was depleted of arachidonate in heart or renal cortex. Using an in vivo labeling technique, it was shown that the liver incorporated most of the [1-14C]arachidonate initially following intraperitoneal injection. Over 11 days, as levels of labeled arachidonate fell in liver, the EFA-deficient heart accumulated arachidonate selectively in PE (8-fold greater than control), and the EFA-deficient renal cortex accumulated arachidonate in PE, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (2-3-fold greater than control). This uptake was shown to be specific for arachidonate over 20:3(n-9). Despite the conservation of cardiac and renal arachidonate seen with EFA deficiency, prostaglandin production by the isolated perfused EFA-deficient heart and kidney was markedly decreased relative to control in response to specific agonist stimulation with angiotensin II, although it was equivalent to control in response to nonspecific stimulation by ischemia. These data suggest that the liver serves to supply other tissues with arachidonate in EFA deficiency, and that the heart and renal cortex both contain mechanisms to accumulate arachidonate selectively in certain phospholipids. However, phosphatidylinositol, which is uniquely depleted of arachidonate in heart and renal cortex with EFA deficiency, appears to be the principal source of arachidonate in response to receptor-mediated agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1596557428,"Multiple biosynthetic forms of glucocerebrosidase were immunoprecipitated after synthesis in vitro using cell-free translation or in vivo using pulse-chase conditions in porcine kidney cells or human fibroblasts. The initial product in vitro was a 52-kDa polypeptide. When canine pancreatic microsomes were present during translation, the nascent polypeptide crossed the microsomal membrane and increased its mass to 60 kDa. Treatment of the 60-kDa polypeptide with endoglycosidase H to remove high mannose carbohydrate yielded a 51-kDa polypeptide. Thus, the membrane-translocated molecule was apparently a high mannose glycoprotein from which a signal peptide had been cleaved, as observed for the lysosomal protease cathepsin D (Erickson, A. H., and Blobel, G. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11771-11774). Treatment of pancreatic microsomes or microsomes from porcine kidney cells with protease did not decrease the size of the polypeptide, which shows that this form is not a transmembrane protein bearing a cytoplasmic domain susceptible to digestion. The in vitro product synthesized in the presence of microsomal membranes was indistinguishable from the in vivo product synthesized during pulse-labeling of cultured porcine kidney cells. Following a 2-h chase period, the 60-kDa product was converted to a 59-kDa polypeptide. The major form of glucocerebrosidase detected after a 24-h chase period was a 56-kDa polypeptide, which in turn was converted to a 55-kDa polypeptide by 72 h. The same forms were precipitated from human fibroblasts but the rate of processing was accelerated in this cell type. Limited treatment of the 60-kDa form of glucocerebrosidase with endoglycosidase H suggested that high mannose carbohydrate is added to at least four sites on the polypeptide chain. By 24 h after synthesis, conversion to endoglycosidase H-resistant complex carbohydrate had occurred. Thus, both polypeptide and carbohydrate processing steps are involved in the biosynthesis of glucocerebrosidase."

https://openalex.org/W2020399468,"The major light-harvesting complex in cyanobacteria and red algae, the phycobilisome, is composed of chromophoric and nonchromophoric polypeptides. Two linked genes encoding major chromophoric components, the polypeptide subunits of phycocyanin, were isolated from the cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon. Transcripts from this phycocyanin subunit gene cluster were present as major species in the cyanobacterium grown in red light, but not in cultures maintained in green light. The genes for the subunits of the red light-induced phycocyanin were transcribed together (beta-phycocyanin followed by alpha-phycocyanin) on two messenger RNA species; one contained 1600 bases while the other had 3800 bases. The latter, which encompassed the smaller transcript, contained additional sequences extending from the 3' end of the coding region of the alpha-phycocyanin gene. It may encode other light-induced components of the phycobilisome. Since phycocyanin, which effectively absorbs red light, becomes a dominant constituent of the phycobilisome in red light, these different levels may reflect an important adaptive mechanism of these organisms to their environment."

https://openalex.org/W1510498956,"Adipocytes process insulin through either of two pathways: a retroendocytotic pathway that culminates in the release of intact insulin, and a degradative pathway that terminates in the intracellular catabolism and release of degraded ligand. Mechanistically, these pathways were found to differ in several ways. First, temporal differences were found in the rate at which intact and degraded products were extruded. After 125I-insulin was preloaded into the cell interior, intact ligand was completely released during the first 10 min (t 1/2 = 2 min), whereas degraded insulin was released at a much slower rate over 1 h (t 1/2 greater than 8 min). Secondly, it was found that chloroquine profoundly inhibited the insulin degradative pathway, resulting in the intracellular accumulation of intact ligand and a reduction in the release of degraded products. In contrast, however, chloroquine was without effect on the retroendocytotic processing of insulin. Based on the known actions of chloroquine, it appears that retroendocytosis of insulin does not involve vesicular acidification or dissociation of the insulin-receptor complex and that insulin is most likely carried to the cell exterior in the same vesicles (either receptor-bound or free) as those mediating recycling receptors. Interestingly, accumulation of undergraded insulin within chloroquine-treated cells did not result in the release of additional intact ligand, suggesting that once insulin enters the degradative compartment it is committed to catabolism and cannot exit the cell through the retroendocytotic pathway. A third difference was revealed by the finding that extracellular unlabeled insulin (100 ng/ml) markedly accelerated the rate at which preloaded 125I-insulin was released from adipocytes (t 1/2 of 3 min versus 7 min in controls cells). Analysis of the composition of the released products revealed that extracellular insulin rapidly augmented (over 10 min) in a dose-dependent manner (5-200 ng/ml) the amount of insulin released intact (from 25 to 38% of preloaded counts; insulin ED50 = 10 ng/ml). Although extracellular insulin had no effect on the early extrusion of degraded insulin, the release of catabolized products was reduced at later times. The interpretation of these results is that the rate or amount of incoming insulin-receptor complexes can effect a sorting process (prior to bifurcation) such that a proportion of insulin is shunted from the slower degradative pathway to the more rapid retroendocytotic pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1614477459,"Calcium-dependent regulation of intracellular protein degradation was studied in isolated rat skeletal muscles incubated in vitro in the presence of a large variety of agents known to affect calcium movement and distribution. A23187, KC1, sucrose, and 8-(diethylamino)octyl-3,4, 5-trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride increase proteolysis while tetracaine, verapamil, and low extracellular calcium caused significant decreases. Additionally, dantrolene decreases proteolysis in the presence of depolarizing levels of potassium, while it has no effect on degradation in normal media. The dose dependence of calcium ionophore A23187 on proteolysis and contracture tension are parallel. Furthermore, excess KC1 and hypertonic solutions increased protein degradation at doses reported to cause tension. Thus, the parallel increase in proteolysis and tension in response to various agents supports the hypothesis that protein degradation in muscle is regulated by calcium. To determine the responsible proteolytic systems involved in calcium-dependent degradation, the effect of different classes of protease inhibitors was tested. Addition of the inhibitors leupeptin and E-64-c blocked the A23187-induced increase in degradation. Since proteases sensitive to these agents are present in both the sarcoplasm and lysosomes, known lysosomotropic agents, methylamine and chloroquine, as well as 3-methyladenine, a specific autophagy inhibitor, were used in combination with A23187. These agents did not inhibit calcium ionophore-induced proteolysis, although these three agents selectively inhibited enhanced degradation seen in the absence of insulin, demonstrating an autophagic/lysosomal pathway in these muscles. Thus, our results suggest that nonlysosomal leupeptin- and E-64-c-sensitive proteases are responsible for calcium-dependent proteolysis in muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1527276203,"Among the proteins that are synthesized only in interferon-treated human cells, a Mr = 67,000 protein has been previously identified by its binding to guanylate agaroses. After a 24-h treatment of human diploid fibroblasts with 200 units/ml of interferon-gamma, about 3 X 10(5) molecules of guanylate-binding protein (GBP) accumulate in each cell. We have developed a one-step purification procedures for GBP using guanylate affinity chromatography. To further elucidate the specific binding of this protein to guanylates, we have used a photoactive probe, 8-azidoguanosine [alpha 32P] triphosphate for the labeling of the GBP. Photolysis of the 8-azido-[alpha-32P]GTP in the presence of GBP results in the covalent attachment of the 32P-guanylate to the GBP. This photolabeling reaction can be inhibited only by guanylates but cannot be inhibited by other nucleotides, suggesting a specific association of GBP to guanylates. Using the purified GBP as an immunogen, we have successfully made rabbit antiserum for GBP. Both the GBP antigen and its guanylate-binding activity are detected only in the cytoplasm of interferon-treated human fibroblasts. The synthesis of the mRNA of GBP is also found in mice exposed to endogenous interferon and in interferon-treated human lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1483034969,"Chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycan was extracted in the presence of protease inhibitors from 6 X 10(9) mouse bone marrow-derived, interleukin 3-dependent mast cells, of which 3 X 10(7) had been biosynthetically labeled with [35S]sulfate or [3H]glycine. Chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycan was purified to apparent homogeneity by density-gradient centrifugation, differential molecular weight dialysis, DEAE-52 ion exchange chromatography, and Sepharose CL-4B gel filtration chromatography. Chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycan, radiolabeled with [3H]glycine or [35S]sulfate, filtered as a single peak of radioactivity on Sepharose CL-4B with a Kav of 0.41. When purified [3H]glycine-labeled proteoglycan was digested with chondroitinase ABC and subjected to gel filtration, all of the radioactivity was shifted to a lower molecular weight. As assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the Mr of the peptide core obtained by chondroitinase ABC treatment was approximately 10,000. The purified proteoglycan was resistant to degradation by collagenase, clostripain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, chymopapain, V8 protease, proteinase K, and Pronase, as assessed by gel filtration chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Analysis of the core peptide of the intact proteoglycan revealed that glycine, serine, and glutamic acid/glutamine accounted for 70% of the total amino acids and were present in a molar ratio of 4.3/1.6/1.0. When analyzed for neutral hexose content by gas-liquid chromatography, the proteoglycan contained approximately 2% of its weight as mannose, fucose, galactose, and other sugars, indicating that oligosaccharides were linked to the peptide core. The mouse bone marrow-derived mast cell chondroitin sulfate E proteoglycan, like the rat serosal mast cell heparin proteoglycan, is markedly protease resistant, has highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans, and contains a peptide core that is rich in serine and glycine. These characteristics of the mast cell class of intracellular proteoglycans may contribute to their function in stimulus-induced granule secretion as well as in mediator storage, including retention of cationic neutral proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1577895244,"We have previously reported (Petruzzelli, L., Herrera, R., Garcia, R., and Rosen, O. M. (1985) Cancer Cells 3, 115-121) that adult Drosophila melanogaster contain a specific, high-affinity insulin-binding protein. Insulin-dependent protein tyrosine kinase activity has now been identified in Drosophila. Activity first appears at 6-12 h of embryogenesis, increases during the 12-18-h period and falls to low levels in the adult. 125I-insulin was cross-linked specifically and with high affinity to a protein (Mr = 135,000) throughout embryogenesis and in the adult. However, during the 6-12- and 12-18-h periods of embryogenesis when insulin-dependent protein tyrosine kinase activity is expressed, another protein (Mr = 100,000) becomes cross-linked to 125I-insulin. Crosslinking to both proteins was competitively inhibited by the addition of 100 nM insulin. We conclude that the insulin-binding and insulin-dependent protein tyrosine kinase activities of the mammalian insulin receptor are conserved in Drosophila. However, the insulin-dependent protein tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor is detected only during specific times in embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1593616408,"Abstract Although orally administered malondialdehyde (MDA), a reactive hepatotoxic and mutagenic product of lipid peroxidation, is extensively metabolized to CO2, a portion is excreted in the urine in acid labile forms. Since much of the MDA in the diet is apparently bound to protein, the metabolism of protein-bound MDA was investigated. MDA was reacted with serum albumin and fed to rats. A urinary metabolite was detected which was shown to be identical to a metabolite of the lysine-MDA enaminal N epsilon-(2-propenal)lysine. After isolation by ion exchange and high performance liquid chromatography the metabolite was identified using high field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy as N alpha-acetyl-epsilon-(2-propenal)lysine. This compound also was a major urinary metabolite of the Na enol salt of MDA administered by stomach intubation, and was excreted in increased amounts by rats fed a diet containing a highly peroxidizable oil (cod liver oil). It was also detected in the urine of fasted animals after injection with NaMDA, indicating that it is formed as a product of lipid peroxidation in vivo as well as of peroxidation of dietary lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1561611514,"Ascorbic acid donates electrons to dopamine beta-monooxygenase during the hydroxylation of dopamine to norepinephrine in vitro. However, the possible role of ascorbic acid in norepinephrine biosynthesis in vivo has not been defined. We therefore investigated the effect of newly accumulated ascorbic acid on catecholamine biosynthesis in cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. Cells supplemented for 3 h with ascorbic acid accumulated 9-fold more ascorbic acid than found in control cells. Under these conditions, the cells loaded with ascorbate were found to double the rate of norepinephrine biosynthesis from [14C]tyrosine compared to control. By contrast, the amounts present of [14C] 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and [14C]dopamine synthesized from [14C]tyrosine were unaffected by the preloading of ascorbic acid. Ascorbate preloaded cells incubated with [3H]dopamine also showed a similar increase in the rate of norepinephrine formation, without any change in dopamine transport into the cells. Thus, these data were consistent with ascorbate action at the dopamine beta-monooxygenase step. In order to determine if ascorbate could interact directly with dopamine beta-monooxygenase localized within chromaffin granules, we studied whether isolated chromaffin granules could accumulate ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid was not transported into chromaffin granules by an uptake or exchange process, despite coincident [3H]dopamine uptake which was Mg-ATP dependent. These data indicate that ascorbic acid does augment norepinephrine biosynthesis in intact chromaffin cells, but by a mechanism that might enhance the rate of dopamine hydroxylation indirectly."
https://openalex.org/W1501043197,"An attempt was made to prepare a highly purified, active recombinant DNA-derived human interferon-gamma. When the protein was denatured in urea and refolded, gel filtration and sedimentation velocity experiments indicated the presence of two forms, which are different in size and are not in a rapid reversible equilibrium. The two forms could be chromatographically separated. Far-UV circular dichroic spectra indicated the presence of secondary structures for both forms. Near-UV circular dichroic spectra revealed that the smaller form is folded into a rigid tertiary structure. The antiviral activity of the two forms of interferon-gamma showed a significant difference, i.e. the smaller form was 4-8-fold more active than the larger form. A variety of experiments show that the smaller form is more active, homogeneous, soluble, and stable than the larger form."
https://openalex.org/W1569431675,"Monoclonal antibodies were prepared against a putative cell-cell adhesion molecule, a surface glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of 80,000 (gp80), from Dictyostelium discoideum. Seven monoclonal antibodies directed against gp80 were characterized and found to fall into three distinct classes. Class I consisted of one monoclonal antibody, is monospecific for gp80, and probably recognizes the peptide portion of the molecule. This class was capable of blocking the EDTA-resistant contact sites effectively. Class II recognized the carbohydrate moiety of gp80 and cross-reacted with a large number of glycoproteins. These monoclonal antibodies partially inhibited cell reassociation. Class III recognized gp80 and one other glycoprotein of Mr 95,000. This class had no effect on cell-cell binding. The class I monoclonal antibody was most potent in inhibiting cell reassociation at the aggregation stage of development. Its effect decreased drastically as development progressed and became negligible by the culmination stage. These observations are consistent with a direct role of gp80 in cell-cell binding and suggest a transient function for gp80 at the aggregation stage."
https://openalex.org/W1538114820,"Trinitrobenzene sulfonate rapidly inactivates ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from both spinach and Rhodospirillum rubrum. With large molar excesses of the reagent, the reactions obey pseudo-first order kinetics and the rates of inactivations are directly proportional to the concentrations of trinitrobenzene sulfonate; thus, there is no indication of reversible complexation of reagent with enzyme. Saturating levels of the competitive inhibitor 2-carboxyribitol 1,5-bisphosphate reduce the rates of inactivations but do not prevent them, thereby suggesting that the groups subject to arylation remain accessible in the enzyme complexed with competitive inhibitor. Characterization of tryptic digests of the inactivated enzymes reveals that Lys-166 of the R. rubrum enzyme and Lys-334 of the spinach enzyme are the only major sites of arylation. Both of these lysines have been assigned to the catalytic site by prior affinity labeling studies and are found within highly conserved regions of primary structure. As a monoanion over a wide pH range, trinitrobenzene sulfonate, for which the carboxylase lacks high affinity, can thus be used to determine the pKa values of the two active-site lysyl epsilon-amino groups. Based on the pH dependency of inactivation of the R. rubrum enzyme by trinitrobenzene sulfonate, the epsilon-amino group of Lys-166 exhibits a pKa of 7.9 and an intrinsic reactivity (ko) of 670 M-1 min-1. In analogous experiments, Lys-334 of the spinach enzyme exhibits a pKa of 9.0 and a ko of 4500 M-1 min-1. Under deactivation conditions (i.e. in the absence of CO2 and Mg2+), the pKa of Lys-334 becomes 9.8 and the ko is increased to 26,000 M-1 min-1. By comparison, the reaction of trinitrobenzene sulfonate with N-alpha-acetyl-lysine reveals a pKa of 10.8 and a ko of 1250 M-1 min-1. The spinach carboxylase, catalytically inactive as a consequence of selective arylation of Lys-334, still exhibits tight binding of the transition state analogue 2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate. Therefore, Lys-334 is not required for substrate binding and may serve a role in catalysis. The unusually low pKa of Lys-166 argues that this residue is also important to catalysis rather than substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W2115590736,"Two genetically distinct acid beta-galactosidases are apparently involved in the hydrolysis of galactosylceramide in fibroblasts. These beta-galactosidases were activated by different bile salts. The classical galactosylceramidase (galactosylceramidase I, EC 3.2.1.46) was activated by sodium taurocholate, while the other galactosylceramidase (galactosylceramidase II) was activated by sodium cholate. The former was genetically lacking in globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) and the latter in GM1 gangliosidosis. Galactosylceramidase II cross-reacted with antibody raised against purified GM1 ganglioside beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) from the human placenta. The purified beta-galactosidase had galactosylceramidase II activity, which was competitively inhibited by GM1 ganglioside. Thus, galactosylceramidase II seems to be identical to GM1 ganglioside beta-galactosidase and lactosylceramidase II. Galactosylceramidase II had a very low affinity for galactosylsphingosine. In the galactosylceramide-loading tests using fibroblasts from patients with GLD and GM1 gangliosidosis, both cell lines hydrolyzed the incorporated galactosylceramide, with lower rates than control fibroblasts but higher than the fibroblasts from patients with I-cell disease, in which both galactosylceramidase I and II were deficient. These results indicate that galactosylceramide is hydrolyzed by two genetically distinct beta-galactosidases and explain well that galactosylsphingosine but not galactosylceramide accumulates in the brain of patients with GLD."
https://openalex.org/W1995773731,"The molecular basis of a human immunoglobulin deficiency characterized by the complete absence of κ chains has been investigated by nucleotide sequence analyses of a patient's κ constant region (Cκ) genes. Both of his Cκ genes had a single point mutation, resulting in the loss of the invariant tryptophan from one allele and of an invariant cysteine from the other allele. These results indicate that neither of the patient's Cκ alleles encoded a κ chain that could form a stable intradomain disulfide bond, although peculiarities in the expression of κ chains in the patient's family suggest that other factors may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1615557421,"Arachidonic acid metabolism in ionophore A23187-activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) proceeds predominantly via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in comparison to metabolism by the 15-lipoxygenase route. Products of both lipoxygenase pathways appear to be involved in the mediation of inflammatory reactions. Pretreatment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with micromolar amounts of the platelet-derived 12-lipoxygenase product 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14- eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) prior to the addition of A23187 and [14C]arachidonic acid resulted in the unexpected dose-dependent stimulation of the 15-lipoxygenase pathway, as evidenced by the formation of [14C]15-HETE. A concomitant inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway was also observed. The structural identity of 15-HETE was confirmed by retention times on straight-phase and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography in comparison with an authentic standard, radioimmunoassay, and chemical derivatization. When other isomeric HETEs were tested, the order of stimulatory potencies was 15-HETE greater than 12-HETE greater than 5-HETE. When arachidonic acid metabolism via the 5-lipoxygenase route was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid, previously ineffective concentrations of exogenous 12-HETE were now able to stimulate the polymorphonuclear leukocyte 15-lipoxygenase. Thus, blockade of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway appeared to be a prerequisite for the activation of the 15-lipoxygenase. The HETE-induced activation of the 15-lipoxygenase occurred within 1-2 min, was a reversible process, and was enhanced in the presence of A23187. In nine donors tested, up to 14-fold stimulation of [14C]15-HETE production was observed. Our results indicate that endogenous HETEs can have a dual role in the post-phospholipase regulation of arachidonic acid metabolism since they can act as physiological stimulators of the 15-lipoxygenase as well as inhibitors of the 5-lipoxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1588683230,"The influenza viral hemagglutinin contains L-fucose linked alpha 1,6 to some of the innermost GlcNAc residues of the complex oligosaccharides. In order to determine what structural features of the oligosaccharide were required for fucosylation or where in the processing pathway fucosylation occurred, influenza virus-infected MDCK cells were incubated in the presence of various inhibitors of glycoprotein processing to stop trimming at different points. After several hours of incubation with the inhibitors, [5,6-3H]fucose and [1-14C]mannose were added to label the glycoproteins, and cells were incubated in inhibitor and isotope for about 40 h to produce mature virus. Glycopeptides were prepared from the viral and the cellular glycoproteins, and these glycopeptides were isolated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-4. The glycopeptides were then digested with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and rechromatographed on the Bio-Gel column. In the presence of castanospermine or 2,5-dihydroxymethyl-3,4-dihydroxypyrrolidine, both inhibitors of glucosidase I, most of the radioactive mannose was found in Glc3Man7-9GlcNAc structures, and these did not contain radioactive fucose. In the presence of deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of mannosidase I, most of the [14C]mannose was in a Man9GlcNAc structure which was also not fucosylated. However, in the presence of swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II, the [14C]mannose was mostly in hybrid types of oligosaccharides, and these structures also contained radioactive fucose. Treatment of the hybrid structures with endoglucosaminidase H released the [3H]fucose as a small peptide (Fuc-GlcNAc-peptide), whereas the [14C]mannose remained with the oligosaccharide. The data support the conclusion that the addition of fucose linked alpha 1,6 to the asparagine-linked GlcNAc is dependent upon the presence of a beta 1,2-GlcNAc residue on the alpha 1,3-mannose branch of the core structure."

Biol. Chem. 257, 7678-7683) and replaced with either skeletal (fast-twitch) or cardiac TnC. The relationship between isometric tension and Sr2+ concentration remained essentially the same before removal and after replacement with skeletal or cardiac TnC. Therefore, the origin of the TnC made no difference in the Sr2+ activation properties of the skinned fiber. In contrast, the activation of skinned cardiac fibers is approximately an order of magnitude more sensitive to Sr2+ than skinned skeletal fibers. These results show that the affinity of cardiac TnC for Sr2+ is altered when substituted into skinned skeletal muscle fibers through protein-protein interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1571571598,"We have purified intact pp60v-src, the product of the Rous sarcoma virus src gene, over 2400-fold, based on the phosphorylation of tumor-bearing rabbit IgG. The purification procedure involved detergent extraction of the particulate fraction of the cells and sequential chromatography on hydroxylapatite, butyl agarose, DEAE-Sephacel, ADP-agarose, and Sephacryl S-200. Analysis of the preparation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single silver-stained band with an apparent molecular weight of 60,000. Our results show that the activities of this preparation were qualitatively similar to those described previously for partially purified pp60v-src. Upon analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the purified pp60v-src yielded one major species which migrated to the same position as the least acidic of the three major species detectable in cellular lysates, suggesting that the pp60v-src had been dephosphorylated during the purification procedure. We found that pp60v-src was very prone to aggregation; to maintain it as a monomer both Nonidet P-40 and KCl were required. Under conditions which maintained pp60v-src as a monomer, the rate of autophosphorylation was independent of its concentration and thus proceeded via an intramolecular process. Preincubation of pp60v-src with ATP or GTP as well as nonphosphorylating analogs of ATP or GTP preserved its phosphorylating activity toward alpha-casein whereas its activity was reduced 80% upon preincubation in the absence of nucleotides. We suggest that protection with nucleotides rather than autophosphorylation accounts for the apparent increase in the activity of pp60v-src after incubation of the enzyme with ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1649136338,"Previously, we have derived murine hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies against DNA methyltransferase from human placenta (Kaul, S., Pfeifer, G. P., and Drahovsky, D. (1984) Eur. J. Cell Biol. 34, 330-335). One of these monoclonal antibodies, M2B10, which undergoes immune complex formation also with DNA methyltransferase from P815 mouse mastocytoma cells, was used for the immunoaffinity purification of mouse and human DNA methyltransferases. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and in immunoblotting studies, the immunoaffinity-purified mouse DNA methyltransferase revealed 5-6 polypeptides of molecular masses 150-190 kDa. The immunoaffinity-purified human placental DNA methyltransferase was characterized by a polypeptide of 158 kDa, presumably representing the native enzyme molecule and by polypeptides of 105-108 kDa and 50-68 kDa, probably generated by a limited proteolysis of the native enzyme molecule. The immunoaffinity-purified DNA methyltransferases preferred hemimethylated DNA substrates over unmethylated ones, and among all unmethylated substrates tested, poly[(dG-dC).(dG-dC)] had the highest methyl-accepting activity. DNA polymers of at least 90 base pairs in length were required for the binding reaction of the immunoaffinity-purified human DNA methyltransferase, and this initial binding was apparently independent of the nucleotide composition of the DNA polymer and of the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine."
https://openalex.org/W1557054487,"Microsomal preparations from cultured chick embryo chondrocytes were incubated with 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate and oligosaccharides prepared from chondroitin. Rates of 4- and 6-sulfation were measured at pH 6 and 8 in the presence of MnCl2 and Brij 58. Ratios of the overall 6-sulfation to 4-sulfation rates ranged from 40-200 at pH 8 and from 6-35 at pH 6, depending upon the composition of the assay mixture. When saturating concentrations of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate and the oligosaccharide acceptors were used, the resulting products were mixtures of monosulfated oligosaccharides. The compositions of the mixtures formed from oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization from 4-12 at pH 6 and 8 were analyzed. Sulfate substituents were found at all N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) residues in the acceptors but were not evenly distributed along the oligosaccharide chains. For oligosaccharides with nonreducing terminal D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) residues, sulfation at the nonreducing terminal GlcUA----GalNAc occurred exclusively at the C6 of the GalNAc residue. However, for oligosaccharides with nonreducing terminal GalNAc residues the rate of 6-sulfation of the nonreducing terminal GalNAc was markedly reduced and was similar to the rate of 4-sulfation at the same position. The rates of sulfation at the reducing ends of the oligosaccharides were relatively high for the shorter oligosaccharide acceptors but decreased with increasing length of the acceptor, suggesting that the sulfotransferases recognized primarily the GalNAc residues in the nonreducing terminal regions."
https://openalex.org/W1525972898,"The chloroplast protein synthesis factor responsible for the binding of fMet-tRNAMeti to chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits (IF-2chl) has been identified in whole cell extracts of Euglena gracilis. The IF-2chl activity is present in considerably higher amounts in extracts of light-grown cells than in extracts of dark-grown cells. About 90% of this activity is found in the postribosomal supernatant of the cell. Chromatography on phosphocellulose results in the partial purification of IF-2chl and separates the chloroplast factor from the cytoplasmic factor eIF-2A. The binding of fMet-tRNAMeti to chloroplast 30 S subunits is message-dependent as observed for prokaryotic systems. In addition, GTP stimulates the IF-2chl-dependent reaction 3-fold. The binding reaction shows broad monovalent and divalent cation optima. The activity of IF-2chl is stimulated 2-fold by the addition of either Escherichia coli IF-1 or IF-3, and 4-fold by the inclusion of both factors. Chloroplast IF-2 is quite active on the homologous 30 S ribosomal subunits but shows little activity on E. coli 30 S or wheat germ 40 S subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2058642191,"In Drosophila, flies with two X chromosomes are females, with one X chromosome, males. We investigated the presence of sex determining factors on the X chromosome by constructing genotypes with one X and various X-chromosomal duplications. We found that female determining factors are not evenly distributed along the X chromosome as had been previously postulated. A distal duplication covering 35% of the X chromosome promotes female differentiation, a much larger proximal duplication of 60% results in male differentiation. The strong feminizing effect of distal duplications originates from a small segment that, when present in two doses, activates Sxl, a key gene for sex determination and dosage compensation. Our results suggest that Sxl can be activated to intermediate levels."
https://openalex.org/W124332999,"The interaction between apolipoprotein A-I and small unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine at the lipid phase transition resulted in complete release of vesicle contents at molar ratios of lipid to protein from 4000:1 down to 50:1. This indicated the existence of two types of stable complexes: a vesicular apo-A-I complex with a maximum of two to three apo-A-Is/vesicle, and a micellar complex (disc) with a stoichiometry of about 50 phosphatidylcholines/apo-A-I (mol/mol). We characterized the complexes by density gradient centrifugation, by gel filtration, and by immunoprecipitation using an anti-apo-A-I antibody. The morphology of the discs was similar to that of previously reported discs. Apo-A-I-induced release of vesicle contents was monitored by the relief of self-quenching of vesicle-encapsulated carboxyfluorescein. Using this assay we characterized the nature of the interaction between apo-A-I and phospholipid vesicles. The formation of complexes between vesicles and apo-A-I followed a two-step process; below or above the lipid phase transition temperature (Tc), apo-A-I bound to phosphatidylcholine vesicles but caused little leakage of contents. Kinetic analysis of the interaction between apo-A-I and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles below Tc indicated that about 1 in 500 collisions leads to a stable apo-A-I-vesicle complex. The second step involved passage of those complexes through Tc, which resulted in a very rapid transition into discs or vesicular complexes. Vesicular complexes contain apo-A-I which was no longer capable of interacting with pure lipid. Discs, on the other hand, interacted with vesicles at their phase transition."

https://openalex.org/W1572796244,"Bacillus subtilis 30 S subunits inefficiently recognize initiation sites in mRNAs from Gram-negative bacteria, but they are able to efficiently recognize initiation sites in mRNA derived from Gram-positive bacteria. McLaughlin et al. (McLaughlin, J. R., Murray, C. L., and Rabinowitz, J. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11283-11291) have suggested that B. subtilis ribosomes require a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence for translation initiation. To test whether this criterion is sufficient to explain the translational specificity of B. subtilis ribosomes, T7 late mRNA, which contains strong Shine-Dalgarno sequences before many of the late genes (Dunn, J. J., and Studier, F. W. (1983) J. Mol. Biol. 166, 477-535), was translated in vitro with both Escherichia coli and B. subtilis ribosomes. The identification of several of the in vitro products upon gel electrophoresis indicated that B. subtilis ribosomes recognize correct translation initiation sites in late T7 mRNA, but they do not translate these products efficiently. Competition experiments demonstrated that late T7 mRNA does not inhibit B. subtilis ribosomal translation of B. subtilis derived mRNA (from the bacteriophage phi 29). It is concluded that strong Shine-Dalgarno sequences may be necessary in B. subtilis translation initiation sites; however, additional determinants of initiation which differ from those found in the translation initiation sites of E. coli mRNAs must exist."

These two fractions differ in mean particle size, and lipid and protein compositions. Both fractions share apolipoproteins B, A-IV, E, A-I, and C, but the fraction which binds to heparin-Sepharose contains two additional proteins: protein I (Mr = 6.0 X 10(4)), and protein II (Mr = 8.0 X 10(4)). Both proteins are also present in the lipoprotein-free fraction of rat serum. Proteins I and II bind to heparin-Sepharose, and are highly amphiphilic: they bind with high affinity to phospholipid surfaces and form stable monolayers at the air-water interface. The molecular weight, amino acid composition, heparin binding, and amphiphilicity of protein I resemble that of beta 2-glycoprotein I; in addition, protein I from rat lymph chylomicrons cross-reacts with rabbit antiserum to human beta 2-glycoprotein I, suggesting that these two proteins are homologous.

Electrolyses were carried out at 0 degrees C in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.2, 0.1 M) using a carbon felt electrode. This electroinactivation process was time-dependent and pseudo first-order with respect to gentisic acid at concentrations up to 300 microM. These concentrations of gentisic acid are below those normally reported to be inhibitory. The enzyme was stable to this applied potential in the absence of gentisic acid. Similar treatment of apoenzyme (heme-removed) revealed no loss in catalytic activity after reconstitution to the holoenzyme. Oxyphenbutazone, a nonoxidizable competitive inhibitor of cyclolooxygenase, was observed to protect the enzyme from electrolytic inactivation mediated by gentisic acid. Radiolabeling studies indicated the covalent attachment of approximately 1 eq of gentisic acid/subunit of enzyme. These studies support the possible role of quinonoid intermediates in the observed anti-inflammatory action of salicylate derivatives."
