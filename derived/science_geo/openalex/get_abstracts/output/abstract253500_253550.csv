https://openalex.org/W2108865709,"A comprehensive, unbiased inventory of synuclein forms present in Lewy bodies from patients with dementia with Lewy bodies was carried out using two-dimensional immunoblot analysis, novel sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with modification-specific synuclein antibodies, and mass spectroscopy. The predominant modification of α-synuclein in Lewy bodies is a single phosphorylation at Ser-129. In addition, there is a set of characteristic modifications that are present to a lesser extent, including ubiquitination at Lys residues 12, 21, and 23 and specific truncations at Asp-115, Asp-119, Asn-122, Tyr-133, and Asp-135. No other modifications are detectable by tandem mass spectrometry mapping, except for a ubiquitous N-terminal acetylation. Small amounts of Ser-129 phosphorylated and Asp-119-truncated α-synuclein are present in the soluble fraction of both normal and disease brains, suggesting that these Lewy body-associated forms are produced during normal metabolism of α-synuclein. In contrast, ubiquitination is only detected in Lewy bodies and is primarily present on phosphorylated synuclein; it therefore likely occurs after phosphorylated synuclein has deposited into Lewy bodies. This invariant pattern of specific phosphorylation, truncation, and ubiquitination is also present in the detergent-insoluble fraction of brain from patients with familial Parkinson's disease (synuclein A53T mutation) as well as multiple system atrophy, suggesting a common pathogenic pathway for both genetic and sporadic Lewy body diseases. These observations are most consistent with a model in which preferential accumulation of normally produced Ser-129 phosphorylated α-synuclein is the key event responsible for the formation of Lewy bodies in various Lewy body diseases.

A number of proteins have been identified in LBs largely by immunohistochemical staining of brain, although the two most common are ubiquitin and α-synuclein (1Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N.

The invariable presence of α-synuclein in LBs suggests that it plays a key role in the etiology of such diseases (“synucleinopathies”). Point mutations in the synuclein gene as well as multiplication of the gene in familial cases of PD lead to autosomally dominant familial forms of PD (5Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E.

As in sporadic PD, LBs are also found in the brains of individuals with familial PD suggesting that clues about the pathogenic role of synuclein lie within the LB. Because α-synuclein is a relatively abundant neuronal protein, and LBs are found in diseased brain, we hypothesized that the formation of the abnormal LB structures results from specific modifications to this protein. We therefore analyzed the specific forms of α-synuclein that are found in LBs isolated from patients with DLB using a combination of two-dimensional immunoblots, immunoaffinity purification, and LC-MS/MS. We found that a single phosphorylation at Ser-129 (10Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) of otherwise unmodified α-synuclein is the most abundant modification of the synuclein in LBs. Smaller amounts of ubiquitinated phosphorylated synuclein, as well as synuclein truncated at Asp-119 were also present in every case. In addition, novel truncations at Asp-115, Tyr-133, and Asp-135 were detected. LB-enriched fractions from a member of the Contursi kindred, a family with an A53T mutation in α-synuclein that co-segregates with an autosomally dominant familial form of PD, and glial cell inclusions (GCIs) from an MSA patient had the same profile of modifications as did the DLB cases, thus suggesting a common pathway to pathogenesis in both sporadic and familial synucleinopathies. Small amounts of phosphorylated Ser-129 (P-S129) synuclein were found in the soluble fraction of both control and disease brain. This normally produced, cytosolic form of α-synuclein may thus be the precursor to the predominant pathogenic form of synuclein in LBs. Synuclein truncated at Asp-119 is also found outside of the LBs, in both normal and disease brain, suggesting that this is a normal metabolite of α-synuclein. In contrast, ubiquitinated synuclein, predominantly phosphorylated at Ser-129, was only found in LBs, and therefore most likely occurs after deposition of P-S129 synuclein into LBs. Recombinant α-Synuclein—Clones of full-length and C-terminally truncated (terminating at amino acid 119 or 122) human α-synuclein in pET21d vectors were transformed into the BL21(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli. All clones were verified by sequencing. Synuclein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and bacteria were harvested 2 h post-induction by spinning at 6500 × g for 15 min. The E. coli pellet was lysed by sonication for 3.5 min in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Cellular debris was pelleted by spinning at 38,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was supplemented with an additional 10 mm dithiothreitol and then placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged as above, and the supernatant containing the α-synuclein was applied to a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in lysis buffer. Synuclein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (10–700 mm). α-Synuclein preparations were >95% pure as measured by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was measured by the BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and confirmed by amino acid analysis (AAA Laboratory, Mercer Island, WA). MS analysis of the purified samples established that the full-length synuclein was intact and that the truncated synuclein terminated with either Asp-119 or Asn-122. In Vitro Phosphorylation of α-Synuclein at Ser-129—Recombinant α-synuclein (1 mg/ml) was incubated overnight at 30 °C with 3 milliunits/μl casein kinase 2 (Upstate) in 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 4 mm MgCl2, 130 mm KCl, 5 ng/μl poly-l-Lys (Sigma) and 800 μm ATP (Sigma). Phosphorylation of Ser-129 was confirmed by LC-MS/MS, and the P-S129-specific antibody 11A5. Phosphorylation at other sites was not detected by LC-MS/MS. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies 1H7 and 9E4 were generated in mice injected with purified recombinant α-synuclein expressed in and purified from E. coli. α-Synuclein purified from bovine brain according to a modified procedure of Jakes et al. (11Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar) was used as the antigen for production of the mouse monoclonal antibodies 5C12 and 8A5. The antigen for the P-S129-specific antibody 11A5 was the peptide CAYEMPSEEGYQ with a phosphorylated Ser. This peptide corresponds to amino acids 124–134 of α-synuclein with a Cys residue added at the N terminus for coupling and is identical to that described by Fujiwara et al. (10Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A. Masliah E. Goldberg M.S. Shen J. Takio K. Iwatsubo T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A clonal cell line producing the phospho-specific antibody was obtained by counter-screening against the non-phosphorylated peptide. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies EL43, EL47, and EL48 were prepared to synthetic peptides (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) corresponding, respectively, to amino acids 1–12, 115–122, and 131–140 of α-synuclein with a GGC linker on the C terminus of each peptide. The neo-epitope polyclonal antibody EL101 was generated by immunizing rabbits with peptides corresponding to amino acids 115–119 (DMPVD) with a CGG linker on the N terminus. All peptides for polyclonal antibody production were coupled through the Cys residue to Imject SuperCarrier Immune Modulator (Pierce), whereas peptides used for monoclonal antibody production were prepared by coupling the Cys on the peptide to sheep anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) using sulfo-EMCS (Molecular Biosciences, Boulder CO). Monoclonal antibodies were purified by anionexchange chromatography or on a Protein A-Sepharose column, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were affinity purified on Sulfolink gel (Pierce Biotechnology) conjugated to the appropriate peptide antigen. Antibodies were epitope-mapped as described below and tested for their specificity to α-versus β-synuclein using recombinant protein. Commercial antibodies used for immunoblot analysis include Syn-1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Z0458, DAKO), and the HRP-labeled secondary antibodies, donkey anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences). Epitope Mapping of Synuclein Antibodies—Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies generated against α-synuclein and the monoclonal antibody Syn-1 were epitope-mapped using a series of overlapping, linear peptides covering the full-length of the α-synuclein sequence (Mimotopes, Melbourne, Australia). The 15-amino acid-long peptides overlapped by 12 amino acids with 3 amino acid steps. All peptides were biotinylated at the C terminus; however, the last 3 peptides in the series were repeated with biotinylation at the N terminus to allow for the detection of C-terminal-specific antibodies. Peptides (5 nm) were captured on streptavidin-coated ELISA plates (Pierce), which were washed and then incubated with purified antibody (2 μg/ml) for 1 h. Antibody binding to peptide was detected by a colorimetric ELISA assay using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Epitopes were mapped with a resolution of three amino acid residues. The polyclonals EL43 and EL48 were mapped, respectively, to amino acids 1–3 and 131–138 of α-synuclein. The monoclonal 1H7 was mapped to amino acids 91–99.

Open table in a new tab Synuclein ELISA Assays—Total and P-S129 α-synuclein levels were quantitated by sandwich ELISAs utilizing 1H7 as the capture antibody and either 5C12 or 11A5 as the reporter antibody, respectively. All steps were carried out at room temperature. Both ELISAs were performed on 4HBX ultra high binding plates (Immulon) coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of 1H7. Plates were blocked for 1 h with casein blocking solution (0.25% casein in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% sodium azide). Samples to be assayed were extracted for 1 h with 5 m guanidine plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Both samples and standards (recombinant α-synuclein with or without in vitro phosphorylation) were diluted to 0.5 m guanidine in casein blocking solution and were applied in triplicate in 100-μl aliquots to the coated, blocked plates. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, plates were brought to room temperature, washed four times with 400 μl of TBST (150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) per wash and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with biotinylated 5C12 or 11A5 (2 μg/ml). After washing, plates were incubated for 1 h with HRP-labeled avidin D (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or avidin (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:7,500 and 1:10,000, respectively, in specimen diluent (0.6% globulin-free bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, 8 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, 145 mm sodium chloride, 0.05% Triton X-405 with 0.05% thimerosal). Plates were washed and incubated with TMB1 Component HRP Microwell Substrate (BioFX Laboratories, Owings Mills, MD) for 5 min to initiate the colorimetric reaction, which was stopped with 450 mm STOP Reagent (BioFx Laboratories). Plates were read at 450 nm. Isolation of LBs and GCIs—Individuals with DLB and MSA as well as control patients whose brains were used in this study are described in supplemental Table S1. LBs, together with LNs, were isolated as described by Jensen et al. (12Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) from the cingulate, temporal, and frontal gray matter of individuals diagnosed with DLB. A mock LB preparation was performed with human brain tissue from control individuals (91/290 and 91/204). GCIs were prepared from an MSA brain (P28) as described by Gai et al. (13Gai W.P. Power J.H.T. Blumbergs P.C. Culvenor J.G. Jensen P.H. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2093-2100PubMed Google Scholar). All preparations were solubilized by two sequential extractions with UTC buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS) with 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 1–3 h at room temperature and 10 min of bath sonication. Preparation of Soluble and Particulate Human Brain Fractions—Cortical gray matter was homogenized in 4 volumes of 0.32 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 17.4 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) as described by Jensen et al. (12Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and was subsequently centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min producing a soluble and particulate fraction. The particulate fraction was solubilized in UTC buffer or in Laemmli sample buffer for analysis by two-dimensional or one-dimensional PAGE, respectively. Synuclein Purification from Human Brain—α-Synuclein was purified from 35 g of hippocampal, temporal, cingulate, and prefrontal cortical gray matter combined from individuals (patients AD22 and P52, supplemental Table S1) with DLB. Brain material was Dounce-homogenized in 4 volumes (ml /g) of sucrose buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol) plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 100,000 × g to sediment LBs. The pellet was extracted in 200 ml of UTC (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS) for 2 h at 25 °C. The resulting extract was clarified by centrifugation and filtration and then applied to a 16/10 Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in anion-exchange buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Twenty column volumes of anion-exchange buffer with a 10 to 700 mm NaCl gradient was applied, and α-synuclein was found to elute between 200 and 300 mm NaCl. Fractions were probed on Western blots for α-synuclein immunoreactivity and were pooled into aliquots enriched in either truncated α-synuclein (pools 1 and 2/3) or P-S129 α-synuclein (pool 4). Pools were diluted with sucrose buffer to a final concentration of 0.5 m urea and further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using the α-synuclein-specific monoclonal antibody 5C12 or the P-S129-specific antibody 11A5 conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (3–5 mg of antibody/ml of resin). The resin was washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and α-synuclein was eluted with 200 mm glycine, pH 2.8, 500 mm NaCl. Extraction of Contursi Brain—A temporal lobe cortex specimen from the brain of a 57-year-old woman with a heterozygous A53T α-synuclein mutation (Contursi kindred member IX/56 (14Golbe L.I. Di Iorio G. Sanges G. Lazzarini A.M. La Sala S. Bonavita V. Duvoisin R.C. Ann. Neurol. 1996; 40: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar)) was obtained from Drs. D. Dickson and L. Golbe. A specimen of control brain from a 59-year-old female who died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (postmortem interval, 15 h) was obtained from Dr. Jennifer A. Chan. Temporal cortex specimens were homogenized in parallel in 3 volumes (ml/g) of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture, as described by Schlossmacher and Shimura (15Schlossmacher M.G. Shimura H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 351-369PubMed Google Scholar) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was extracted with the homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 substituted in place of Nonidet P-40, extracted for 2 h with intermittent vortexing, and spun as above. The pellet was then homogenized in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm magnesium sulfate with Complete protease inhibitors, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to generate a supernatant (Tris-buffered sucrose extract) and pellet. The pellet was sequentially extracted with 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA plus protease inhibitors (urea extract) followed by the same buffer containing 1% SDS (SDS extract). Extracts were spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min. PAGE and Immunoblotting—For two-dimensional analysis, 50–100 μg of LB protein or 100–200 μg of protein from the soluble fraction of brain were focused on 24-cm Immobiline DryStrip gels (Amersham Biosciences) with either a pH 4–7 or pH 3–10 gradient. Strips were run on DALT gels (25 × 21 cm, 12.5% acrylamide). One-dimensional analysis was performed using Tricine-buffered 10–20% acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). One-dimensional gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) or nitrocellulose (Invitrogen) membranes at 1 amp for 1.5 h using Laemmli transfer buffer. Two-dimensional gels and some one-dimensional gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride for 1 h and 15 min at 0.8 V/cm2 using a Multiphor semi-dry blotting apparatus with a discontinuous buffer system as specified by the manufacturer. All membranes were placed in boiling phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min prior to blocking with either 5% milk or 10% newborn calf sera (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride). Immunoreactivity was detected using ECL or ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). The apparent molecular weights of synuclein species were extrapolated from the migration of either Bio-Rad Precision or Amersham Biosciences Rainbow molecular weight markers on one-dimensional gels. For reprobing a blot with additional antibodies, the blot was stripped by incubation in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride for at least 30 min, followed by two 5-min washes in Tris-buffered saline and blocking. Complete stripping was verified by reprobing with the appropriate secondary antibody. The pI values noted on each blot were estimated from calibration curves supplied by the manufacturer of the isoelectric focusing strips. Nanospray ESI-MS/MS Analysis—Plugs were removed from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels using an Ettan Spotpicker (GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences), then equilibrated in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and rehydrated in 10 ng/μl trypsin (Promega) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Samples were acidified to pH 2 with 10% trifluoroacetic acid and sonicated to extract the peptides from the gel plugs. Protein samples in solution were enzymatically digested with 1 ng of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) suspended in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Digestions were limited to 1 h at room temperature, with partial proteolysis preferred to allow overlapping peptide sequence coverage by LC-MS/MS. Nanospray high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation was performed using a Michrom Magic 2002 capillary HPLC (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) equipped with a 75-μm × 5-cm Proteopep2 C18 reversed-phase nanospray column (New Objective, Cambridge, MA). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5–50% acetonitrile and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in 45 min with a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Peptides were analyzed by MS/MS using an LCQ DecaXP ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoElectron Corp., San Jose, CA) with spray voltage set at 2.1 kV and collision energy at 35%. Mass scanning ranges varied accordingly to detect peptides of interest. The mass acquisition method consisted of one full MS survey scan followed by four MS/MS scans of the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan. Dynamic exclusion of MS/MS spectra was set to 30 s. Data Base Searching and Filtering of Results—MS/MS spectra were searched using the Turbosequest algorithm within the Bioworks 3.2 software suite (ThermoElectron). Data files were searched using a customized data base designed to detect serial C-terminal truncations of the α-synuclein protein and also with the SWISS-PROT data base (Release 46) from Expasy. The mass tolerance of the intact precursor and fragment ions was set at 2 and 1 Da, respectively. Therefore, the intact peptide and peptide fragments were within ±1 and 0.5 Da, respectively, of that of the assigned peptides. The MS/MS data files were searched specifying cleavage by trypsin and allowing up to four missed cleavages. Results were filtered using two independent measures for the accuracy of matches: p values and a cross correlation (XCorr) score, a value based on the number and intensity of ions matched in the data base. The minimum acceptable Xcorr values for assigning peptides, 1.8 (+1), 2.5 (+2), and 3.0 (+3), are within the standard cutoffs typically used for MS data base matches and were selected to screen out all but the most stringent matches. XCorr cutoff values were reduced to 2.5 for matching of (+3) phosphate-containing peptides due to poor fragmentation patterns. Only peptide matches with p values <0.05, i.e. >95% confidence, were accepted in assigning peptides. Differential modifications were specified as Met oxidation (16 Da) and acetylation (42 Da), and Ser, Thr, or Tyr phosphorylation (80 Da). For determination of sites of ubiquitination, a differential modification of 114 Da was specified for Lys residues. This corresponds to the mass of the diglycine modification left behind after tryptic digestion of the ubiquitinated protein. Deconvolution of Intact Protein ESI-MS Spectrum—The charge envelope generated by ESI-MS of the intact P-S129 α-synuclein was acquired over a mass/charge range of 600–1800 m/z and deconvoluted using Bioworks 3.2 (ThermoElectron) with a specified mass range of 5,000–20,000 Da. Immunohistochemistry of Human Brain—Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on brain samples from pathologically confirmed cases of DLB (n = 6), age-matched controls (n = 6), and individuals with an A53T α-synuclein mutation (n = 2). The patients with the synuclein mutation, II-5 and II-6, were part of an Australian family of Greek origin (16Spira P.J. Sharpe D.M. Halliday G. Cavanagh J. Nicholson G.A. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 49: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Brains from the control and DLB patients were bisected with one half fixed by immersion in buffered 4% formaldehyde and the other half frozen at –70 °C for biochemical studies (17Gai W.P. Yuan H.X. Li X.Q. Power T.H. Blumbergs P.C. Jensen P.H. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 166: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Free-floating sections (50 μm) were prepared from brain regions known to contain LBs (cingulate, frontal, and temporal cortices and brainstem). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight, followed by biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Sections were incubated with an avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (1:200, Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and hydrogen peroxide. Primary antibodies used included EL48 and EL101, each used at 1 μg/ml. To test the neo-epitope specificity of EL101 on brain sections, EL101 was preincubated with recombinant α-synuclein (100 μg/ml) or with the peptide antigen (20 μg/ml) prior to staining. α-Synuc"

The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a well conserved serine/threonine kinase that regulates cell growth in response to nutrient status. Here we demonstrate that in mammalian cells the mammalian TOR (mTOR) pathway plays a significant role in determining both resting oxygen consumption and oxidative capacity. In particular, we demonstrate that the level of complex formation between mTOR and one of its known protein partners, raptor, correlated with overall mitochondrial activity. Disruption of this complex following treatment with the mTOR pharmacological inhibitor rapamycin lowered mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption, and ATP synthetic capacity. Subcellular fractionation revealed that mTOR as well as mTOR-raptor complexes can be purified in the mitochondrial fraction. Using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, we further demonstrated that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin resulted in a dramatic alteration in the mitochondrial phosphoproteome. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of TSC2, p70 S6 kinase (S6K1), raptor, or rictor demonstrates that mTOR regulates mitochondrial activity independently of its previously identified cellular targets. Finally we demonstrate that mTOR activity may play an important role in determining the relative balance between mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial sources of ATP generation. These results may provide insight into recent observations linking the TOR pathway to life span regulation of lower organisms.

Finally we demonstrate that mTOR activity may play an important role in determining the relative balance between mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial sources of ATP generation. These results may provide insight into recent observations linking the TOR pathway to life span regulation of lower organisms. For nearly a century it has been appreciated that an organism's intrinsic metabolic rate is an important determinant of life span. This theory, initially known as the “rate of living” hypothesis, has merged with another proposed mechanism for aging first enunciated by Denham Harman (1Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6606) Google Scholar) and often called the “free radical theory of aging.” The basis for combining these two hypotheses came from observations demonstrating that mitochondria determine both cellular and organismal metabolic rate and that these organelles also produce a continuous stream of reactive oxygen species. Although both the rate of living and the “free radical” theories of aging remain viable and attractive explanations for determining the rate of aging in a wide range of species, neither hypothesis has been conclusively proven (2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar, 3Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar, 4Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3350) Google Scholar). Surprisingly relatively little is known regarding what regulates the intrinsic metabolic rate of an organism. Similarly on a cellular level the molecular regulation of mitochondrial activity is incompletely understood. Resting oxygen consumption presumably is set at a point to meet overall energetic demands. Nonetheless for most cells this basal respiration is considerably below the maximum oxidative capacity of the mitochondria. The maximal oxidative or ATP synthetic capacity can be easily assessed by treating the cell with various chemical uncouplers and thereby producing the maximal degree of respiration. It is important to note that although mitochondria are the most efficient generators of ATP, cells can also produce ATP through the cytosolic metabolism of glucose. This cytosolic process is particularly important during hypoxic conditions. Nonetheless even under normal aerobic laboratory conditions, most cultured cells rely on both aerobic mitochondrial metabolism and aerobic glycolysis to generate their basal ATP needs. Indeed for many cells in culture these two sources of ATP generation each appear to contribute to roughly half of the overall ATP supply (5Sariban-Sohraby S. Magrath I.T. Balaban R.S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4662-4664PubMed Google Scholar). It is presently unclear what determines the relative balance between cytosolic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism and why cells with significant unused mitochondrial capacity rely so heavily on less efficient non-mitochondrial energy sources. The use of lower organisms including yeast, flies, and worms has provided significant insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying aging. Both genetic and environmental interventions have been studied as potential modifiers of life span. Interestingly in simple organisms, structural mutations in mitochondrial subunits or knockdown of mitochondrial components has been shown to significantly alter life span albeit in both positive and negative directions (4Balaban R.S.

Caloric restriction is another non-genetic intervention that appears to be effective in extending life span in a wide range of organisms (10Guarente L. Picard F. Cell. 2005; 120: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the antiaging effects of caloric restriction remains incompletely understood. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, reducing the glucose concentration in the culture medium can increase the replicative life span of the organism by 20-40% (11Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 12Lin S.J. Kaeberlein M. Andalis A.A. Sturtz L.A. Defossez P.A. Culotta V.C. Fink G.R. Guarente L. Nature. 2002; 418: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Using a collection of yeast strains harboring single gene deletions, it was shown recently that the life span extension occurring with very low extracellular glucose requires the target of rapamycin (TOR) 2The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; raptor, regulatory associated protein of mTOR; rictor, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR; TMRM, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhdrazone; TSC2, tuberous sclerosis complex 2; p70 S6K1 or S6K1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase isoform 1; 4E-BP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein 1; HEK-293T, human embryonic kidney-293T; Cy2, -3, or -5, cyanine dye 2, 3, or 5; RNAi, RNA interference; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry. pathway (13Kaeberlein M. Powers III, R.W. Steffen K.K. Westman E.A. Hu D. Dang N. Kerr E.O. Kirkland K.T. Fields S. Kennedy B.K. Science. 2005; 310: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). A subsequent study suggested that this pathway is also involved in the chronological life span of yeast (14Powers III, R.W. Kaeberlein M. Caldwell S.D. Kennedy B.K. Fields S. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). These results are also supported by earlier observations in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila where it was demonstrated that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the TOR pathway can lead to life span extension in these organisms (15Vellai T. Takacs-Vellai K. Zhang Y. Kovacs A.L. Orosz L. Muller F. Nature. 2003; 426: 620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 16Kapahi P. Zid B.M. Harper T. Koslover D. Sapin V. Benzer S. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 885-890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). The TOR pathway is a well conserved pathway from yeast to mammalian cells (17Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 18Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that this pathway is sensitive to both the energetic supply and demand of the cell. TOR itself is a large serine/threonine protein kinase of ∼280 kDa and forms a multisubunit complex with numerous protein partners. In mammalian cells two distinct complexes have been identified: mTORC1 in which mTOR is bound to the protein partner raptor and mTORC2 in which mTOR is bound to another protein partner called rictor (17Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 18Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N. Cell. 2006; 124: 471-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4745) Google Scholar). These protein complexes appear to have distinct biological functions. Given the role of metabolism in aging and the role of the TOR pathway in life span determination, in this study we sought to understand the role of mTOR in regulating mitochondrial function and activity. Cell Culture and Reagents—Jurkat T cell leukemia clone E6-1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum; HEK-293T (ATCC) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. In general, cell sorting was performed in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Nucleofection of small interfering RNA (non-targeting control 2, TSC2, S6K, raptor, and rictor small interfering RNA from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Nucleofector kit V, Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD), and cells were routinely analyzed 72 h after transfection. Using a control expression plasmid encoding for green fluorescent protein we could demonstrate that ∼80% of Jurkat and HEK-293T cells could be transfected using this electroporation strategy. Where indicated, cells were incubated with either carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhdrazone (FCCP; 10 μm), oligomycin (0.2 μg/ml), or rapamycin (10 nm), all from Sigma. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Isolation of Mitochondria—Antibodies for immunoblotting were as follows: mTOR, raptor, phospho-p70 S6K1 (Thr-421/Ser-424), p70 S6K1, phospho-S6 (phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6) (Ser-235/236), S6, phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr-37/46), 4E-BP1, and TSC2 (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); rictor (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX); tubulin and α-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); VDAC1/porin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen); or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion, Austin, TX). Western blot analysis was performed by standard methods using enhanced chemiluminescence. Immunoprecipitation of mTOR complexes was performed as described previously (19Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar) using the N-19 mTOR antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated with the mitochondria purification kit for cultured cells (Pierce). Purity of the fractions was assessed by probing for tubulin and VDAC1/porin. Membrane Potential and Cell Sorting—Membrane potential was assessed using the potentiometric dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) at a final concentration of 25 nm for 15 min. At this concentration, significant autoquenching is thought to be minimized (20Nicholls D.G. Ward M.W. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 166-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis was performed with the FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems). Excitation light source was 15 milliwatts from an argon laser tuned to 488 nm. For sorting of cells with different mitochondrial membrane potential, Jurkat cells were sorted into three pools corresponding to the cells with the lowest (5%), median (10%), and highest (5%) TMRM fluorescence. For fluorescence determination of mitochondrial mass, cells were stained with MitoTracker Deep Red 633 (20 nm for 15 min). Cell sorting was performed on a MoFlo flow cytometer (Dako Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Fluorescence signals from TMRM were collected using logarithmic amplifiers. Data acquisition, analysis, and compensation were performed using Summit software (Dako Cytomation). Cell cycle analysis was performed by standard propidium iodine staining. Oxygen Consumption, Lactate, and ATP Measurements—Oxygen consumption was determined using the BD Oxygen Biosensor System (BD Biosciences) as described previously (21Wilson-Fritch L. Nicoloro S. Chouinard M. Lazar M.A. Chui P.C. Leszyk J. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in culture medium and subsequently transferred to a 96-well plate where the same numbers of cells (1 × 106) were placed in each well. Levels of oxygen consumption were measured under base-line conditions and in the presence of FCCP (1 μm) or oligomycin (0.2 μg/ml). Fluorescence was recorded using a GENios multimode reader (Tecan, San Jose, CA) at 2-min intervals for 2 h at an excitation of 485 nm and emission of 630 nm. For semiquantitative data analysis the maximum slope of fluorescence units/s was used and converted into arbitrary units. The respiration rates shown are triplicate determinations of a single experiment that are representative of at least three similar experiments. Alternatively levels of oxygen consumption were determined using a fiber optic oxygen monitor (Instech Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) as we have described previously (22Nemoto S. Fergusson M.M. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16456-16460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Lactate was measured using the lactate reagent (Trinity Biotech, Brey, Ireland). Simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and lactate production allowed for the calculation of the percentage of ATP derived from mitochondrial respiration rates and aerobic glycolysis as described previously (5Sariban-Sohraby S. Magrath I.T. Balaban R.S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4662-4664PubMed Google Scholar). ATP was measured using the ATP determination kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proteomics—Mitochondrial proteins isolated from ∼1 × 109 cells were solubilized using 100 μl of 1% SDS (w/v) in Tris buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) at 95 °C for 5 min. A chloroform/methanol precipitation step was performed to remove salts and lipids (23Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). The resulting pellet was dried and resuspended in 100 μl of a lysis buffer containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% CHAPS. Fifty micrograms each of the control and rapamycin-treated samples were labeled on lysine residues with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively. As an internal standard, 50 μg of a mixture consisting of 25 μg of the control and 25 μg of rapamycin-treated samples were labeled with Cy2 as described previously (24Hoffert J.D. van Balkom B.W. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F170-F179Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The first dimension isoelectric focusing was carried out using the IPG (immobilized pH gradient) strips (pH 3-10 non-linear) for a total of 63 kV-h (Ettan, IPGphor, GE Healthcare). The strips were then loaded onto an Ettan DALT-12 electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare), and the proteins were separated on a 10-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Jule Inc., Milford, CT) at room temperature for 16 h under a constant voltage (105 V). Image analysis was performed using cross-stain analysis function with Progenesis Discovery software (NonLinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). An automated Ettan Spot Handling Workstation (GE Healthcare) was used for gel spot picking, in-gel protein digestion with trypsin, and spotting on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) plates as described previously (24Hoffert J.D. van Balkom B.W. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F170-F179Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Peptides were analyzed using the Proteomics Analyzer (ABI 4700 MALDI-TOF/TOF). Full scan mass spectrometry (MS) spectra were obtained first followed by MS/MS spectra. Protein identification was carried out using the search engine MASCOT (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). Pro-Q Diamond staining for direct phosphoprotein determination was performed as described recently (25Hopper R.K. Carroll S. Aponte A.M. Johnson D.T. French S. Shen R.F. Witzmann F.A. Harris R.A. Balaban R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2524-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We were interested in the role of mTOR in mitochondrial metabolism and therefore sought a system to explore the endogenous variation in metabolic rate for cells in culture. To begin to address this issue, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to purify populations of cells based on the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential using the mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye TMRM. Furthermore because the number of cells that can be obtained by flow cytometry is limited, we adapted a recently described method that allows for the measurement of oxygen consumption of intact cells plated in microtiter wells (21Wilson-Fritch L. Nicoloro S. Chouinard M. Lazar M.A. Chui P.C. Leszyk J. Straubhaar J. Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This method uses microtiter wells coated with an oxygen-sensitive fluorophore and thus provides a means for real time measurement of metabolic rates. Such methodology reduced the number of cells required for reliable oxygen consumption by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. We chose to primarily study a Jurkat T cell line because this cell is routinely grown in suspension and therefore easy to sort and analyze by flow cytometry. Jurkat cells were initially loaded with the mitochondrial potential-sensitive dye TMRM and sorted based on low, medium, or high TMRM fluorescence (Fig. 1A). We next used a miniaturized assay to measure oxygen consumption. Approximately 1 × 106 M.Fl. cytometer-sorted ΔψmL, ΔψmM, or ΔψmH cells were transferred to individual microtiter wells, and the oxygen consumption of intact cells was measured under normal growth conditions or in the same media supplemented with oligomycin (to assess respiratory leak) or FCCP (to measure maximal oxidative capacity). As seen in Fig. 1B, there was a dramatic difference in the basal metabolic rate as well as the oxidative capacity of these differentially sorted cells. This microtiter-based technique does not allow for absolute quantification, and therefore oxygen consumption is expressed in terms of relative fluorescence units/s. Nonetheless when we compared the relative metabolic rate of unsorted Jurkat cells using the microtiter plate format with conventional assays using an oxygen electrode we saw a good concordance between these methods (Fig. 1, C and D). The basal level of ATP was also slightly higher in the ΔψmH cells (relative increase to ΔψmL: 19.2 ± 1.01%, n = 3, p < 0.01). Based on these results we next asked whether there was any evidence that levels of mTOR activity might be correlated to these observed differences in endogenous oxygen consumption and oxidative capacity. As seen in Fig. 2A, there were no differences in the absolute level of mTOR or the mTOR-interacting protein raptor in our sorted Jurkat cell populations. In contrast, we did observe that the degree of mTOR-raptor complex formation tightly correlated with the observed metabolic parameters (Fig. 2B). Similarly the level of phosphorylation of known mTOR targets such as p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) and 4E-BP1 appeared to also correlate with the observed metabolic phenotype (Fig. 2C). To further test whether mTOR-raptor association was an important regulator of mitochondrial metabolism we made use of rapamycin, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of mTOR-raptor complex formation (Fig. 3A). The dissociation of mTOR-raptor complexes with rapamycin is consistent with past observations (26Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. King J.E. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 27Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for the mTOR-raptor complex in regulating mitochondrial function, treatment of Jurkat cells with rapamycin resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3B). Similarly measurement of oxygen consumption and oxidative capacity of intact Jurkat cells with and without rapamycin treatment revealed that inhibiting mTOR-raptor complex formation dramatically altered metabolic rate and reduced overall oxidative capacity (Fig. 3C). Oxidative capacity is thought to represent an intrinsic property of the mitochondria suggesting that mTOR could potentially directly interact with the mitochondria. Interestingly the subcellular localization of mTOR is not well characterized, although a previous report has demonstrated that a fraction of mTOR directly associates with the mitochondria (28Desai B.N. Myers B.R. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4319-4324Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Consistent with that report, in our cells, fractionation experiments revealed that mTOR and raptor could both be identified in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 4A). Furthermore we could also immunoprecipitate intact mTOR-raptor complexes from both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 4B). Given that the mTOR-raptor complex appears to physically associate with the mitochondria and the stability of the mTOR-raptor complex correlates with mitochondrial activity, we next sought to assess whether we could observe any direct biochemical changes to the mitochondria following disruption of this complex. We therefore performed comparative proteomic analysis using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis of mitochondria extracts from untreated and rapamycin-treated cells. Over 1300 presumptive mitochondrial proteins could be resolved by this strategy. Comparison of control and rapamycin samples revealed no large difference in the level of proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation or substrate oxidation. This similarity in enzyme content between control and rapamycin-treated samples suggested that the decrease in ATP synthetic capacity observed following rapamycin treatment (Fig. 3C) was most likely due to post-translational modifications. In support of this notion, a number of proteins appeared to undergo shifts in their isoelectric focusing point consistent with a change in phosphorylation status (Fig. 4, C and D). Many of the proteins exhibiting differences in their isoelectric focusing point following rapamycin treatment could be identified by subsequent mass spectroscopic analysis. The proteins identified appeared to be enriched for enzymes involved in either intermediary metabolism or electron transport (Fig. 4D). Rapamycin treatment appeared to uniformly involve isoelectric shifts consistent with the dephosphorylation of these metabolic proteins, a result also consistent with the known role of rapamycin as an mTOR kinase inhibitor. Nonetheless it is currently unclear whether the proteins identified represent direct or indirect targets of mTOR or in fact whether these shifts represent changes in phosphorylation or oxidation. However, the supposition that these isoelectric shifts represented dephosphorylation of numerous mitochondrial proteins was further supported by Pro-Q Diamond staining of additional two-dimensional gels obtained from mitochondrial extracts derived from untreated and rapamycin-treated cells. The intensity of the Pro-Q Diamond stain has been shown previously to correlate with the degree of protein phosphorylation (25Hopper R.K. Carroll S. Aponte A.M. Johnson D.T. French S. Shen R.F. Witzmann F.A. Harris R.A. Balaban R.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2524-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29Martin K. Steinberg T.H. Cooley L.A. Gee K.R. Beechem J.M. Patton W.F.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6316-6326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry allowed us to again identify a number of individual Pro-Q Diamond-positive proteins, and as before, treatment with rapamycin appeared to reduce the level of phosphorylation (Fig. 4E). Although rapamycin is viewed as a specific inhibitor of the mTOR-raptor complex, we sought additional and complementary methods to alter the level of complex formation to assess the regulatory role of mTOR activity on mitochondrial function. We first made use of previous observations demonstrating that mTOR activity is negatively regulated by the TSC2 gene product (17Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 18Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N.

Transient expression of RNAi specific for TSC2 resulted in a significant decrease in TSC2 protein levels without affecting the levels of either mTOR or raptor (Fig. 5A). Consistent with previous results, TSC2 knockdown also augmented S6K activity (17Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 18Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N.

Interestingly TSC2 knockdown also consistently resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in mTOR-raptor complex formation (Fig. 5B). Consistent with a role for mTOR in regulating mitochondrial activity, TSC2 knockdown increased basal oxygen consumption as well as oxidative capacity (Fig. 5C). Similar increases in oxygen consumption were also seen following TSC2 knockdown in other cell types (Fig. 5, D and E). One possible explanation of these results is that mTOR stimulates an increase in energetic demand by augmenting protein translation via an increase in S6K1 activity. In an effort to test this we directly targeted S6K1 by RNAi (Fig. 6A). As demonstrated in Fig. 6B, this intervention had no measurable effect on mitochondrial metabolism. In contrast, knockdown of raptor resulted in a decrease in oxygen consumption (Fig. 6, C and D), whereas knockdown of rictor increased oxygen consumption and oxidative capacity (Fig. 6, E and F). Interestingly levels of mTOR-raptor complex were increased over 1.5-fold in rictor knockdown cells suggesting that, as reported previously in other cell types, raptor and rictor might compete for binding to mTOR (19Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The alteration in mitochondrial metabolism seen with either TSC2, S6K1, raptor, or rictor knockdown was not associated with significant change in mitochondrial mass as assessed by either VDAC1 levels (see Fig. 6, A, C, and F) or by staining with MitoTracker Deep Red, a membrane potential-independent fluorescent marker of mitochondrial mass (Fig. 6G). Similarly although inhibiting mTOR can cause G1 (Gap 1) delay we observed no alteration in the cell cycle in our various RNAi conditions (Fig. 6H). We next asked whether the observed perturbations in mitochondrial respiration significantly altered the relative balance of ATP generation. There are two main pathways for ATP generation in mammalian cells: the first is aerobic respiration in the mitochondria, whereas the second involves the metabolism of glucose in the cytosol. In control Jurkat cells, direct and simultaneous measurement of coupled respiration and lactate production revealed that these cells derive a little less than half of their ATP from mitochondrial metabolism (Table 1), a result not atypical for cells maintained in culture (5Sariban-Sohraby S. Magrath I.T. Balaban R.S. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 4662-4664PubMed Google Scholar). Knockdown of TSC2 and raptor appears to alter this balance. In particular, TSC2 knockdown cells derived ∼60% of their basal ATP needs from respiration, whereas raptor knockdown cells derived only 30% of their ATP from this source (Fig. 7A).TABLE 1Relative amount of ATP produced from mitochondrial respiration and aerobic glycolysisO2 consumptionLactate productionTotal ATPPercentage of ATP production fromRespirationGlycolysisnmol/min/108nmol/min/108nmol/min/108%5.47 ± 0.7126.1 ± 0.7370.0 ± 2.484456 Open table in a new tab In summary, we have provided evidence that mTOR activity and more precisely mTOR-raptor complex formation is tightly correlated with mitochondrial metabolism. In particular, cells sorted for spontaneous differences in resting mitochondrial respiration showed corresponding differences in their mTOR-raptor complexes and mTOR activity. Similarly disrupting mTOR-raptor complexes by either pharmacological means with rapamycin or genetically with RNAi resulted in a corresponding change in metabolism. There are at least two possible explanations for this relationship. The first is that increasing mTOR activity places a significant energetic load on the cell presumably through an increase in protein synthesis, ribosomal biogenesis, etc. that results in a corresponding reactive increase in mitochondrial activity. The second possibility is that mTOR can directly modulate mitochondrial metabolism in what might be described as a feed forward mechanism. Clearly these two possibilities need not be mutually exclusive. Although we cannot conclusively conclude which mechanism predominates we believe that our observations do provide evidence for a feed forward pathway. This primary regulation is supported by three observations. First, mTOR-raptor directly associated with the mitochondria, and disruption of mTOR-raptor resulted in a significant alteration in the mitochondrial phosphoproteome. Second, altering mTOR-raptor did not just affect the load-dependent property of basal oxygen consumption but also the total oxidative capacity of the cell, a measurement that is believed to reflect an intrinsic mitochondrial property. Finally if the alteration in mitochondrial metabolism were merely secondary to changes in energetic demand we would not expect the relative balance of aerobic to glycolytic ATP generation to be altered. Rather we would expect that if cellular demand went up or down mitochondrial metabolism and cytosolic glycolysis would go correspondingly up or down but do so while maintaining their initial balance. Although our oxygen consumption measurements have limitations with regard to quantification, our data (Fig. 7A) do suggest that knockdown of raptor and TSC2 appears to alter the relative contribution of cytosolic glycolysis to mitochondrial metabolism. These observations, in our view, further support a primary regulatory role of mTOR on mitochondrial activity. We performed our respiration experiments using intact cells, whereas the majority of previous studies have used isolated mitochondria. One somewhat surprising aspect of our data is that in our sorted cells the level of aerobic ATP production (i.e. oligomycin-sensitive oxygen consumption) and the mitochondrial membrane potential positively correlate (Fig. 1B). This is somewhat unusual because most events that increase the synthesis of ATP in isolated mitochondria that act solely through the F1F0-ATPase result in a lowering of membrane potential. A higher mitochondrial membrane potential in the face of higher respiration supports the notion that the overall capacity of the mitochondria to produce ATP has been enhanced. This supposition is also supported by our observation that oxidative capacity (maximal FCCP-stimulated respiration) increased as a function of mitochondrial membrane potential. We believe these observations highlight the potential utility of studying intact cells with intrinsic differences in endogenous mitochondrial activity and capacity rather then isolating and pooling mitochondria from metabolically heterogeneous tissues. Although both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 are important downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway, our data demonstrate that the ability of mTOR to regulate oxygen consumption and oxidative capacity appears to be independent of these known effectors. For instance, although TSC2 knockdown increased oxygen consumption it did not appear in Jurkat cells to significantly affect 4E-BP1. Similarly knockdown of S6K1 had no effect on overall oxygen consumption. Interestingly a recent report has demonstrated that S6K1-/- mice have a 5-fold increase in their rate of lipolysis. This large increase in substrate supply, as well as an increase in uncoupling, led to an observed 27% increase in total body oxygen consumption in these mice (32Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). As such, it is important to emphasize that observed in vivo metabolic rate reflects both intrinsic cellular parameters as measured here including mitochondrial number, activity, and coupling as well as a variety of extrinsic factors (nutrient supply, temperature, and overall demand). Previous results have suggested that perturbing mitochondrial function can influence mTOR activity by a property known as retrograde signaling (17Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar, 18Wullschleger S. Loewith R. Hall M.N.

We confirm that this pathway is also operational in Jurkat cells as agents that lower mitochondrial membrane potential rapidly inactivated mTOR activity (data not shown). Our rapamycin and RNAi results suggest, however, that the reciprocal regulation is also operative. As such, these results suggest that mitochondria can signal to mTOR and that mTOR may in turn regulate mitochondrial activity (Fig. 7B). It is possible that such a homeostatic loop may be essential for coordinating energy supply and demand during complicated and important mTOR-regulated processes such as cell cycle progression. Finally there is growing evidence that mitochondrial metabolism may play an important role in aging (2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar, 3Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 359-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar, 4Balaban R.S. Nemoto S.

An analysis of a large number of life-extending mutations in C. elegans has led to a hypothesis that these diverse genetic alterations may all function by inducing energetic shifts away from the mitochondria and toward alternative ATP-generating pathways (33Rea S. Johnson T.E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 197-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our observation that mTOR activity tightly correlates with oxygen consumption and serves to regulate the balance between glycolysis and aerobic metabolism appears consistent with that theoretical framework. We are grateful to Leigh Samsel and Ann Williams for expertly performing the sorts, to Michael Sack and Ines Pagel for assistance on oxygen consumption measurements, to Daniela Malide and Christian A.

https://openalex.org/W2099377713,"Global inhibition of protein synthesis is a common response to stress conditions. We have analyzed the regulation of protein synthesis in response to oxidative stress induced by exposure to H2O2 in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our data show that H2O2 causes an inhibition of translation initiation dependent on the Gcn2 protein kinase, which phosphorylates the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2. Additionally, our data indicate that translation is regulated in a Gcn2-independent manner because protein synthesis was still inhibited in response to H2O2 in a gcn2 mutant. Polysome analysis indicated that H2O2 causes a slower rate of ribosomal runoff, consistent with an inhibitory effect on translation elongation or termination. Furthermore, analysis of ribosomal transit times indicated that oxidative stress increases the average mRNA transit time, confirming a post-initiation inhibition of translation. Using microarray analysis of polysome- and monosome-associated mRNA pools, we demonstrate that certain mRNAs, including mRNAs encoding stress protective molecules, increase in association with ribosomes following H2O2 stress. For some candidate mRNAs, we show that a low concentration of H2O2 results in increased protein production. In contrast, a high concentration of H2O2 promotes polyribosome association but does not necessarily lead to increased protein production. We suggest that these mRNAs may represent an mRNA store that could become rapidly activated following relief of the stress condition. In summary, oxidative stress elicits complex translational reprogramming that is fundamental for adaptation to the stress.

We suggest that these mRNAs may represent an mRNA store that could become rapidly activated following relief of the stress condition. In summary, oxidative stress elicits complex translational reprogramming that is fundamental for adaptation to the stress. Cells must be able to maintain their intracellular homeostasis in the face of changing conditions. Typically, they respond by invoking complex regulatory mechanisms, including global inhibition of translation (1Clemens M.J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 27: 57-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 2Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This reduction in protein synthesis may prevent continued gene expression during potentially error-prone conditions as well as allow for the turnover of existing mRNAs and proteins, whilst gene expression is reprogrammed to deal with the stress. Four mammalian protein kinases that inhibit translation initiation by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) 2The abbreviations used are: eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TAP, tandem affinity purification; RT, reverse transcription. have been identified. GCN2 (the amino acid control kinase), PKR (the double-stranded protein kinase activated by RNA), HRI (the heme-regulated inhibitor), and PERK/PEK (the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum eIF2α kinase) are regulated independently in response to various different cellular stresses (2Proud C.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 3Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). For example, PERK has been found in all multicellular eukaryotes and is a component of the unfolded protein response. Consistent with its central role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, cells lacking PERK fail to phosphorylate eIF2α and do not down-regulate protein synthesis during ER stress conditions (4Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 5Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Attenuating protein synthesis may act to reduce the burden of newly synthesized ER client proteins on the ER folding machinery. Additionally, eIF2 phosphorylation induces translation of specific mRNAs, such as that encoding the metazoan activating transcription factor-4 (6Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 7Lu P.D. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 11: 27-33Crossref Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Activating transcription factor-4 mediates the integrated stress response, the targets of which include genes encoding proteins involved in amino acid metabolism and resistance to oxidative stress, ultimately protecting against the deleterious consequences of ER oxidation (8Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). In yeast, Gcn2 is the sole eIF2 kinase and phosphorylates eIF2α in response to nutrient starvation and sodium or rapamycin exposure. eIF2 is a guanine nucleotide-binding factor and, in the GTP-bound form, interacts with the initiator methionyl-tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) to form a ternary complex (eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet) that is competent for translation initiation. Following each round of initiation, eIF2 is released from the ribosome as a binary complex with GDP. GDP is replaced by GTP in a guanine nucleotide exchange reaction promoted by eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by Gcn2 converts eIF2 from a substrate to an inhibitor of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B (9Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The resulting decrease in eIF2B activity leads to reduced ternary complex levels. Paradoxically, translation of the GCN4 mRNA is activated in response to low ternary complex levels in a mechanism involving short upstream open reading frames (10Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Gcn4 is a transcription factor that activates gene expression of many targets, including amino acid biosynthetic genes (11Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Thus, analogous to the mammalian integrated stress response, activation of Gcn4 serves to overcome the imposed starvation, which initially led to the translational control. More recently, we used microarray analysis combined with polysome analysis to demonstrate that lowering ternary complex levels results in widespread translational reprogramming, identifying a fundamental role for translational control in the adaptation to nutrient limitation (12Smirnova J.B. Selley J.N. Sanchez-Cabo F. Carroll K. Eddy A.A. McCarthy J.E. Hubbard S.J. Pavitt G.D. Grant C.M. Ashe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9340-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All aerobic organisms are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2, the superoxide anion, and the hydroxyl radical, during the course of normal aerobic metabolism or following exposure to radical-generating compounds. These ROS cause wide-ranging damage to macromolecules, eventually leading to cell death (13Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1993; 19: 141-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 14Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine, 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). To protect against oxidant damage, cells contain effective defense mechanisms, including antioxidant enzymes and free radical scavengers (15Temple M.D. Perrone G.G. Dawes I.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 319-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Yeast cells can adapt to oxidative stress by altering global transcription, including genes encoding antioxidants and other metabolic enzymes (16Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar, 17Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S. Harbison C.T. Kanin E.J. ennings E.G. Lee T.I. True H.L. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that oxidative stress caused by exposure to H2O2 results in a rapid and reversible inhibition of protein synthesis (18Shenton D. Grant C.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear how changes in the gene expression program are translated into the cellular proteome. In this study, we have analyzed the regulation of protein synthesis in response to oxidative stress induced by exposure to H2O2. Our data show that H2O2 causes a dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis mediated in part by Gcn2-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α. In addition, we provide evidence that protein synthesis is repressed by a Gcn2-independent inhibition of ribosomal transit. We used microarray analysis to demonstrate that certain mRNAs are translationally maintained following oxidative stress, indicating that translational control is a key component of the cellular response to oxidative stress. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are isogenic derivatives of CY4 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3 leu2-112 trp1-1 ade2-1 his3-11 can1-100) (19Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged strains (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) were purchased from Open Biosystems. Strains were converted to methionine prototrophs by transforming with a PCR-generated MET15 gene to facilitate radiolabeling with l-[35S]cysteine/methionine. Strains were grown in rich YEPD medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) Bacto-peptone, and 2% (w/v) glucose) or minimal synthetic dextrose medium (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5% (w/v) ammonium sulfate, and 2% (w/v) glucose) supplemented with appropriate amino acids and bases (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar) at 30 °C and 180 rpm. Media were solidified by the addition of 2% (w/v) agar. Assays of GCN4-lacZ Reporter Expression—Standard methods for measuring the β-galactosidase activity for strains bearing GCN4-lacZ fusions were used (21Lucchini G. Hinnebusch A.G. Chen C. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase levels are expressed as nanomoles of o-nitrophenol β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolyzed per min/μg of total protein. Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed using anti-eIF2α and anti-phospho-eIF2α antibodies as described previously (22Holmes L.E. Campbell S.G. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Ashe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2998-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). TAP-tagged proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using peroxidase·anti-peroxidase complex (Sigma). Analysis of Protein Synthesis—The rate of protein synthesis was measured in exponential phase cells treated with H2O2 for 15 min and pulse-labeled for the last 5 min with 85 μm l-[35S]cysteine/methionine (18Shenton D. Grant C.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). TAP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using IgG-Sepharose beads as described previously (23Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Séraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). For the analysis of ribosome distribution on sucrose density gradients, yeast cultures were grown to exponential phase and treated with H2O2 as appropriate. Extracts were prepared and analyzed as described previously (24Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Monosome and polysome peaks were quantified using NIH Image J software. For transit time measurements, cells were pulsed-labeled with 85 μm l-[35S]cysteine/methionine, and aliquots were taken at regular intervals. Extracts were prepared in 200 μg/ml cycloheximide, and radioactive incorporation was measured in the total (completed and unfinished proteins) and completed protein fractions by liquid scintillation counting (25Nielsen P.J. McConkey E.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transit times were determined by comparing the incorporation of radioactive amino acids into total proteins and completed proteins released from ribosomes. Polysome Analysis and RNA Preparation—Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (12Smirnova J.B. Selley J.N. Sanchez-Cabo F. Carroll K. Eddy A.A. McCarthy J.E. Hubbard S.J. Pavitt G.D. Grant C.M. Ashe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9340-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 A260 units were layered onto 35-ml 15-50% sucrose gradients and sedimented via centrifugation at 16,900 rpm for 13 h in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. Gradients were collected, and RNA quality was assessed using a 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For comparison of RNA levels, fractions 4-8 and 11-15 from the gradient were pooled together for monosomal and polysomal RNA samples, respectively (see Fig. 4B). Thus, we focused on only the most strongly and poorly translated mRNAs, omitting some mRNAs that are located in the dimer region of the gradient. Total RNA samples were prepared according standard protocols (www.cogeme.man.ac.uk/Facilities/TRF%20Protocols.htm). RNA analysis by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out using the MyiQ single-color real-time PCR detection system and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Microarray Analysis—Microarray experiments were performed using the GeneChip yeast genome S98 oligonucleotide array (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions (www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/manuals.affx). Approximately 10 μg of polysomal, monosomal, or total RNA was processed into biotinylated cRNA according to the Affymetrix protocols. 15 μg of biotinylated cRNA targets was fragmented and hybridized to the arrays at 45 °C for 16 h. The arrays were then processed using the Affymetrix EukGE-WS2 fluidics protocol (Version 4_450) and stained with R-phycoerythrin conjugated to streptavidin (Molecular Probes). Microarray images were acquired using GeneChip Scanner 2500 (Affymetrix) and Microarray Suite Version 5.0 software. For consistency with previous studies (12Smirnova J.B. Selley J.N. Sanchez-Cabo F. Carroll K. Eddy A.A. McCarthy J.E. Hubbard S.J. Pavitt G.D. Grant C.M. Ashe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9340-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we used robust multi-array analysis normalization to normalize the array data as well as further analysis using the Affymetrix library of procedures (Affy Version 1.5.8) in Bioconductor (Version 1.5, www.bioconductor.org) within R (Version 2.0.1, www.r-project.com). Robust multi-array analysis normalization was observed to produce more robust treatment of replicates as seen from standard MA plots used to compare the biological replicate samples (data not shown). Pooled polysomal and monosomal fractions generated very modest dispersal, demonstrating that the procedure we have developed is highly reproducible and fulfills all of the standard criteria generally applicable to microarray data (26Brazma A. Hingamp P. Quackenbush J. Sherlock G. Spellman P. Stoeckert C. Aach J. Ansorge W. Ball C.A. Causton H.C. Gaasterland T. Glenisson P. Holstege F.C. Kim I.F. Markowitz V. Matese J.C. Parkinson H. Robinson A. Sarkans U. Schulze-Kremer S. Stewart J. Taylor R. Vilo J. Vingron M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3337) Google Scholar). The data sets are publicly available at ArrayExpress (accession number E-MEXP-526). Hydrogen Peroxide Inhibits Protein Synthesis—Cells were treated with H2O2 for 15 min, and the rate of protein synthesis was measured during the final 5 min by the incorporation of [35S]cysteine/methionine. H2O2 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of protein synthesis with maximal inhibition observed at concentrations >1.0 mm (Fig. 1A). The inhibition of protein synthesis caused by H2O2 prompted us to analyze translational activity by examining the distribution of polysomes. Polysomes are ribosomes that are actively translating mRNAs. They can be separated on sucrose density gradients and quantified by measuring absorbance at 254 nm. Extracts prepared from the untreated strain exhibited normal profiles, including peaks corresponding to 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits, monosomes (80 S ribosomes), and polysomes (Fig. 1B). There was a dramatic shift of ribosomes from the polysomal region into the monosome or 80 S peak following treatment with H2O2. The accumulation of ribosomes in the 80 S peak of a sucrose gradient is indicative of decreased translation initiation. Polysome profiles from cells treated with cycloheximide during the peroxide treatment were analyzed to ensure that this effect did not arise because of peroxide activating global mRNA degradation in yeast. Incubation with cycloheximide was found to preserve polysomes during peroxide treatment, ruling out any effect on mRNA degradation (Fig. 1C). Oxidative Stress Induces Gcn2-dependent eIF2α Phosphorylation— One of the best characterized translational regulatory pathways in yeast involves phosphorylation at Ser51 of the eIF2α subunit by the Gcn2 kinase. Gcn2 is activated in response to amino acid starvation and ultimately brings about an inhibition of translation initiation (10Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). To test whether the H2O2-dependent translation inhibition relies upon this pathway, we examined eIF2α phosphorylation by immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphorylated eIF2α antibody. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was observed in response to all concentrations and was maximal at 0.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2A), corresponding with maximal polysome decrease (Fig. 1B). Deletion of GCN2 abrogates phosphorylation of eIF2α and results in translational resistance to amino acid starvation (10Hinnebusch A.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 407-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Similarly, no inhibition of translation initiation was observed in a gcn2 mutant in response to oxidative stress because loss of GCN2 prevented the accumulation of monosomes in response to H2O2 (Fig. 2B). However, polysomes were maintained in the gcn2 mutant following H2O2 treatment compared with the wild-type strain, indicating an effect at the post-initiation phase of translation (see below). Inhibition of translation initiation was also abrogated in a strain containing a mutant form of eIF2α lacking Ser51 that is the target of phosphorylation (data not shown). The Gcn1·Gcn20 complex binds to Gcn2 and is thought to mediate the activation of Gcn2 by uncharged tRNA. The inhibition of translation initiation promoted by H2O2 stress was reduced by loss of GCN1 or GCN20, indicating that the activation of Gcn2 by H2O2 is liable to operate via a mechanism similar to amino acid starvation (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of eIF2α causes a global inhibition of protein synthesis as well as gene-specific translational activation of GCN4, which encodes a transcriptional activator protein (27Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). GCN4 expression has been widely measured using a GCN4-lacZ reporter containing the GCN4 promoter and 5′-untranslated region driving expression of the lacZ gene. This reporter provides a convenient means to assess Gcn2-dependent inhibition of eIF2B activity mediated by eIF2α phosphorylation. When expression from this GCN4-lacZ reporter was measured following H2O2 treatment for 2 h, a modest 2-fold induction was seen in response to 0.2 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2C). This induction was dependent on Gcn2 because there was no induction in a gcn2 mutant. Surprisingly, GCN4 expression was inhibited at higher concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 2C) despite the finding that maximal phosphorylation of eIF2α was at 0.5 mm H2O2 (Fig. 2A). To investigate the reason for this inhibition, we measured the rate of protein synthesis in a gcn2 mutant that could not inhibit translation initiation in response to H2O2 (Fig. 2B) and found that protein synthesis was still inhibited in the gcn2 mutant, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data indicate that H2O2 exposure causes a global inhibition of protein synthesis via Gcn2-dependent inhibition of translation initiation as well as via an additional mechanism that does not affect initiation. Oxidative Stress Inhibits Ribosomal Transit—Polysome analysis showed that H2O2 caused an inhibition of translation initiation (Fig. 1A). The extracts for these profiles were prepared in the presence of the translation elongation inhibitor cycloheximide to prevent continued elongation and ribosomal runoff. An inhibition of ribosomal transit (elongation plus termination of polypeptide chains) should be seen as a preservation of polysomes when extracts are prepared in the absence of cycloheximide. However, even a diminished rate of ribosomal runoff is extremely rapid and difficult to detect (28Tuite M.F. Stansfield I. Planta R.J. Brown A.J.P. Tuite M.F. Methods in Microbiology: Yeast Gene Analysis. 26. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 351-373Google Scholar). We therefore took the approach of inhibiting translation initiation by shifting cells to medium lacking glucose following the treatment with H2O2. Glucose withdrawal from the growth medium results in a rapid (<1 min) inhibition of translation initiation (24Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that this would allow us to better detect any effect on ribosomal transit without the added complication of de novo translation initiation. Cells were either left untreated or treated with 2 mm H2O2 prior to the switch to medium lacking glucose. Glucose withdrawal resulted in a rapid inhibition of translation initiation as expected (Fig. 3A), and ribosomal runoff occurred in control experiments, resulting in a loss of ∼60% of the polysomes within 2 min (Fig. 3B). In contrast, polysomes were maintained following the H2O2 treatment, and ∼80% of the polysomes were maintained for 2 min. Ribsosomal transit times can be measured by comparing the incorporation of [35S]cysteine/methionine into total protein and completed polypeptide chains released from ribosomes (25Nielsen P.J. McConkey E.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1980; 104: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using this technique, we determined that the average mRNA transit time in a gcn2 mutant is ∼86 s (Fig. 3C). H2O2 treatment (0.5 mm) increased the transit time by ∼50% to ∼131 s (Fig. 3D). Because a gcn2 mutant could not inhibit translation initiation (Fig. 2), these data confirm that there is an inhibition of translation elongation or termination in response to H2O2. Global Gene Expression Profiling Reveals That Certain mRNAs Are Translationally Maintained following Oxidative Stress—The use of expression profiling techniques such as microarray analyses can be used to analyze protein synthesis (29Beilharz T.H. Preiss T. Brief. Funct. Genomics Proteomics. 2004; 3: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We used this technology to identify mRNAs that are translationally regulated in response to oxidative stress conditions. Cell extracts were prepared from yeast cells treated with 0.2 or 2 mm H2O2 for 15 min. These concentrations were chosen because they had a similar effect on translation initiation (Fig. 1B) but inhibited protein synthesis to different extents (Fig. 1A). The 15-min treatment with 0.2 mm H2O2 reduced cell viability by ∼20% compared with 65% loss of viability upon treatment with 2.0 mm H2O2. The 2.0 mm treatment also significantly slowed the growth of cells compared with the 0.2 mm treatment (Fig. 4A). Polysomal gradients from the selected stress conditions were separated into fractions (as described below), and in addition, total RNA samples (total stressed or total control) were prepared from stressed and control yeast cells to quantify standard transcript level changes. The resulting RNA samples were processed into cRNA and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays. The analysis was performed in duplicate, and the data were processed and compared using the bioinformatics analyses described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression profiling studies generally compare the ratio of mRNAs in polysomal (P) and monosomal (M) fractions between stressed (S) and control (C) yeast cells. For example, when translation is inhibited at the level of initiation, the association of mRNAs with the polysomal versus non-polysomal fraction can be used as a marker that represents the translational activity of specific mRNAs (29Beilharz T.H. Preiss T. Brief. Funct. Genomics Proteomics. 2004; 3: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We recently defined the ratio PS/MS:PC/MC as the “translational state” of an individual mRNA and used it to identify mRNAs that are translationally maintained in response to the eIF2B-targeting stresses, amino acid starvation and fusel alcohol addition (12Smirnova J.B. Selley J.N. Sanchez-Cabo F. Carroll K. Eddy A.A. McCarthy J.E. Hubbard S.J. Pavitt G.D. Grant C.M. Ashe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9340-9349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, when translation is inhibited by attenuating elongating ribosomes, as is the case for H2O2, increased polysome association cannot be used as a marker of the translational state of mRNAs. It was therefore necessary to develop a novel strategy to identify candidate mRNAs that are translationally regulated following H2O2 stress. Specifically, we compared the mRNAs in monosomal and polysomal fractions during stress conditions (PS+MS) with the mRNAs in monosomal and polysomal fractions during control conditions (PC+MC) (Fig. 4B). We reasoned that any mRNAs that can overcome the initiation block would have more ribosomes bound during stress conditions, resulting in an increase in PS+MS compared with PC+MC. These values were plotted on a scatter plot for stressed (y axis) and unstressed (x axis) cells (Fig. 5, A and B), where the intersection generates the change in translational activity for the mRNAs (PS+MS:PC+MC). This analysis facilitates the identification of those mRNAs that can overcome the block in translation initiation because they contain more ribosomes (both monosomal and polysomal) following the stress treatment. Within this population of mRNAs, we reasoned that it is possible to identify those mRNAs that are also somewhat resistant to the ribosomal transit block because they will contain more polysomes bound during stress conditions compared with control conditions, resulting in an increase in the PS:PC ratio (Fig. 5, A and B, red). Thus, we were able to identify those mRNAs that can overcome the inhibition of translation initiation (using the PS+MS: PC+MC ratio) as well as the mRNAs within this population that can overcome the inhibition of ribosomal transit to accumulate an increase in polyribosomes (using the PS:PC ratio). Interestingly, the two stress conditions gave very different translational profiles. Using a 2-fold cutoff value for the change in translational activity (PS+MS:PC+MC), 231 mRNAs (130 up and 101 down) and 230 mRNAs (98 up and 132 down) were significantly altered following treatment with 0.2 or 2.0 mm H2O2, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). The majority of these mRNAs were also somewhat resistant to the ribosomal transit block because they contained more polysomes bound during stress conditions compared with control conditions (0.2 mm, 199 mRNAs; and 2.0 mm, 198 mRNAs) (Fig. 5, A and B). To assess whether a similar set of mRNAs are altered following each stress condition, we highlighted those mRNAs that chang"

In the present study we have identified and characterized the human PreP homologue, hPreP, in brain mitochondria, and we show its capacity to degrade the amyloid β-protein (Aβ). PreP belongs to the pitrilysin oligopeptidase family M16C containing an inverted zinc-binding motif. We show that hPreP is localized to the mitochondrial matrix. In situ immuno-inactivation studies in human brain mitochondria using anti-hPreP antibodies showed complete inhibition of proteolytic activity against Aβ. We have cloned, overexpressed, and purified recombinant hPreP and its mutant with catalytic base Glu78 in the inverted zinc-binding motif replaced by Gln. In vitro studies using recombinant hPreP and liquid chromatography nanospray tandem mass spectrometry revealed novel cleavage specificities against Aβ-(1-42), Aβ-(1-40), and Aβ Arctic, a protein that causes increased protofibril formation an early onset familial variant of Alzheimer disease. In contrast to insulin degrading enzyme, which is a functional analogue of hPreP, hPreP does not degrade insulin but does degrade insulin B-chain. Molecular modeling of hPreP based on the crystal structure at 2.1 Å resolution of AtPreP allowed us to identify Cys90 and Cys527 that form disulfide bridges under oxidized conditions and might be involved in redox regulation of the enzyme.

One of them is Alzheimer disease (AD) 4The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β-protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; IDE, insulin degrading enzyme; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; oPh, ortho-phenanthroline; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; Ma, matrix; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography nanospray tandem mass spectrometry; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; NRD, di-basic convertase Nardilysin. 4The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β-protein; APP, amyloid precursor protein; IDE, insulin degrading enzyme; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; oPh, ortho-phenanthroline; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DTT, dithiothreitol; OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; Ma, matrix; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography nanospray tandem mass spectrometry; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; NRD, di-basic convertase Nardilysin. in which the polymerization of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) into insoluble fibrils in brain seems to be a pathological event. An extracellular accumulation of Aβ has been the main focus of molecular studies associated with AD (1Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). However, increasing attention is directed toward intracellular events including the mitochondrial role in AD (2Glabe C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). There are many links between mitochondrial dysfunctions and AD (3Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Crews L. Masliah E. Neuromolecular Med. 2003; 4: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 4Yan S.D. Stern D.M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2005; 86: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Impairment of mitochondrial energy metabolism and altered cytochrome c oxidase activity are among the earliest detectable defects in AD (5Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 6Cardoso S.M. Santana I. Swerdlow R.H. Oliveira C.R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) 695 is not only targeted to the plasma membrane but also to mitochondria (5Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Robin M.A. Avadhani N.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Accumulation of APP in the outer mitochondrial membrane caused dysfunctions and impaired energy metabolism. The active γ-secretase complex including presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, which cleave APP to generate Aβ, has been shown to be present in the mitochondrial outer membrane (7Hansson C.A. Frykman S. Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Nilsberth C. Pursglove S.E. Ito A. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. Thyberg J. Ankarcrona M. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the occurrence of Aβ in mitochondria of AD patients and its direct binding to ABAD (Aβ-binding alcohol dehydrogenase, also called ERAB) induces apoptosis and free radical generation in neurons (8Lustbader J.W. Cirilli M. Lin C. Xu H.W. Takuma K. Wang N. Caspersen C. Chen X. Pollak S. Chaney M. Trinchese F. Liu S. Gunn-Moore F. Lue L.F. Walker D.G. Kuppusamy P. Zewier Z.L. Arancio O. Stern D. Yan S.S. Wu H. Science. 2004; 304: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that Aβ is present in the mitochondrial matrix in AD brains and in brains from transgenic mice overexpressing mutant human APP that impairs neuronal energetics and contributes to cellular dysfunction in AD (9Caspersen C. Wang N. Yao J. Sosunov A. Chen X. Lustbader J.W. Wei Xu H. Stern D. McKhann G. Yan S.D. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 2040-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). We have recently identified a novel mitochondrial metalloendopeptidase in Arabidopsis thaliana, presequence protease AtPreP, which degrades targeting peptides that are cleaved off in mitochondria after completed protein import (10Stahl A. Moberg P. Ytterberg J. Panfilov O. Brockenhuus Von Lowenhielm H. Nilsson F. Glaser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41931-41939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). AtPreP has been shown to degrade not only targeting peptides but also other unstructured peptides up to 70 amino acids residues in length but not small proteins (11Moberg P. Stahl A. Bhushan S. Wright S.J. Eriksson A. Bruce B.D. Glaser E. Plant J. 2003; 36: 616-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Stahl A. Nilsson S. Lundberg P. Bhushan S. Biverstahl H. Moberg P. Morisset M. Vener A. Maler L. Langel U. Glaser E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 847-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, AtPreP is also present in chloroplasts, and it uses an ambiguous signal for targeting of the protein to both mitochondria and chloroplasts (13Bhushan S. Lefebvre B. Stahl A. Wright S.J. Bruce B.D. Boutry M. Glaser E. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). hPreP is a metalloendopeptidase that belongs to the pitrilysin family (subfamily M16C) of oligopeptidases called also inverzincins, as they contain an inverted zinc-binding motif (14Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have determined the crystal structure of AtPreP refined at 2.1 Å (15Johnson K.A. Bhushan S. Stahl A. Hallberg M. Glaser E. Eneqvist T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that is the first structure of a protein belonging to the pitrilysin family with a bound substrate peptide (Protein Data Bank accession code 2FGE). The AtPreP structure revealed a unique totally enclosed large cavity of 10,000 Å3 that opens and closes in response to peptide binding, revealing a novel catalytic mechanism for proteolysis. We have identified amino acid residues involved in catalysis and shown that amino acids located about 800 residues from the inverted zinc-binding motif contribute to the formation of the active site. As PreP-catalyzed proteolysis occurs in the cavity (like in the proteasome) we refer to the structure of PreP as peptidasome (15Johnson K.A. Bhushan S. Stahl A. Hallberg M. Glaser E. Eneqvist T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PreP is an organellar functional analogue of the human insulin degrading enzyme, IDE, that also belongs to the pitrilysin family. IDE has been implicated in AD as it cleaves Aβ before insoluble amyloid fibers are formed (16Kurochkin I.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 421-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 17Selkoe D.J.

Neuron. 2004; 43: 605-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Moreover, a genetic deletion of IDE in mice leads to significant elevation in brain Aβ levels (19Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E.

Hersh L.B. Thiele D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6221-6226Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of IDE in neurons prevented AD-type pathology in transgenic mice overexpressing APP (21Leissring M.A. Farris W. Chang A.Y. Walsh D.M. Wu X. Sun X. Frosch M.P. Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2003; 40: 1087-1093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). These findings led us to investigate the degradation of Aβ by human PreP, hPreP. hPreP comprises 1037 amino acids and shows 48% sequence similarity (31% identity) to AtPreP. It has been previously identified and referred to as a metalloprotease, hMP1 (22Mzhavia N. Berman Y.L. Qian Y. Yan L. Devi L.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Intracellular localization of hMP1 was not previously studied. hMP1 has been shown to be widely and highly expressed in different cell lines and tissues on the mRNA expression level. Here we show that the human PreP is localized to the mitochondrial matrix in mammalian mitochondria where besides presequence and other unstructured peptide degradation it has a novel function, degradation of Aβ. We have produced recombinant hPreP and characterized hPreP proteolytic activity both in situ and in vitro. We show that hPreP efficiently degrades different Aβ proteins. Immuno-inactivation studies in human brain mitochondria using anti-hPreP antibodies reveal complete inhibition of the proteolytic activity against Aβ showing that under circumstances when Aβ is present in the mitochondria, hPreP is the protease responsible for degradation of this toxic protein. Furthermore, we have investigated the degradation pattern of the Aβ protein using mass spectrometric analysis. The analysis reveals several unique cleavage sites on Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ Arctic protein. Our findings contribute to studies of the mitochondrial component in AD. Preparation of Human Mitochondria—Post-mortem brain material (cortex) (four cases, age: 58-91 years; post-mortem delay: 14-24 h) was obtained from the Huddinge Brain Bank, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden, and mitochondria were isolated as described by Ankarcrona et al. (23Ankarcrona M. Hultenby K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ethical approval was received from the local Ethical Committee at Karolinska Institutet Huddinge Universitetssjukhus. 1 g of brain tissue was thawed and homogenized in buffer A (250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) by 10 strokes at 1500 rpm with a high torque motor-driven pestle. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and cell nuclei were removed by two centrifugations at 600 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Mitochondria were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) plus 20% glycerol, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -70 °C before use. Preparation and Subfractionation of Rat Liver Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated from liver of 200-g body weight Sprague-Dawley male rats by differential centrifugation technique according to Lapidus and Sokolove (24Lapidus R.G. Sokolove P.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To obtain mitoplasts rat liver mitochondria were diluted 10 times with sonication buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5 (1 mg/ml final concentration) and incubated 20 min at 4 °C following centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min. The pellet containing mitoplasts was either used directly for determination of rat PreP localization or used for preparation of the inner membrane and matrix fractions, which were obtained after sonication of mitoplasts and subsequent centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatant containing outer membrane as well as soluble inter membrane space proteins were further centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet contained outer membrane, whereas soluble intermembrane space proteins were concentrated by precipitation with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and suspended to 1 mg/ml in sonication buffer. Overexpression and Purification of hPreP and Its hPreP-(E78Q) and hPreP(C90S) Mutants—An Escherichia coli overexpression strain, BL21(DE3), was transformed with the pGEX-6P-2 vector containing the predicted mature part (amino acids 27-1036 of hPreP (AAH05025, gi:13477137) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and was grown at 30 °C in LB medium. After 4 h, 1 mm IPTG was added to the culture, and the incubation was continued for another 4 h. The cells were pelleted, re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3), and lysed by addition of 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 10 μg/ml DNase I followed by sonication for 3 × 30 s. The lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g and filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane. The supernatant was loaded onto a GSTrap FF 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The hPreP was eluted after on-column cleavage with PreScission Protease according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The eluted hPreP was applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 8.0. The protein content of eluted fractions from GSTrap FF and Superdex 200 HR10/30 was analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE in the presence of 4 m urea (Laemmli 1970) (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Mutants of hPreP(E78Q) and hPreP (C90S) were constructed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing using a DYEnamic sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). The hPreP mutant (E78Q) for production antibodies was overexpressed in E. coli as GST-hPreP fusion, induced with IPTG in the presence of 10 μm zinc acetate, and purified as follows: anion exchange on 10-ml ResourceQ15 column was used to capture the fusion protein, then a second anion exchange step on a 6-ml ReSourceQ column was performed to obtain pure fusion protein. Then the fusion protein was desalted into cleavage buffer (Amersham Biosciences) and reacted overnight at 4 °C with PreScission protease. The cleaved hPreP mutant was purified by anion exchange on the 6-ml ReSourceQ column and then was loaded onto a 26 × 60 Superdex200 gel filtration column. The gel filtration peaks were concentrated by ultrafiltration to 5 mg/ml. Degradation Assays—The degradation assay for studying the proteolytic activity of recombinant hPreP contained 1 μg purified hPreP and following substrates: 1 μg of Aβ-(1-40) or Aβ-(1-42) or Aβ-(1-40) E22G in a degradation buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2. For the inhibitory studies, 1 mm PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 20 mm oPh (ortho-phenanthroline), 1 mm NEM (N-ethylmaleimide, 100 units ml-1 apyrase, 50 μg/ml bestatin were preincubated with 1 μg of hPreP on ice for 10 min before addition of the substrate. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reactions were stopped by addition of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, analyzed on 10-20% Tris-Tricine gels (Bio-Rad), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To investigate the degradation of insulin and insulin B-chain by hPreP, 1 μg of insulin or insulin B-chain was incubated with 1 μg of purified hPreP in the degradation buffer for 1 h at 37°C. The reactions were stopped and analyzed as described above. Proteolytic activity of the PreP cysteine mutant was investigated under oxidizing conditions (2.5 mm K3Fe(CN)6) and reducing conditions (2.5 mm DTT). The protease was incubated under the respective conditions at room temperature for 5 min prior to the addition of Aβ. The proteolytic activity of the human mitochondrial matrix and the rat mitochondrial subfractions was tested by incubation of the samples with Aβ for 3 h at 37 °C. Proteolytic activity in the presence of protease inhibitors was tested after preincubation of the matrix fraction (20 μg) with the inhibitors for 10 min at 4 °C before addition of 1 μg of Aβ-(1-40). The reactions were stopped by adding 2 × Laemmli sample buffer, analyzed on 10-20% Tris-Tricine gels (BioRad), and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Intracellular Localization of hPreP—Human brain mitochondria were isolated as described elsewhere by Ankarcrona et al. (23Ankarcrona M. Hultenby K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Human mitochondrial membrane and matrix were obtained by resuspending isolated mitochondria in a sonication buffer. The resuspended mitochondria were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by sonication 5 × 15 s on ice and centrifuged at 18,600 × g to discard the unbroken mitochondria. The supernatant was thereafter ultracentrifuged at 70,000 rpm (Beckman TL-100 Ultracentrifuge, TLA 100.2 rotor) for 45 min. Human brain cytosol, mitochondria, membrane, and matrix were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE in the presence of 4 m urea. Immunological cross-reactivity was analyzed by Western blot analysis using nitrocellulose membrane Hybond™ (Amersham Biosciences) with antibodies raised against hPreP, F1 moiety of the ATP synthase from N. plumbaginifolia, and Tim17 followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Intracellular localization of PreP in rat liver mitochondria, mitoplasts, and different mitochondrial subfractions, outer membrane (OM), inner membrane (IM), intermembrane space (IMS), and matrix (Ma), was studied by Western blot analysis with compartment-specific antibodies against porin (OM), Tim17 (IM), Omi (IMS), and GRP75 (Ma) using ECL detection system. Immuno-inactivation—Immuno-inactivation studies were performed as follows: 6 μg of antibodies raised against hPreP or 18 μg of antibodies raised against presequence of F1β subunit of the ATP synthase from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, pF1β-(2-54), were preincubated with human mitochondrial soluble fraction at 4 °C for 30 min before addition of Aβ-(1-40). The samples were incubated for 3 h at 37°C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed on 12-20% SDS-PAGE in the presence of 4 m urea. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane Hybond™ (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Signet Laboratories) at 1:1000. Immunoreactivity was detected with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody and ELC (Amersham Biosciences). Mass Spectrometric Analysis; High Performance Liquid Chromatography-MS/MS—The sample was concentrated and desalted using ZipTips (Millipore) and injected onto a 0.1 × 150-mm C18 column (YMC Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) using a nano-LC injector (Valco Instruments) with a 1-ml loop. Peptides were eluted using a water/acetonitrile gradient supplemented with 0.2% formic acid: from 10-20% acetonitrile in 10 min, 20-35% acetonitrile in 30 min, and 35-50% acetonitrile in 15 min. The flow rate was 400 nl/min delivered by an Agilent 1100 nanopump (Agilent Technologies), and the column was coupled to an Agilent ion trap mass spectrometer (Agilent) fitted with a nanospray interface. Mass spectra were recorded from m/z 240 to 1800, and the three largest peaks in each spectrum were subjected to MS/MS analysis. The cycle time was 12 s. Peak areas were obtained from the selected ion traces corresponding to the calculated masses of the intact and cleaved peptide. Homology Modeling of hPreP and Flexible Aβ Docking—The homology model of hPreP was based on the 2.1-Å crystal structure of AtPreP (Protein Data Bank accession code 2FGE (15Johnson K.A. Bhushan S. Stahl A. Hallberg M. Glaser E. Eneqvist T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using the internal coordinate mechanics energy optimization method (26Abagyan R. Batalov S. Cardozo T. Totrov M. Webber J. Zhou Y. Proteins Suppl. 1997; 1: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Abagyan R. Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1994; 19: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and a sequence alignment generated by CLUSTALW (28Higgins D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). The model comprises all atoms including hydrogens and was created by the zero end gap dynamic programming algorithm, where the backbone and conserved side chains adopt the same conformation as the template. Loop regions were subjected to search against a data base of loop structures from the Protein Data Bank, and loops with the closest matching sequences and loop end positions are inserted into the homology model. The bound Aβ-(12-17) peptide was created by substituting the side chains of the unidentified peptide found in the AtPreP crystal structure followed by several rounds of energy optimization implemented by Internal Coordinate Mechanics to allow the peptide to adopt a conformation that fit the active site of the hPreP model. The coordinates of AtPreP have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 2FGE (15Johnson K.A. Bhushan S. Stahl A. Hallberg M. Glaser E. Eneqvist T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Degradation of Aβ Proteins by hPreP—The recombinant hPreP was cloned as a fusion protein with GST, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity on GSTrap FF column after cleavage with PreScission protease (Fig. 1A). hPreP has a molecular mass of 114 kDa. The “light” band at about 70 kDa corresponds to DnaK indicating that small quantity of this bacterial molecular chaperone co-purifies with hPreP. The recombinant hPreP shows proteolytic activity against different Aβ proteins. Fig. 1B shows SDS-PAGE of amyloid β-proteins degradation by hPreP. hPreP completely degraded both Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ-(1-42) as well as Aβ Arctic protein (1-42 E22G), a protein that causes an AD-like pathology, with an approximate activity of 0.053 μg of Aβ/min/μg of hPreP. To compare proteolytic activities of hPreP and IDE, the degradation of insulin and insulin B-chain by hPreP was investigated. hPreP degraded completely the insulin B-chain but was not capable of degrading insulin (Fig. 1C). Investigation of the effect of different types of protease inhibitors on the degradation of Aβ-(1-40) by the recombinant hPreP showed that neither PMSF nor bestatin (i.e. serine or aminopeptidase type protease inhibitors) affected proteolysis (Fig. 1D), whereas NEM, a cysteine-type protease inhibitor, showed a small inhibitory effect of 10%, and the metalloprotease inhibitor oPh completely inhibited degradation of Aβ, demonstrating that hPreP is a thiol-sensitive metalloprotease. This is in agreement with studies on hMP1, which showed that hMP1 was efficiently inhibited by oPh and p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid (22Mzhavia N. Berman Y.L. Qian Y. Yan L. Devi L.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Apyrase had no effect on the proteolytic activity showing that Aβ degradation is independent of ATP. hPreP contains an inverted zinc-binding motif, H75ILE78H79. The importance of the metal-binding motif for the proteolytic activity has been demonstrated by studying the recombinant hPreP mutant, hPreP(E78Q), in which the catalytic base Glu78 was changed to Gln (Fig. 1E). We have overexpressed and purified the mutant and showed that hPreP(E78Q) could not degrade (only 10% was degraded) the Aβ-(1-40) protein (Fig. 1F) confirming the importance of the inverted zinc-binding site for the proteolytic activity. The degradation pattern of Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ Arctic was studied using liquid chromatography nanospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Fig. 2). The base peak chromatogram shown in Fig. 2B also shows a schematic representation of the cleavage sites by hPreP (filled arrows) on Aβ-(1-40) and Aβ Arctic Fig. 2, A and C). The overall degradation resulted in the production of several 4-14 amino acid fragments that are unique for hPreP. Degradation of Aβ-(1-40) resulted in the cleavage after Gln15, Lys16, Phe19, Phe20, Ala30, Gly33, and Leu34 (Fig. 2A). The major cleavage product is the short very hydrophobic peptide, Leu17-Val18-Phe19-Phe20. hPreP degraded Aβ Arctic at cleavage sites that generally overlapped with those found for wild type Aβ. However, two new cleavage sites appeared, after Gly29 and Gly38 (gray arrows). Mitochondrial Localization of hPreP and Its Function—The bioinformatic programs created to predict intracellular localization of proteins, Mitoprot, Predotar, and TargetP localize hPreP to mitochondria with a high score (0.9888 for MitoProt and 0.877 for TargetP). However, the predicted presequence of hPreP is much shorter (29 amino acids) than for the plant homologue AtPreP (85 amino acids). The yeast homologue of PreP, MOP112, is not predicted to be a mitochondrial protein but was shown to be located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (29Kambacheld M. Augustin S. Tatsuta T. Muller S. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20132-20139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To confirm the localization of hPreP to mitochondria, we isolated human brain mitochondria and the cytosolic fraction and tested immunological cross-reactivity with antibodies against hPreP and the F1 moiety of the ATP synthase. Western blot analysis verified mitochondrial localization of hPreP (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, hPreP was shown to be located in the soluble fraction of human brain mitochondria, no cross-reactivity was found in the membrane fraction probed with anti-Tim17 antibodies (Fig. 3B). The soluble fraction of human brain mitochondria showed proteolytic activity against Aβ that was almost completely inhibited by oPh and partially (20%) by NEM but not by PMSF or apyrase (Fig. 3C). To investigate intramitochondrial localization of PreP we have used rat liver mitochondria due to a limited amount of human material. Rat PreP shows 85% sequence identity (93% similarity) to hPreP and is predicted to be a mitochondrial protein with a 28-amino acid-long presequence. Consistent with human and rat PreP, the predicted presequences of PreP from mouse, dog, and orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) are estimated to be 29 amino acid residues in length. We have prepared highly purified rat liver mitochondria free from microsomal contamination and we have osmotically ruptured the outer mitochondrial membrane to obtain mitoplasts. Mitochondria were fractionated into OM, IM, IMS, and Ma. We"

Nef binds several members of the Src kinase family, and these interactions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS. However, the direct effect of Nef interaction on Src family kinase (SFK) regulation and activity has not been systematically addressed. We explored this issue using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well defined model system for the study of SFK regulation. Previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of c-Src arrests yeast cell growth in a kinase-dependent manner. We expressed Fgr, Fyn, Hck, Lck, Lyn, and Yes as well as c-Src in yeast and found that each kinase was active and induced growth suppression. Co-expression of the negative regulatory kinase Csk suppressed SFK activity and reversed the growth-inhibitory effect. We then co-expressed each SFK with HIV-1 Nef in the presence of Csk. Nef strongly activated Hck, Lyn, and c-Src but did not detectably affect Fgr, Fyn, Lck, or Yes. Mutagenesis of the Nef PXXP motif essential for SH3 domain binding greatly reduced the effect of Nef on Hck, Lyn, and c-Src, suggesting that Nef activates these Src family members through allosteric displacement of intramolecular SH3-linker interactions. These data show that Nef selectively activates Hck, Lyn, and c-Src among SFKs, identifying these kinases as proximal effectors of Nef signaling and potential targets for anti-HIV drug discovery.

Nef has no known catalytic function and is believed to promote viral pathogenicity by altering signaling pathways in infected cells through its interactions with cellular proteins. Nef affects several distinct classes of host cell proteins, including immune receptors, protein kinases, trafficking proteins, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (13Arold S.T. Bauer A.S.

Through interactions with these and other signaling proteins, Nef can affect multiple cellular processes leading to enhancement of viral replication, immune evasion, and enhanced survival in T-cells and macrophages (1Fackler O.T.

Protein kinases are a major class of Nef effector proteins, and members of the Src family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases have been strongly linked to Nef function.

Among these, the interaction of Nef with Hck has been studied in great detail at the cellular and molecular levels. Hck is strongly expressed in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (26Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J. Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2003; 74: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography demonstrates that Nef interacts with the Hck SH3 domain via a bipartite mechanism dependent upon the three-dimensional fold of Nef (31Lee C.H. Saksela K. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 85: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). These contacts include a highly conserved Nef PXXPXR motif, which forms the polyproline type II helix typical of SH3 ligands. In addition, Ile-96 within the RT-loop of the Hck SH3 domain fits into a pocket within the Nef core that is lined with several highly conserved hydrophobic residues. Both of these interactions are necessary, but not independently sufficient, for high affinity binding of Nef to the Hck SH3 domain (22Choi H.J. Smithgall T.E. J. Mol.

Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). When Hck is down-regulated, its SH3 domain associates with the polyproline type II helix formed by the linker connecting the SH2 and kinase domains (36Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J.

Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This interaction is stabilized by the interaction of the SH2 domain with the C-terminal tail, which is phosphorylated on a conserved tyrosine residue by the negative regulatory kinases Csk and Chk (38Chong Y.P.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nef-induced Hck activation does not require tail dephosphorylation or displacement from the SH2 domain, suggesting that Nef may induce a novel signaling conformation of Hck (42Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 365-369PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functional consequences of the Nef-Hck pathway are still under investigation, mounting evidence suggests a key role for this interaction in AIDS progression. In monocyte-derived macrophages, Komuro et al. (35Komuro I. Yokota Y. Yasuda S. Iwamoto A. Kagawa K.S. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) established a strong positive correlation of high titer replication of macrophage-tropic HIV-1 with Hck expression. In addition, they showed that HIV replication is blocked following suppression of Hck with antisense oligonucleotides. At the whole animal level, targeted expression of Nef to the T-cell and macrophage compartments in transgenic mice induces an AIDS-like phenotype, characterized by CD4+ T-cell depletion, diarrhea, wasting, and uniform mortality (43Hanna Z.

In contrast, mice expressing a mutant form of Nef lacking the PXXPXR motif essential for SH3 binding show no evidence of the AIDS-like phenotype (44Hanna Z. Weng X. Kay D.G. Poudrier J. Lowell C. Jolicoeur P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9378-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when transgenic mice expressing wild-type Nef were crossed into a hck-null background, appearance of the AIDS-like phenotype was delayed with a significant proportion of the mice living normal lifespans (44Hanna Z. Weng X. Kay D.G. Poudrier J. Lowell C. Jolicoeur P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9378-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The observation that the Nef-induced AIDS-like syndrome is reduced but not eliminated in the absence of Hck suggests that other SFKs may contribute to Nef signaling in this system. Less is known about the functional interaction of Nef with other Src family members. Lyn is the only Src family member other than Hck with an Ile residue in the SH3 domain RT-loop. Although the Lyn SH3 domain appears to bind as tightly to Nef as the Hck SH3 domain in vitro (19Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 22Choi H.J. Smithgall T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1255-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the effect of Nef on Lyn kinase activity has not been reported. Several reports suggest that HIV-1 Nef binds to Lck and down-regulates its kinase activity (21Greenway A.L. Dutartre H. Allen K. McPhee D.A. Olive D. Collette Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6152-6158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Greenway A. Azad A. McPhee D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Collette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A. Ramos M. Benarous R. Harris M. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6333-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, other work failed to detect a direct interaction of Nef with Lck or provide evidence for an effect on kinase activity in vivo (47Baur A.S. Sass G. Laffert B. Willbold D. ChengMayer C. Peterlin B.M. Immunity. 1997; 6: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 48Briggs S.D. Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Conflicting reports exist regarding the interaction of Nef with Fyn and its SH3 domain (19Saksela K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 22Choi H.J. Smithgall T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1255-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 48Briggs S.D.

Virology. 1999; 264: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas the direct effect of Nef on Fyn kinase activity is unknown. Nef also interacts with both full-length c-Src and its SH3 domain (22Choi H.J. Smithgall T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1255-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although the direct effect of Nef on c-Src activity is not clear (48Briggs S.D. Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 52He J.C. Husain M. Sunamoto M. D'Agati V.D. Klotman M.E. Iyengar R. Klotman P.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Finally, while Fgr and Yes are present in HIV target cells, neither has been tested for interactions with Nef. One explanation for the conflicting literature regarding the impact of Nef on SFK activity relates to the use of diverse systems for analysis. In addition, Nef is likely to activate multiple kinases in HIV target cells, obscuring its direct effects on individual Src family members. Identification of those SFKs that are directly activated by Nef is the first step toward validation of these kinases as drug discovery targets. Here we address this important issue using a yeast-based expression system, originally developed for the study of c-Src regulation (53Brugge J.S. Jarosik G. Andersen J. Queral-Lustig A. Fedor-Chaiken M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2180-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 54Cooper J.A. Runge K. Oncogene Res. 1987; 1: 297-310PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kornbluth S. Jove R. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4455-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Yeast cells represent a useful model for the study of SFK regulation, because they do not express orthologs of c-Src or other mammalian protein-tyrosine kinases. In addition, ectopic expression of c-Src and other mammalian protein-tyrosine kinases has been shown to induce kinase-dependent growth arrest in yeast, providing a convenient end-point for structure-function analysis (56Murphy S.M. Bergman M. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 57Walkenhorst J. Goga A. Witte O.N. Superti-Furga G.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the case of c-Src, co-expression of the regulatory kinase Csk reverses the growth-inhibitory effect through phosphorylation of the negative regulatory tail, modeling the natural mechanism of down-regulation in mammalian cells (56Murphy S.M. Bergman M. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 60Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Draetta G.

In this report, we first show that regulation of Hck kinase activity by Nef can be faithfully reconstituted in yeast. When expressed alone, Hck was highly active and produced a strong growth-suppressive phenotype. Hck activity and growth suppression were reversed upon co-expression of the negative regulatory kinase, Csk. Introduction of Nef led to re-activation of Hck despite the presence of Csk, closely modeling previous reports in mammalian cells types (16Briggs S.D. Scholtz B. Jacque J.-M. Swingler S. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25605-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We then extended the study to include all other SFKs expressed in HIV target cells: Fgr, Fyn, Lck, Lyn, c-Src, and Yes. Like Hck, all of these kinases suppressed yeast cell growth when active, and this phenotype was reversed upon co-expression with Csk. Introduction of Nef led to clear activation of Lyn and c-Src in addition to Hck. In all three cases, activation involved the PXXPXR motif of Nef, suggesting a common SH3-linker displacement mechanism previously described for Hck. In contrast, Nef did not affect Lck or Fyn activity, despite previous reports of Nef binding to these kinases (20Arold S. Franken P. Strub M.P. Hoh F. Benichou S. Benarous R. Dumas C.

Nef also failed to affect Yes or Fgr activity. These data provide the first complete analysis of direct HIV-1 Nef-SFK interaction in living cells and identify the complexes of Nef with Hck, Lyn, and c-Src as unique targets for anti-HIV drug discovery. Yeast Expression Vectors—Coding sequences for human Csk, c-Src, Fyn, Hck, Lck, and Lyn as well as murine Fgr and Yes were amplified by PCR from existing templates to introduce a yeast translation initiation sequence (AATA) immediately 5′ to the ATG start codon. The cDNA clones for HIV-1 Nef (SF2 strain) and the herpesvirus saimiri Tip protein (amino acids 1–187) were similarly amplified and modified. A FLAG epitope tag was added to the N terminus of the Tip coding sequence. All SFK cDNA clones were subcloned downstream of either the Gal1 or Gal10 promoter in the yeast expression vector pESC-Ura (Stratagene). Hck was also subcloned downstream of the Gal10 promoter in the pYC2/CT vector (Invitrogen), which carries the CEN6/ARSH4 sequence for low copy replication. The Csk, Nef, and Tip cDNAs were subcloned downstream of either the Gal 1 or Gal10 promoter in pESC-Trp (Stratagene). cDNA clones for kinase-defective Hck (Hck-K269D), tail-activated Hck (Hck-Y501F), and kinase-defective Csk (Csk-K222D) were created via site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). The Nef-2PA mutant, in which prolines 72 and 75 are replaced with alanines, has been described elsewhere (32Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Yeast Growth Suppression Assay—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH 499 (Stratagene) was co-transformed with pESC-Ura (or pYC2/CT) and pESC-Trp plasmids containing the genes of interest via electroporation (Bio-Rad GenePulser II). Yeast cells were selected for 3 days at 30 °C on standard synthetic drop-out plates lacking uracil and tryptophan (SD/-U-T) with glucose as the sole carbon source to repress protein expression. Positive transformants were grown in liquid SD/-U-T medium plus glucose, normalized to A600 = 0.2 in water, and then spotted in 4-fold dilutions onto SD/-U-T agar plates containing galactose as the sole carbon source to induce protein expression. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C and imaged on a flatbed scanner. Yeast patches appear as dark spots against the translucent agar background. All growth suppression assays were repeated at least three times starting with randomly selected independent transformed clones and produced comparable results; representative examples are shown. Immunoblotting—Aliquots of the yeast cultures used for the spot assay were grown in SD/-U-T medium plus galactose for 18 h. Cells were pelleted, treated with 0.1 n NaOH for 5 min at room temperature (62Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), and normalized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer to 0.02 A600 units per microliter. Aliquots of each lysate (0.2 A600 unit) were separated via SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for protein phosphotyrosine content with a combination of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and PY20 (BD Transduction Laboratories). Protein expression was verified by immunoblotting with antibodies to Csk (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Fgr (C1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), FLAG (M2, Sigma), Fyn (FYN3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Hck (N-30, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Lck (2102, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Lyn (44, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Src (N-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Yes (3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nef antibodies (monoclonal EH1 and Hyb 6.2) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Expression and Purification of Recombinant SFKs and Nef—Human Hck, Lyn, and c-Src clones were modified on their C-terminal tails to encode the sequence Tyr-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro. This modification promotes autophosphorylation of the tail and permits high yield purification of the down-regulated form of each kinase without the need for co-expression of Csk (37Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The N-terminal unique domain of each kinase was replaced with a hexahistidine tag, and each construct was used to produce a recombinant baculovirus in Sf9 insect cells using BaculoGold DNA and the manufacturer's protocol (BD Pharmingen). Recombinant SFKs were purified from 1 liter of infected Sf9 cell culture using a combination of ion-exchange and affinity chromatography as originally described by Schindler et al. for Hck (37Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The purity and concentration of each kinase preparation were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. The SF2 allele of HIV-1 Nef was similarly expressed and purified with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Tyrosine kinase assays were performed in 384-well plates using the FRET-based Z'-lyte kinase assay system and the Tyr2 peptide substrate (Invitrogen). Reactions (10 μl) were conducted in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij-35). Assay conditions were first optimized to determine the amount of each kinase and the incubation time necessary to phosphorylate 20–30% of the Tyr2 peptide in the absence of Nef. To assess the effect of Nef on SFK activity, Hck (20 ng), Lyn (50 ng), and Src (50 ng) were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with a 5- or 10-fold molar excess of Nef. ATP (50 μm final) and Tyr2 substrate (2 μm final) were then added to the reaction followed by a 1-h incubation (45 min for Hck). Development reagent, containing a protease that digests non-phosphorylated peptide, was then added to the reaction for an additional 60 min at room temperature, at which time the reaction was terminated with the proprietary stop reagent. Fluorescence was assessed at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm; coumarin fluorescence and the fluorescein FRET signal were monitored at 445 and 520 nm, respectively. The coumarin emission excites fluorescein by FRET in the phosphorylated (uncleaved) substrate peptide only. Reactions containing unphosphorylated peptide and kinase in the absence of ATP served as 0% phosphorylation control, whereas a stoichiometrically phosphorylated peptide was used as a 100% phosphorylation control. Raw fluorescence values were corrected"

Skin is the largest human organ, and only organ directly exposed to the environment. Acute exposure to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation from the sun is harmful to skin, causing sunburn, immune suppression, DNA damage, and connective tissue degradation (1Ichihashi M. Ueda M. Budiyanto A. Bito T. Oka M. Fukunaga M. Tsuru K. Horikawa T. Toxicology. 2003; 189: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Accumulated damage, resulting from chronic sun exposure, causes skin cancer and premature skin aging (photoaging) (2Berneburg M. Plettenberg H. Krutmann J. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 2000; 16: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Approximately one million individuals in the United States develop skin cancer each year, and essentially all people experience photoaging to some degree, depending on the amount of sun exposure and skin pigmentation (pigmentation is protective) (3Halder R.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 2The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RPTP-κ, receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase-κ; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. is a ubiquitously expressed, cell surface, transmembrane receptor that possesses intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Functional activation of EGFR results from increased phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation is catalyzed by intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Phosphotyrosine residues function as binding sites for assembly of protein complexes, which initiate downstream signaling pathways that regulate cellular function (4Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). EGFR is highly expressed in human skin cells (keratinocytes) in vivo and in vitro (5Fisher G. Kang S.

This EGFR activation is necessary for induction of signaling pathways (termed the mammalian UV response), including mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, and phospholipase C/protein kinase C (16Wang H.

In addition, EGFR activation protects against UV-induced apoptosis, through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway (16Wang H. Quan T. He T. Franke T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J.

Biological effects of UV irradiation occur as a consequence of absorption of electromagnetic energy by certain molecules within all cells. The excess energy is dissipated either by chemical modification of the absorbing molecule, or transfer of energy to an acceptor molecule. Molecular oxygen, which is in high concentrations in eukaryotic cells, can readily accept energy from UV-absorbing molecules (25Foote C. Autor A. Pathology of Oxygen.

Whereas at high concentrations ROS can be cytotoxic, at low concentrations ROS appear to serve a physiological function as mediators of cellular response (35Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. Biochem.

Recent studies have shown that activation of cell surface growth factors and cytokine receptors by UV results in the formation of ROS, which play a critical role in mediating downstream signaling pathways in cultured cells (37Bonizzi G.

All members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family contain an active site cysteine residue, which is required for phosphohydrolase activity. This active site cysteine is highly susceptible to oxidation, particularly by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (40Denu J. Tanner K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The pKa of the cysteine within the active site is relatively low (5.5) at physiological pH, which promotes formation of the reactive thiolate form. The thiolate reacts readily with H2O2 to form a stable sulfenic acid (40Denu J. Tanner K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), or sulfenyl-amide species (41van Montfort R. Congreve M. Tisi D. Carr R. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 423: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), which renders the phosphatase catalytically inactive. Recent evidence indicates that reversible oxidative inactivation of PTP activities occurs as a consequence of ROS generated in response to growth factor and cytokine receptor activation, and regulates tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction pathways (18Bae Y.

Oxidative inhibition of PTP activity by ROS has been proposed as a mechanism for activation of EGFR by UV irradiation (45Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Critical testing of this proposed mechanism has been hindered by lack of knowledge regarding phosphatases that directly regulate EGFR at the cell surface. We have recently identified receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase κ (RPTP-κ) as a regulator of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, in human keratinocytes (6Xu Y. Tan L. Grachtchouk V. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42694-42700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RPTP-κ directly dephosphorylates EGFR in vitro, and functions in cells to maintain low levels of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of exogenous ligand. RPTP-κ counteracts EGFR intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity by preferentially dephosphorylating EGFR tyrosine residues 1068 and 1173 (6Xu Y. Tan L. Grachtchouk V. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42694-42700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We report here that activation of EGFR by UV irradiation is mediated by oxidative inhibition of RPTP-κ activity. Materials—Adult human primary keratinocytes were purchased from Cascade Biologics Inc. (Portland, OR). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were obtained from ATCC. EGFR and phospho-EGFR (pY1068) antibodies used for Western analysis were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), respectively. EGFR antibody for immunofluorescence was from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Neutralizing EGFR antibody LA1, which blocks ligand binding, was obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies (Waltham, MA). RPTP-κ antibody was generated and affinity purified from rabbits immunized with a peptide derived from the intracellular domain of human RPTP-κ, as described (6Xu Y. Tan L. Grachtchouk V. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42694-42700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine peptide derived from EGFR (Biotin-KGSTAENAE(pY)LRV-amide) was synthesized by New England Peptide, Inc. (Gardner, MA). PD169540 is a generous gift from Dr. David Fry (Pfizer Inc.). Oligonucleotide probes used for in situ hybridization were synthesized by GeneDetect (Bradenton, FL). Purified, full-length active human EGFR was obtained from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The intracellular region of RPTP-κ was cloned into pGEX-6-P, and expressed as a His-tagged glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in BL21. Expressed RPTP-κ was purified by nickel chelate and glutathione affinity chromatography to a purity of greater than 90%, as judged by SDS-PAGE. Cell Culture—Subcultures of adult human primary keratinocytes were expanded in modified MCDB153 media (EpiLife, Cascade Biologics, Inc.) at 37 °C under 5% CO2. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium with 1.5 g/ml sodium bicarbonate, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. UV Source and Irradiation—Subconfluent cells in a thin layer of Tris-buffered saline were irradiated using a Daavlin lamp apparatus containing six FS24T12 UVB-HO bulbs. A Kodacel TA401/407 filter was used to eliminate wavelengths below 290 nm (UVC) resulting in a UV spectrum consisting of 48% UVB, 31% UVAII, and 21% UVA1. The irradiation intensity was monitored with an IL1400A phototherapy radiometer and a SED240/UVB/W photodetector (International Light, Newbury, MA). Human subjects were phototested to determine the dose of UV irradiation that caused the skin to become slightly pink (minimal erythema dose). Subjects were exposed to twice this dose for studies. All procedures involving human subjects were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent. Transient Transfection of CHO Cells—Mammalian expression vectors harboring EGFR (pRK5 EGF) or RPTP-κ (pShuttle RPTP-κ) coding sequences were transiently transfected by the Lipofectamine 2000 method into CHO cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen Corp.). siRNA Silencing of Endogenous RPTP-κ in Primary Human Keratinocytes—A 21-mer RNA sequence (5′-AAGGTTTGCCGCTTCCTTCAG-3′) derived from the RPTP-κ coding sequence was designed using Oligoengine's software (Seattle, WA). Homology search was performed on this RNA sequence using BLAST to ensure it was not presented in any other known sequence in the data base. Double-stranded siRNA was synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon Inc. (Valencia, CA). The synthetic siRNA was transfected into primary human keratinocytes using the Human Keratinocytes Nucleofector kit and device from Amaxa Biosystems (Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RPTP-κ Immunoprecipitation, Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Assay, and EGFR Tyrosine Phosphorylation ELISA—Keratinocytes whole cell lysates were made in TGH buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100), supplemented with 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and were pre-cleared with normal rabbit IgG before incubation with RPTP-κ antibody for 3 h at 4°C. For some assays, as indicated in the text, 10 mm iodoacetic acid was added to TGH buffer to irreversibly inhibit non-oxidized protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity (18Bae Y. Kang S. Seo M. Baines I. Tekle E. Chock P. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Protein A-conjugated agarose beads were then added, and further incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by extensive washing. Washed immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot, or assayed for protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. For some assays, as indicated in the text, 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to the assay buffer to reduce oxidized RPTP-κ (18Bae Y. Kang S. Seo M. Baines I. Tekle E. Chock P. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). For measurement of protein phosphatase activity, tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from EGFR was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm in 50 μl of PTP assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were terminated by addition of 100 μl of BIOMOL Green Reagent (BIOMOL, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and absorbance was measured at 620 nm. Human total EGFR and tyrosine 1068 phospho-EGFR were quantified by ELISA (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). Western Blot Analysis of UV Irradiation-induced Oxidation of RPTP-κ in Human Primary Keratinocytes—Human primary keratinocytes were mock irradiated or UV irradiated (90 mJ/cm2). Five minutes post-UV irradiation, cells were lysed in the presence of 100 mm iodoacetic acid, and RPTP-κ was immunoprecipitated as described above. The immunoprecipitate was reduced by addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol in TGH buffer, containing protease inhibitors, for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed three times, and then irreversibly oxidized by incubation with 2 mm pervanadate at 4 °C for 1 h. Oxidized RPTP-κ was analyzed by Western blot probed with OXPTP antibody (a gift from Dr. Arne Ostman, Cancer Center Karolinska, Stockholm, Sweden) as described (47Persson C. Kappert K. Engstrom U. Östman A. Sjoblom T. Methods. 2005; 35: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Western Analysis Detection and Quantitation—Western blots were developed and quantified using a chemifluorescent substrate (ECF Western blot Reagents, Amersham Biosciences). Detection of chemifluorescence was performed using a STORM PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Sample loads, antibody concentration, and incubator times were adjusted to yield fluorescent signals within the linear range of detection. Fluorescent intensity of protein bands were quantified by ImageQuant software, which is an integral application of the STORM. Detection of UV Irradiation-induced DNA Fragmentation in Human Primary Keratinocytes—Human primary keratinocytes were infected with either empty or RPTP-κ adenovirus. Cells were mock or UV irradiated 2 days post-infection. Six hours post-UV irradiation, cells were lysed, and DNA fragmentation was measured by Cell Death Detection ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). In Situ Hybridization—Hybridization buffer (4× SSC, 20% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.25 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.1 m DTT, 0.5× Denhardt's solution) with three fluorescein-conjugated sense or antisense DNA oligonucleotide probes, corresponding to nucleotides 1549-1596, 3440-3487, and 4290-4337 in the human RPTP-κ mRNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_002844), were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Sections were washed in 2× phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20, then 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% Tween 20. Washed slides were incubated with protein block (Biogenex, San Ramon, CA), biotin-labeled antifluorescence antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin. Hybridized probes were visualized by addition of AEC as substrate. Immunohistology and Immunofluorescence—Human full thickness skin samples were embedded in OCT and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (7 μm) were cut with a cryostat (LEICA CM3050). Sections were air dried for 10 min, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and washed for 20 min. Slides were loaded on an automated immunostainer (Biogenex i6000). For immunoperoxidase staining, slides were incubated with peroxide block (10 min), protein block (20 min), rabbit affinity purified anti-RPTP-κ (30 min), Multilink-biotin conjugate (10 min), streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (10 min), AEC substrate (3 min), and hemotoxylin (20 s). For double immunofluorescence, peroxide block was omitted, and following incubation with RPTP-κ antibody, biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) were each added for 10 min. Slides were washed with distilled water, EGFR antibody (Ab-10) was added overnight at 4 °C, and anti-mouse IgG1-conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) was added for 10 min. Stained slides were washed with distilled water, and covered with Supermount. For negative control, staining was performed using RPTP-κ antibody plus peptide used to raise the antibody, or preimmune serum, instead of primary antibody. Staining was observed under a Zeiss microscope (Axioskop 2) and images were obtained with digital camera (SPOT2, Diagnostic Inc. Sterling Heights, MI). All reagents, except as noted, were from Biogenex. To investigate the role of RPTP-κ in UV irradiation regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, we initially examined the effects of ROS on purified RPTP-κ activity and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro. Addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused dose-dependent inhibition of RPTP-κ activity, with 80% loss of activity observed at 100 μm (Fig. 1A). In the presence of ATP/Mg2+, purified EGFR was phosphorylated by its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast to RPTP-κ, H2O2 had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of purified EGFR, in vitro (Fig. 1B). Incubation of purified RPTP-κ and EGFR together resulted in a low level of steady state EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, representing the balance between the rates of tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase activities. In the presence of H2O2, which inhibits RPTP-κ, EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation increased to the level observed in the absence of RPTP-κ (Fig. 1C). These data provide proof of concept for RPTP-κ-dependent regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation by ROS, in a cell-free system. To further investigate UV irradiation regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation by RPTP-κ, we used a model mammalian cell system. CHO cells do not express either EGFR or RPTP-κ. We have previously used this system to screen PTPs for EGFR phosphatase activity (6Xu Y. Tan L. Grachtchouk V. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42694-42700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of CHO cells with EGFR expression vector resulted in high level of constitutive (i.e. in the absence of ligand) EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2). This constitutive EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation was abolished by specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD169540, indicating tyrosine phosphorylation was due to intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (data not shown. Exposure of EGFR-expressing CHO cells to UV irradiation did not further increase EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. However, co-expression of EGFR with RPTP-κ substantially reduced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2). UV irradiation of CHO cells expressing both EGFR and RPTP-κ increased the level of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation to the level observed in the absence of RPTP-κ (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that RPTP-κ is required for UV irradiation induction of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, in the CHO cell model system. We next investigated the role of RPTP-κ in UV irradiation regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in human keratinocytes. In addition to expressing both EGFR and RPTP-κ, keratinocytes express several EGFR ligands, including transforming growth factor-α, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, betacellulin, and epiregulin. To examine potential involvement of ligand binding in UV irradiation induction of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, we used a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which blocks ligand binding to EGFR. Whereas this antibody reduced EGF-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation to near basal levels, it had no significant effect on UV irradiation induction of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). We conclude that ligand binding has little, if any, role in activation of EGFR by UV irradiation. This conclusion is consistent with data demonstrating that the EGFR ligand-binding domain is not required for UV irradiation induction of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in NIH 3T3 cells (45Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). We next examined whether UV irradiation altered RPTP-κ expression in human keratinocytes. We found no change of RPTP-κ protein levels following UV irradiation (Fig. 3B). We next examined the effect of UV irradiation on RPTP-κ activity in human keratinocytes. For these studies, keratinocytes were mock-exposed or exposed to UV irradiation (50 mJ/cm2), and harvested in lysis buffer 5 min post-UV irradiation. RPTP-κ was immunoprecipitated, and its activity measured by dephosphorylation of a phosphotyrosine-containing synthetic peptide substrate, derived from the amino acid sequence of the EGFR (amino acids 1164-1176). UV irradiation reduced RPTP-κ activity in human keratinocytes more than 60%, compared with mock-irradiated cells (Fig. 3C). It has recently been reported that UV irradiation can reduce protein levels of PTP 1B and LAR, in certain cell types, through activation of proteolytic cleavage (46Gulati P. Markova B. Gottlicher M. Bohmer F.-D. Herrlich P. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, no reduction of the RPTP-κ protein level in human keratinocytes was observed within 90 min following UV irradiation (data not shown). The data above indicate that UV irradiation inhibits RPTP-κ activity, in human keratinocytes. To determine whether inhibition results from oxidation, iodoacetic acid was included in the lysis buffer that was used to harvest cells following mock or UV irradiation. Iodoacetate forms a stable adduct with non-oxidized, but not with oxidized, cysteine thiols. Therefore non-oxidized RPTP-κ is irreversibly inhibited by iodoacetate, whereas oxidized RPTP-κ is not (18Bae Y. Kang S. Seo M. Baines I. Tekle E. Chock P. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The activity of oxidized, but not acetylated, RPTP-κ can be restored by reduction with DTT (18Bae Y. Kang S. Seo M. Baines I. Tekle E. Chock P. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates from mock-irradiated keratinocytes, prepared in the presence of iodoacetate, and treated with DTT, contained four times less RPTP-κ activity, compared with immunoprecipitates from UV-irradiated cells (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that UV irradiation caused oxidation of RPTP-κ, which protected it against acetylation, in human keratinocytes. To confirm that UV irradiation leads to oxidation of RPTP-κ in human keratinocytes, we utilized an antibody that specifically recognizes the oxidized active site of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (47Persson C. Kappert K. Engstrom U. Östman A. Sjoblom T. Methods. 2005; 35: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). RPTP-κ was immunoprecipitated from keratinocytes following mock exposure or exposure to UV irradiation. Immunoprecipitated RPTP-κ was analyzed for active site oxidation by Western analysis. The level of oxidized RPTP-κ was increased 3-fold in UV-irradiated, compared with non-irradiated keratinocytes (Fig. 3E). We observed that expression of exogenous RPTP-κ conferred UV irradiation induction of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, in CHO cells (Fig. 2). Keratinocytes, however, express endogenous RPTP-κ. Therefore, we utilized siRNA-mediated knockdown to examine the role of RPTP-κ in UV irradiation regulation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Transient transfection of RPTP-κ siRNA caused 80 and 70% reduction of RPTP-κ mRNA and protein (Fig. 4A), respectively (6Xu Y. Tan L. Grachtchouk V. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42694-42700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Knockdown of RPTP-κ had no effect on gene expression levels of other related RPTPs expressed in keratinocytes (RPTP-μ,-β, -δ, or-ζ) (6Xu Y. Tan L. Grachtchouk V. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42694-42700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). UV irradiation induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation nearly 5-fold in keratinocytes transfected with scrambled control siRNA (Fig. 4B), similar to that observed in nontransfected keratinocytes (Fig. 3). Knockdown of RPTP-κ increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in non-irradiated keratinocytes nearly 4-fold. Exposure to UV irradiation further increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation only 20% (Fig. 4B). Addition of EGFR antibody that blocks ligand binding had no effect on increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation induced by RPTP-κ knockdown (Fig. 4C). These data indicate that normal levels of RPTP-κ function to maintain low basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. In the presence of reduced levels of RPTP-κ, basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation is increased, and therefore can only be marginally further increased by UV irradiation. In the presence of normal levels of RPTP-κ, basal EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation is low, and oxidative inhibition of RPTP-κ by UV irradiation alters the EGFR tyrosine kinase/phosphatase balance to elevate EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. UV irradiation can damage skin cells, and with sufficient damage, induce apoptosis (48Kulms D. Schwarz T. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 2000; 16: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In human keratinocytes, EGFR protects against UV-induced apoptosis, primarily through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/ATK pathway (16Wang H. Quan T. He T. Franke T. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45737-45745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether overexpression of RPTP-κ could modulate UV irradiation-induced DNA fragmentation, a marker of apoptosis, in human keratinocytes. At a dose of 50 mJ/cm2, UV irradiation did not cause significant DNA fragmentation, compared with mock irradiation, in keratinocytes infected with control vector (Fig. 5). In contrast, this dose of UV irradiation causes a significant increase of DNA fragmentation of keratinocytes overexpressing RPTP-κ (Fig. 5). Higher doses of UV irradiation (70-90 mJ/cm2) caused increased DNA fragmentation in both control and RPTP-κ overexpressing cells. However, increased expression of RPTP-κ caused increased levels of DNA fragmentation, at all doses of UV irradiation. Finally, we examined RPTP-κ expression and regulation by UV irradiation in human skin in vivo. Epidermis primarily consists of stratified layers of keratinocytes. The lowest layer of keratinocytes (basal keratinocytes) undergoes cell division. Daughter cells (suprabasal keratinocytes) migrate upward toward the surface, and, as they migrate, undergo a coordinated, complex program of maturation. Suprabasal keratinocytes normally do not proliferate. RPTP-κ mRNA was expressed predominantly in suprabasal keratinocytes (Fig. 6A). A similar pattern of expression was observed for RPTP-κ protein (Fig. 6B). In contrast, EGFR protein, the substrate for RPTP-κ, was expressed throughout the epidermis, in both basal and suprasbasal keratinocytes (Fig. 6C). ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase is a major EGFR effector in many cells, including human keratinocytes. UV irradiation activates ERK1/2 in human keratinocytes in skin in vivo, and this activation is dependent on EGFR (49Kang S. Chung J. Lee J. Fisher G. Wan Y. Duell E. Voorhees J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 835-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the localization of activated ERK closely coincides with that of RPTP-κ in UV-irradiated human skin (5Fisher G. Kang S. Varani J. Bata-Csorgo Z. Wan Y. Datta S. Voorhees J. Arch. Dermatol. 2002; 138: 1462-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with inhibition of RPTP-κ leading to EGFR-dependent ERK activation of suprabasal keratinocytes in human skin in vivo. In addition, EGFR is a major mitogenic pathway in basal keratinocytes. Therefore, predominant expression of RPTP-κ in non-proliferating suprabasal keratinocytes is consistent with its role in limiting EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Our observation that overexpression of RPTP-κ in cultured basal keratinocytes completely inhibits proliferation provides support for this notion (6Xu Y. Tan L. Grachtchouk V. Voorhees J. Fisher G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42694-42700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that exposure of human skin in vivo to UV irradiation increases EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (42Fisher G. Talwar H. Lin P. McPhillips F. Wang Z. Li X. Wan Y. Kang S. Voorhees J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Increased tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal (5-fold) 30 min after exposure. To determine the effect of UV irradiation on RPTP-κ, sun-protected buttock skin of adult subjects was exposed to UV irradiation, and skin samples were obtained 30 min post-exposure. UV irradiation had no effect on RPTP-κ protein level (Fig. 6D), in human skin in vivo, as was also observed in cultured keratinocytes (Fig. 3B). In contrast, UV irradiation inhibited RPTP-κ activity more than 60% (Fig. 6E). These results are similar to those obtained in cultured keratinocytes, and provide support for RPTP-κ as a critical regulator of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, in UV-irradiated skin in vivo. Activation of signal transduction cascades and concomitant alterations in gene expression that occur in skin cells in response to exposure to UV irradiation are largely dependent on increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. In human skin, EGFR-dependent responses are critical elements in the pathophysiology of UV irradiation-induced cancer and aging. Currently, with the exception of sunscreens, there are no effective measures for prevention of these serious solar UV irradiation-induced skin conditions. Our data demonstrate that oxidative inhibition of RPTP-κ is a central mechanism by which UV irradiation activates EGFR in human skin. Anti-oxidants, as topical preparations or dietary supplements, have gained popular attention with claims for a multiplicity of health benefits. However, these claims have been difficult to substantiate. One reason for this difficulty is lack of specific molecular targets for assessment of antioxidant effect. Our findings identify RPTP-κ as a key molecular target for antioxidant action for prevention of the primary manifestations of solar UV-induced skin damage.

https://openalex.org/W2169670549,"Acting via the estrogen receptor (ER), estradiol exerts pleomorphic effects on the uterus, producing cyclical waves of cellular proliferation and differentiation in preparation for embryo implantation. In the classical pathway, the ER binds directly to an estrogen response element to activate or repress gene expression. However, emerging evidence supports the existence of nonclassical pathways in which the activated ER alters gene expression through protein-protein tethering with transcription factors such as c-Fos/c-Jun B (AP-1) and Sp1. In this report, we examined the relative roles of classical and nonclassical ER signaling in vivo by comparing the estrogen-dependent uterine response in mice that express wild-type ERα, a mutant ERα (E207A/G208A) that selectively lacks ERE binding, or ERα null. In the compound heterozygote (AA/-) female, the nonclassical allele (AA) was insufficient to mediate an acute uterotrophic response to 17β-estradiol (E2). The uterine epithelial proliferative response to E2 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen was retained in the AA/-females, and uterine luminal epithelial height increased commensurate with the extent of ERα signaling. This proliferative response was confirmed by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation. Microarray experiments identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A as a nonclassical pathwayresponsive gene, and transient expression experiments using the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A promoter confirmed transcriptional responses to the ERα (E207A/G208A) mutant. These results indicate that nonclassical ERα signaling is sufficient to restore luminal epithelial proliferation but not other estrogen-responsive events, such as fluid accumulation and hyperemia. We conclude that nonclassical pathway signaling via ERα plays a critical physiologic role in the uterine response to estrogen. Acting via the estrogen receptor (ER), estradiol exerts pleomorphic effects on the uterus, producing cyclical waves of cellular proliferation and differentiation in preparation for embryo implantation. In the classical pathway, the ER binds directly to an estrogen response element to activate or repress gene expression. However, emerging evidence supports the existence of nonclassical pathways in which the activated ER alters gene expression through protein-protein tethering with transcription factors such as c-Fos/c-Jun B (AP-1) and Sp1. In this report, we examined the relative roles of classical and nonclassical ER signaling in vivo by comparing the estrogen-dependent uterine response in mice that express wild-type ERα, a mutant ERα (E207A/G208A) that selectively lacks ERE binding, or ERα null. In the compound heterozygote (AA/-) female, the nonclassical allele (AA) was insufficient to mediate an acute uterotrophic response to 17β-estradiol (E2). The uterine epithelial proliferative response to E2 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen was retained in the AA/-females, and uterine luminal epithelial height increased commensurate with the extent of ERα signaling.

We conclude that nonclassical pathway signaling via ERα plays a critical physiologic role in the uterine response to estrogen. The uterus responds to cyclical changes in estrogen and progesterone levels in preparation for embryo implantation. Estrogen mediates the principal proliferative response of the uterus through two related but distinct estrogen receptors (ERα 2The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; E2, estradiol; 4HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; NERKI, nonclassical ER knock-in; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; LEH, luminal epithelial height; PR, progesterone receptor; ERKO, estrogen receptor knockout; ANOVA, analysis of variance.2The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen response element; E2, estradiol; 4HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; NERKI, nonclassical ER knock-in; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; LEH, luminal epithelial height; PR, progesterone receptor; ERKO, estrogen receptor knockout; ANOVA, analysis of variance. and ERβ) (1White R.

ERα is the predominant form in the murine uterus (4Couse J.F. Lindzey J. Grandien K. Gustafsson J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4613-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), but ERβ transcripts are also detected at very low levels (4Couse J.F. Lindzey J. Grandien K. Gustafsson J.A. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4613-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). After estrogens bind to the ligand domain of the ER, it undergoes conformational changes that allow interactions with coactivator molecules (5Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 6McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 7Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr.

O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that the ER can regulate genes that lack a canonical ERE, suggesting additional pathways for estrogen action (9Coleman K.M. Smith C.L.

For example, the ER may activate genes via protein-protein tethering with c-Fos/c-Jun B (AP-1) and Sp1 (12Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Scanlan T.S. Shiau A.K. Uht R.M. Webb P. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12940-12946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This alternate response mechanism has been referred to as the tethered or nonclassical pathway.We previously generated an ERα mutant that selectively functions via the nonclassical pathway. Substitution of two amino acids in the DNA recognition sequence of the first zinc finger eliminated ERα binding to EREs but preserved ligand binding, dimerization, and receptor interactions with other transcription factors (i.e. AP-1) and co-factors (i.e. SRC-1) (11Jakacka M.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13615-13621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These alanine mutations were “knocked in” to the murine germ line to generate the nonclassical ER knock-in (NERKI) mouse (11Jakacka M. Ito M. Martinson F. Ishikawa T. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2188-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Heterozygote NERKI females (AA/+) possessing one AA and one wild-type ERα allele are infertile and have grossly enlarged uteri with cystic hyperplasia (11Jakacka M. Ito M. Martinson F. Ishikawa T. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2188-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This phenotype was unexpected, given that one normal wild-type ERα allele remains and the uterus in heterozygote ERα null (+/-) mice is developmentally and physiologically normal (16Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast, the uteri of complete ERα null (-/-) mice demonstrate no mitogenic response to stimulation with estradiol or growth factors (i.e. epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1) (16Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 358-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This comparison suggests that nonclassical signaling participates in the uterine response to hormones through as yet unknown mechanisms. To gain further insight into the different uterine signaling pathways, we generated a mouse model with the exclusive expression of nonclassical ERα (AA/-) signaling by crossing heterozygote NERKI males (AA/+) with heterozygote ERα null females (+/-). The objective of this study was to use this in vivo model to evaluate the contribution of nonclassical ERα signaling, in the absence of ERE-mediated pathways, as a potential mediator of the uterine response to the ER ligands, estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Animals—All animal experiments were approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals. The generation of mutant mice containing the AA allele has previously been described (11Jakacka M. Ito M. Martinson F. Ishikawa T. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2188-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The mutant (NERKI) colony was maintained on a hybrid background of 129/SvJ and C57BL/6J strains by crossing heterozygote male NERKI mice (AA/+) and heterozygote female ERα null mice (+/-). The αERKO colony was maintained on pure C57BL/6J (17Lubahn D.B. Moyer J.S. Golding T.S. Couse J.F. Korach K.S. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11162-11166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). The AA allele was transmitted by heterozygote male NERKI mice, because the heterozygote NERKI females are infertile (11Jakacka M. Ito M. Martinson F. Ishikawa T. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2188-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Mice were maintained for 12 weeks before ovariectomy via a single ventral incision following an intraperitoneal injection of 50 μl/mouse of a mixture containing 25 mg/ml ketamine (80 mg/kg; Ketaset; American Home Product Corp., Madison, NJ), 1.27 mg/ml xylazine (10 mg/kg; Rompun; Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, PA), and 0.25 mg/ml acetopromazine (American Home Product Corp.). At least eight animals of each genotype were used per treatment. After allowing 2 weeks for recovery, mice were injected with sesame oil (100 μl; 6-, 24-, and 72-h groups), 17β-estradiol (E2; 100 ng/mouse; 6-, 24-, and 72-h groups), or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT; 50 μg/mouse; 72-h group) and sacrificed at 6 or 24 h after the last injection. The sesame oil vehicle and all hormones were obtained from Sigma. All treatments were prepared in sesame oil and injected (100 μl/mouse) subcutaneously. Two hours before sacrifice, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling reagent (Sigma) was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg/100 g of body weight dissolved in 100 μl of saline.To assess stromal cell proliferation, ovariectomized mice were primed by a subcutaneous injection of 100 ng of E2 in 100 μl of sesame oil for 2 days (18Tong W. Pollard J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Four days later, mice were injected subcutaneously with 1 mg of progesterone dissolved in 100 μl of sesame oil daily for 4 consecutive days. On the fourth day, 100 ng of E2 was injected subcutaneously following the last progesterone injection in a different location. The animals were sacrificed 18 h after the last injection.Serum Hormone Measurements—Serum estradiol and progesterone were measured by radioimmunoassay at the University of Virginia Ligand Assay and Core Laboratory. All measurements were performed in groups of at least 10 animals. The interassay coefficient of variation was <5% for estrogen and <6% for progesterone measurements.Uterine Morphometry—Intact 12-week-old females of each genotype were selected. Using vaginal cytology, the cycle stage was monitored to select wild-type animals in proestrus, when circulating estradiol levels are highest. The AA/- and ERα (-/-) females do not exhibit a regular cycle. Whole uteri from each genotype were fixed in 10% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde for 24 h, transferred to 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. Slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed using standard protocols. The uterine radius was measured from the serosal side to the apical surface of the luminal epithelium. The muscle layer consisted of the inner circular layer. The luminal epithelial height was measured from the basement membrane to the apical surface. All measurements were performed using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Thornwood, NY) equipped with an Optronics MicroFire digital camera (Goleta, CA) and Image-Pro Express version 4.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). The measurements were taken from three different areas (proximal, middle, and distal) per longitudinal section, and five measurements per area were analyzed.The number of positively stained BrdUrd cells in a random cross-section from the midportion of the uterus was counted. Approximately 500 epithelial cells were counted in four separate fields per section, and the average number of positive cells was calculated.Immunohistochemistry—For immunochemistry, sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in descending concentrations of ethanol followed by antigen retrieval in sodium citrate buffer (microwave 10 min at full power). Sections were blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 30 min and incubated with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The primary antibody was cyclin D2 (1:40; catalog number SC-593; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and secondary antibody was biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) for 30 min.BrdUrd fluorescence was performed after deparaffinization and rehydration. Antigen retrieval was completed with acid treatment (0.01 n HCl) at room temperature for 3 min, followed by pepsin (1 mg/ml in 0.01 n HCl at 37 °C for 1 h) and DNase treatment (100 units/ml DNase in reaction buffer at 37 °C for 1 h). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. Slides were incubated using rat anti-BrdUrd/fluorescein isothiocyanate (catalog number MCA2060FT; Serotec Ltd., Oxford, UK) diluted to 1:20 at 4 °C overnight. After additional washes, sections were incubated with 0.1% Sudan Black in 70% ethanol for 10 min to block autofluorescence, washed with tap water, and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.).Western Blot Analysis—Whole uterine protein extracts were prepared by homogenizing tissues in buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm EDTA, and 1mm EGTA. The protein concentration was determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Fifty micrograms of total uterine protein were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection was carried out using antibody AB-52 (1:1000; catalog number SC-810) to detect the progesterone receptor (PR) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. Proteins were visualized with an ECL Plus detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Reverse Transcription-PCR—Wild-type ERα (+/+), AA/-, and ERα null (-/-) mice were ovariectomized, allowed to recover for 10-14 days, and then treated with sesame oil control (Sigma) or E2 (1 μg/mouse; Sigma). Uteri were collected 2 h after treatment and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Three or four uteri from each treatment group were pooled, and RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy clean up protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized and analyzed by real time PCR using SYBR green dye as previously described (19Hewitt S.C. Collins J. Grissom S. Deroo B. Korach K.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Relative transcript levels were quantified in comparison with wild-type control and normalized to 18 S rRNA (20Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24897) Google Scholar). Primer sequences were selected using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and were purchased from Sigma. Primer sequences were as follows: 18 S (forward, 5′-GAAACTGCGAATGGCTCATTAA (positions 966-987); reverse, 5′-GAATCACCACAGTTATCCAAGTAGGA (positions 1046-1021)); cdkn1A (p21) (forward, 5′-CAGCGACCATGTCCAATCC (positions 193-211); reverse, 5′-CGAAGAGACAACGGCACACTT (positions 264-244)); and aquaporin 5 (aqp5; forward, 5′-ACAGGGCCTCTTTGGAATTAGG-3′ (positions 1474-1495); reverse, 5′-TGAGCTTGCACTGCCTTCAC (positions 1549-1530)).Cell Culture and Transfection—An Ishikawa ERα negative endometrial cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 12-well culture dishes containing phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% dextran charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum 24 h before transfection. Cells were cotransfected with 10 ng/well of wild-type mouse ERα or mutant nonclassical ERE207A/G208A (AA) expression vector and 500 ng/well of the indicated reporter constructs (AP-1-luciferase or p21-luciferase) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 2.4-kb full-length human p21 reporter was kindly provided by Dr. Xiao-Fan Wang (Duke University) (21Kivinen L. Tsubari M. Haapajarvi T. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Laiho M.

Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ER expression and AP-1 reporter constructs have been previously described (11Jakacka M. Ito M. Martinson F. Ishikawa T. Lee E.J. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2188-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 15Jakacka M. Ito M. Weiss J. Chien P.Y. Gehm B.D. Jameson J.L. J. Biol.

One day later, cells were treated with vehicle (0.1% EtOH), 1 nm E2, or 100 nm ICI 182,780 for 24 h. 17β-Estradiol was obtained from Sigma, and ICI 182,780 was from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Duplicate wells were harvested, and cell extracts were prepared for luciferase activity determinations using the Luciferase assay system kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Microplate Clarity luminometer (Bio-Tek Inc., Winooski, VT). Relative luciferase units were normalized to total cellular protein measured by the BCA assay (Pierce).Statistical Analysis—All reported values represent the mean ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05 using factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appropriate post hoc tests (SPSS version 14.0).RESULTSMorphology of the Uterus in the Nonclassical NERKI Mouse—The primary genotypes compared are 1) wild-type ERα (+/+), 2) nonclassical NERKI (AA/-), and 3) ERα null (-/-), since these allow the effect of the NERKI (AA) allele to be compared relative to the wild-type (+) and knock-out (-) alleles. Steroid hormone levels were determined for ERα (-/-), AA/-, and wild-type females at 10-12 weeks of age (Table 1). Serum estradiol levels were greater in the ERα (-/-) mice than in the AA/- or wild-type mice, consistent with the absence of negative feedback in the ERα null mice. However, estradiol levels were not significantly different between AA/- and wild-type females. Serum progesterone levels were similar among all three genotypes (Table 1). Although the steroid hormone levels were similar between the AA/- and wild-type females, none of the 15 AA/-females became pregnant when bred to either wild-type or AA/-proven males. Fertility was confirmed in parallel matings between wild-type female littermates and AA/-males. The AA/-females had no evidence of corpus luteum formation on ovarian histology, and vaginal smears confirmed that the AA/-females do not cycle and are in constant diestrus.TABLE 1Serum estrogen and progesterone concentrations in adult femalesHormoneERα(−/−) (S.E.)AA/− ± S.E.Wild type (+/+) ± S.E.Estradiol (pg/ml)69.9 ± 5.940.2 ± 1.7aANOVA with Bonferroni procedure, AA/− versus ERα(−/−), p < 0.01.33.3 ± 1.4bANOVA with Bonferroni procedure, wild type (+/+) versus ERα(−/−), p<0.01.Progesterone (ng/ml)3.6 ± 0.753.7 ± 0.654.6 ± 0.73a ANOVA with Bonferroni procedure, AA/− versus ERα(−/−), p < 0.01.b ANOVA with Bonferroni procedure, wild type (+/+) versus ERα(−/−), p<0.01. Open table in a new tab The gross morphology of the AA/-uterus appeared normal and exhibited a substantial increase in the thickness of the uterine horns compared with ERα (-/-) (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the gross morphology, the wet weight of the AA/-uteri was 1.7-fold greater than that of ERα (-/-) animals (Fig. 1B). The mean uterine wet weight of intact 12-week-old animals was 43 ± 2mginAA/-animals compared with 25 ± 1 mg for ERα (-/-) and 67 ± 4 mg in wild-type mice (p < 0.01). The activity of the uterine ERα signaling pathways was confirmed by the response to ovariectomy. After ovariectomy, the mean uterine wet weight did not differ between the ERα (-/-), AA/-, and wild-type animals (18.0 ± 1, 21.4 ± 1, and 23.1 ± 2 mg, respectively) (see Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Uterine weight responses to acute and prolonged estrogen treatment. Ovariectomized (OVX) 12-week-old ERα (-/-), AA/-, and wildtype (+/+) mice were treated with sesame oil or E2 (100 ng/mouse) and sacrificed 6 or 24 h after the last injection (p < 0.01, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison procedure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar to ERα (-/-) and wild-type animals, the three major anatomical compartments of the uterus, the outer muscle layer, the inner stroma, and the epithelium (glandular and luminal), are all present in the AA/-uterus (Fig. 2A). When compared with the ERα (-/-) mice, the AA/-uterus contains more endometrial glands and a higher cellular density within the stroma (data not shown).FIGURE 2Uterine histology in mice with different ERα genotypes.

B, quantitative analysis of uterine morphometry (p < 0.01, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison procedure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quantitative comparison of longitudinal uterine sections revealed that the presence of a single AA allele increased the uterine radius, the inner circular muscle layer, and the luminal epithelial height compared with ERα (-/-) (Fig. 2B). In AA/-animals, the mean uterine radius was 345 ± 12 μm compared with 194 ± 16 μminERα (-/-)(p < 0.01). The inner circular muscle increased to 49 ± 4 μminAA/-mice compared with 37 ± 2 μminERα (-/-) mice (p < 0.01). The luminal epithelial height was greater in the AA/-mice compared with ERα (-/-) (24 ± 1 versus 13 ± 1 μm, p < 0.01). Despite the significant increase in size of all three major anatomical compartments of the uterus, estrogen signaling by the AA allele did not fully restore the uterus to the size of wild-type mice, and each functional compartment of the uterus was significantly larger in wild-type mice when compared with the AA/- but increased compared with ERα (-/-) animals.Acute Uterine Response to Estradiol Is Deficient in Nonclassical NERKI Mice—To examine whether nonclassical signaling influences the acute uterotrophic response to E2, ovariectomized mice from each genotype received a single subcutaneous injection of E2 (100 ng/mouse) and were sacrificed 6 h later. The presence of a single AA allele did not facilitate the acute uterotrophic response, which is characterized by hyperemia and water imbibition (Fig. 3). After ovariectomy alone, there was no difference in the uterine wet weight based on the extent of ERα signaling. Six hours after estradiol, the uterine wet weight of AA/-animals was greater than in ERα (-/-) mice (22.7 versus 11.3 mg, p < 0.01) but did not differ from the AA/-ovariectomized mice. In contrast, the uterine wet weight of wild-type animals increased significantly after a single injection of E2 (p < 0.01). No increase in uterine wet weight was seen in the ERα (-/-) or AA/-mice, even after extended treatment with E2 (72 h) or 4HT (72 h, data not shown) (Fig. 3).Epithelial Cell Responses to Estradiol and 4-Hydroxytamoxifen Are Preserved in Nonclassical NERKI Mice—Based on histology, a proliferative response of the uterine epithelium was observed after 24 h of E2 and 72 h of 4HT in both AA/- and wild-type animals (Fig. 4). There was no evidence of luminal epithelial proliferation in response to the control injection of sesame oil for any of the genotypes. The ERα (-/-) mice did not respond to either E2 or 4HT. The treatment of AA/- and wild-type mice with E2 for 24 h resulted in moderate hypertrophy of the luminal epithelium (Fig. 4A, middle column). In wildtype animals treated with 4HT for 72 h, there was marked hyperplasia and stratification of the luminal epithelium. In the AA/-mice, the proliferative response to 4HT was accompanied by greater nuclear enlargement and cytoplasmic clearing (Fig. 4A, right column).FIGURE 4Luminal epithelial responses to estrogen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. A, longitudinal uterine sections were examined for the luminal epithelial response to E2 and 4HT using the same magnification. Adult ovariectomized mice were given a single subcutaneous injection of E2 (100 ng/mouse) or three daily injections of 4HT (50 μg/mouse) and sacrificed 24 h after the last injection. Mice injected with sesame oil were sacrificed after 24 and 72 h and served as controls. The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. B, quantitation of luminal epithelial height (p < 0.01, ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison procedure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The uterine luminal epithelial height (LEH) increased with the restoration of estrogen signaling in the nonclassical NERKI and wild-type females but not the ERα (-/-) animals (Fig. 4B). The presence of a single nonclassical allele in the AA/-animals resulted in a mean LEH of 27.2 ± 0.7 μm after E2 and 32.2 ± 1.2 μm with 4HT compared with a control LEH of 12.7 ± 0.6 μm. The increase in LEH was greater for wild-type mice after each hormone treatment (47.5 ± 2.5 μm after estradiol and 60.8 ± 2.5 μm post-4HT). The LEH response to E2 and 4HT differed significantly between ERα (-/-), AA/-, and wild-type animals (p < 0.01).Uterine BrdUrd Incorporation Is Preserved in Nonclassical NERKI Mice—The proliferative response of the AA/-uterine epithelial cells was confirmed by the presence of BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 5A). The percentage of BrdUrd-positive luminal epithelial cells was markedly greater in the AA/- and wild-type uteri compared with the ERα (-/-) animals. In response to 24 h of E2, the AA/- and wild-type mice had a similar pattern of proliferation with ∼80 and 82% of the luminal epithelial cells positive, respectively, for BrdUrd incorporation versus 2% in ERα (-/-)(p < 0.01). The pattern of epithelial proliferation was similar but diminished in intensity after 72hofE2 (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggest that a proliferative response of uterine epithelial cells to estrogenic hormones in AA/-animals is preserved and does not require classical ERα signaling.FIGURE 5Cellular proliferation in response to estrogen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. A, uterine cross-sections were examined for BrdUrd incorporation as an index of cellular proliferation (green labeling). LE, luminal epithelium; Str, stroma. Approximately 500 epithelial cells were counted in four separate fields per crosssection, and the average number of positive cells was calculated.

The only known function of Viperin relates to its ability to inhibit human Cytomegalovirus replication. Very little data are available on the regulation of this gene. In silico analysis of the promoter identified two interferon (IFN)-stimulated response elements (ISRE), which in other genes bind IRF3 or the IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) complex. LPS and poly(I-C) induce very high levels of Viperin in wild type cells but not in cells deficient in TRIF, TBK1, IRF3, or the type I IFNα/βR. SV-induced Viperin gene expression was mediated independently of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling by retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I) and the downstream adapter, mitochondrial anti-viral signaling (MAVS). Virus-induced Viperin expression was not attenuated in macrophages deficient in either TBK1 or IKKϵ alone. Moreover, IRF3-deficient, but not IFNα/βR deficient, macrophages still induced Viperin in response to SV. Promoter reporter studies combined with DNA immunoprecipitation assays identified the ISGF3 complex as the key regulator of Viperin gene expression. Moreover, positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1 (PRDI-BF1, also called BLIMP1) binds the ISRE sites and competes with ISGF3 binding in a virus inducible manner to inhibit Viperin transcription. Collectively, these studies identify Viperin as a tightly regulated ISGF3 target gene, which is counter-regulated by PRDI-BF1.

(IFN-αs and IFN-β) and the induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which limit viral replication and spread. Early detection can occur via the recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which accumulates in virus-infected cells. Double-stranded RNA is recognized by (at least) two distinct classes of pattern recognition receptors. TLR3 (1Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4848) Google Scholar) is an endosomally localized membrane bound receptor which upon dsRNA recognition oligomerizes and recruits a Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adapter molecule, TRIF (also called TICAM1). TRIF is one of four adapters involved in TLR signaling, which interacts with TRAF proteins and downstream kinase complexes (reviewed in Ref. 2Vogel S.N. Fitzgerald K.A. Fenton M.J. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recognition of the Gram-negative bacterial product lipopolysaccharide (LPS) occurs via TLR4 and MD2, which engage all four TIR adapters: MyD88, Mal (TIRAP), TRIF, and TRAM (2Vogel S.N. Fitzgerald K.A. Fenton M.J. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).A second dsRNA sensing system, localized in the cytoplasm, is mediated by the RNA helicases: retinoic acid-inducible gene (Rig-I) (3Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat.

These RNA helicases bind dsRNA and activate downstream signaling via caspase recruitment and activation domains (CARD), which engage MAVS (mitochondrial anti-viral signaling, also called IPS1, CARDif, or VISA) a CARD domain-containing adapter via homotypic interactions (5Seth R.B.

Like TRIF, MAVS recruits TRAF proteins and downstream kinases to activate transcription (for a complete review, see Ref. 9Jefferies C.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Signaling by TLR3, TLR4, and these helicases leads to the activation of ATF-2-c-Jun, IRF3/IRF7, and NF-κB. In resting cells, NF-κB is bound to the inhibitor protein IκBα, which, after virus infection, becomes phosphorylated by the classical IκB kinase complex (IKKα/β/γ), “marking” IκBα for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Similarly, IRF3 becomes phosphorylated, but in this case IKKϵ (IKKi) and/or TBK1 (NAK,T2K) (10Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M.

ATF-2-c-Jun, IRF3/IRF7, and NF-κB form a multiprotein complex, the “enhanceosome,” on the IFN-β promoter to regulate IFN-B gene expression.IFN-β signals in an autocrine/paracrine manner via the heterodimeric receptor complex (IFNα/βR) 1 and IFNα/βR2 (12Mogensen K.E. Lewerenz M. Reboul J. Lutfalla G. Uze G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1069-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Each of these receptor subunits engages a member of the Janus-activated kinase (JAK) family (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar, 14Ihle J.N. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IFNα/βR1 is constitutively associated with tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), whereas IFNα/βR2 associates with JAK1 (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4948) Google Scholar, 14Ihle J.N. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Chen J. Baig E. Fish E.N. J.

Ligand-induced rearrangement and dimerization of the receptor subunits causes the receptor-associated JAKs to become activated by autophosphorylation resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation and heterodimerization of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 and STAT2, which associate in the cytoplasm with IRF9 (also called p48). The trimeric STAT1/2/IRF9 complex, also called the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, translocates to the nucleus and initiates transcription by binding IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of multiple ISGs. Although some anti-viral genes can be induced directly by IRF3, the main workhorses of the anti-viral response are the diverse ISGs, many of which are of unknown function (17Doly J. Civas A. Navarro S. Uze G. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Viperin (virus inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon-γ-inducible) is an anti-viral gene whose function is still unclear. Viperin was initially identified as a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)- and IFNγ-inducible protein in fibroblasts (18Chin K.C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15125-15130Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and was shown to inhibit productive HCMV infection by down-regulating several HCMV structural proteins critical for viral assembly and maturation. Viperin (known as cig5 in humans, vig1 in mouse, and also RSAD2 in both human and mouse) has also been shown to be induced after infection with vesicular stomatitis virus, Yellow Fever virus, human polyomavirus JC, hepatitis C virus (19Boudinot P.

Takahashi K. Torii Y. Takeshita F. Ludwig H. Sutter G. Suzuki K. Hemmi H. Sato S. Yamamoto M. Uematsu S. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The rapid and robust induction of the Viperin gene by a range of different viruses and microbial products such as LPS and DNA suggests that it is an important component of innate immunity to diverse pathogens.In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanisms regulating Viperin gene expression. We demonstrate that Viperin is induced via IRF3-dependent as well as IRF3-independent pathways all of which rely on type I IFN signaling. The key factor regulating Viperin promoter activity appears to be the ISGF3 complex and not IRF3 itself. Moreover, positive regulatory domain I-binding factor 1 (PRDI-BF1, also called BLIMP1) blocks Viperin expression. Collectively these studies identify Viperin as a highy inducible ISGF3 target gene and define the molecular mechanisms controlling its expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Human Dendritic Cells (DC) and Mouse Macrophages—DC were generated and their maturation state examined as described (24Coccia E.M.

Where indicated, the cells were treated for 16 h with SV. Cell pellets (1 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 400 μl of Buffer I (10 mm of Tris, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and mixture protease inhibitors) and then incubated on ice for 15 min. Nuclei were sedimented by centrifuging at 1,500 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellets were then resuspended in 80 μl of Buffer II (20 mm of Tris, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, pH 7, and 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and mixture protease inhibitors).

The beads were collected with a magnet and washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the indicated specific Abs: anti-HA-horseradish peroxidase (Roche Applied Science), anti-FLAG-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), anti-STAT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PRDI-BF1 (Novus Biologicals Inc., Littleton, CO). The level of the nuclear lysates used in the assay was verified by immunoblotting with the anti-USF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Western Blot Analysis—Nuclear cell extracts were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal Abs, as requested, against the specified Abs using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSWe first examined cig-5/Viperin gene expression in human monocyte-derived DC in response to various stimuli. DC were treated for 3 h with the synthetic mycobacterial lipoprotein, Pam2Cysk4, poly(dI-dC), and LPS, ligands for TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, respectively. As seen in Fig. 1A, quantitative real-time RT-PCR measurements demonstrate that both poly(dI-dC) and LPS induced a robust induction of Viperin. In contrast Pam2Csk4 or the mixture of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL1-β did not induce this gene. Sendai virus (SV) also induced a strong expression of Viperin in DC. This differential inducibility of Viperin prompted us to examine its promoter region for transcription factor-binding sites. Using the transcription factor-binding site prediction program MatInspector (31Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar), a region spanning 1,000 bp upstream of the transcription starting site and 500 bp downstream was analyzed. Several transcription factor-binding sites for IFN-regulatory factors (IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, and IRF4), as well as two ISREs, which can bind IRFs and the IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3) complex, were identified within 500 bp of the transcription starting site. An NF-κB-binding site in close proximity to the transcription starting site was also detected (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, we also found binding sites for PRDI-BF1 (see below).We next examined the activation of both human and mouse Viperin promoters generated using luciferase-based reporter constructs. HEK293 cells expressing TLR3 induced the human Viperin promoter following treatment with poly(dI-dC). HEK293 cells expressing TLR4, MD2, and the TLR4-specific adapter TRAM also induced this reporter in response to LPS (of note, we did not observe either Viperin or IFNB reporter gene activation without TRAM coexpression). Consistent with our data in human DC, neither the TLR2 ligand nor IL-1β/TNF-α treatment induced the reporters (Fig. 1C). Importantly, these latter treatments strongly induced an NF-κB-driven reporter gene (data not shown). SV infection also resulted in a strong activation of the reporters in the parental cells in the absence of exogenous TLR expression. Similar results were obtained using the murine promoter (data not shown).We next examined Viperin induction in bone marrow (BM) macrophages derived from MyD88-, Mal-, TRIF-, and TRAM-deficient mice following LPS treatment to probe the adapter molecule requirements for this response. Macrophages from these mice were treated for 3 h with LPS and the level of Viperin mRNA was examined by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Viperin gene expression was completely abrogated in LPS-treated macrophages from TRIF- and TRAM-deficient mice. In contrast, the response in both Mal- or MyD88-deficient mice was not impaired, in fact these two strains showed an even stronger induction compared with C57BL/6 wild type mice highlighting the possible involvement of a MyD88/Mal-dependent repressor of Viperin gene expression (see “Discussion”). These findings support a key role for the TRIF/TRAM pathway in the induction of Viperin following LPS treatment.FIGURE 2TIR and CARD domain-containing adapters are differentially required for Viperin gene transcription. A, BM macrophages from C57BL/6, MyD88-/-, Mal-/-, TRIF-/-, and TRAM-/- mice were stimulated with LPS (3 h). mRNA expression of the Viperin gene was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. B, HEK293 cells were transfected with the Viperin reporter gene and then cotransfected with full-length RIG-I, MDA-5, and Lgp2. Cells were infected with SV for 16 h, and luciferase reporter activity was measured. In all cases, data are expressed as fold induction relative to the reporter-only control and are the mean ± S.D.

To determine whether RIG-I contributes to SV-induced Viperin gene expression, HEK293 cells were transfected with a reporter gene encoding the human Viperin promoter and cotransfected with an expression vector for RIG-I or Mda-5 (Fig. 2B). Transfection of the full-length RIG-I alone activated the Viperin reporter and this effect was dramatically enhanced upon SV infection. Mda-5 overexpression slightly induced Viperin promoter; however, no enhancement was observed with SV (29Rothenfusser S. Goutagny N. Diperna G. Gong M. Monks B.G. Schoenemeyer A. Yamamoto M. Akira S.

Hennighausen L. Genomics. 2001; 78: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which seems to be a post-induction feedback inhibitor of RIG-I signaling (29Rothenfusser S. Goutagny N.

To clearly demonstrate a role for RIG-I we used the human Huh7.5 hepatoma cell line that has a single point mutation within the CARD domain of RIG-I, which impairs its signaling. Consistent with the previous data, the Viperin promoter was induced in the parental Huh7 cell line upon SV stimulation. However, we observed an induction in Huh7.5 upon SV infection only after their complementation with wild type RIG-I (Fig. 2C). Moreover, overexpression of MAVS in HEK293 cells potently activated the Viperin promoter, and this response was enhanced by SV infection (Fig. 2D). SV-induced Viperin reporter activity was blocked by the Hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease (data now shown), in fact it has been recently shown that NS3/4A abrogates signaling through RIG-I by cleaving MAVS from the mitochondrial membrane (34Li K. Foy E. Ferreon J.C. Nakamura M. Ferreon A.C. Ikeda M. Ray S.C. Gale Jr., M. Lemon S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2992-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Collectively these data demonstrate that RIG-I and MAVS regulate Viperin gene expression in the SV pathway.We next examined Viperin reporter gene activity upon overexpression of the IKK kinases, which act downstream of TRIF and MAVS to regulate either IRF3 or NF-κB. Overexpression of TBK1 and IKKϵ but not the related kinase IKKβ induced the reporter gene (Fig. 3A). TBK1, but neither IKKϵ nor IKKβ, greatly enhanced SV-induced reporter activity suggesting that TBK1 may be the main kinase regulating the Viperin response. The lack of induction by IKKβ suggests that the NF-κB site may not be as important. We also compared the induction of Viperin in macrophages from C57BL/6 wild type, IKKϵ-deficient, and TBK1"
https://openalex.org/W2090920304,"Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in antiproliferative and anti-virus responses, immune surveillance and tumor suppression. These biological responses to IFN-γ are mainly mediated by the regulation of gene expression. It has been reported that growth-inhibitory role of IFN-γ is dependent on activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1); however, the molecular basis downstream of STAT1 remains unclear. Here, we report that an IFN-γ-induced gene, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1), plays a key role in the antiproliferative action of IFN-γ. Overexpression of IFITM1 negatively regulated cell growth, whereas suppression of IFITM1 blocked the antiproliferative effect of IFN-γ, accelerated the cell growth rate and conferred tumorigenicity to a non-malignant hepatocyte in nude mice. Further, IFITM1 could inhibit the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 and stabilize the p53 protein by inhibiting p53 phosphorylation on Thr55. Suppression of p53 reduced the growth-inhibitory capacity of both IFITM1 and IFN-γ. Therefore, these findings indicated that the antiproliferative action of IFN-γ requires the induction of IFITM1, and provided a crosstalk between two well-known signaling mediators, STAT1 and p53, both of which play critical roles in tumor suppression."

Here, we have employed an integrated genomics approach including DNA microarray and proteomics analyses to elucidate the catabolic pathway for d-arabinose in Sulfolobus solfataricus. During growth on this sugar, a small set of genes appeared to be differentially expressed compared with growth on d-glucose. These genes were heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified and biochemically studied. This showed that d-arabinose is oxidized to 2-oxoglutarate by the consecutive action of a number of previously uncharacterized enzymes, including a d-arabinose dehydrogenase, a d-arabinonate dehydratase, a novel 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinonate dehydratase, and a 2,5-dioxopentanoate dehydrogenase. Promoter analysis of these genes revealed a palindromic sequence upstream of the TATA box, which is likely to be involved in their concerted transcriptional control. Integration of the obtained biochemical data with genomic context analysis strongly suggests the occurrence of pentose oxidation pathways in both Archaea and Bacteria, and predicts the involvement of additional enzyme components. Moreover, it revealed striking genetic similarities between the catabolic pathways for pentoses, hexaric acids, and hydroxyproline degradation, which support the theory of metabolic pathway genesis by enzyme recruitment.

Moreover, it revealed striking genetic similarities between the catabolic pathways for pentoses, hexaric acids, and hydroxyproline degradation, which support the theory of metabolic pathway genesis by enzyme recruitment. Pentose sugars are a ubiquitous class of carbohydrates with diverse biological functions. Ribose and deoxyribose are major constituents of nucleic acids, whereas arabinose and xylose are building blocks of several plant cell wall polysaccharides. Many prokaryotes, as well as yeasts and fungi, are able to degrade these polysaccharides, and use the released five-carbon sugars as a sole carbon and energy source. At present, three main catabolic pathways have been described for pentoses. The first is present in Bacteria and uses isomerases, kinases, and epimerases to convert d- and l-arabinose (Ara) and d-xylose (Xyl) into d-xylulose 5-phosphate (Fig. 1A), which is further metabolized by the enzymes of the phosphoketolase or pentose phosphate pathway. The genes encoding the pentose-converting enzymes are often located in gene clusters in bacterial genomes, for example, the araBAD operon for l-Ara (1Lee N. Gielow W. Martin R. Hamilton E. Fowler A. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 47: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the xylAB operon for d-Xyl (2Rosenfeld S.A. Stevis P.E. Ho N.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 194: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the darK-fucPIK gene cluster for d-Ara (3Elsinghorst E.A. Mortlock R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7223-7232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second catabolic pathway for pentoses converts d-Xyl into d-xylulose 5-phosphate as well, but the conversions are catalyzed by reductases and dehydrogenases instead of isomerases and epimerases (Fig. 1B). This pathway is commonly found in yeasts, fungi, mammals, and plants, but also in some bacteria (4Chiang C. Knight S.G. Nature. 1960; 188: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 5Fossitt D. Mortlock R.P. Anderson R.L. Wood W.A. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1988; 172: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In a third pathway, pentoses such as l-Ara, d-Xyl, d-ribose, and d-Ara are metabolized non-phosphorylatively to either 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) 4The abbreviations used are: 2-OG, 2-oxoglutarate; HSCFE, heat-stable cell-free extract; CFE, cell-free extract; Ara, arabinose; KDA, 2-keto-3-deoxy-arabinonate; DOP, 2,5-dioxopentanoate; AraDH, arabinose dehydrogenase; AraD, arabinonate dehydratase; KdaD, 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinonate dehydratase; DopDH, 2,5-dioxopentanoate dehydrogenase. or to pyruvate and glycolaldehyde (Fig. 1C). The conversion to 2-OG, which is a tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate, proceeds via the subsequent action of a pentose dehydrogenase, a pentonolactonase, a pentonic acid dehydratase, a 2-keto-3-deoxypentonic acid dehydratase, and a 2,5-dioxopentanoate dehydrogenase. This metabolic pathway has been reported in several aerobic bacteria, such as strains of Pseudomonas (7Weimberg R. Doudoroff M. J. Biol.

Alternatively, some Pseudomonas and Bradyrhizobium species have been reported to cleave the 2-ke- to-3-deoxypentonic acid with an aldolase to yield pyruvate and glycolaldehyde (14Palleroni N.J.

Despite the fact that these oxidative pathway variants have been known for more than five decades, surprisingly, the majority of the responsible enzymes and genes remain unidentified. Sulfolobus spp. are obligatory aerobic Crenarchaea that are commonly found in acidic geothermal springs. Among the Archaea, this genus is well known for its broad saccharolytic capacity, which is reflected in their ability to utilize several pentoses and hexoses, as well as oligosaccharides and polysaccharides as a sole carbon and energy source (17Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the catabolism of hexoses is well studied (reviewed in Ref. 18Siebers B. Schonheit P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 695-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), the pathways for pentose degradation have neither been established in Sulfolobus solfataricus, nor in any other member of the Archaea (19Johnsen U. Schonheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from MWG Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). S. solfataricus P2 (DSM1617) was grown in media containing either 3 g/liter d-Ara or d-Glu as previously described (20Brouns S.J. Smits N. Wu H. Snijders A.P. Wright P.C. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2392-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whole genome DNA microarrays containing gene-specific tags representing >90% of the S. solfataricus P2 genes (21Andersson A. Bernander R. Nilsson P. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were used for global transcript profiling of cultures grown on d-Ara as compared with d-Glu. Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and labeling, hybridization, and scanning were performed as previously described, as were data filtration, normalization, and statistical evaluation (22Lundgren M. Andersson A. Chen L. Nilsson P. Bernander R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7046-7051Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Snijders A.P. Walther J. Peter S.

The proteome of S. solfataricus P2 was studied with a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, 15N metabolic labeling, and tandem mass spectrometry as previously described (24Snijders A.P. de Vos M.G. Wright P.C. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Snijders A.P. de Vos M.G. de Koning B. Wright P.C. Electrophoresis. 2005; 26: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two separate growth experiments were set up: 1) S. solfataricus with d-Ara as the carbon source and (14NH4)2SO4 as the nitrogen source; and 2) S. solfataricus with d-Glu as the carbon source and (15NH4)2SO4 as the nitrogen source. Next, the 14N and 15N cultures were mixed in equal amounts on the basis of optical density (A530) measurements, proteins were extracted and separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. For the localization of proteins, a previously described two-dimensional gel electrophoresis reference map was used (23Snijders A.P. Walther J. Peter S. Kinnman I. de Vos M.G. van de Werken H.J. Brouns S.J. van der Oost J. Wright P.C. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1518-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Spots were excised from the gel, and peptides were quantified on the basis of their relative intensity in the time of flight mass spectrum, according to established methods (23Snijders A.P. Walther J. Peter S. Kinnman I. de Vos M.G. van de Werken H.J. Brouns S.J. van der Oost J. Wright P.C. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1518-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). d-Arabinonate was synthesized from d-Ara as previously described (26Sperber N. Zaugg H.E. Sandstrom W.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1947; 69: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The aldehyde 2,5-dioxopentanoate was synthesized from 1,4-dibromobutane according to reported procedures (27Kraus G.A. Landgrebe K. Synthesis. 1984; 1984: 885Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Macritchie J.A. Silcock A. Willis C.L. Tetrahedron Asymmetry. 1997; 8: 3895-3902Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Crestia D. Guerard C. Bolte J. Demuynck C. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzymol. 2001; 11: 207-212Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The genes araDH (Sso1300), araD (Sso3124), kdaD (Sso3118), and dopDH (Sso3117) were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using Pfu TURBO polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned in expression vector pET24d (Novagen) (supplemental materials Table 1). The resulting plasmids were harvested from Escherichia coli HB101 transformants by Miniprep (Qiagen), sequenced by Westburg genomics (Leusden, Netherlands), and transformed to E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3) containing the tRNA accessory plasmid pRIL (Stratagene). All proteins were produced according to standard procedures in four 1-liter shaker flasks containing LB medium, but with some exceptions. When the culture A600 reached 0.5, the cultures were cold-shocked by placing them on ice for 30 min to induce host chaperones (20Brouns S.J. Smits N. Wu H. Snijders A.P. Wright P.C. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2392-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After that, the expression was started by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were incubated for 12-16 h at 37 °C after which they were spun down (10 min, 5000 × g, 4 °C). At the time of induction, the arabinose dehydrogenase (AraDH) and AraD overexpression cultures were supplemented with 0.25 mm ZnSO4 (30Esposito L. Bruno I. Sica F. Raia C.A. Giordano A. Rossi M. Mazzarella L. Zagari A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14397-14407Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and 20 mm MgCl2, respectively. Pelleted E. coli and S. solfataricus cells were resuspended in buffer and disrupted by sonication at 0 °C. Afterward, insoluble cell material was spun down (30 min, 26,500 × g, 4 °C) and the E. coli supernatants were subjected to heat treatment for 30 min at 75 °C. Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation (30 min, 26,500 × g, 4 °C) yielding the heat-stable cell-free extract (HSCFE). AraDH—HSCFE in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 50 mm NaCl was applied to a 20-ml Matrex Red A affinity column (Amicon). After washing the bound protein with 2 column volumes of buffer, the recombinant protein was eluted by a linear gradient of 2 m NaCl. AraD—HSCFE in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) supplemented with 50 mm NaCl was applied to a 70-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column, and eluted in a 2 m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled, concentrated with a 30-kDa cut-off filter (Vivaspin), and purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) and 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 8.0) supplemented with 100 mm NaCl as an eluent. 2-Keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinonate Dehydratase (KdaD)—HSCFE in 25 mm NaPi buffer (pH 6.8) was applied to a 70-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column. Flow-through fractions containing KdaD were collected, loaded onto a 46-ml Bio-Gel hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad), and eluted by a linear gradient of 0.5 m NaPi buffer (pH 6.8). Fractions containing the recombinant proteins were pooled, and dialyzed overnight in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). 2,5-Dioxopentanoate Dehydrogenase (DopDH)—HSCFE in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) supplemented with 200 mm NaCl and 7.5 mm DTT was purified by affinity chromatography, as described for AraDH. Fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated using a 30-kDa cut-off membrane (Vivaspin), and purified by size exclusion chromatography as described for AraD. Unless stated otherwise, all enzymatic assays were performed in degassed 100 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.5) at 70 °C. The optimal pH of catalysis was determined using a 30 mm citratephosphate-glycine buffer system that was adjusted in the range of pH 3-11 at 70 °C. Thermal inactivation assays were performed by incubating 50 μg/ml of enzyme at 70, 80, 85, and 90 °C and drawing aliquots at regular intervals during 2 h followed by a standard activity assay. Sugar dehydrogenase activity was determined on a Hitachi U-1500 spectrophotometer in a continuous assay using 10 mm d- and l-arabinose, d- and l-xylose, d-ribose, d-lyxose, d- and l-fucose, d- and l-galactose, d-mannose, and d-glucose as a substrate, and 0.4 mm NAD+ or NADP+ as a cofactor. Aldehyde dehydrogenase reactions were performed using 5 mm 2,5-dioxopentanoate, glycolaldehyde, dl-glyceraldehyde, acetaldehyde, and propionaldehyde in the presence of 10 mm DTT. Initial enzymatic activity rates were obtained from the increase in absorption at 340 nm (A340), and calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm-1 cm-1. Standard reactions were performed using 10 mm potassium d-arabinonate in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2. The formation of 2-keto-3-deoxy-acid reaction products was determined with the thiobarbiturate assay at 549 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 67.8 mm-1 cm-1 (31Warren L. Nature. 1960; 186: 237Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 32Kim S. Lee S.B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The effect of different divalent cations on enzymatic activity was investigated by a pre-treatment of the enzyme with 1 mm EDTA for 20 min at 70 °C, followed by a standard assay in the presence of 2 mm divalent metal ions. Enzyme reactions were performed with cell-free extract (CFE) from S. solfataricus cultures grown on either d-Ara or d-Glu, which were harvested at mid-exponential phase. The reaction was started by adding 25 μl of 3.5 mg/ml CFE to a mixture containing 10 mm potassium d-arabinonate, 1 mm MgCl2, and either 0.4 mm NAD+ or NADP+. After an incubation of 2 h at 75°C, the reactions were stopped by placing the tubes on ice. Identical reactions were set up in which the CFE was replaced by the purified enzymes AraD (4.2 μg), KdaD (13.4 μg), and DopDH (3.8 μg). The amount of 2-oxoglutarate in these mixtures was then determined by the reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate to l-glutamate using purified recombinant Pyrococcus furiosus glutamate dehydrogenase at 60 °C (33Lebbink J.H. Eggen R.I. Geerling A.C. Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Scandurra R. de Vos W.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The detection reaction was started by the addition of 5 units of glutamate dehydrogenase to a sample that was supplemented with 10 mm NH4Cl and 0.12 mm NADPH. The formation of pyruvate was determined at 30 °C using 4 units of chicken heart lactate dehydrogenase and 0.1 mm NADH. The conversion of 2-oxoglutarate or pyruvate was continuously monitored on a Hitachi U-1500 spectrophotometer by following the decrease in A340 until substrate depletion occurred. Changes in concentrations of NAD(P)H were calculated as described above. The oligomerization state of AraDH, AraD, KdaD, and DopDH was determined by nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. For this, the protein was concentrated in the range of 5-15 μm and the buffer was exchanged to 50 or 200 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.7 or 7.5) by using an Ultrafree 0.5-ml centrifugal filter device with a 5-kDa cut-off (Millipore). Protein samples were introduced into the nanoflow electrospray ionization source of a Micromass LCT mass spectrometer (Waters), which was modified for high mass operation and set in positive ion mode. Mass spectrometry experiments were performed under conditions of increased pressure in the interface region between the sample and extraction cone of 8 mbar by reducing the pumping capacity of the rotary pump (34Schmidt A. Bahr U. Karas M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 6040-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Tahallah N. Pinkse M. Maier C.S. Heck A.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Capillary and sample cone voltages were optimized for the different proteins and were in the range of 1.4-1.6 kV and 75-150 V, respectively. Upstream sequences of the differentially expressed genes were extracted between -200 and +50 nucleotides relative to the open reading frame translation start site. These sequences were analyzed using the Gibbs Recursive Sampler algorithm (36Thompson W. Rouchka E.C. Lawrence C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3580-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Possible sequence motifs were checked against all upstream sequences and the complete genome of S. solfataricus. A diagram of the sequence motif was created using the WebLogo server. Protein sequences were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and analyzed using PSI-BLAST on the non-redundant data base, and RPS-BLAST on the conserved domain data base. Multiple sequence alignments were built using either ClustalX or TCoffee software. Gene neighborhood analyses were performed using various webserver tools: STRING at the EMBL, Gene Ortholog Neighborhoods at the Integrated Microbial Genomes server of the Joint Genome Institute, and pinned regions at the ERGO bioinformatics suite. S. solfataricus is a model archaeon for studying metabolism and information processing systems, such as transcription, translation, and DNA replication (37She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F.

Several halophilic and thermophilic Archaea have been reported to assimilate pentose sugars, but neither the catabolic pathways for these 5-carbon sugars nor the majority of its enzymes are known (17Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Johnsen U. Schonheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6198-6207Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To close this knowledge gap, we have studied the growth of S. solfataricus on the pentose d-Ara using a multidisciplinary genomics approach, and compared the results to growth on the hexose d-Glu. Both culture media supported growth to cell densities of ∼2 × 109 cells/ml (A600 2.5) with similar doubling times of around 6 h. Several enzyme activity assays were performed with CFEs from both cultures to establish a mode of d-Ara degradation (Fig. 1). A 12.3-fold higher NADP+-dependent d-Ara dehydrogenase activity (45.5 milliunits/mg) was detected in d-Ara CFE (Table 1), which indicated the presence of an inducible d-Ara dehydrogenase. d-Ara reductase, d-arabinitol dehydrogenase, and d-Ara isomerase activity were not detected. Activity assays using d-arabinonate indicated that d-Ara CFE contained a 13.9-fold higher d-arabinonate dehydratase activity (7.4 milliunits/mg) than d-Glu CFE (Table 1). Moreover, the multistep conversion of d-arabinonate to 2-OG could readily be demonstrated with d-Ara CFE in the presence of NADP+ (Fig. 2). The formation of pyruvate as one of the products from d-arabinonate was not observed, whereas control reactions with both CFEs and d-gluconate as a substrate did yield pyruvate (data not shown), indicating that the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway were operative. In the final step of the pathway, d-Ara CFE contained a 3.6-fold higher activity (255 milliunits/mg) toward the aldehyde 2,5-dioxopentanoate (DOP) using NADP+ as a cofactor. The data suggest that S. solfataricus employs an inducible enzyme set that converts d-Ara into the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate 2-OG via the pentose oxidation pathway (Fig. 1C).TABLE 1Properties of the d-Ara degrading enzymes of S. solfataricusAraDHAraDKdaDDopDHDescriptiond-Arabinose 1-dehydrogenased-Arabinonate dehydratase2-Keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinonate dehydratase2,5-Dioxopentanoate dehydrogenaseEC number1.1.1.1174.2.1.54.2.1.-1.2.1.26Locus IDSso1300Sso3124Sso3118Sso3117Uniprot IDQ97YM2Q97U96Q97UA0Q97UA1GenBank ID15898142158998301589982615899825COG1,0644,9483,9701,012PFAM00107011880155700171Specific activity in S.s extracts (milliunits/mg)45.57.4NDaND, not determined.255-Fold A/G(12.3)(13.9)(3.6)ARA-box presentYesYesYesYesSubunit size (kDa)37.342.433.152.3OligomerizationTetramerOctamerTetramerTetramerSubstrate specificity, turnover number (s−1)d-Arabinose (23.8)d-Arabinonate (1.8)ND2,5-Dioxopentanoate(8.6)l-Fucose (26.8)Glycolaldehyde(5.3)d-Ribose (17.7)dl-glyceraldehyde(4.8)l-Galactose (17.7)CofactorNADP+, Zn2+Mg2+NDNADP+Apparent pH optimum (>50% activity)8.2 (7.3-9.3)6.7 (5.2-10.2)ND7.8 (6.7-8.2)Apparent T-optimum (°C) (>50% activity)91 (74->100)85 (75-92)NDNDThermal inactivation42 min at 85 °C18 min at 85 °CNDNDHalf-life time26 min at 90 °C<10 min at 90 °Ca ND, not determined.

The transcriptome comparison between both growth conditions showed that a small set of genes was differentially expressed 3-fold or more (Table 2). The highly expressed genes under d-Ara conditions included all four subunits of the Ara ABC transporter (Sso3066-3069) (39Elferink M.G. Albers S.V. Konings W.N. Driessen A.J. Mol.

The differential expression of the gene for the remaining SoxM subunit, i.e. the sulfocyanin subunit SoxE (Sso2972), was just below the threshold level (supplemental materials Table 2).

The Glu ABC transporter was not differentially expressed, confirming previous observations (41Lubelska J.M. Jonuscheit M. Schleper C. Albers S.V. Driessen A.J. Extremophiles. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). The difference in gene expression of subunits SoxA (Sso2658), SoxC (Sso2656), and SoxD (Sso10828) was just below the threshold level (supplemental materials Table 2). Next to the SoxABCD genes, a small gene cluster containing the Rieske iron-sulfur cluster protein SoxL-1 (Sso2660) and Sso2661 to Sso2663 appeared to be expressed with a 2-3-fold difference (supplemental materials Table 2). It thus appears that under d-Glu conditions, the Sox-ABCD quinol oxidase complex is preferentially used, whereas under d-Ara conditions the SoxM-mediated terminal quinol oxidation is favored.

https://openalex.org/W2040964375,"Peroxisomal proteins carrying a peroxisome targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) are recognized in the cytosol by the cycling import receptor Pex5p. The receptor-cargo complex docks at the peroxisomal membrane where it associates with multimeric protein complexes, referred to as the docking and RING finger complexes. Here we have identified regions within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex5p sequence that interconnect the receptor-cargo complex with the docking complex. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved tryptophan residue within a reverse WXXXF motif abolished two-hybrid binding with the N-terminal half of Pex14p. In combination with an additional mutation introduced into the Pex13p-binding site, we generated a Pex5p mutant defective in a stable association not only with the docking complex but also with the RING finger peroxins at the membrane. Surprisingly, PTS1 proteins are still imported into peroxisomes in these mutant cells. Because these mutations had no significant effect on the membrane binding properties of Pex5p, we examined yeast and human Pex5p for intrinsic lipid binding activity. In vitro analyses demonstrated that both proteins have the potential to insert spontaneously into phospholipid membranes. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that a translocation-competent state of the PTS1 receptor enters the membrane via protein-lipid interactions before it tightly associates with other peroxins.

Peroxisomes post-translationally import folded and oligomeric proteins of very different sizes from the cytosol across the single membrane into their matrix (1Lazarow P.B. Curr. Opin.

Although the identities of many proteins, collectively called peroxins, that are required for this process are known, the mechanism of protein translocation across the peroxisomal membrane is poorly understood.

After releasing their cargo, the receptors recycle to the cytosol for additional rounds of import. Most of the peroxisomal matrix proteins possess one of two evolutionarily conserved PTS, the C-terminal PTS1 or the N-terminal PTS2, which are specifically recognized by Pex5p and Pex7p, respectively (2Eckert J.H.

This import receptor was shown to consist of two functionally distinct domains. Although binding of the PTS1 proteins is mediated by six tetratricopeptide repeats within its C-terminal half (13Gatto G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct.

An even larger complex, termed the importomer, which in addition to the docking subcomplex contains Pex8p and the three RING finger peroxins, Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p, has been shown to exist in the peroxisomal membrane (29Agne B.

The ATP-dependent dislocation of the PTS1 receptor from the peroxisomal membrane into the cytosol is mediated by the AAA peroxins Pex1p and Pex6p (30Platta H.W. Grunau S. Rosenkranz K. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The interaction of Pex5p and Pex14p, which seems to be the initial binding partner of the receptors at the peroxisomal membrane, has been studied intensively (31Choe J. Moyersoen J. Roach C.

It was found that the N terminus (amino acid residues 1–78) of human Pex14p directly interacts with Pex5p with a binding affinity in the nanomolar range (32Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5666-5673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Moreover, the seven conserved WXXXF motifs within the N-terminal half of human Pex5p form individual high affinity sites for Pex14p (35Saidowsky J. Dodt G. Kirchberg K. Wegner A. Nastainczyk W. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34524-34529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These motifs are present in variable number and spacing in all known Pex5 proteins. Recently it was shown that the PTS1 and the PTS2 receptors not only associate with the outer surface of the membrane (cycling receptor model) but actually traverse the membrane. This has led to the extended shuttle receptor model (6Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Despite these accumulating data about the translocation machinery, a translocation channel has not yet been identified. In this study, we investigated the interaction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex5p (ScPex5p) at the peroxisomal membrane in greater detail. The identification of a novel Pex14p-binding site in the Pex5p sequence enabled us to generate a mutant Pex5p that has lost the ability to associate stably with the docking and the RING finger complex. Most unexpectedly, this Pex5p variant associated together with cargo protein with the peroxisomal membrane and was still able to mediate matrix protein import. From these findings we speculated that protein-lipid interaction rather than protein-protein interactions could anchor the receptor-cargo complex at the membrane. In a first step to verify this assumption, we show in vitro that Pex5p has the ability to spontaneously insert into phospholipid monolayers and bilayers. Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of S. cerevisiae UTL-7A if not stated otherwise (Table 1). Strains expressing proteins fused to tobacco etch virus (tobacco etch virus-protease cleavage site)-protein A instead of wild-type Pex5p were generated by genomic integration into the PEX5 locus. This was achieved by transforming haploid yeast cells with the PCR products according to Knop et al. (36Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The yeast strain pex3Δpex19Δ was generated according to Güldener et al. (37Güldener U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J.

The construction of the pex13Δ pex14Δ pex5Δ strain required the disruption of PEX5 with the removable loxP-kanMX4-loxP marker using the oligonucleotides Ku301 and Ku976b. The deletion of PEX13 was generated using the primer pair Ku274/RE534, whereas PEX14 was deleted with the oligonucleotides RE536 and RE537.

All plasmids named pDK or pWK contain modified copies of the ScPEX5 gene, which were expressed in a PEX5 deletion strain from the low copy vector pRS416 (Stratagene). The constructs are under control of the PEX5 promotor region and an ADC1 termination region (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8895-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The corresponding coding DNA regions were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of the wild-type strain as a template. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 2 and were obtained from Eurogentec (Belgium). The PEX5 full-length fragment was amplified by using the primers Ku875 and Ku888. The amplification product was cloned using primer-generated endonuclease recognition sites into SalI/BglII-digested pWK-PEX5-(aa 1–313) (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8895-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and into SalI/BglII-digested pPC86 (39Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) resulting in pWK-PEX5 and pPC86-PEX5. The PEX5-(aa 1–313) fragment was obtained by SalI/BglII digestion from the vector pWK-PEX5-(aa 1–313) (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8895-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and ligated into a SalI/BglII-digested two-hybrid vector pPC86 resulting in pPC86-PEX5-(aa 1–313). The same procedure was used to obtain the PEX5-(aa 313–612) fragment from the vector pDK-PEX5-(aa 313–612) (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8895-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) resulting in pPC86-PEX5-(aa 313–612). The PEX5-(aa 1–245) fragment was amplified using the primer pair Ku875/Ku876. The amplification product was digested with SalI and BglII and ligated into a SalI/BglII-digested pPC86 vector resulting in pPC86-PEX5-(aa 1–245). The PEX5 fragment encoding amino acids 246–267 was amplified by two PCRs. In a first step a fragment corresponding to amino acids 246–258 fused to the GAL-4-activating domain was amplified using the two-hybrid vector pPC86 as template and the primer pair Ku1436/Ku1433 in which the latter one codes for the PEX5 fragment. The PCR product serves as template for the final fragment coding for amino acids 246–267, which was amplified by the primer pair Ku1436/Ku1434 in which the latter one codes for the PEX5 fragment (aa 252–267) and contains a NotI restriction site. The amplification product was ligated after MluI/NotI restriction into an MluI/NotI-digested pPC86 vector resulting in pPC86-PEX5-(aa 246–267). Point mutations in PEX5 were introduced using overlap extension PCR (40Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). All base pair changes were verified by sequencing. For the mutation Pex5p(W120A), PCR products were amplified by primer pairs Ku875/Ku856 and Ku855/Ku888 using genomic DNA of wild-type strain as template. Ku856 and Ku855 contain a substituted base pair triplet coding for alanine at amino acid position 120. The exterior primers Ku875 and Ku888 together with both PCR products were used for the overlap extension PCR. The amplification product was digested with SalI and BglII and ligated into SalI/BglII-digested pPC86 resulting in pPC86-PEX5(W120A). To introduce the double mutation W120A/W204A into the PEX5 sequence, the PCR product PEX5(W120A) was used as a template. Overlapping PCR was carried out as described above using primers Ku857 and Ku858 for the substitution W204A and the exterior primers Ku875 and Ku888. The PCR product was digested with SalI and BglII and ligated into SalI/BglII digested pPC86 resulting in pPC86-PEX5(W120A;W204A). To introduce the single mutation Pex5p(Trp-204) the same cloning procedure was carried out as described above but using genomic DNA of wild-type strain as template resulting in pPC86-PEX5(W204A). Additionally, the PCR fragment was ligated into SalI/BglII-digested pWK-PEX5-(aa 1–313) resulting in pDK-PEX5(W204A). To obtain Pex5p(W261A), PCR products were amplified by primer pairs Ku875/Ku1458 and Ku888/Ku1457 using genomic DNA of wild-type strain as template. Ku1458 and Ku1457 contain a substituted base pair triplet coding for alanine at amino acid position 261. The exterior primers Ku875 and Ku888 together with both PCR products were used for the overlap extension PCR. The amplification product was digested with SalI and BglII and ligated into SalI/BglII-digested pWK-PEX5-(aa 1–313) (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8895-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and into SalI/BglII-digested pPC86 (39Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), resulting in pDK-PEX5(W261A) and pPC86-PEX5(W261A). To introduce the double mutation W120A/W204A into the PEX5 sequence, PEX5(W204A) was used as a template. Overlapping PCR was carried out as described above using primers Ku1558 and Ku1457 for the substitution W204A and the exterior primers Ku875 and Ku888. The amplification product was digested with SalI and BglII and ligated into SalI/BglII digested pPC86 and pWK-PEX5-(aa 1–313) resulting in pPC86-PEX5(W204A;W261A) and pDK-PEX5(W204A;W261A). The PTS1 peptide represents the 12 C-terminal amino acids 659–670 from the carnitine-acetyltransferase 2. The fragment was amplified by the primer pair Ku1520/Ku1521 using the two-hybrid vector pPC97 as template. The primer Ku1520 contains a HindIII restriction site and binds on the Gal-4 binding domain of the vector. The primer Ku1521 contains a NotI restriction site and encodes for the PTS1 sequence. The amplification product was ligated after HindIII/NotI restriction into HindIII/NotI-digested pPC97 vector resulting in pPC97-PTS1. The vectors pPC97-PEX14-(aa 1–58) and pPC97-PEX14-(aa 235–341) were kindly provided by K. Niederhoff (Bochum, Germany) (41Niederhoff K. Meindl-Beinker N.M. Kerssen D. Perband U. Schafer A.

To create yeast expression plasmids coding for Pex5p(W261A)-ProtA, Pex5p(W204A)-ProtA, and Pex5p(W204;261A)-ProtA, a PCR product containing a PEX5-ProtA fragment (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell.

The amplification product was cloned after NheI/SpHI restriction into NheI/SpHI-digested pWK-Pex5p(W261A), pWK-Pex5p(W204A), and pWK-Pex5p(W204;261A), resulting in pDK-Pex5p(W261A)ProtA, pDK-Pex5p(W204A)ProtA and pDK-Pex5p(W204;261A)ProtA. For bacterial expression of yeast Pex5p, the vector pET9d-His-ScPex5p was kindly provided by K. Niederhoff (Bochum, Germany). For expression of human Pex5p, the vector pET9d-His-HsPex5Lp was used (32Schliebs W. Saidowsky J. Agianian B. Dodt G. Herberg F.W. Kunau W.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar), open reading frames of selected PEX genes were fused to the DNA-binding domain or transcription-activating domain of GAL4 in the vectors pPC86 and pPC97 (39Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Cotransformation of two-hybrid vectors into yeast strain PCY2 (Clontech) was performed according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Transformed yeast cells were plated on SD synthetic medium without tryptophan and leucine. β-Galactosidase filter tests were performed as described previously (45Rehling P. Marzioch M. Niesen F. Wittke E. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.-H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2901-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Western Blotting and Densitometry—Western blots were incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against human Pex5p and the S. cerevisiae proteins thiolase, Fox1p, Pex5p, Pex10p, Pex12p, Pex13p, Pex14p, Pex17p, Pex3p, catalase A, porin, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (all raised in our laboratory), aconitase (a kind gift of R. Lill, University of Marburg, Germany), Mdh3p (a kind gift of L. McAlister-Henn, University of California), and Sec72p (a kind gift of E. Hartmann, University of Lübeck, Germany). Horseradish peroxidase coupled with anti-rabbit IgG in combination with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect immunoreactive complexes. For semi-quantitative analyses of Western blot signals the band density on film was measured with a scanner using Scion image software. The relative density of signals was calculated in the area encompassing the immunoreactive protein band and subtracting the background of an adjacent nonreactive area in the same lane of the protein of interest. Yeast Cell Fractionation—Spheroplasting of yeast cells, homogenization, and differential centrifugation at 25,000 × g of post-nuclear supernatants were performed as described previously (38Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Mertens D. Kunau W.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2432-2436Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Cell fractionation by means of density gradient centrifugation was carried out as described previously (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Schliebs W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8895-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but instead of postnuclear supernatant 3–4 mg of protein of 25,000 × g organellar pellet were loaded onto the gradient. For membrane extraction of organellar pellets, aliquots were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Samples were incubated for 30 min on ice and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Protease protection experiments were carried out with organellar pellets containing 100 μg of protein and increasing amounts of proteinase K (Sigma) in buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 5 mm MES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, pH 6.0) with or without 1% Triton X-100. Digestion was carried out on ice for 10 min and stopped by adding PMSF (240 μg/ml) and SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All samples were analyzed by Western blotting. For flotation analyses of cell lysates, oleate grown yeast cells were lysed according to Lamb et al. (46Lamb J.R. Michaud W.A. Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4321-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) using glass beads and lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES; 100 mm KOAc; 5 mm MgOAc; pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (240 μg/ml PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.35 μg/ml bestatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.16 mg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml antipain, 0.21 mg/ml NaF, 6 μg/ml chymostatin). 1.5 mg of protein from the lysate were adjusted to a concentration of 45% (w/v) sucrose. The samples were laid onto sucrose cushions (220 μl of lysis buffer with 50% (w/v) sucrose) and overlaid with 500 μl of buffer II (lysis buffer; 40% (w/v) sucrose), 1900 μl of buffer I (lysis buffer; 25% (w/v) sucrose), and 1000 μl of lysis buffer. After ultracentrifugation for 3 h at 170,000 × g in a swing-out rotor, the flotation gradient was collected as 10 fractions from top (fraction 10) to bottom (fraction 1). The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot detection. The immunopurification of membrane-associated Pex5p-ProtA and its variants with IgG-coupled Sepharose was performed as described previously (14Schäfer A. Kerssen D. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H.

https://openalex.org/W2117823973,"Roles for UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase (GNE) beyond controlling flux into the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway by converting UDP-GlcNAc to N-acetylmannosamine are described in this report. Overexpression of recombinant GNE in human embryonic kidney (HEK AD293) cells led to an increase in mRNA levels for ST3Gal5 (GM3 synthase) and ST8Sia1 (GD3 synthase) as well as the biosynthetic products of these sialyltransferases, the GM3 and GD3 gangliosides. Conversely, down-regulation of GNE by RNA interference methods had the opposite, but consistent, effect of lowering ST3Gal5 and ST8Sia1 mRNAs and reducing GM3 and GD3 levels. Control experiments ensured that GNE-mediated changes in sialyltransferase expression and ganglioside biosynthesis were not the result of altered flux through the sialic acid pathway. Interestingly, exogenous GM3 and GD3 also changed the expression of GNE and led to reduced ST3Gal5 and ST8Sia1 mRNA levels, demonstrating a reciprocating feedback mechanism where gangliosides regulate upstream biosynthetic enzymes. Cellular responses to the GNE-mediated changes in ST3Gal5 and ST8Sia1 expression and GM3 and GD3 levels were investigated next. Conditions that led to reduced ganglioside production (e.g. short hairpin RNA exposure) stimulated proliferation, whereas conditions that resulted in increased ganglioside levels (e.g. recombinant GNE and exogenous gangliosides) led to reduced proliferation with a concomitant increase in apoptosis. Finally, changes to BiP expression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation consistent with apoptosis and proliferation, respectively, were observed. These results provide examples of specific biochemical pathways, other than sialic acid metabolism, that are influenced by GNE.

These results provide examples of specific biochemical pathways, other than sialic acid metabolism, that are influenced by GNE. Sialic acids, 9-carbon amino-monosaccharides, are ubiquitously displayed on mammalian cell surfaces. These sugars modulate biological and pathological events ranging from development and immune function to tumor biology and the viral and bacterial infection of cells (1Schauer R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Angata K. Fukuda M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Varki A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, factors that influence the biosynthesis of sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates are of great interest due to the ever growing list of cellular functions influenced by this sugar. The biochemical steps that control sialic acid production, outlined in Fig. 1, have been intensely investigated in recent years (4Tanner M.E. Bioorg. Chem. 2005; 33: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with a particular focus given to the bifunctional enzyme UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase (GNE). 2The abbreviations used are: GNE, UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase; HIBM, hereditary inclusion body myopathy; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; siRNA, small interfering RNA; shGNE, short hairpin GNE; RNAi, RNA inhibition; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; rGNE, recombinant GNE; GM1, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GM2, Gal-NAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GM3, Neu5Acα3Galβ4GlcCer; GD3, Neu5Acα8-Neu5Acα3Galβ4GlcCer. Whereas GNE is known to control flux into the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway through conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc (5Hinderlich S. Stäche R. Zeitler R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24313-24318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and has been described as the key determinant in the surface display of sialoglycans (6Keppler O.T. Hinderlich S. Langner J. Schwartz-Albiez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M. Science. 1999; 284: 1372-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the biological activity of this protein and its impact in health and disease remain far from understood. In particular, accumulating evidence that healthy cells maintain higher levels of GNE than required for sialic acid production raises the possibility that GNE may be a “moonlighting” protein that serves multiple functions within a cell (7Jeffery C.J. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 415-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 8Copley S.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that cells have “excess” GNE is based on two human diseases that suffer from single amino acid mutations in this protein. The first, sialuria, is a rare congenital disorder characterized by mutations in the regulatory domain of GNE (9Seppala R. Lehto V.P. Gahl W.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1563-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that alleviate the allosteric feedback inhibition that normally occurs upon binding of the downstream metabolite CMP-Neu5Ac (Fig. 1) (10Weiss P. Tietze F. Gahl W.A. Seppala R. Ashwell G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17635-17636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, GNE-catalyzed conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc greatly increases, and cytosolic levels of sialic acid rise dramatically (by ∼70–200-fold (11Seppala R. Tietze F. Krasnewich D. Weiss P. Ashwell G. Barsh G. Thomas G.H. Packman S. Gahl W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7456-7461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Because this increase occurs without a corresponding change in the copy number of GNE (12Yarema K.J. Goon S. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or an increase in UDP-GlcNAc (the already abundant substrate of this enzyme), it is a reasonable hypothesis that normal cells have the requisite metabolic machinery (i.e. enzymes and small molecule substrates) in place to produce much higher levels of sialic acid than they require. The presence of the large pool of UDP-GlcNAc found in cells can be rationalized by considering the several biochemical pathways that use this compound. For example, UDP-GlcNAc is used as an activated sugar donor for glycosylation (13Chen H. Wang Z. Sun Z. Kim E.J. Yarema K.J. Yarema K.J. Handbook of Carbohydrate Engineering. Francis & Taylor/CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 1-48Crossref Google Scholar); it is converted to a second sugar donor, UDP-GalNAc (13Chen H. Wang Z. Sun Z. Kim E.J. Yarema K.J. Yarema K.J. Handbook of Carbohydrate Engineering. Francis & Taylor/CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL2005: 1-48Crossref Google Scholar); and it is used as a substrate for O-GlcNAc protein modification (14Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Chem.

By contrast, the presence of “excess” GNE, whose enzymatic activity is largely kept quiescent through feedback inhibition in healthy cells, as well as tissue-specific splice variants that have no clear impact on sialic acid production (16Watts G.D.J.

The hypothesis that GNE has cellular functions beyond sialic acid production has been reinforced by sialic acid metabolism in hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), a late onset congenital disorder affecting skeletal muscle. Genetic evidence has linked HIBM to single amino acid mutations (18Eisenberg I. Thiel C. Levi T. Tiram E. Argov Z. Sadeh M. Jackson C.L. Thierfelder L. Mitrani-Rosenbaum S.

These mutations reduce the ability of GNE to convert UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc by as much as 70–90% in cell-free assays (21Nishino I. Noguchi S. Murayama K. Driss A. Sugie K. Oya Y. Nagata T. Chida K.

Contrary to these in vitro findings, which would be expected to translate into reduced sialic acid production by reducing metabolic flux into the biosynthetic pathway for this sugar (Fig. 1), are studies that show that HIBM patients have approximately normal levels of sialic acid (23Hinderlich S. Salama I. Eisenberg I. Potikha T. Mantey L.R. Yarema K.J. Horstkorte R. Argov Z. Sadeh M. Reutter W. Mitrani-Rosenbaum S.

Even if a small subset of glycans crucial for muscle function, such as α-dystroglycan, experience anomalous sialylation in HIBM and are responsible for disease symptoms (25Huizing M. Rakocevic G.

Metab. 2004; 81: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (although evidence also exists to the contrary (26Broccolini A. Gliubizzi C. Pavoni E. Gidaro T. Morosetti R. Sciandra F. Giardina B. Tonali P. Ricci E. Brancaccio A. Mirabella M. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2005; 15: 177-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), it is now clear that overall production of sialic acid is not significantly reduced in this disease. The apparent disconnect between in vitro results and sialic acid production in HIBM patients can be resolved by considering the lesson learned from sialuria that cells have an excess of GNE beyond the amount required to supply flux into the sialic acid pathway. Consequently, it is reasonable to postulate that the “residual” enzymatic activity of GNE in HIBM patients is comparable with healthy cells after CMP-Neu5Ac-mediated feedback inhibition has been considered. These considerations supply a mechanistic explanation for the nearly normal levels of sialic acid found in HIBM patients but leave the biochemical basis of cellular abnormalities found in HIBM unanswered. The hypothesis that GNE has a second role, beyond supplying metabolic flux into the sialic acid pathway, opens the door to the possibility that a defect in this currently unknown activity is responsible for HIBM symptoms. Reports that GNE shuttles to and from parts of the cell not involved in sialic acid metabolism (27Krause S. Hinderlich S. Amsili S. Horstkorte R. Wiendl H. Argov Z. Mitrani-Rosenbaum S. Lochmüller H. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) provide clues to a second cellular role for this protein. In particular, the presence of GNE in the nucleus, where it is not required for ManNAc production, raises the intriguing possibility that this protein regulates gene expression. Accordingly, we investigated whether the role of GNE in sialylation, supplying the metabolic pathway responsible for the synthesis of activated sugar CMP-Neu5Ac, could be augmented by modulating the expression of sialyltransferases, the set of ∼20 biosynthetic enzymes that work in parallel to install terminal Neu5Ac residues onto underlying oligosaccharide structures (Fig. 1). As described in this report, we found that overexpression of recombinant GNE and inhibition of endogenous GNE by RNA inhibition (RNAi) methods influenced the expression of ST3Gal5 (GM3 synthase) and ST8Sia1 (GD3 synthase) and resulted in corresponding changes to the biosynthetic products of these sialyltransferases, the GM3 and GD3 gangliosides. Moreover, the manipulation of GNE had an impact on proliferation and apoptosis consistent with the known cellular effects of these gangliosides. Finally, biochemical mechanisms for the ganglioside-mediated effects of GNE on proliferation and apoptosis were identified and occur, at least in part, through the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, an important element of MAPK signaling pathways and through the BiP-associated unfolded protein response, respectively. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The human epithelial kidney cell line (HEK AD293) was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and was cultured in a 37.0 °C, water-saturated, 5.0% carbon dioxide incubator in medium specified by the ATCC (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the concentration of penicillin/streptomycin specified by the supplier (Sigma). The SK-MEL-28 cell line was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured following published conditions (28Nakano J. Mohan Raj B.K. Asagami C. Lloyd K.O. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). d(+)-Glucosamine also was purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories (Logan, UT). The human embryoid body-derived (hEBD LVEC) line was kindly provided by the Shamblott Laboratory (The Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, Baltimore, MD) and was cultured following published conditions (29Shamblott M.J. Axelman J. Littlefield J.W. Blumenthal P.D. Huggins G.R. Cui Y. Cheng L. Gearhart J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Cloning of GNE and the Construction of Expression Vectors—The GNE gene was amplified by PCR by using primers AAACTCGAGATGG AGAAGAATGGAAATAACC (the XhoI restriction site is underlined) and TTTAAGCTTGTAGATCCTGCCTGTTGTGTAG (HindIII). PCR products were digested by XhoI and HindIII endonuclease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated in-frame into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) with T4 DNA ligase. Plasmids were routinely amplified in the Escherichia coli DH5α strain and isolated from cultures by using the Qiagen Plasmid Spin Midiprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The R266Q and R266W GNE mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis with the mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-GGTTCGAGTGATGCAGAAGAAGGGCATTGAGCA-3′ and 5′-GGTTCGAGTGATGTGGAAGAAGGGCATTGAGCA-3′ for the R266Q and R266W sialuria mutations, respectively (where the site of mutation is underlined) through PCR-like amplification with Pfu polymerase. PCR was performed for 14 cycles by the following program for each cycle: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1.0 min, and extension at 68 °C for 10 min. The parental template was then digested specifically by the restriction enzyme DpnI, which cuts only dammethylated DNA. The nicked plasmid vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), with the desired mutations, was then transfected into E. coli 5α. All mutant constructs were sequenced by the DNA Analysis Facility Finch-Server (The John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Determination of the Sialic Acid Content of GNE-transfected Cells—HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant or wild-type forms of GNE shown in Fig. 3 by the Lipofectamine 2000 method (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were incubated for 24 h to allow expression of GNE. The complete medium (with 5.0% fetal bovine serum) was then replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented with 2.0 mm d(+)-glucosamine. Glucosamine was added to increase metabolic flux through the hexosamine pathway (15Hanover J.A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1865-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), ensuring that a lack of UDP-GlcNAc did not hinder the production of ManNAc (12Yarema K.J. Goon S. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 553-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ManNAc produced by GNE subsequently intercepts the sialic acid pathway (see Fig. 1) and increases total cellular levels of sialic acid; in this study, sialic acid levels were measured by an adaptation of the periodate/resorcinol method (30Jourdian G.W. Dean L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 430-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Jones M.B. Teng H. Rhee J.K. Baskaran G. Lahar N. Yarema K.J. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 85: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In brief, after the cells were incubated with glucosamine for 24 h, they were harvested by trypsinization and counted with a Coulter Z2 instrument. The cells were then washed by pelleting by centrifugation (at 900 × g for 2.0 min) followed by resuspension in 1.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline by repeated, but gentle, pipetting. This step was repeated two times to ensure that residual serum proteins, which are rich in sialoglyconjugates, were removed. The cells were resuspended in 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles. In order to quantify sialic acid, the sample was oxidized by the addition of 5.0 μl of 0.4 m periodic acid followed by incubation on ice for 1.5 h, followed by 15 min of boiling in 500 μl of 6.0% (w/v) resorcinol, 2.5 mm CuSO4, 44% (v/v) concentrated HCl. After cooling, 500 μl of t-butyl alcohol was added to each sample. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 15,700 × g for 5.0 min to pellet insoluble cell debris. Immediately after spinning, the supernatants were decanted into the cuvettes, and optical density readings were taken at 630 nm. Sialic acid concentrations were calculated by comparison of these optical density values with a standard curve generated from known concentrations (0, 5.0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 μm) of sialic acid. Data are expressed in molecules of sialic acid/cell (in all cases, cells were enumerated by Coulter Z2 cell counter analysis before lysis). Chemical reagents used in these assays, including copper sulfate, resorcinol, periodic acid, and hydrochloric acid, were from EM Sciences (Gibbstown, NJ). Real-time PCR Quantification of Gene Expression—The mRNA levels of the sialic acid-processing genes listed in Table 1 were analyzed by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method. In addition, the two housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and β-glucuronidase (32Aerts J.L. Gonzales M.I. Topalian S.L. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 84-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were monitored in each experiment. Primers, also listed in Table 1, were designed by using the Primer3 software (available on the World Wide Web at www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi/) (33Rozen S. Skalesky H.J.

Open table in a new tab The basic protocol followed for qRT-PCR experiments began with the isolation of total RNA from 5.0 × 106 cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or by the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method. RNA quality was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.8% gels run with TAE buffer followed by nucleic acid band visualization under UV illumination after ethidium bromide staining) and quantified by A260/A280 OD readings. RNA integrity was confirmed using 18 S rRNA primers, and samples were standardized based on equal levels of β-actin cDNA. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed in 20 μl of a mixture containing a 2.0-μl cDNA dilution, 1.0 μl (10 pmol/μl) of primers, and 10 μl of 2× SYBR master mix containing Amplitaq Gold DNA polymerase, reaction buffer, a dNTP mixture with dUTP, passive reference, and the SYBR Green I. PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of 2.0 min at 50 °C, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1.0 min. Specific PCR products were detected with the fluorescent double-stranded DNA binding dye, SYBR Green (34Morrison T.B. Weis J.J. Wittwer C.T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24: 954-958PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed in triplicate and replicated in three independent experiments. Gel electrophoresis and melting curve analyses were performed to confirm correct PCR product sizes and the absence of nonspecific bands. The expression levels of each gene were normalized against β-actin using the comparative CT method according to the manufacturer's protocols (75Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Amst.). 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar). Analysis of Cell Surface and Total Levels of GM3 and GD3—The method for the analysis of cell surface GM3 and GD3 expression by flow cytometry was adapted from published protocols (28Nakano J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7825-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, these tests were performed by detaching SK-MEL-28 or GNE-transfected HEK AD293 cells by trypsinization and washing them with washing buffer (1.0% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells (1.0 × 106) were stained with 20 μg/ml of a mouse monoclonal antibody against GM3 (NBT-M101/M102, isotype IgM, clone M2590; Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Affinipure rabbit anti-mouse IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). The same procedure was used for GD3 analysis, except cells were stained with mouse anti-human ganglioside GD3 monoclonal antibody (Product number 371440, clone 110.14F9, isotype IgG3; Calbiochem) diluted 1:50 in washing buffer and detected with a donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to fluorescein (Jackson Immunoresearch). Control samples stained with secondary antibody alone were analyzed in parallel in each experiment. Samples were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer and Cell Quest software (BD Immunocytometry Systems, San Diego, CA), and a minimum of 5000 events were acquired for each sample. Analysis of total (i.e. surface and intracellular) GM3 and GD3 was tested in fixed and permeabilized cells (36Lovat P.E. Di Sano F. Corazzari M. Fazi B. Donnorso R.P. Pearson A.D. Hall A.G. Redfern C.P. Piacentini M. J. Natl.

Wiesehan J.D. Stillwell W. Zaloga G.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, before completing the staining procedure described above, cells were fixed by incubation in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2.0 min at room temperature. Preparation and Transfection of Short Hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA)—GNE-specific and control shRNA expression vectors were produced and purified by using the MessageMuter™ shRNA interference production kit (Epicenter® Biotechnologies, Madison, WI). Three shRNA GNE-specific sequences were selected with the online siMAX™ design tool MWG-Biotech (High Point, NC) and cross-referenced with the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) to ensure that only the GNE gene was targeted. These sequences were 5′-AGATTACATTGTTGCACTA-3′ (shGNE760), 5′-TTAACATTGGATGCACTTA-3′ (shGNE827), and 5′-CCTATGAAGAGAGGATTAA-3′ (shGNE1448) based on GenBank™ NM_005476 nucleotidesequences760–778,827–845, and 1448–1466, respectively.

In addition to these three shRNAs, siRNA targeted against the 760 region of GNE (i.e. the 5′-AGATTACATTGTTGCACTA-3′ sequence) was tested by using sense siRNA GNE 760 5′-AGAUUACAUUGUUGCACUATT-3′ and antisense siRNA GNE760 5′-UAGUGCAACAAUGUAAUCU-3′ (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX).

https://openalex.org/W2042359206,"The p38α MAPK participates in a variety of biological processes. Activation of p38α is mediated by phosphorylation on specific regulatory tyrosine and threonine sites, and the three dual kinases, MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3), MKK4, and MKK6, are known to be the upstream activators of p38α. In addition to activation by upstream kinases, p38α can autoactivate when interacting with transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1-binding protein 1 (TAB1). Here we used MKK3 and MKK6 double knock-out (MKK3/6 DKO) and MKK4/7 DKO mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells to examine activation mechanisms of p38α. We confirmed that the MKK3/6 pathway is a primary mechanism for p38α phosphorylation in MEF cells, and we also showed the presence of other p38α activation pathways. We show that TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation in MEF cells did not need MKK3/4/6, and it accounted for a small portion of the total p38α phosphorylation that was induced by hyperosmolarity and anisomycin. We observed that a portion of peroxynitrite-induced phospho-p38α is associated with an ∼85-kDa disulfide complex in wild-type MEF cells. Peroxynitrite-induced phosphorylation of p38α in the ∼85-kDa complex is independent from MKK3/6 because only phospho-p38α not associated with the disulfide complex was diminished in MKK3/6 DKO cells. In addition, our data suggest interference among different pathways because TAB1 had an inhibitory effect on p38α phosphorylation in the peroxynitrite-induced ∼85-kDa complex. Mutagenesis analysis of the cysteines in p38α revealed that no disulfide bond forms between p38α and other proteins in the ∼85-kDa complex, suggesting it is a p38α binding partner(s) that forms disulfide bonds, which enable it to bind to p38α. Therefore, multiple mechanisms of p38α activation exist that can influence each other, be simultaneously activated by a given stimulus, and/or be selectively used by different stimuli in a cell type-specific manner.

The MAP3Ks are serine/threonine kinases and are often activated through phosphorylation. MAP3K activation leads to the phosphorylation and activation of an MKK, which then stimulates MAPK activity through dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues located in the activation loop of kinase subdomain VIII. Once activated, MAPKs phosphorylate target substrates on serine or threonine residues. It is believed that the substrate selectivity of MAP3K, MKK, and MAPK is conferred by specific interaction motifs located on the kinases and substrates (7Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 8Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In addition, MAPK cascade specificity is also mediated by scaffolding proteins that organize pathways in specific modules through simultaneous binding of several components (9Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although the kinase cascade is the primary activation mechanism of MAPKs, autoactivation of the MAPK p38α is promoted by its interaction with transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 1 (TAB1) or by phosphorylation on Tyr-323 with the tyrosine kinase Zap70 (10Ge B.

To date, however, there is little information regarding whether the multiple mechanisms are simultaneously or individually used by a given stimulus or regarding the contribution of the different pathways. The p38 MAPK group is composed of p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ (13Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 14Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem.

Among the four members, p38α is the most studied, and it has been implicated in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence, and inflammation (13Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 14Nebreda A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem.

Cell Res. 2005; 15: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). p38α activation has been observed in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli, including proinflammatory cytokines, bacterial components, and stress (16Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar, 17Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. David R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). MKK3 and MKK6 are the two main MKKs that are known to activate p38α (18Derijard B. Raingeaud J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). MKK4, an upstream kinase of JNK, can aid in the activation of p38α in cells exposed to various stimuli (18Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 20Brancho D. Tanaka N. Jaeschke A. Ventura J.J. Kelkar N. Tanaka Y. Kyuuma M. Takeshita T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In addition, p38α can also be activated by interaction with TAB1 (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). TAB1 was originally identified as an interacting protein of TAK1 (21Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The interaction between TAB1 and p38α was later independently found by two research groups (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 22Cheung P.C. Campbell D.G. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A splicing variant of TAB1, TAB1β, has also been found to interact only with p38α and not TAK1 (11Ge B. Xiong X. Jing Q. Mosley J.L. Filose A. Bian D. Huang S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2286-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In vitro and co-expression experiments have indicated that the interaction of TAB1 and p38α leads to p38α autophosphorylation on the dual phosphorylation sites in the activation loop (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 11Ge B. Xiong X. Jing Q. Mosley J.L. Filose A. Bian D. Huang S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2286-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). TAB1-dependent p38α activation appears to play a role in injury response during myocardial ischemia (23Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A. Saurin A.T. Jiang J. Heads R.J. Martin J.L. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Marber M.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), monocyte-derived dendritic cell maturation (24Matsuyama W. Faure M. Yoshimura T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3520-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and peripheral T-cell anergy maintenance (25Ohkusu-Tsukada K. Tominaga N. Udono H. Yui K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6957-6966Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On one hand, phosphorylation of TAB1 by p38α has been observed, and negative feedback on TAK1 activation by phosphorylated TAB1 was proposed as a major function of TAB1-p38α interaction (22Cheung P.C. Campbell D.G. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a study using MEF cells generated from MKK3/6 DKO mice ruled out the role of TAB1 in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)- and UV radiation-induced p38α phosphorylation in MEF cells (20Brancho D. Tanaka N. Jaeschke A. Ventura J.J. Kelkar N. Tanaka Y. Kyuuma M. Takeshita T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Therefore, differing opinions exist as to whether MKK-independent p38α phosphorylation occurs. To better understand the relevance of MKK-independent p38α activation, we examined p38α activation in MKK3/6 DKO and MKK4/7 DKO MEF cells. The MKK independence of TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation is supported by our data from MKK3/6 and MKK4/7 DKO MEF cells. We further show that MKK-independent p38α phosphorylation accounts for a small portion of the total p38α phosphorylation induced by some, but not all, of the different ligands in MEF cells. In addition to the role in promoting p38α phosphorylation, we found that TAB1 has an inhibitory effect on peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation that is associated with a disulfide complex. This p38α phosphorylation is likely to be independent from MKK3/6 because MKK3/6 double knock-out mostly eliminated the phosphorylation of p38α that is not associated with the disulfide complex. Our data indicate that, although the kinase cascade is a major mechanism in p38α activation, multiple mechanisms exist and can be simultaneously activated by a single stimulus, and they may coordinately regulate p38α phosphorylation. Reagents—Lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA), and CpG DNA was purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). Peroxynitrite, thapsigargin, and SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. Anisomycin, sorbitol, and anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Mouse TNF was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies against phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, and phospho-ERK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and polyclonal antibodies against p38α, TAB1, and MKK4 were generated from New Zealand White rabbits by stepwise subcutaneous and muscle injections of each of the affinity-purified recombinant proteins. Vectors and RNA Interference—FLAG-tagged p38α, TAB1, or TAB1β was cloned into the vector pcDNA3. The point mutations in p38α were generated with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotides were cloned into the vector pSuper to express short hairpin RNA. The following sequences were targeted: 5′-AGCAGTCCTTCTCAACAGCAAG-3′ for siTAB#1 and 5′-AGGCCCTTCTGTGCAAATCTAC-3′ for siTAB#2. Double-stranded RNA targeting the sequence 5′-AATGCGGAGTAGTGATTGCCCAT-3′ of MKK4 was purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Chicago, IL), and control double-stranded RNA targeting the sequence 5′-ATGATTGATTTGTCAATGGTCCACC-3′ of green fluorescent protein was obtained from Invitrogen. Cell Culture and Transfection—Wild-type, MKK3/6 DKO, or MKK4/7 DKO MEF cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The transfection of expression vectors was done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly MEF cells were freshly seeded to 70% confluence 1 day before transfection. 3-5 μg of total DNA were mixed with 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min before dropwise addition onto the cells. Analysis of transfected gene expression took place 24-48 h later. For the selection of TAB1 knockdown MEF cells, cells were incubated in a medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin and were further cultured for 2 weeks and then pooled. MEF cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000, and then they were incubated for 48 h and subjected to Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin. After centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Non-reducing cell lysate samples were prepared in lysis buffer without dithiothreitol and were mixed with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and were then immunoblotted with antibodies against FLAG, phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK, p38α, TAB1, and MKK4. In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed using recombinant His-tagged p38α as a kinase and myelin basic protein as a substrate as described previously (16Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). TAB1- or TAB1β-mediated Phosphorylation of p38α Occurs in Both Wild-type and MKK3/6 DKO or MKK4/7 DKO MEF Cells—TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation in cells can be seen by co-expression of TAB1 and p38α (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The MKK independence of TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation has been established by the observation that TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation is not inhibited by dominant negative MKKs, and it is dependent on the intrinsic activity of p38α (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). To determine whether TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation in cells is unequivocally independent of MKK3 and MKK6, we co-expressed p38α with TAB1 or TAB1β in MKK3/6 DKO and control wild-type MEF cells. The phosphorylation of p38α was measured by Western blotting with anti-phospho-p38 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, TAB1 and TAB1β enhanced phosphorylation of p38α in both wild-type and MKK3/6 DKO cells. The phosphorylation level of p38α is comparable in wild-type and MKK3/6 DKO cells. To further demonstrate the dependence of TAB1 on p38α phosphorylation in a co-expression assay, we co-transfected p38α expression vector with increased amounts of TAB1β expression vector. We found that the higher the TAB1 dose the higher the level of p38α phosphorylation in MKK3/6 DKO cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, both MKK3 and MKK6 are not involved in TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation. Because MKK4 is known to activate p38α under certain conditions, we examined whether TAB1 can cause p38α phosphorylation in MKK4/7 DKO cells. Co-expression of TAB1β with p38α resulted in p38α phosphorylation in both wild-type and MKK4/7 DKO MEF cells (Fig. 1C). Therefore, TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation in cells is also MKK4-independent. Although TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation was not affected by MKK3/6 or MKK4 knock-out (Fig. 1, A, B, and C), it is still possible that MKK3/6 and MKK4 compensate for each other in these knock-out cells, and thus TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation still requires MKK. To evaluate this possibility, we used siRNA to knock down MKK4 in MKK3/6 DKO cells. Because knockdown of MKK4 in MEF cells by siRNA has been successfully done before (20Brancho D. Tanaka N. Jaeschke A. Ventura J.J. Kelkar N. Tanaka Y. Kyuuma M. Takeshita T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), the same experimental protocol was used here. As shown in Fig. 1D, transfection of siRNA targeting MKK4 (siMKK4) gene expression reduced MKK4 protein levels in the MKK3/6 DKO cells. Reduction of MKK4 in MKK3/6 DKO cells did not affect TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation as determined by co-expression of TAB1β and p38α. Therefore, TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation is independent from MKK3, MKK6, and MKK4. MKK3/6/4-independent p38α Phosphorylation Contributes a Small Portion of the Extracellular Stimuli-induced p38α Phosphorylation in MEF Cells—Because TAB1-mediated p38α phosphorylation requires the intrinsic activity of p38α, inhibition of p38α phosphorylation by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 has been used to dissect MKK-dependent and MKK-independent p38α phosphorylation (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 23Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A. Saurin A.T. Jiang J. Heads R.J. Martin J.L. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Marber M.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Matsuyama W. Faure M. Yoshimura T. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 3520-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Ohkusu-Tsukada K. Tominaga N. Udono H. Yui K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6957-6966Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, there are drawbacks in the drug-based inhibition approach that include a lack of absolute target specificity. To conclusively determine whether MKK-independent p38α phosphorylation is involved in extracellular stimuli-induced p38α activation, we examined p38α phosphorylation in wild-type and MKK3/6 DKO cells in response to different stimuli. As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type MEF cells responded to bacterial lipopolysaccharides and CpG oligonucleotides, to the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, to the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, to the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, to the nitrogen monoxide (NO) producer peroxynitrite, and to hyperosmolarity (0.5 m sorbitol). The level of response in p38α phosphorylation varied considerably among the different stimuli. Lipopolysaccharide- and CpG-induced p38α phosphorylation was barely detectable, but high levels of p38α phosphorylation were detected in thapsigargin-, anisomycin-, peroxynitrite-, and hyperosmolarity (sorbitol)-treated cells. The phosphorylation of p38α was not detected in lipopolysaccharide-, CpG-, TNF-, or thapsigargin-treated MKK3/6 DKO cells, but it was detected in anisomycin-, peroxynitrite-, and sorbitol-treated MKK3/6 DKO cells, albeit the levels of phosphorylation were dramatically reduced. Therefore, in MEF cells, MKK3/6-dependent and MKK3/6-independent p38α activation occurs in parallel in response to a wide range of stimuli. Because MKK4 participates in the activation of p38α under certain conditions, we sought to determine whether MKK4 is involved in anisomycin-, peroxynitrite-, and hyperosmolarity (sorbitol)-induced p38α phosphorylation using MKK4/7 DKO MEF cells. As shown in Fig. 3, MKK4 deletion had no detectable effect on anisomycin-, peroxynitrite-, and hyperosmolarity (sorbitol)-induced p38α phosphorylation in MEF cells, indicating that MKK4 is not involved in or only has a little contribution to these stimuli-induced p38α phosphorylation events. TAB1 Can Both Positively and Negatively Regulate p38α Phosphorylation in a Stimulus-dependent Manner—We next examined whether the MKK-independent p38α phosphorylation shown in Fig. 2 is TAB1-dependent. Because TAB1 knockout cells were not available to us, we used siRNA to knock down TAB1 expression in MEF cells. After testing a number of TAB1-targeting siRNAs, we found two (named siTAB#1 and siTAB#2) that were able to effectively knock down TAB1 expression in MEF cells. DNA sequence analysis (Blastn) indicated that siTAB#1 and siTAB#2 only target TAB1. We stably expressed siTAB#1 or siTAB#2 in MKK3/6 DKO cells and measured TAB1 expression by Western blot analysis. A significant reduction in TAB1 was seen in both siTAB#1- and siTAB#2-expressing MKK3/6 DKO cells (Fig. 4A). We treated control (vector-transfected) and either siTAB#1- or siTAB#2-expressing MKK3/6 DKO cells with anisomycin, peroxynitrite, or sorbitol and then measured p38α phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. More cell lysates and longer exposure times were needed in the Western blot analysis due to the low levels of p38α phosphorylation in MKK3/6 DKO cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, anisomycin- and hyperosmolarity (sorbitol)-induced p38α phosphorylation was reduced in cells expressing TAB1-targeting siRNA, suggesting that anisomycin- and hyperosmolarity (sorbitol)-induced MKK-independent p38α phosphorylation in MEF cells is TAB1-dependent. To our surprise, peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation was not reduced by siTAB#1 and siTAB#2 siRNA, but on the contrary, it was significantly enhanced in both cell lines (Fig. 4B). The same results were obtained when pools of independently transfected cells were used in the experiments, indicating that this is unlikely an observation resulting from variation among individual cell clones or different batches of stably transfected cell lines. Therefore, we concluded that TAB1 has an inhibitory effect on peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation in MKK3/6 DKO cells. Previous studies by us and by others have suggested that peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and heart cells was mediated in part by TAB1 because SB203580 significantly inhibits peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 23Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A. Saurin A.T. Jiang J. Heads R.J. Martin J.L. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Marber M.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Unlike peroxynitrite, sorbitol-induced p38α phosphorylation in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and heart cells cannot be inhibited by SB203580, and anisomycin-induced p38α phosphorylation is only weekly inhibited by SB203580. Like the data obtained in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and heart cells, anisomycin-induced MKK-independent p38α phosphorylation in MEF cells was found to be dependent on TAB1 (Fig. 4B). However, although peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation was not dependent on TAB1 in MKK3/6 DKO MEF cells, sorbitol-induced p38α phosphorylation was (Fig. 4B). To determine whether these differences are due to the different types of cells or the experimental methods used, we used SB203580 to inhibit autophosphorylation-dependent p38α phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 5, SB203580 partially inhibited anisomycin- and sorbitol-induced p38α phosphorylation, but it did not inhibit peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation in either wild-type (Fig. 5A) or MKK3/6 DKO MEF cells (Fig. 5B). Therefore, the results obtained through siRNA knockdown of TAB1 and through the inhibition of p38α autophosphorylation are consistent in MEF cells. Based on published data (10Ge B. Gram H. di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 23Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A. Saurin A.T. Jiang J. Heads R.J. Martin J.L. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Marber M.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and the data shown in Fig. 5, it can be concluded that it is the cell type that determines whether a TAB1-dependent or -independent mechanism is used by peroxynitrite to induce p38α phosphorylation. TAB1 Knockdown in MEF Cells Non-selectively Enhances the Phosphorylation of MAP Kinases in a Ligand-dependent Manner—Next we sought to determine whether the TAB1 knockdown-mediated enhancement of p38α phosphorylation is specific for p38α. MKK3/6 DKO MEF cells expressing siTAB#1 or siTAB#2 were stimulated with peroxynitrite or sorbitol, and the phosphorylation levels of p38α or JNK1/2 were determined by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-p38 and anti-phospho-JNK antibodies, respectively. Like the data shown in Fig. 4B, peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation was found to be much stronger in cells expressing TAB1-targeting siRNA (Fig. 6A). It is important to note that peroxynitrite-induced JNK phosphorylation was also enhanced by TAB1 knockdown (Fig. 6A). In contrast, sorbitol-induced JNK phosphorylation was not affected by TAB1 knockdown. As previously seen in Fig. 4B, sorbitol-induced p38α phosphorylation was inhibited by TAB1 knockdown. We next examined whether TAB1 knockdown affected p38α phosphorylation in wild-type MEF cells. Consistent with the data obtained with MKK3/6 DKO MEF cells, TAB1 knockdown enhanced peroxynitrite-induced p38α phosphorylation (Fig. 6B). Peroxynitrite-induced ERK phosphorylation was also enhanced by TAB1 knockdown. In a manner consistent with the data shown in Fig. 5A, sorbitol-induced p38α phosphorylation was reduced in TAB1 knockdown cells, and sorbitol-induced ERK phosphorylation was not affected by TAB1 knockdown. Therefore, TAB1 inhibits p38α phosphorylation when cells are stimulated with peroxynitrite but not other stimuli such as hyperosmolarity (sorbitol). Furthermore the enhancement of peroxynitrite-induced phosphorylation by TAB1 knockdown is not restricted to p38α. A recent report showed that reactive oxygen species sustain JNK activation by inactivating MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) (26Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The inactivation of MKP-1 by reactive oxygen species is achieved by converting the catalytic cysteine of MKP to sulfenic acid. The increase in oxidized M"
https://openalex.org/W1983160604,"After binding, central nervous system (CNS) myelin-derived axon growth inhibitory ligands, the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR), complexes with LINGO-1 and either the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) or TROY to initiate growth cone collapse via a Rho-A inhibitory signaling pathway and/or Ca(2+)-dependent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through an unknown signaling pathway. We have shown that axon growth through CNS myelin is disinhibited after neurotrophic factor administration by 1) initiating intramembranous proteolysis (RIP) of p75(NTR), leading to cleavage of the extracellular (p75(ECD)) and intracellular domains (p75(ICD)) by alpha- and gamma-secretase, respectively, thereby paralyzing inhibitory signaling; 2) shedding of soluble NgR(ECD), which acts as a competitive antagonist to NgR for binding of inhibitory ligands; and 3) antagonizing NgR/p75(NTR) clustering by competitive p75(ECD)/NgR interaction. Here, we report that TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, ADAM17) induces disinhibition of FGF2-stimulated neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRGN) cultured in the presence of a predetermined concentration of inhibitory CNS myelin-derived ligands. After addition of TACE (which has alpha-secretase activity) to mitotically arrested adult rat mixed DRG cultures, we demonstrate 1) NgR(ECD) shedding; 2) release of p75(ECD) and p75(ICD) by RIP of p75(NTR); 3) blockade of Rho-A activation; 4) reduced EGFR phosphorylation; and 5) increased FGF2-stimulated DRGN neurite outgrowth and branching in the presence of CNS myelin-derived inhibitory ligands. Thus, TACE-induced cleavage of NgR and RIP of p75(NTR) abrogates axon growth inhibitory signaling, thereby disinhibiting CNS axon/neurite growth."

Low energy states activate the intracellular energy sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation by the AMP mimetic AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside) has been shown to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis. We used transcriptional profiling to search for AICAR-regulated genes in hepatocyte cell lines. We report that a dual specificity phosphatase, Dusp4, is induced by AMPK in AML12, H4IIE, and Fao cells at both mRNA and protein levels. AMPK also induces the immediate early transcription factor Egr1 (early growth response 1), a known transcriptional activator of Dusp4, and it directly binds the Dusp4 promoter at its known binding site. Both reporter gene assays and real time PCR demonstrate that exogenous DUSP4 inhibits the promoter activity and expression of both glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-P) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pepck) to an extent similar to both AICAR and constitutively active AMPK. Conversely, depletion of EGR1 or DUSP4 using siRNA not only partially abrogates the inhibition of Pepck expression by AICAR, but also importantly affects glucose production by Fao cells. In Fao cells, small interfering RNA targeted EGR1 also depletes DUSP4 expression following treatment with AICAR, further supporting a direct link between EGR1 and DUSP4 activation. Expression of a constitutively active form of p38, a known effector of cAMP-mediated gluconeogenesis, rescues the DUSP4-mediated repression of PEPCK. These results suggest that the inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by AMPK may, in part, be mediated by an immediate early gene response involving EGR1 and its target, DUSP4.

Understanding the pathways that maintain proper glucose homeostasis is a central focus of discovery efforts for treatments of Type 2 diabetes that now affects over 20 million Americans, with levels increasing at 6% a year (1Moller D.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 2Stein C.J. Colditz G.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 89: 2522-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Proper glucose homeostasis requires a balance between glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and production by the liver. Type 2 diabetic patients lose this balance due to a reduction of glucose uptake during the fed state, as well as improper fasting gluconeogenesis by the liver. During the fasted state, glucagon secretion by the pancreas and resulting cAMP-mediated signaling through CREB, 2The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; AMPK, AMP-activated kinase; DUSP, dual specificity phosphatase; EGR1, early growth response 1; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Glc-6-P, glucose-6-phosphatase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; CA-AMPK, constitutively active AMP-activated kinase; HA, influenza hemagglutin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; siRNA, small interfering RNA.2The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; AMPK, AMP-activated kinase; DUSP, dual specificity phosphatase; EGR1, early growth response 1; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Glc-6-P, glucose-6-phosphatase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HNF, hepatic nuclear factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; CA-AMPK, constitutively active AMP-activated kinase; HA, influenza hemagglutin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescent protein; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; siRNA, small interfering RNA. as well as glucocorticoid release, results in gluconeogenic gene transcription. In the fed state this transcriptional program is suppressed by insulin signaling due to repression of the nuclear hormone receptor co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α, which is necessary for CREB-mediated transcription. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (Glc-6-P) are two rate-limiting enzymes for gluconeogenesis that are transcriptionally regulated by glucagon and insulin, and are widely used as markers for gluconeogenesis (3Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Due to the important role of dysregulated gluconeogenesis in the pathology of Type 2 diabetes, further insight into the mechanisms of repression of these genes by insulin-independent mechanisms could lead to treatments of insulin-resistant individuals (4Wu C. Okar D.A. Kang J. Lange A.J. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Disord. 2005; 5: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Activation of AMPK (AMP-activated kinase) is one insulin independent means of gluconeogenesis repression. AMPK has been termed a “master switch” of cellular energy status, being highly conserved from simple eukaryotes to humans. In mammalian systems it is activated in multiple organs during conditions that cause a low ATP/AMP ratio. These include exercise and starvation on the whole body level as well as many cellular stresses such as glucose deprivation, oxidative stress, ischemia, and exposure to metabolic poisons that inhibit ATP synthesis (5Hardie D.G. Scott J.W. Pan D.A. Hudson E.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 6Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). When activated, AMPK switches on ATP generating processes and switches off those that consume ATP. Both in vivo and in vitro studies support that AMPK activation inhibits gluconeogenesis (7Foretz M.

Sutherland C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat hepatoma cells or primary hepatocytes with the AMPK activator AICAR inhibits transcription of the Glc-6-P and Pepck genes (8Lochhead P.A. Salt I.P. Walker K.S. Hardie D.G. Sutherland C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In vivo, activation of AMPK in the livers of fasted mice has been shown to reduce glucose production (9Vincent M.F. Erion M.D. Gruber H.E. Van den Berghe G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1148-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and gluconeogenic gene expression (10Foretz M. Ancellin N. Andreelli F. Saintillan Y. Grondin P. Kahn A. Thorens B. Vaulont S. Viollet B. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1331-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Additionally, AMPK has been suggested to mediate the beneficial and detrimental effects of adiponectin and resistin, respectively, on hepatic glucose output (11Muse E.D. Obici S. Bhanot S. Monia B.P.

Recently this has been supported by the finding that genetic deletion of the AMPK α2 isoform in the mouse liver leads to glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia in the fasted state, which could be reversed by insulin. Yet, these animals were resistant to regulation of glucose production by the AMPK activators leptin and adiponectin (13Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar, 14Andreelli F. Foretz M. Knauf C. Cani P.D. Perrin C. Iglesias M.A. Pillot B. Bado A. Tronche F.

AMPK achieves its downstream effects by immediate direct phosphorylation of enzyme substrates as well as long-term effects on gene expression. For example, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, resulting in a suppression of the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The lower levels of malonyl-CoA allows entry of fatty acids into the mitochondria and their subsequent oxidation (15Winder W.W. Wilson H.A. Hardie D.G. Rasmussen B.B. Hutber C.A. Call G.B.

Biochem. 1988; 175: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Other direct targets that can be phosphorylated by AMPK include glycogen synthase, IRS-1, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (17Jorgensen S.B. Nielsen J.N. Birk J.B. Olsen G.S. Viollet B.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2439-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The effects of AMPK on gene expression, and the role of the target genes in mediating the physiological effects of AMPK activation are much less well understood, although it has been shown that AMPK activation decreases HNF-4 expression levels leading to repression of its target genes including HNF-1α, GLUT2, and L-type pyruvate kinase (20Hong Y.H. Varanasi U.S. Yang W. Leff T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27495-27501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this study we systematically examined the gene expression changes caused by AMPK activation in hepatocytes, and evaluated the possible role of some of these in repression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Utilizing transcriptional profiling we identified the immediate early response transcription factor early growth response 1 (Egr1) and the dual specificity phosphatase 4 (Dusp4) as transcriptional targets of AMPK that are necessary for its ability to fully repress glucose production. Additionally, our data suggests a link between the p38 MAP kinase and DUSP4 in regulating gluconeogenesis. Gene Expression Profiling—Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized starting with 5 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript System (Invitrogen). The cDNA was purified by filtration through Multiscreen filter plate (Millipore), and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase (Epicenter, Madison, WI) and biotinylated nucleotides (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization buffer containing the spike pool reagent was added to each of the fragmented cRNA mixtures and each sample was hybridized to the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array or Rat Genome 230 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) at 45 °C for 18 h as recommended by the manufacturer. The hybridized chips were washed and stained using Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and the EukGE-WS2v4_450 protocol as recommended by the manufacturer. The staining was performed using streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), followed by biotinylated antibody against streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and then streptavidin-phycoerythrin. The chips were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip Scanner and .cel files were generated with Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0) software. Cell Culture—The rat hepatoma cell lines H4IIE and Fao were cultured in DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum and RPMI1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. AML12 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 5 ng/ml selenium, and 40 ng/ml dexamethasone. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—To cross-link protein and DNA, formaldehyde was added at a 1% (v/v) concentration to H4IIE cells in a 100-mm dish. Fixation proceeded for 10 min at room temperature with gentle shaking and was stopped with the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m, and then the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell pellet was lysed with immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of aprotinin/ml, 10 μg of leupeptin/ml)) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The resulting lysate was sonicated to give chromatin of an average length of 600 to 1,000 bp. The lysate was then microcentrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysate was then precleared with 50 μl of protein A beads (IPA 400; Repligen) for 15 min. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight with 2 μg of antibody in a total volume of 500 μl at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A beads were then added to the lysates and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), and 4 times with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid). The immune complexes were eluted twice in 200 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) for 15 min. A 1-μl aliquot of high concentration RNase was added, and the NaCl concentration was adjusted to 0.3 m. Samples were then incubated at 67 °C for 5 h to reverse cross-links. Two volumes of ethanol were added for overnight precipitation at -20 °C. The resulting pellets were collected, air dried, and resuspended in 100 μl of TE. Twenty-five microliters of 5× PK buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 25 mm EDTA, 1.25% SDS) was added with 1 μl of proteinase K. The samples were digested at 45 °C for 2 h. 175 μl of TE was then added. The DNA was purified by standard phenol-chloroform and chloroform extractions and precipitated with 0.3 m NaCl, 5 μg of glycogen carrier, and 2 volumes of ethanol for overnight precipitation at -20 °C. The purified DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of water. A 5-μl aliquot was analyzed by PCR with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). For the rat Dusp4 promoter, the sequence to be amplified resides at positions -72 to -264 for which the PCR primer sequences were: 5′-GGCGGCTCCATTCACAAAGTCCG-3′ and 5′-CCGACTCTTGAATGGAGCGCCG-3′ and positions -1310 to -1528 for which the primers were: 5′-AAGAAACGCAGTGCCATTTTGGAACC-3′ and 5′-CGCTTAAACCCTCTCTCCACTCAGTT-3′. Western Blots—Lysates were prepared with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 μg of leupeptin/ml. 20 μg of lysate for each sample was run on NuPAGE 10% polyacrylamide bis-tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Following blocking with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, anti-DUSP4 (SC-1200, Santa Cruz) was blotted in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween at 1:300, anti-EGR1 (SC-110, Santa Cruz) at 1:1000, p38 and phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000, AMPKα (Cell Signaling Technology), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-ACC (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-α-tubulin (Abcam) at 1:2000. Goat anti-mouse and rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used at 1:5000 and blots were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). TaqMan Real Time Quantitative PCR—RNA was isolated and purified from H4IIE cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dusp4, Egr1, Pepck, and Glc-6-P mRNA levels were measured by TaqMan real time quantitative PCR using Assay-on-Demand TaqMan reagents (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan was performed in an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Adenoviruses—cDNA expressing human CA-AMPK (α2312(T172D) (21Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar)), GFP, and human DUSP4 were subcloned into pAdori1-3 (22Kotlyarov A. Yannoni Y. Fritz S. Laass K. Telliez J.B. Pitman D. Lin L.L. Gaestel M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4827-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Each pAdori1-3 cDNA-expressing plasmid was digested with AscI and BstZ17I and the fragment containing cDNA inserts and adenoviral genomic sequence was isolated. Recombinant adenoviral genomic DNA was linearized with PacI. The pAdori1-3 DNA fragment was co-transfected with adenoviral genomic DNA into early passage 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Ten to 14 days post-transfection, the recombinant adenovirus was harvested and subjected to another two rounds of amplification in 293 cells. The resulting virus was used to infect 293 cells at a large scale followed by purification by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation (Viraquest, North Liberty, IA). Reporter Assays—The rat Pepck promoter (-548 to +73) was amplified from rat genomic DNA using primers 5′-GCCTCGAGCTCGAGTCCAGCAGACACCTAGTGGG-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCTTAAGCTTTCTCGCCGGATTTCCCCTGTTC-3′ (23Xu H. Dembski M. Yang Q. Yang D. Moriarty A. Tayber O. Chen H. Kapeller R. Tartaglia L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30187-30192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The human Glc-6-P promoter (-1227 to +57) was amplified from human genomic DNA using primers: 5′-GCCTCGAGCTCGAGTGAGCTCAGGAATTCAAGACC-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCTTAAGCTTAGATGTCAGCAGAGCCCTTGC-3′. The promoters were subsequently cloned into XhoI and HindIII sites of pSEAP-BASIC vector (Clontech). pSEAP2-control, for which SEAP expression is regulated by the SV40 early promoter, was used as a negative control. H4IIE cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected at 90% confluence using Tfx-50 Reagent (Promega). 0.9 μg of each SEAP reporter and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (BD Biosciences) were included. 0.4 μg of pCMV-XL5-human-DUSP4 (NM_001394, Origene), pCMV-Sport6-human EGR1 (BC073983, Open Biosystems), pMEV2HA-P38α-WT and P38α-EE (Biomyx), or empty pCMV-Sport6 were included. SiGenome SMARTpool reagents were included at 25 nm. 24 h post-transfection cells were starved for 5 h in DMEM with 0.5% FBS followed by treatment with 200 μl of DMEM with 0.1% FBS with 100 μm cAMP (Calbiochem) and dexamethasone (Sigma) and/or 500 μm AICAR for 3 h. 60 μl of the media was utilized for the SEAP assay (Great EscAPe SEAP Kit, BD Biosciences) and cell lysate was used for the β-galactosidase assay (Luminescent β-galactosidase detection kit, BD Biosciences). Data were presented as relative SEAP activity with β-galactosidase activity as a transfection control. Glucose Output—1 million Fao cells were transfected with siGenome SMARTpool reagents for EGR1 (number M-100247-00), DUSP4 (number M-098966-00), or siCONTROL Non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon) using OPTI-fect (Invitrogen) at 25 nm final concentration. 24 h post-transfection cells were washed once with RPMI1640 and incubated in RPMI1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma catalog D1881), and 1 mm cAMP (Calbiochem catalog 28745) for 16 h with and without 500 μm AICAR. Cells were then incubated in 0.35 ml (per well) of phenol red-free, glucose-free DMEM containing 2 mm pyruvate and 20 mm lactate containing dexamethasone and cAMP with or without AICAR as indicated in the figure legends. Media were collected 5 h later and subjected to glucose measurement using the Amplex® Red Glucose/Glucose Oxidase Assay Kit (Molecular Probes). Cells were lysed and protein concentration was determined. The glucose output rate was normalized by cellular protein concentration and expressed as micrograms of glucose/mg of protein/5 h. Untreated output of samples was set to 1 and the data were presented as glucose output relative to the untreated samples. Identification of Transcripts Significantly Regulated by AICAR in Hepatocytes—To identify transcriptional targets of activated AMPK in hepatocytes, with a goal of further understanding its role in negatively regulating gluconeogenesis, the mouse hepatoma cell line AML12 was treated with 500 μm AICAR for 2, 6, or 24 h in triplicate. Processed RNA was hybridized on the Affymetrix MOE430 2.0 array, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using normalized data, after removing lowly expressed genes, we performed an analysis of variance. Qualifiers that were induced or repressed in a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) way at all three time points between AICAR and vehicle treated samples were identified. The expression patterns of these 43 qualifiers are represented in Fig. 1. Among the qualifiers that increased with greatest significance upon AICAR treatment were Dusp4 and the zinc finger transcription factor Egr1. The normalized frequency of each of these qualifiers at each time point with and without AICAR treatment is also shown in Fig. 1. Dusp4 message increased 3-, 6-, and 5-fold over the time course relative to untreated controls with the highest individual expression occurring at 6 h of treatment. Egr1 increased 3-fold at 2 and 6 h of treatment relative to control and 2-fold at 24 h. AICAR treatment was also performed over the time course period on the H4IIE rat hepatoma line. Total RNA was isolated from these cells and hybridized on the RAE430 2.0 array and analyzed in the same manner as the AML12 cells. The number of qualifiers changing was much more robust with treatment of these cells. Using similar filtering conditions as described above, the expression of 54 qualifiers were induced or repressed in a statistically significant (p ≤ 1 × 10-4 versus p ≤ 0.05) manner at every time point when comparing AICAR versus vehicle treated samples. The normalized frequency of Egr1 over the time course of this experiment is shown in Fig. 2A. Expression increased 32-, 7.5-, and 3-fold relative to time matched controls at 2, 6, and 24 h of treatment. To further investigate the time course of EGR1 induction with AICAR treatment an anti-EGR1 Western blot was performed at time points ranging from 10 min of treatment up to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2B, EGR1 expression increases as early as 20 min of treatment, increasing up to 6 h, and slightly decreasing by 24 h. DUSP4 expression also increased with AICAR treatment in H4IIE cells. Fig. 2C shows the results of a TaqMan real time PCR analysis of Dusp4 mRNA levels following 2, 6, and 24 h of treatment of H4IIE cells. TaqMan was utilized because the Dusp4 probe set on the RAE430 2.0 array was not as sensitive as the Dusp4 probe set on the MOE430 2.0 array. DUSP4 message was increased 20-fold at 2 h of treatment, and 4-fold at both 6 and 24 h of treatment. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D) showed an increase of DUSP4 protein at 2 and 6 h and at 12-h levels were similar to no treatment. The 500 μm AICAR treatment did activate AMPK as ACC was phosphorylated at 2, 6, and 24 h of treatment (Fig. 2E). To confirm that AMPK activation resulted in Dusp4 and Egr1 transcription an adenovirus expressing constitutively active AMPKα2 (CA-AMPK), which is truncated to 312 residues and contains an activating mutation (T172D), was created (21Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that 24 and 48 h of infection of H4IIE cells with CA-AMPK adenovirus at multiplicity of infection of 100, resulted in a 10- and 8-fold increase, respectively, in Egr1 mRNA, as determined by TaqMan, while infection with GFP expressing adenovirus had little effect. Similarly, Dusp4 mRNA was strongly induced by CA-AMPK expression, as it was induced by 46- and 200-fold after 24 and 48 h of expression, respectively. The Western blots of Fig. 3C show that the CA-AMPK mutant was both expressed by the virus and was active at 24 and 48 h as ACC was phosphorylated at these times. The results of Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that activation of AMPK either through 500 μm AICAR treatment or expression of a constitutively active mutant both increase the expression of EGR1 and DUSP4. Dusp4 was previously identified as a transcriptional target of the immediate early transcription factor EGR1 in response to gonadotropin releasing hormone in pituitary cells (24Zhang T. Wolfe M.W. Roberson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45604-45613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Upon treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, EGR1 bound and activated the Dusp4 promoter. To test whether EGR1 bound the Dusp4 promoter in AICAR-treated H4IIE cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Fig. 4A shows a schematic of the DUSP4 promoter including the reported EGR1 site and putative binding sites of other transcription factors. The EGR1 site identified as a response element during gonadotropin-releasing hormone signaling is located 119 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site. Primers were designed to amplify this site and PCR was performed on DNA following immunoprecipitation of EGR1 protein-DNA complexes after AICAR treatment for either 2 or 6 h. As shown in Fig. 4B, only upon AICAR treatment and immunoprecipitation with anti-EGR1 antibodies (not anti-VP16 as a nonspecific antibody) was the EGR1 site amplified, as identified by the presence of a 189-bp PCR product. The results shown in Fig. 4C show that the region of the Dusp4 promoter containing the site identified in Fig. 4B is specific as an upstream sequence of the promoter, including -1528 to -1310 that does not contain an EGR1 site, was not immunoprecipitated by anti-EGR1 antibodies following AICAR treatment. These results show that both Egr1 and Dusp4 are induced within 2 h of AICAR treatment (Egr1 within 20 min), and that EGR1 specifically occupies an element of the Dusp4 promoter previously shown to be necessary for its activation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone. EGR1 and DUSP4 Inhibit Gluconeogenic Gene Transcription— Activation of AMPK via AICAR inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis through inhibition of the transcription of the rate-limiting enzymes Pepck and Glc-6-P (8Lochhead P.A. Salt I.P. Walker K.S. Hardie D.G. Sutherland C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To determine whether EGR1 and DUSP4 are effectors of AICAR-mediated inhibition of Pepck and Glc-6-P, reporter assays were utilized. The rat PEPCK promoter (-548 to +73) was cloned into a secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter (pSEAP-Basic, Promega) and the effects of altering DUSP4 or EGR1 expression levels on this reporter were determined in transient transfection assays. As has been previously reported, we found that treatment of H4IIE cells with 500 μm AICAR inhibits the cAMP and dexamethasone-induced activation of the Pepck promoter (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, overexpression of DUSP4 in H4IIE cells inhibited the cAMP and dexamethasone activation of the Pepck promoter almost as potently as AICAR (from ∼36-fold inhibition with AICAR to 6-fold with DUSP4 (p ≤ 0.01)), suggesting that upregulation of DUSP4 alone could mediate the effects of AICAR on PEPCK transcription. Additionally, depletion of DUSP4 via RNA interference using a siRNA smart pool (a mix of 4 individual DUSP4 targeting siRNA molecules) impaired the ability of AICAR to completely inhibit Pepck transcription (Fig. 5A). A control smart pool of non-targeting siRNA had an insignificant effect on the a"

To determine whether β2-linked sialic acids similarly impact Nav gating, we co-expressed β2 with Nav1.5 or Nav1.2 in Pro5 (complete sialylation) and in Lec2 (essentially no sialylation) cells. β2 sialic acids caused a significant hyperpolarizing shift in Nav1.5 voltage-dependent gating, thus describing for the first time an effect of β2 on Nav1.5 gating.

The β2 subunit is predicted to have a single transmembrane-spanning domain, a small intracellular domain, and a large extracellular N-terminal end that contains three potential N-glycosylation sites and an immunoglobulin-like fold that shows similarity to the neural cell adhesion molecule, contactin (11Isom L.L.

The external portion of β2 is responsible for efficient association with the α subunit via disulfide bonds (28Messner D.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

In general, β2 caused a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and/or inactivation of Nav1.2 and Nav1.8 but was reported to not affect the channel properties of Nav1.3 or Nav1.5 (14Qu Y.

The loss of β2 resulted in hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons isolated from mice lacking functional β2 (34Chen C. Bharucha V. Chen Y. Westenbroek R.E. Brown A. Malhotra J.D. Jones D. Avery C. Gillespie III, P.J. Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Kazarinova-Noyes K. Shrager P. Saunders T.L. Macdonald R.L. Ransom B.R.

Thus, β2 is an important modulator of several Nav isoforms expressed in cardiac and neuronal tissues. Here, we wished to determine whether β2 SA are involved in modulating Nav gating. We also wished to determine whether the SA-dependent effects of β2, if any, were additive with those recently observed for β1 sialic acids (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To this end, we expressed two different Nav α subunit isoforms, Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 (central nervous system and cardiac isoforms, respectively) in the presence or absence of β2 in two Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that differ in their ability to sialylate proteins (35Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 36Stanley P. Mol. Cell.

The Pro5 cell line allows normal Chinese hamster ovary cell sialylation, whereas Lec2 cells, which are deficient in the CMP-sialic acid transporter, produce proteins that are essentially nonsialylated and thus can act as a model for an inherited disorder resulting in glycoproteins with deficient levels of sialic acids attached, carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome (CDGS), type IIf (38Martinez-Duncker I.

Our data indicate that β2 modulates Nav gating through SA-dependent and SA-independent mechanisms; the exact mechanism is determined by the α subunit with which it associates. In addition, we show that the SA-dependent effects of β1 on a specific α subunit are apparently additive with the SA-dependent and SA-independent effects of β2 on that α subunit. Clones—Nav1.2, Nav1.5, and green fluorescent protein have been described previously (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The hβ1 and hβ2 cDNAs were subcloned into the bicistronic vectors, pIRES-DsRed2 and pIRES2-EGFP, respectively. This was done to verify the expression of each β subunit through fluorescence. The β2 subunit was mutated similarly to that described previously for β1 subunit mutagenesis (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Specifically, each asparagine that initiates a potential N-glycosylation site (Asn42, Asn66, and Asn74) was changed to a glutamine residue to create the deglycosylated mutant, β2-ΔN. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—Pro5 and Lec2 cells were grown as previously described (21Bennett E.S. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Johnson D.

Transfections involving only α and β1 were carried out as previously described (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol.

Transfections involving α and β2 were performed using 2.2 μg of DNA (91% α sodium channel, 9% hβ2 vector cDNAs). Triple transfections of α, β1, and β2 were performed using a total of 2.5 μg of DNA (80% α sodium channel, 12% hβ1, and 8% hβ2 vector cDNAs). The experiments were performed 72 h post-transfection. Whole Cell Recording and Data Analysis—INa were recorded at room temperature (∼22 °C) using established whole cell patch clamp techniques, pulse protocols, data analyses, and solutions as previously described (20Bennett E.

Although series resistance was compensated 95–98% for all data, the smaller current produced using the low sodium solutions further minimized any remaining series resistance error, resulting in <1 mV error. All of the data shown are recorded at least 5 min after attaining whole cell configuration to ensure complete dialysis of the intracellular solution. All of the solutions were filtered using Gelman 0.2-μm filters immediately prior to use. β2 Has Opposing Effects on Gating of two Nav α Subunit Isoforms—To determine whether modulation of Nav1.2 and/or Nav1.5 by β2 is dependent on the presence of β2 sialic acids, Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 were individually co-expressed with β2 in the fully sialylating Pro5 and essentially nonsialylating Lec2 cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1, co-expression of β2 with Nav1.5 in the fully sialylating Pro5 cell line caused a generalized hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependent gating. Specifically, steady state activation (Fig. 1A) and the kinetics of fast inactivation (Fig. 1C) and recovery from fast inactivation (Fig. 1D) all were shifted similarly (∼8 mV) to the left along the voltage axis. Note that β2 had no significant effect on steady state inactivation (Fig. 1B). When β2 and Nav1.5 were co-expressed in the essentially nonsialylating Lec2 cell line, β2 had no measurable effect on Nav1.5 gating. That is, all steady state and kinetic gating characteristics measured for the nonsialylated Nav1.5·β2 complex were nearly identical to gating characteristics of Nav1.5 alone with or without attached sialic acids (Fig. 1). These data suggest that all gating effects of β2 on Nav1.5 can be assigned to β2 sialic acids and represent, to our knowledge, the first time that a gating effect of β2 on Nav1.5 was observed. Similar questions were asked for the effect of β2 on Nav1.2 gating, with very different results. β2 caused a uniform depolarizing shift (∼7 mV) in all four measured gating characteristics (Fig. 2). Gating of the Nav1.2·β2 complex was nearly identical as expressed in Pro5 or in Lec2 cells, indicating that the β2-induced depolarizing shift in Nav1.2 gating was not dependent on β2 sialic acids. Thus, β2 had opposing effects on the gating of two different Nav α subunits. There were only modest and inconsistent effects of β2 on the slope factors for steady state activation or inactivation relationships (Ka and Ki, respectively), indicating that the β2 has little to no impact on the effective gating valence for Nav1.2 or Nav1.5. In addition, we did not observe a significant effect on peak conductance values in any condition except when Nav1.5 was expressed with β2 alone.

Open table in a new tab N-linked Sialic Acids Attached to β2 Fully Account for Effects of β2 on Nav1.5 Gating but Have No Impact on Nav1.2 Gating—To determine whether the SA-dependent effects of β2 on Nav1.5 gating were limited to N-linked sialic acids, a deglycosylated mutant β2 was constructed in which each asparagine residue that initiates an N-glycosylation consensus sequence was mutated to a glutamine residue (β2-ΔN). We co-expressed β2-ΔN with Nav1.5 or Nav1.2 in the fully sialylating Pro5 cells and compared channel gating to the α subunit alone and to the α·β2 channel complex (Fig. 3). Note that the deglycosylated β2-ΔN had no effect on Nav1.5 gating (3A). The data shown in Fig. 3B show that β2-ΔN and wild type β2 modulate Nav1.2 gating nearly identically and thereby suggest that β2-ΔN likely still interacts with Nav α subunits. Together, these data support the conclusion that N-linked sialic acids fully account for the gating effects of β2 on Nav1.5, whereas β2 N-linked sugars are not involved in the effects of β2 on Nav1.2 gating. The Effects of β1 and β2 on Nav Gating Are Apparently Additive—Sodium channel α subunits often associate with more than one auxiliary subunit. For example, Nav1.2, β1, and β2 are expressed at the same time in granule cells of the cerebellum (for reviews see Refs. 9Goldin A.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 871-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar and 39Schaller K.L. Caldwell J.H. Cerebellum. 2003; 2: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that β1 induced similar, uniform, SA-dependent hyperpolarizing shifts in Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 gating (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To determine whether the SA-dependent effects of β1 were apparently additive with the α subunit-specific, SA-dependent and SA-independent effects of β2, α (Nav1.2 or Nav1.5) ± β1 ± β2 subunits were expressed in Pro5 and in Lec2 cells. Co-expression of Nav1.5 with β1 and β2 in Pro5 cells caused a generalized hyperpolarizing shift (∼15 mV) in Nav1.5 gating significantly greater than that induced by β1 or β2 alone (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). However, under fully sialylating conditions, steady state inactivation curves (Fig. 4B) were shifted negatively to potentials similar to those observed for the Nav1.5·β1 complex (by ∼9 mV), consistent with the previous data indicating that β2 had no measurable effect on Nav1.5 channel availability (Fig. 1B). Gating of all channel complexes studied (i.e. Nav1.5 alone, Nav1.5·β1, Nav1.5·β2, and Nav1.5·β1·β2) behaved similarly under conditions of reduced sialylation. That is, neither β1 nor β2 modulated Nav1.5 gating in the absence of sialic acids regardless of the combination of subunits. Thus, the gating effects of β1 and β2 on Nav1.5 are SA-dependent and apparently additive and independent. The measured gating parameters for Nav1.5 ± β1 ± β2 ± SA are represented graphically in Fig. 6 and listed in Table 1. Note the apparent additive effects of β1 and β2 sialic acids on these values. Further, note that under conditions of reduced sialylation, there are no significant differences in gating parameter values among the channel complexes studied. Steady state and kinetic gating of Nav1.2 co-expressed with β1 and β2 in Pro5 cells were similar to gating of Nav1.2 alone (Fig. 5). In the presence of full sialylation, the opposing effects of the two β subunits on Nav1.2 gating essentially balanced one another, resulting in an apparent trimeric channel complex that gates similarly to that of the α subunit alone. When sialylation was reduced, the β1 subunit no longer impacted Nav1.2 gating, whereas the effect of β2 was left intact. Thus, the nonsialylated Nav1.2·β1·β2 channel complex gated at more depolarized potentials. The calculated gating parameter values for Nav1.2 ± β1 ± β2 ± SA are shown in Fig. 6 and listed in Table 1. Note the consistent (among gating parameters) spectrum of effects that are dependent on the combination of β subunits and sialylation conditions. The data shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6 demonstrate that modulation of different Nav α subunit isoforms by multiple β subunits in conditions of varied post-translational modification is a complex process that results in multiple functional phenotypes depending on the combination of subunits expressed by the cell and the degree to which each subunit is glycosylated/sialylated. β2 Has Multiple Mechanisms of Action That Are Dependent on the α Subunit with Which It Associates—Previous work has demonstrated that β1 has essentially uniform SA-dependent effects on the gating of several Nav isoforms, including the adult brain (Nav1.2) and cardiac (Nav1.5) isoforms (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we show that β2, unlike β1, has opposing effects on the gating of Nav1.2 and Nav1.5. Two different mechanisms can explain these opposing isoform-specific effects, an SA-dependent and an SA-independent mechanism. Co-expression of β2 induced a depolarizing shift in Nav1.2 gating (Fig. 2). This effect is in general agreement with the observations of Chen and co-workers (34Chen C. Bharucha V. Chen Y. Westenbroek R.E. Brown A. Malhotra J.D. Jones D. Avery C. Gillespie III, P.J. Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Kazarinova-Noyes K. Shrager P. Saunders T.L. Macdonald R.L. Ransom B.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Isom L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17072-17077Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the voltage dependence of inactivation for INa of hippocampal neurons isolated from mice lacking β2 was shifted in the negative direction compared with mice expressing β2 (34Chen C. Bharucha V. Chen Y. Westenbroek R.E. Brown A. Malhotra J.D. Jones D. Avery C. Gillespie III, P.J. Kazen-Gillespie K.A. Kazarinova-Noyes K. Shrager P. Saunders T.L. Macdonald R.L. Ransom B.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Isom L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17072-17077Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Studies of Nav1.2·β2 expressed in HEK cells demonstrated that β2 could positively shift the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation (14Qu Y. Curtis R. Lawson D. Gilbride K. Ge P. DiStefano P.S. Silos-Santiago I. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2001; 18: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, here we show that β2 slows the rate of inactivation and increases the rate of recovery from fast inactivation. That is, we find that β2 caused all measured voltage-dependent gating parameters for Nav1.2 to shift in the depolarized direction essentially along the voltage axis. When sialylation or N-glycosylation was prevented, β2 still modulated Nav1.2 gating nearly identically to its effect under fully sialylated conditions (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, the effects of β2 on the gating of Nav1.2 appear to be entirely SA-independent (in this cellular system). These effects are opposite to those we previously described for β1 modulation of Nav1.2 in this system. We showed that β1 shifted the gating parameters of Nav1.2 in the hyperpolarized direction and was entirely dependent on β1 sialic acids (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Together these studies demonstrate the specific and alternative modes of action of two different auxiliary subunits on gating of a specific Nav α subunit. In contrast, β2 caused a generalized hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of Nav1.5 gating but had no significant effect on steady state inactivation (Fig. 1). This effect was entirely SA-dependent, because β2 could not modulate Nav1.5 gating in the absence of sialic acids. Although the effect on steady state inactivation was not statistically significant, it may be a real, albeit small, SA-dependent shift in half-inactivation voltage. The reasons for this possibility include: 1) all of the other parameters measured are shifted to more negative potentials by sialic acids and 2) the mean value of the half-inactivation voltage for Nav1.5+β2 does shift by ∼4 mV in the negative direction. Next, we sought to question whether N-linked sialic acids were fully responsible for this novel effect of β2 on Nav1.5. As shown in Fig. 3, a mutant β2 in which all potential N-glycosylation sites were removed, β2-ΔN, had no effect on Nav1.5 gating, indicating that N-linked sialic acids attached to β2 were fully responsible for the effect of β2 on Nav1.5 gating. β2-ΔN imposed the same depolarizing effect on Nav1.2 gating as observed for wild type β2, indicating that β2 N-linked sugars had no effect on Nav1.2 gating and that deglycosylation did not prevent association of β2 with the α subunits. To our knowledge this is the first report describing a significant functional effect of β2 on Nav1.5 gating. β2 is expressed in the heart, and recent work has shown that Nav1.5 and β2 colocalize to the intercalated disks of ventricular myocytes (32Malhotra J.D. Chen C. Rivolta I. Abriel H. Malhotra R. Mattei L.N. Brosius F.C. Kass R.S. Isom L.L. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 40Maier S.K. Westenbroek R.E. McCormick K.A. Curtis R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In addition, Nav1.5 is also expressed in both fetal and adult brain and could potentially be co-expressed with β2 (41Donahue L.M. Coates P.W. Lee V.H. Ippensen D.C. Arze S.E. Poduslo S.E. Brain Res. 2000; 887: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, control of β2 expression and sialylation may provide a means for modulating Nav1.5 gating in the heart and brain. Another important and novel finding is that β2 differentially modulates the gating of two Nav α subunit isoforms. That is, modulation of Nav gating by β2 appears to be determined by the α subunit with which it associates. Nav1.5 is modulated only in the presence of β2 sialic acids, whereas modulation of Nav1.2 by β2 is SA-independent. This suggests that β2 has at least two different mechanisms of action: one that involves sialic acids and one that does not. Co-expression of β1 and β2 Provides Multiple Mechanisms for Modulating Nav Function—We report here that the β2 subunit has varied effects on two Nav α subunits, causing an SA-dependent hyperpolarizing shift in Nav1.5 gating and an SA-independent depolarizing effect on Nav1.2 gating. Previously, we showed that β1 shifted all tested gating parameters for Nav1.5 and Nav1.2 in the hyperpolarized direction in an SA-dependent manner (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nav α subunits might be associated with both auxiliary subunits. If so, what is the impact on Nav gating? Are the SA-dependent effects of β1 and β2 on Nav1.5 independent? Are the SA-dependent and -independent effects additive? As shown in Figs. 5 and 6 and in Table 1, co-expression of β1 and β2 with Nav1.2 indicated that the gating effects of the β subunits are apparently additive and independent. That is, the depolarizing influence of β2 essentially negated the hyperpolarizing influence of β1 under fully sialylating conditions. Thus, the measured gating behavior of Nav1.2 alone was nearly identical to the fully sialylated Nav1.2·β1·β2 complex. However, under conditions of reduced sialylation, only SA-independent β2 effects were observed. The data indicate that the effects of β1 and β2 on Nav1.2 are independent and, indeed, apparently additive. Interestingly, the same was true for β subunit effects on Nav1.5, even though each β subunit conferred SA-dependent effects. That is, channel gating (except steady state inactivation) shifted to even greater hyperpolarized potentials (shifted ∼15 mV) when β1 and β2 were co-expressed with Nav1.5 under fully sialylated conditions than when only one β subunit was present (shifted ∼8–9 mV). When sialylation was reduced, Nav1.5 gating was unaffected by expression of the β subunits either alone or in combination (Figs. 4 and 6 and Table 1). Thus, these data suggest the SA-dependent effects of both β subunits on Nav1.5 gating are apparently additive and likely independent. Could Less Sialylated Nav Partially Account for Symptoms Exhibited by Those Suffering from Carbohydrate-deficient Glycoprotein Syndrome?—Patients with CDGS present with severe developmental delay, neurological abnormalities, and failure to thrive. Surviving adults suffer from progressive muscle atrophy (42Marquardt T. Denecke J. Eur. J. Pediatr. 2003; 162: 359-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Currently, there are 20 documented forms of CDGS, each caused by dysfunction of one gene product involved in N-linked (16 of 20) or O-linked protein glycosylation (43Jaeken J. Carchon H. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2004; 16: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 44Jaeken J. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2003; 26: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition to CDGS, there are other disorders whose pathology is linked to aberrant glycosylation such as several forms of congenital muscular dystrophy (43Jaeken J. Carchon H. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2004; 16: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 44Jaeken J. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2003; 26: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 45Dubowitz V. Ann.

Nishino I. Campbell K.P. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Nearly all CDGS impact multiple organ systems, with prominent effects on neuronal, muscular, and cardiovascular systems. Although the exact mutated glycosylation structure varies from one CDGS to another, all CDGS victims suffer from reduced protein sialylation. Because many of the observed phenotypes suggest sluggish or reduced neuromuscular and/or cardiovascular activity, it is intriguing to consider that the lowered SA levels attached to the glycoproteins of the patient may be responsible for changes in ion channel activity, which might contribute to symptoms. For example, consistent with our data here and described previously (22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), perhaps cardiac Nav function in CDGS patients is compromised because of the reduced levels of sialic acids attached to the α, β1, and β2 subunits expressed in the heart. Such studies will be the focus of future investigations. Summary—Taken together these data suggest an increasingly complex mechanism by which voltage-gated sodium channels, and thereby cardiac, skeletal muscle, and neuronal action potentials, can be regulated. The SA attached to a specific Nav α subunit can differentially impact channel gating (21Bennett E.S. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 675-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Johnson D. Montpetit M.L. Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44303-44310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Stocker P.J. Bennett E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the β1 subunit uniformly shifts Nav1.2 and Nav1.5 gating, but only in the presence of SA. Co-expression of β2 alone causes an SA-dependent shift in Nav1.5 gating but an SA-independent shift in Nav1.2 gating. The data indicate that the varied SA-dependent and SA-independent effects of β subunits on two different Nav α subunits are apparently independent and additive. The results indicate for the first time that Nav activity can be modulated by altering the functional Nav subunit composition coupled with varying levels of subunit glycosylation/sialylation. The implications from this study are potentially far-reaching given the diversity and ubiquitous presence of ion channel glycosylation and the vital role of ion channels in cellular function.

https://openalex.org/W2095898664,"Alzheimer disease is characterized by extracellular plaques composed of Aβ peptides. We show here that these plaques also contain the serine protease inhibitor neuroserpin and that neuroserpin forms a 1:1 binary complex with the N-terminal or middle parts of the Aβ1-42 peptide. This complex inactivates neuroserpin as an inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator and blocks the loop-sheet polymerization process that is characteristic of members of the serpin superfamily. In contrast neuroserpin accelerates the aggregation of Aβ1-42 with the resulting species having an appearance that is distinct from the mature amyloid fibril. Neuroserpin reduces the cytotoxicity of Aβ1-42 when assessed using standard cell assays, and the interaction has been confirmed in vivo in novel Drosophila models of disease. Taken together, these data show that neuroserpin interacts with Aβ1-42 to form off-pathway non-toxic oligomers and so protects neurons in Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia. The pathological features are characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular Aβ plaques. The plaques are composed of 42 (Aβ1-42)- and to a lesser extent 40 (Aβ1-40)-amino acid fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (1Selkoe D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 924: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Overproduction of the more aggregatory Aβ1-42 peptide is believed to cause neuronal dysfunction and death in most sporadic and familial forms of Alzheimer disease. Although insoluble plaques of Aβ1-42 are a classic feature of the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease, these plaques are also present in some healthy, elderly individuals (2Wilcock G.K. Esiri M.M. J. Neurol. Sci. 1982; 56: 343-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). This discrepancy, and the observation that soluble Aβ is a better marker of cognitive decline (3Naslund J. Haroutunian V. Mohs R. Davis K.L. Davies P. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2000; 283: 1571-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), has led to the proposal that mature amyloid plaques are an end stage aggregation product and that the directly neurotoxic species occur earlier in the aggregation pathway (4Lambert M.P.

The presence of ancillary proteins that interact with Aβ may stabilize particular aggregation intermediates or seed-specific patterns of aggregation that have distinct toxic properties. Of particular interest in this regard are several proteins that are associated with β amyloid plaques such as apolipoprotein E (7Namba Y. Tomonaga M. Kawasaki H. Otomo E. Ikeda K.

The role of these proteins is underscored by the finding that the E4 polymorphism of apolipoprotein E is the most powerful genetic risk factor for the development of sporadic Alzheimer disease (9Corder E.H.

We show here that neuroserpin is a plaque-associated protein in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease and that it forms a specific binary complex with the Aβ peptide. The neuroprotective consequences of this interaction are demonstrated in cell culture and Drosophila models of disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals and buffers, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), horse serum, fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin, B27 supplement, and thioflavin T were all from Sigma. PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were carried out in PBS. The Aβ1-40 peptides substituted with proline residues were obtained from the Keck Biotechnology Center, Yale University.Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining was performed on tissue fixed in 10% w/v buffered formalin for at least 2 weeks and embedded in paraffin before staining. Routine histological procedures were employed throughout, and staining used the streptavidin-biotin methodology and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, with or without nickel enhancement, as the chromagen. The monoclonal 6F/3D (Novocastra Laboratories Ltd., UK) was used to detect the Aβ peptides, and neuroserpin was detected using an affinity-purified, polyclonal rabbit antiserum (23Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenschild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol.

The peptides were then dissolved in 1 ml of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluro-2-propanol (Sigma), divided into 40-μl aliquots, dried thoroughly in a rotary evaporator at room temperature, and stored at -80 °C.Expression and Purification of Neuroserpin—Wild-type recombinant neuroserpin was expressed with a 6-histidine tag at the N terminus in the pQE81L vector in Escherichia coli SG13009 (pREP4) cells and purified to homogeneity as described previously (19Belorgey D.

The resulting protein was dialyzed into PBS, or into DMEM for use in cell experiments, concentrated, and then stored at -80 °C.Assessing the Interaction between Aβ Peptides and Neuroserpin—The effect of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 peptides on neuroserpin polymerization was determined by incubating 0.8 mg/ml recombinant neuroserpin at 45 °C in the presence or absence of a 10- or 50-fold molar excess of Aβ1-40 or Aβ1-42. Neuroserpin polymerization was also assessed in the presence or absence of N- and C-terminal fragments of the Aβ1-42 peptide and with mutants of the Aβ1-40 peptide that contained proline substitutions (F20P, I31P, and M35P). Samples were taken at various time points and snap frozen before being assessed by 7.5% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE.The formation of an SDS-stable complex between neuroserpin and tPA was demonstrated by co-incubating 2 μm neuroserpin with 2 μm tPA (Calbiochem) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The effect of Aβ1-42 on complex formation was assessed by incubating neuroserpin with or without a 10× molar excess of Aβ1-42 for 24 h at 37 °C, followed by a 5-min incubation with tPA at room temperature. To control for any effect of Aβ1-42 on tPA, 2 μm neuroserpin, 2 μm tPA, and 20 μm Aβ1-42 were incubated together for 5 min. The reaction between neuroserpin and tPA was stopped by the addition of 1,5-dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethylketone (1 mm final concentration, Calbiochem) to inhibit any residual free tPA (29Renatus M.

Following the final incubation in each condition, the samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until the completion of the experiment. The samples were then mixed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were separated on a 10% w/v SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by silver staining.N-terminal Amino Acid Sequencing—Recombinant neuroserpin (20 μm) was incubated with a 40× molar excess of Aβ1-42 for 30 h at 37 °C. The samples were then resolved by 7.5% (w/v) non-denaturing PAGE and electroblotted on to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon, Millipore Corp.). Following transfer the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stained with Ponceau-S to visualize the bands. The band containing the neuroserpin-Aβ1-42 complex was cut out and analyzed by quantitative N terminus amino acid sequencing.Assessment of Aβ Aggregation with Thioflavin T—230 μm Aβ1-42 was incubated with a range of concentrations of neuroserpin (0, 2, 8, and 12 μm) in PBS at 37 °C. At various time points, up to 30 min, a 2-μl aliquot from each incubation mixture was diluted into 298 μl of 20 μm thioflavin T in 50 mm glycine, pH 8.5. Fluorescence was measured in a 2-mm path length quartz cuvette in an LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 450 and 485 nm, respectively, with a 2.5 nm band pass for excitation and 15 nm for emission.Electron Microscopy—Aβ1-42 and neuroserpin were incubated as described above for the thioflavin T experiments. At various time points aliquots were removed and either diluted 1:1 with buffer and placed directly on copper grids or centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets were placed on the grids. The grids were negatively stained with 2% w/v uranyl acetate in water and then examined and photographed using a Hitachi H7100 microscope operated at 75 kV.Cell Culture Experiments—Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamate. The cells were plated at a density of 5000-7000 cells/well in a 96-well plate at 37 °C in 10% v/v CO2 until 70-80% confluency was achieved. Primary cortical neurons from E14 rat embryos were obtained as previously described (30Wilkins A. Chandran S. Compston A. Glia. 2001; 36: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and cultured in B27 media (DMEM, 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 2% v/v B27 supplement), plated at a density of 1000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C in 5% v/v CO2 for 48 h. Aβ1-42 peptide (final concentration, 50 μm) and a range of concentrations of neuroserpin (both in DMEM) were then added to the cell media of the PC12 cells and the primary cortical rat embryo neurons followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 72 and 40 h, respectively. Mitochondrial activity of the cells was determined by the MTT assay. Quantification of cell death was performed using spectrophotometric measurement at 540 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm for the PC12 assays and 570 nm for the primary rat cortical neuronal culture assays.Transgenic Flies—Wild-type neuroserpin with its human secretion signal peptide and the Aβ1-42 peptide, fused to a secretion signal peptide from the Drosophila necrotic gene (31De Gregorio E. Han S.J. Lee W.J. Baek M.J. Osaki T. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Iwanaga S. Lemaitre B. Brey P.T. Dev.

The lines expressing wild-type neuroserpin had the transgene inserted on chromosomes 2 (NS16) and 3 (NS9). In the Aβ1-42-expressing lines the inserts were on chromosomes 2 (Alz1) and 3 (Alz2). Flies co-expressing neuroserpin and Aβ1-42 were generated by crossing the respective single transgenic lines. The lines containing the GAL4-responsive constructs were then crossed with various drivers (GAL4da, GAL4Act5c, GAL4GMR, GAL4sev) to drive expression in various tissues (da and Act5c widespread, and GMR and sev primarily in the eye). Hatching frequency observation and scanning electron microscopy were both performed on flies cultured at 25 °C and 29 °C as described previously (32Crowther D.C. Kinghorn K.J. Miranda E. Page R.

Neuroscience. 2005; 132: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar).RESULTSNeuroserpin Antibodies Selectively Label Aβ Deposits in Alzheimer Disease—Neuroserpin was detected in the brains of seven patients with sporadic Alzheimer disease using a polyclonal antiserum to recombinant human neuroserpin. The relative distributions of neuroserpin and β-amyloid peptides were compared using the 6F/3D monoclonal antibody that detects Aβ peptides (Fig. 1). Both neuroserpin and Aβ were detected at high levels in the CA1 region of the hippocampus; Aβ was present as plaques (Fig. 1a); however, neuroserpin (Fig. 1b) demonstrated a widespread intra-neuronal distribution with some puncta of peri- and intra-neuronal staining. This discrete staining for neuroserpin was only seen in association with plaques in tissue from patients with Alzheimer disease and was not seen in control tissue. Neuroserpin (Fig. 1c, brown stain) was found at the periphery of the amyloid core (arrow) of plaques, associated with dystrophic neurites and swollen axonal processes (arrowheads). Staining of the amyloid plaques for both Aβ and neuroserpin (Fig. 1d) demonstrated co-localization of the Aβ peptide (darker stain) with neuroserpin (lighter stain, arrowheads) within the plaque. The co-localization of neuroserpin to plaques was confirmed by staining consecutive sections of Alzheimer disease brain tissue for neuroserpin and Aβ. Plaques were stained for neuroserpin (Fig. 1e, arrow and arrowhead), and the corresponding plaques were stained for Aβ in the adjacent section (Fig. 1f). At higher power the presence of Aβ and neuroserpin within a single plaque was clearly seen (Fig. 1, e and f, insets).Aβ1-42 Abolishes the Protease Inhibitory Activity of Neuroserpin by the Formation of a 1:1 Molar Complex—To determine whether the localization of neuroserpin to β amyloid plaques represents a specific interaction between the serpin and the Aβ peptide, we investigated the functional consequences of co-incubating pure solutions of protein and peptide. The proteinase inhibitory activity of neuroserpin, in common with the other serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), requires the insertion of the reactive center loop (Fig. 2, a and b, yellow) into β-sheet A (Fig. 2, a and b, red) following the initial interaction with the proteinase. Reactive loop peptide insertion is energetically favorable and allows the subsequent deformation and inhibition of the proteinase (Fig. 2, a and b, blue and purple) (33Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Exogenous peptides such as a synthetic 12-mer peptide, corresponding to the reactive loop of the serpin (Fig. 2c, arrow) or the N terminus of the Aβ1-42 peptide (Fig. 2d), may also anneal to β-sheet A, resulting in the loss of protease-inhibitory activity (34Skinner R. Chang W.S. Jin L. Pei X. Huntington J.A. Abrahams J.P. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consequently we investigated the effect of Aβ peptides on the inhibitory activity of neuroserpin toward its cognate protease tPA. Normally 2 μm neuroserpin (Fig. 3, lane 1) reacts with equimolar tPA (Fig. 3, lane 2) resulting in a high molecular mass SDS-resistant serpin-enzyme complex (Fig. 3, lane 3, arrowhead). In contrast, preincubation of the neuroserpin with a 10× molar excess of Aβ1-42 at 37 °C for 24 h before adding tPA abolished the serpin-enzyme complex (Fig. 3, lane 5). As a control we showed that tPA is not inhibited by Aβ1-42, because when tPA, neuroserpin, anda10× molar excess of Aβ1-42 were mixed simultaneously, the high molecular weight neuroserpin-tPA complex was still observed (Fig. 3, lane 4). These data show that Aβ1-42 irreversibly inactivates neuroserpin. The migration profile of neuroserpin was also modified by preincubation with Aβ1-42, such that the tPA-cleaved neuroserpin species (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4, arrows) is no longer seen (Fig. 3, lane 5).FIGURE 2Molecular models of neuroserpin (a and b, gray, red, and yellow, modeled on α1-antitrypsin) interacting with a protease such as tissue plasminogen activator (a and b, tPA, blue and purple, protease modeled on trypsin (33Huntington J.A.

The structure of a binary complex of serpin with a reactive loop peptide (c, arrow) inserted into β-sheet A and a model of neuroserpin complexed with Aβ1-42 (d, extending from the inferior pole of neuroserpin into β-sheet A). tPA interacts with the P1-P1′ residues of the reactive loop of neuroserpin (a, yellow) resulting in cleavage of the reactive loop and formation of a covalent serpin-enzyme complex (33Huntington J.A.

The insertion of the cleaved reactive center loop into β-sheet A (red) provides the energy to deform and inactivate tPA (b). The insertion of peptides into β-sheet A (34Skinner R. Chang W.S. Jin L.

The incubation of 2 μm neuroserpin (lane 1) with 2 μm tPA (lane 2) for 5 min at room temperature yielded an SDS-stable neuroserpin-tPA complex (lane 3, arrowhead), some cleaved neuroserpin (lane 3, arrow), some unreacted neuroserpin, and tPA. Neuroserpin (2 μm) and 2 μm tPA were also incubated for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of 20 μm Aβ1-42 (lane 4), resulting in an identical appearance to lane 3 indicating that Aβ1-42 does not inhibit tPA. The co-incubation of 2 μm neuroserpin with 20 μmAβ1-42 for 24 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with 2 μm tPA for 5 min at room temperature abolished serpin-complex formation, demonstrating a loss of the proteinase inhibitory activity of neuroserpin (lane 5). The data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the stoichiometry of the neuroserpin-Aβ1-42 complex, 20 μm neuroserpin was incubated with a 40× molar excess of the Aβ1-42 peptide for 30 h at 37 °C. The samples were resolved by non-denaturing PAGE, and the neuroserpin band was analyzed by quantitative N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Two sequences were identified: 3.0 pmol of MRGSHH (consistent with the N-terminal end of the His-tagged neuroserpin protein) and 3.5 pmol of DAEFRH (the first six amino acids of the Aβ1-42 peptide). Thus the neuroserpin-Aβ1-42 complex has a 1:1 stoichiometry.Aβ1-42 Prevents the Loop-sheet Polymerization of Neuroserpin—The patency of β-sheet A is also required for a competing biophysical process, termed loop-sheet polymerization. As with other serpins, neuroserpin will form homopolymers when incubated at elevated temperatures (19Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol.

The insertion of an exogenous peptide into β-sheet A of serpins blocks the formation of loop-sheet polymers; however, to date, this has not been demonstrated for neuroserpin (19Belorgey D. Crowther D.C. Mahadeva R. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17367-17373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Consequently we co-incubated a 50× molar excess of Aβ1-40 (Fig. 4a, arrowhead) or Aβ1-42 (Fig. 4b, arrowhead) with 0.8 mg/ml neuroserpin at 45 °C and assessed the effect on the rate of neuroserpin polymerization using non-denaturing PAGE (Fig. 4, a and b) with densitometry (Fig. 4, c and d). Both Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 significantly inhibited neuroserpin polymerization. At all time points there was more monomeric neuroserpin (arrows) and less polymer in the presence of Aβ compared with neuroserpin alone (Fig. 4, a and b, + lanes versus - lanes, and c and d, squares versus triangles). Polymerization was also inhibited by a 10× molar excess of Aβ1-42, but the degree of inhibition was less marked (data not shown). The specificity of the Aβ1-42-neuroserpin interaction was confirmed by coincubating Aβ1-42 with another serpin, α1-antitrypsin. In contrast the polymerization of α1-antitrypsin was not inhibited by a 50× molar excess of Aβ1-42 at 50 °C and 55 °C (data not shown).FIGURE 4Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 inhibit the polymerization of neuroserpin. Neuroserpin (0.8 mg/ml) in PBS was incubated alone (-) or in the presence (+) of a 50 molar excess of Aβ1-40 (a, arrowhead) or Aβ1-42 (b, arrowhead) over a 10-h time period at 45 °C. Samples were taken at various time points and visualized by 7.5% non-denaturing PAGE. Co-incubation of neuroserpin with Aβ1-40 or Aβ1-42 slowed polymerization of neuroserpin and stabilized the monomer (arrows, comparing the - lane with the + lane for each time point).

https://openalex.org/W2055897437,"Solid tumors often have an inadequate blood supply, which results in large regions that are subjected to hypoxic or anoxic stress. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates much of the transcriptional response of cells to hypoxia. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is another transcription factor that responds to a variety of stresses and is often upregulated in cancer. We investigated the regulation of ATF3 by oxygen deprivation. ATF3 induction occurred most robustly under anoxia, is common, and it is not dependent on presence of HIF-1 or p53, but is sensitive to the inhibition of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation and the antioxidant N-acetylcystein. ATF3 could also be induced by desferrioxamine but not by the mitochondrial poison cyanide or the nonspecific 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine. We also show that anoxic ATF3 mRNA is more stable than normoxic mRNA providing a mechanism for this induction. Thus, this study demonstrates that the regulation of ATF3 under anoxia is independent of 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, HIF-1 and p53, presumably involving multiple regulatory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2119241703,"As a leading cause of heart failure, postinfarction left ventricular remodeling represents an important target for therapeutic interventions. Mitogen-activated protein kinases regulate critical cellular processes including stress response and survival, but their role in left ventricular remodeling is unknown. In the present study, rats were subjected to myocardial infarction by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Western blot and kinase assay analysis revealed an inactivation of p38 kinase after myocardial infarction. Local adenovirus-mediated cotransfection of wild-type (WT) p38 kinase and constitutively active MKK3b reduced infarct size (26+/-3% vs. 47+/-4%, P<0.05 vs. LacZ-treated control) associated with improved ejection fraction (66.9+/-5.5% vs. 44.4+/-4.0%, P<0.001), fractional shortening (30.2+/-2.1% vs. 19.7+/-2.2%, P<0.001), and decreased left ventricular diastolic diameter (8.5+/-0.4 mm vs. 9.5+/-0.2 mm, P<0.01). p38 kinase gene transfer increased capillary density (2423+/-107/mm(2) vs. 1934+/-86/mm(2), P<0.001) and resulted in microvessel enlargement in the ischemic border zone. Apoptosis (35+/-7 vs. 69+/-13 cells, P<0.01) and fibrosis (16+/-3% vs. 34+/-8%, P<0.05) were reduced, while the number of c-kit positive cardiac stem-like cells remained unchanged. These results indicate that reduced p38 signaling predisposes to adverse postinfarction remodeling. The rescue of failing myocardium with p38 kinase may be a potential new therapy for heart failure after myocardial infarction."
https://openalex.org/W2006463550,"The Hsp90 chaperoning pathway and its model client substrate, the progesterone receptor (PR), have been used extensively to study chaperone complex formation and maturation of a client substrate in a near native state. This chaperoning pathway can be reconstituted in vitro with the addition of five proteins plus ATP: Hsp40, Hsp70, Hop, Hsp90, and p23. The addition of these proteins is necessary to reconstitute hormone-binding capacity to the immuno-isolated PR. It was recently shown that the first step for the recognition of PR by this system is binding by Hsp40. We compared type I and type II Hsp40 proteins and created point mutations in Hsp40 and Hsp70 to understand the requirements for this first step. The type I proteins, Ydj1 and DjA1 (HDJ2), and a type II, DjB1 (HDJ1), act similarly in promoting hormone binding and Hsp70 association to PR, while having different binding characteristics to PR. Ydj1 and DjA1 bind tightly to PR whereas the binding of DjB1 apparently has rapid on and off rates and its binding cannot be observed by antibody pull-down methods using either purified proteins or cell lysates. Mutation studies indicate that client binding, interactions between Hsp40 and Hsp70, plus ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70 are all required to promote conformational maturation of PR via the Hsp90 pathway.

Mutation studies indicate that client binding, interactions between Hsp40 and Hsp70, plus ATP hydrolysis by Hsp70 are all required to promote conformational maturation of PR via the Hsp90 pathway. Molecular chaperones are known for several vital roles in the cell. These include the folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, translocation through membranes, maturation and assembly of client proteins, prevention of aggregation, promotion of degradation, and response to cell stress (1Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). While there are several chaperone networks, we are concerned with the Hsp90 chaperoning pathway and its model client substrate, the progesterone receptor (PR). 2The abbreviations used are: PR, progesterone receptor; SBD, steroid binding domain; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; WT, wild type; AR, androgen receptor. More than 100 substrates or client proteins for Hsp90 have been identified (2Pratt W. Toft D. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 3Pratt W.B.

Greenblatt J. Boone C. Emili A. Houry W. Cell. 2005; 120: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). These proteins include a diverse family of kinases, transcription factors, and cell cycle regulators, many of which are involved in cancer (5Whitesell L. Lindquist S. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar, 6Workman P. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Chiosis G. Vilenchik M. Kim J. Solit D. Drug. Discov. Today. 2004; 9: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Steroid receptors are a family of transcription factors chaperoned by Hsp90. Of these, PR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) have served as models to study this pathway in detail (2Pratt W. Toft D. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 3Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Murphy P.J. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). PR exists in the cell as two isoforms, PR-A and PR-B (8Conneely O. Maxwell B. Toft D. Schrader W. O'Malley B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), which are products of a single gene and differ only in that PR-A lacks the first 164 amino acids from the N terminus. These isoforms are both ligand-activated and dimeric in their activated states. Previous studies have not shown any differences in the chaperone association of PR-A and PR-B (9Schowalter D. Sullivan W. Maihle N. Dobson A. Conneely O. O'Malley B. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21165-21173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Smith D. Schowalter D. Kost S. Toft D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1704-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Chaperones appear to associate with the C-terminal domain of PR, where the steroid binding domain (SBD) is located. The primary amino acid sequence of the SBD is highly conserved throughout the steroid receptor family and a crystal structure of this domain of human PR bound to hormone is available (11Williams S. Sigler P. Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Steroid receptors isolated from cell cytosol are associated with several chaperone and co-chaperone proteins, including Hsp90. When PR is stripped of its association with Hsp90, it loses its hormone binding ability in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. However, this activity can be restored or maintained in vitro through the actions of a minimum of 5 proteins plus ATP: Hsp40, Hsp70, Hop, Hsp90, and p23 (12Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Dittmar K.D. Banach M. Galigniana M.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7358-7366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In vivo, other co-chaperones are involved, including HIP (14Prapapanich V. Chen S. Smith D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 944-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimerman R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar) and one of several immunophilins (2Pratt W. Toft D. Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 3Pratt W.B. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Murphy P.J. Essays Biochem. 2004; 40: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Smith D.F. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2004; 9: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Incubation with the aforementioned five proteins regenerates the hormone binding ability of PR and reconstitutes a heterocomplex resembling that originally found in vivo. The hormone-binding cleft is believed to be collapsed through hydrophobic interactions in the absence of ligand, thus the SBD requires a change in conformation to bind hormone (18Gee A. Katzenellenbogen J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These five proteins work together to confer this conformational change. The Hsp90 chaperoning pathway occurs in a series of steps that include the formation of multichaperone complexes with the steroid receptor. It was recently shown that Hsp40 binding is the first step in the PR chaperoning pathway (19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This binding is followed by Hsp70 association, which is ATP dependent (19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hsp70 binds ATP at its N-terminal domain, and the J-domain of Hsp40 binds to Hsp70 and stimulates its ATPase activity, thus causing the tight association of Hsp70 with the substrate (20Fan C. Lee S. Cyr D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The intermediate complex that follows is formed with the assistance of Hop, which is an adaptor protein that can simultaneously associate with Hsp70 and Hsp90 and modulate their activities (21Chen S. Smith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35194-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 22Lassle M. Blatch G. Kundra V. Takatori T. Zetter B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1876-1884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 23Smith D. Sullivan W. Marion T. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D. Toft D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is capable of transporting Hsp90 into the complex. Hop senses conformational changes in Hsp70 and Hsp90, mainly brought about by ATP binding, hydrolysis, and release (24Hernandez M. Sullivan W. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38294-38304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 25Johnson B. Schumacher R. Ross E. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 26Odunuga O. Longshaw V. Blatch G. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). After the intermediate complex is formed, ATP is bound to Hsp90. p23 recognizes ATP-bound Hsp90 and promotes the dissociation of the intermediate complex (27Sullivan W. Owen B. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45942-45948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and a transition to a receptor complex that is able to bind hormone. The Hsp90 chaperone pathway is thus highly regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis as well as by a series of interactions with chaperones and cofactors. We hypothesized that the initial recognition of PR by Hsp40 in one specific site is necessary for the reconstitution of hormone binding to PR. Here we characterized the assembly of the initial complex, PR-Hsp40-Hsp70, and compared type I and type II Hsp40 proteins in their association with PR. We also addressed the need for interaction between Hsp70 and Hsp40 in the context of Hsp90 chaperoning to gain insight on the requirements for client protein recognition by this chaperoning system. HeLa Cell Lysate Pull-downs—HeLa cells stably expressing PR-B (28Chadli A. Graham J. Abel M. Jackson T. Gordon D. Wood W. Felts S. Horwitz K. Toft D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1722-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were grown to 70% confluency in MEM medium enriched with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 6 ng/μl insulin (Invitrogen), nonessential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C. The cells were trypsinized and washed in lysate buffer that included 20 mm Tris 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete® EDTA-free from Roche). The cells were sonicated five times using the following cycle: 1 s pulse with 30 s rest on ice. The lysates were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 20 min. The lysate was added to protein A-Sepharose beads that were cross-linked using dimethylpimelimidate (DMP; Sigma-Aldrich) (29Sisson T. Castor C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 127: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with either PR-B antibody (PR6 (30Sullivan W. Beito T. Proper J. Krco C. Toft D. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)) or DjA1 antibody (Neomarkers® HDJ-2/DNAJ Ab-1). The lysate and beads were incubated on ice for 1.5 h, and washed four times with 1 ml of lysate buffer minus protease inhibitors. The beads were incubated with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min at 90 °C, and proteins were resolved by 7.5% acrylamide SDS-PAGE. Construction of Mutants—Human DjA1 D36N, Hsp70 K71M and Hsp70 R171H were prepared using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. These constructs were prepared in a pET23C vector (Novagen). The Ydj1 G315D mutant was a gift from Dr. Douglas Cyr. All mutant proteins were overexpressed in the BL21 DE3 PLysS E. coli strain with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 between 0.6 and 0.8 for 3 h at room temperature. Protein Purification—Human Hsp90, human Hsp70, Ydj1, DjA1, DjB1, Hop, and p23 were all expressed and purified as described previously (12Kosano H. Stensgard B. Charlesworth M. McMahon N. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32973-32979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The mutant DjA1 D36N and the mutant Ydj1 G315D were purified as described previously (31Caplan A. Tsai J. Casey P. Douglas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Bacterial lysates were fractionated by FPLC using first a Q-Sepharose, followed by UnoQ and Superdex 200. Both proteins were eluted early in the salt gradient of the ionic exchange columns. The Hsp70 mutations Hsp70 K71M and Hsp70 R171H were purified using the same procedure as the wild-type Hsp70 (19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PR-A Expression and Cytosol Preparation—The procedure followed for the baculovirus-mediated expression of PR-A in SF9 cells included co-expression of p23, which enhances the expression of PR in a native state. This method has been described previously for GR expression (32Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J. Lowe E.R. Jenkins G.J. Osawa Y. Sunahara R.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48754-48763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SF9 cells were co-infected with viral vectors coding for chicken PR-A and human p23 in the Recombinant Protein Expression Proteomics Core, The Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine. A final concentration of 10 mm glucose was added to the cultures at 24-h postinfection. The pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline prior to freezing at -80 °C. The cytosol was prepared from these pellets in the following manner. A pellet containing ∼756 × 106 cells was thawed in 20 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors: Complete® EDTA-free). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was then centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h and stored at -80 °C. Prior to use, the cytosol is thawed on ice and adjusted to 500 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP. The lysate was salt-treated for 30 min on ice to dissociate chaperone proteins from PR. PR Immuno-isolation—We used a mouse monoclonal antibody PR22 (IgG) against chicken PR described previously (30Sullivan W. Beito T. Proper J. Krco C. Toft D. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1549-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Antibody resin was prepared by incubating PR22 with a slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature prior to use. Proportions were 7 μl of PR22 ascites for every 20 μl of resin volume. The conjugated resin was washed three times in PBS and then resuspended as a 1:1 slurry with ice-cold stripping buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 1 mm dithiothreitol). When PR is isolated from SF9 cells, it is accompanied by an assortment of chaperones, mainly Hsp90, Hsp70, and p23. These chaperones are removed by treatment with high salt, ATP, and detergent (stripping buffer) while the immunoisolation is taking place. For the purification of PR, 40 μl of PR22/protein A resin slurry was added to 0.07 ml of salt-treated lysate. This mixture was incubated on ice for 1.5 h. Receptorresin complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of cold stripping buffer and once with reaction buffer, with brief centrifugation to pellet the resin. Resin pellets were used in reconstitution or binding reactions. PR Binding Assays—PR resin pellets (20 μl) were suspended with 200 μl of cold reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) containing the specified amount of wild type or mutant Ydj1, DjA1, or DjB1. Reactions that assess the stimulation of Hsp70 binding to PR also include wild type or mutant Hsp70 plus 2 mm ATP. These reactions proceeded at 30 °C for 20 min; the samples were chilled on ice for 2 min, then washed four times with 1 ml of reaction buffer. The final samples were suspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS plus 5% mercaptoethanol), heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The determination of association constants was performed as published previously (19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Progesterone Receptor Reconstitution—PR resin (20 μl) was suspended with 200 μl of cold reaction buffer containing 20 μg of Hsp70, 5 μg of Ydj1, DjA1, or DjB1, 5 μg of Hop, 20 μg of Hsp90, 5 μg of p23, and 5 mm ATP unless otherwise noted. Incubation proceeded at 30 °C for 20 min. The samples were chilled on ice for 2 min and supplemented with 100 nm [3H]progesterone (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc, St. Louis, MO, 50 Ci/mmol) plus 100 nm of unlabeled progesterone. The samples were incubated for 3 h on ice with gentle resin suspension and then washed four times with 1 ml of reaction buffer. During the fourth suspension 100 μl were removed for the measurement of [3H]progesterone. The final samples were suspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Analysis of complex formation after reconstitution assays were performed in 10% acrylamide gels, while analysis of Hsp40 and Hsp70 binding to PR used 7.5% acrylamide gels to get better resolution in the 50-40 kDa range. Type I and Type II Hsp40 Proteins Interact Differently with PR— As seen in Fig. 1A, type I and type II Hsp40 proteins contain a J-domain at the N terminus of the protein (20Fan C. Lee S. Cyr D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 33Hennessy F. Nicoll W. Zimmermann R. Cheetham M. Blatch G. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In some cases the J domains of type I and II Hsp40 proteins are nearly identical and interchangeable (34Fan C. Lee S. Ren H. Cyr D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Yan W. Craig E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7751-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This domain interacts with Hsp70 and is responsible for stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70. The zinc finger-like domain (ZFLD), unique to the type I Hsp40, is essential for proper recognition and delivery of substrates to Hsp70 (36Lu Z. Cyr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 37Fan C. Ren H. Lee P. Caplan A. Cyr D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 695-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The glycine-phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region is required for the proper function of these proteins (35Yan W. Craig E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7751-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), while the significance of the glycine-methionine (G/M) region, unique to the type II Hsp40 proteins, is unclear (38Lee S. Fan C. Younger J. Ren H. Cyr D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21675-21682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). According to a recently published tertiary structure for both type I and type II Hsp40 (39Borges J.C. Fischer H. Craievich A.F. Ramos C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13671-13681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the dimer of the type I forms a horseshoe with the J domains close together in space, while the dimer of the type II forms a more elongated structure where the J domains are at a distance. These peculiarities, together with the non-conserved C terminus of the Hsp40 proteins (Fig. 1A), suggest that they would behave differently and recognize different client proteins (34Fan C. Lee S. Ren H. Cyr D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the present study we compared the activities of two type I Hsp40 proteins, yeast Ydj1 (40Caplan A. Douglas M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and human DjA1 (HDJ2, HSDJ, HSJ2, HSPF4, DJ-2) (41Davis A. Alevy Y. Chellaiah A. Quinn M. Mohanakumar T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1203-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and one type II protein, human DjB1 (HDJ1, dj1, HSJ2, HSPF1) (42Raabe T. Manley J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in the context of Hsp90 chaperoning (see Ref. 43Ohtsuka K. Hata M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 98-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar for classification and nomenclature). These were compared for their interaction with PR and ability to promote hormone-binding activity. To study the cellular interaction of PR with Hsp40 proteins, we used a HeLa cell line that had been modified to express human PR-B (28Chadli A. Graham J. Abel M. Jackson T. Gordon D. Wood W. Felts S. Horwitz K. Toft D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1722-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DjA1 and DjB1 are readily detected in the soluble cytosolic fraction of HeLa cells, as seen in Fig. 1B (lane 7), and both are potential PR-interacting proteins. Because the Hsp40 type that interacts with PR in the cell has not been identified, we tested for the association of DjA1 and/or DjB1 with PR in cell lysates. Using PR pull-down experiments (Fig. 1B) DjA1 showed a clear association with PR, whereas DjB1 was not detected (lane 5). When the pull-down was performed using antibody to DjA1, the co-isolation of PR was not observed (lane 6). This lack of detection may be explained by the much greater abundance of DjA1 over PR in the lysate. It is also possible that the DjA1 antibody interferes with the interaction. A pull-down of DjB1 was not able to detect PR association (data not shown). Using the PR reconstitution system, we have previously shown that the binding of Ydj1 to PR is rapid, has a high affinity, can be assembled in vitro, and is independent of nucleotide and Hsp70 (19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because these conditions have been well established for the yeast Hsp40, Ydj1, we tested the human Hsp40s, DjA1, and DjB1. As seen in Fig. 1C, both type I proteins Ydj1 and DjA1 interact with PR in the absence of other proteins (lanes 1 and 2) and stimulate Hsp70 association in the presence of ATP (lanes 4 and 5). DjB1 does not visibly interact with PR (lane 3); yet, it is able to promote the association of Hsp70 with PR (lane 6). This also results in some binding of DjB1 in the complex which may represent its binding to Hsp70, PR, or both. These in vitro results agree with the in vivo analysis above in that DjA1 binds readily to PR in a pull-down experiment but DjB1 does not. However, the in vitro results suggest that DjB1 may bind transiently to PR to promote Hsp70 binding. Both Type I and II Hsp40 Proteins Are Able to Promote Hsp90 Chaperoning—In Fig. 2A we depict the hormone binding profile of PR when increasing amounts of either Ydj1 or DjA1 are used in the reconstitution reaction. In addition to Hsp40, this reaction includes purified Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, and p23. These proteins work together to form complexes with PR to promote hormone binding through the opening of the hormone-binding site. Both Hsp40 proteins are able to promote PR chaperoning to the hormone binding state, although there are some differences in the response profiles. Ydj1 is somewhat more potent than DjA1, but it is slightly inhibitory when in excess. Fig. 2B represents the complex formation of the reaction described above. Protein association occurs in a timely and organized manner (44Smith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 45Smith D. Whitesell L. Nair S. Chen S.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, the presence of proportional quantities of Hsp90 and p23 are indicative of a mature complex that is able to bind hormone. Both Hsp40 proteins are able to promote Hsp90 binding to PR. The main difference between a reconstitution that is triggered by DjA1 or Ydj1 is the presence of Hsp70 in the isolated complexes, which is more prominent throughout when Ydj1 is used. This difference is subtle and does not appear to affect substantially the hormone binding of PR although this may account for the inhibitory effect seen when excess Ydj1 is used. The association of Ydj1 can be seen in this gel while association of DjA1 is not, because it is not resolved from the antibody heavy chain in this gel system (10% acrylamide gels). In experiments performed with beads containing cross-linked antibody or 7.5% acrylamide gels, the amounts of DjA1 and Ydj1 seen associated to the PR complexes are comparable (data not shown). Surprisingly, whereas DjB1 binding to PR is not observed using our methods, it is able to promote PR chaperoning in a similar manner to Ydj1 and DjA1. Fig. 2, C and D show that, when adding increasing amounts of DjB1 to a reconstitution reaction, we are able to achieve hormone binding by PR. As seen in Fig. 2C, the maximum potency of DjB1 is less than that of Ydj1, but very similar to that of DjA1 (Fig. 2A). In Fig. 2D, both the association of Hsp90 and Hsp70 are similar whether Ydj1 or DjB1 is used although the association of Hsp70 in the presence of Ydj1 is higher, as seen previously in Fig. 2B. Hsp40 Binding to PR Is Specific and Limited—DjA1 and Ydj1 are able to bind similarly to PR, promote Hsp70 binding, and promote hormone binding of PR when used in a reconstitution assay. The PR binding affinities for these two proteins were compared as shown in Fig. 3A. The Kd for Ydj1 is 225 nm, while the Kd for DjA1 is 278 nm. Thus, these two proteins have similar affinities for PR. In an earlier study, a higher affinity of Ydj1 for PR was reported with a Kd of 77 nm (19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The presence of detergent (0.01% Nonidet P-40) in the present study apparently lowers the affinity for Ydj1 binding somewhat, but enhances the efficiency of PR chaperoning overall. The Scatchard analysis in Fig. 3A depicts a linear relationship between the binding of PR and each Hsp40, Ydj1, and DjA1. Therefore, a single type of binding is expected from type I Hsp40. A binding affinity constant was not calculated for DjB1 because no measurable binding of DjB1 to PR was detected. Our laboratory has previously calculated the stoichiometry of Ydj1 binding to PR in the early complex as ∼1:1 (19Hernandez M. Chadli A. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11873-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since the PR exists as a monomer in chaperone complexes, Ydj1 may also bind PR in a monomeric state or the Ydj1 dimer may be able to bind two PR molecules. This stoichiometry argues for one binding site on PR for Hsp40. Thus, hypothetically, all Hsp40 proteins that are able to reconstitute PR should bind to the same site. We considered this question regarding type I Hsp40 in Fig. 3, B and C, where a competition assay between Ydj1 and DjA1 was performed. Increasing amounts of Ydj1 were added to a reaction containing a constant amount of 5 μg of DjA1. Fig. 3B shows a representative 7.5% acrylamide gel, where we can visually assess the displacement of DjA1 by Ydj1, because they have slightly different molecular weights. The graph shown in Fig. 3C, quantifies the competition experiment. Ydj1 was able to replace all DjA1 at the PR binding site. These data strengthen the hypothesis considering a single binding site for type I Hsp40. The same displacement or competition pattern occurs in the reverse experiment when DjA1 is used to occupy the site for Ydj1 binding on PR (data not shown). DjB1 does not stably bind PR when using our methods and it is not an effective competitor for Ydj1 binding. Thus, we considered a functional approach. We used a dominant negative Hsp40, DjA1 D36N, which binds to PR (see Table 1 and Fig. 5), is unable to bind Hsp70 (47Suh W. Burkholder W. Lu C. Zhao X. Gottesman M. Gross C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and is also unable to reconstitute the hormone binding ability of PR (Fig. 5). Fig. 4A shows a competition experiment where Hsp90, Hsp70, Hop, DjA1, and p23 were used in a reconstitution assay. We then added increasing amounts of DjA1 D36N to this reaction. We show h"

This transition is characterized by changes in their gene expression profile, particularly by a significant down-regulation of contractile proteins. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB has long been known to initiate VSMC de-differentiation and mitogenesis. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, on the other hand, has differing effects depending on the model studied. Here, we report that both IGF-I and PDGF-BB stimulated VSMC de-differentiation of rat heart-derived SMCs in culture, although only PDGF-BB was capable of inducing proliferation. Although both PDGF-BB and IGF-I stimulation resulted in decreased smooth muscle α-actin expression and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 expression, the response to IGF-I was significantly more rapid. The increased MMP-2 expression in response to both growth factors was due to increased transcription rates and was dependent on the action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector, Akt. Both PDGF-BB and IGF-I activated PI3K/Akt to similar degrees; however, only PDGF-BB concomitantly stimulated an inhibitory signaling pathway that antagonized the effects of Akt but did not alter the extent or duration of Akt activation. Together, these findings suggest that changes in MMP-2 expression are part of the program of VSMC phenotypic modulation and that both PDGF-BB and IGF-I, despite their different abilities to induce proliferation in this model, are capable of inducing VSMC activation.

It is becoming increasingly clear that VSMCs, 2The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; CSF-1R, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; M-CSF, macrophage-colony stimulating factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane-type MMP-1 (MMP-14); PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFRβ; PDGF receptor β; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; SM, smooth muscle; SMC, smooth muscle cell; WKY-HSMC, Wistar-Kyoto rat heart smooth muscle cell; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; RT, reverse transcription; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.2The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell; CSF-1R, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor; ERK, extracellular regulated kinase; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; M-CSF, macrophage-colony stimulating factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1-MMP, membrane-type MMP-1 (MMP-14); PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFRβ; PDGF receptor β; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; SM, smooth muscle; SMC, smooth muscle cell; WKY-HSMC, Wistar-Kyoto rat heart smooth muscle cell; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; RT, reverse transcription; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. which are of fundamental importance in blood vessel structure, function, and dynamics, also play a critical role in the development of vascular lesions, particularly during atherogenesis. One reason VSMCs are able to participate in a variety of normal and disease processes is that they have the ability to alter their phenotype from a contractile, non-proliferative state to a migratory, non-contractile state, often accompanied by proliferation (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). During this phenotypic modulation, VSMCs down-regulate a set of contractile proteins, including SM α-actin, SM myosin heavy chain, calponin, and SM22α, and up-regulate genes involved in cell migration, extracellular matrix deposition, cell growth, and vessel remodeling (2Thyberg J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 169: 183-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). This VSMC plasticity contributes to tissue remodeling as well as to serious vascular complications associated with disease (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar, 4Thyberg J. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 871-891PubMed Google Scholar), particularly in atherogenesis, during which VSMCs from the medial layer of vessels migrate to the intima, where they participate in the development of the fibrous plaque characteristic of the disease (5Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). VSMCs demonstrating the de-differentiated, or synthetic, phenotype in vivo have been found in arterial intimal lesions in atherosclerosis, as well as in most other vascular disease states (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). Along with decreased contractile protein expression, VSMC de-differentiation involves the increased synthesis of extracellular matrix-degrading proteinases, which play an important role in VSMC proliferation and migration (6Newby A.C. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). MMP expression, in particular, is associated with the VSMC synthetic state (4Thyberg J. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 871-891PubMed Google Scholar). MMPs comprise a family of Zn+2-dependent extracellular enzymes that, along with their endogenous inhibitors, the TIMPs, regulate a wide variety of processes associated with vascular structure and remodeling (7Vu T.H. Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). MMP-2 is known to play several important roles during changes in vascular structure associated with both normal and disease processes. The stimulation of VSMCs with PDGF leads to increased expression of MMP-2 (8Uzui H. Lee J.D. Shimizu H. Tsutani H. Ueda T. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 149: 51-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and this up-regulation was linked to increased cell migration (8Uzui H. Lee J.D. Shimizu H. Tsutani H. Ueda T. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 149: 51-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cultured VSMCs, which often mimic the synthetic state, typically express MMP-2 (4Thyberg J. Histol. Histopathol. 1998; 13: 871-891PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hultgardh-Nilsson A. Lovdahl C. Blomgren K. Kallin B. Thyberg J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 418-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proliferating VSMCs express higher mRNA levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2, which plays a dual role in MMP-2 activation and inhibition, and lower levels of TIMP-1, which inhibits MMP function (10Pauly R.R. Passaniti A. Bilato C. Monticone R. Cheng L. Papadopoulos N. Gluzband Y.A. Smith L. Weinstein C. Lakatta E.G. et al.Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In vivo, MMP-2 expression by VSMCs has been linked to a variety of pathological situations, particularly in atherosclerotic plaques, which show significantly increased MMP-2 expression and activation most prominently in vulnerable regions (11Shah P.K. Galis Z.S. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1878-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Newby A.C. Zaltsman A.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Migration of VSMCs into the intima during atherogenesis is dependent on MMP activity, and VSMCs in atherosclerotic lesions show decreased contractile protein expression and increased MMP expression, indicative of the activated state (3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). VSMCs derived from vessels of patients with aneurysms expressed significantly more MMP-2 than normal cells, with a concomitant increase in invasive capability (13Goodall S. Porter K.E. Bell P.R. Thompson M.M. Eur. J. Vasc. Endovasc. Surg. 2002; 24: 72-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Importantly, MMP-2-deficient mice did not form aneurysms in an experimental model; this study also found that MMP-2 derived from the mesenchyme was the source for aneurysm formation (14Longo G.M. Xiong W. Greiner T.C. Zhao Y. Fiotti N. Baxter B.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 625-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of MMP-2 in vessel remodeling, blocking MMP activity can reverse or prevent the development of vascular pathologies. Inhibiting MMPs blocked proliferation of airway VSMCs in response to serum, thrombin, and PDGF (15Johnson S. Knox A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L1109-L1117PubMed Google Scholar), VSMC proliferation out of aortic explants (16Bendeck M.P. Zempo N. Clowes A.W. Galardy R.E. Reidy M.A. Circ.

Stetler-Stevenson W. Capogrossi M.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2195-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). MMP-2-null VSMCs showed decreased migration in culture models and decreased intimal hyperplasia (22Kuzuya M. Kanda S. Sasaki T. Tamaya-Mori N. Cheng X.W. Itoh T. Itohara S. Iguchi A. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Johnson C. Galis Z.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). MMP-2 has also been linked to VSMC proliferation in response to oxidized low density lipoprotein, perhaps through an MMP-2-linked activation of sphingomyelinase and subsequent ceramide production (24Auge N. Maupas-Schwalm F. Elbaz M. Thiers J.C. Waysbort A. Itohara S. Krell H.W. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Circulation. 2004; 110: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was found that MMP-2 specifically inactivates adrenomedullin, a vasodilator, and that one of the resulting peptides is a potent vasoconstrictor (25Martinez A. Oh H.R. Unsworth E.J. Bregonzio C. Saavedra J.M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cuttitta F. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, MMP-2 plays multiple roles in VSMC biology. In this study, we demonstrate that both PDGF-BB and IGF-I mediate VSMC de-differentiation, including decreased expression of contractile proteins and increased expression of MMP-2. Importantly, we show that PDGF-BB stimulates both negative and positive pathways that result in a significantly delayed increase in MMP-2 transcriptional up-regulation. MMP-2 induction was dependent on the PI3K/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1/Akt pathway, whereas the transient inhibitory pathway acts downstream of Akt. These results suggest that growth factors such as PDGF-BB can elicit both positive and negative signals simultaneously, and that, depending on when gene expression is analyzed, the net effects of this stimulation can vary tremendously. Cell Culture—Wistar-Kyoto rat heart smooth muscle cells (WKY-HSMCs, kindly provided by Dr. Paula Grammas) were grown to post-confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then placed on serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate plus the antibiotic mixture. After 48 h of serum starvation, cells were treated with either the indicated concentrations of recombinant rat PDGF-BB, recombinant human IGF-I, or recombinant human M-CSF (all from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). In experiments involving the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (both from Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), and the MEK inhibitor, U0126 (Promega, Madison, WI), cells were pretreated with the indicated concentration of inhibitor for 15 min prior to growth factor stimulation. In some cases, cells were co-stimulated with 400 μm l-mimosine (Biomol) plus PDGF-BB. Cell lysates were harvested with either boiling SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-Cl) or with cold radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) supplemented with 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma). Immunocytochemistry—WKY-HSMCs were cultured on glass coverslips as above and treated with the indicated growth factors in serum-free medium. Following treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) for 10 min. Fixed cells were stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen) to visualize stress fibers. Coverslips were mounted in SlowFade® Gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen), and stress fibers were visualized using an Olympus AX70 fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY) with QCapture 2.68 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). Stable Cell Lines and Nucleofection—WKY-HSMCs were transfected with Lipofectamine and PLUS Reagents (Invitrogen) and selected for 3 weeks with 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). After selection, cells were allowed to grow to confluence on maintenance (2.5 μg/ml) blasticidin and used to seed experiments. For transient expression of signaling pathway effectors, cells were nucleofected using the AMAXA Nucleofector (Amaxa, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with the Primary Smooth Muscle Cell supplement per manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR, Semiquantitative PCR, and Real-time PCR—For wild-type and stable cells, RNA was harvested using the Purescript RNA Isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and for nucleofected cells, RNA was harvested using an RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Total RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and reverse-transcribed using PowerScript reverse transcriptase (BD Biosciences) and oligo(dT). Semiquantitative PCR and real-time PCR were performed as described previously (26Phelps E.D. Updike D.L. Bullen E.C. Grammas P. Howard E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 290: C352-C361Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Primers used for semiquantitative PCR: calponin (5′-CACTTTAACCGAGGTCCTGCCTAC-3′ and 5′-GCCAATGATGTTCCTGCCTTCTCT-3′); MMP-2 (5′-TCAGATCCGTGGTGAGATCTTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-AACTGTTAAAGGGAGAAGCAAGAAGG-3′); MTI-MMP (5′-GGACTGAGGAGGAGACGGAGGTGA-3′ and 5′-GGGGGATGGAAGAGAAGCAGATGA-3′); SM α-actin (5′-CCACTGCTGCTTCCTCTTCTTCCC-3′ and 5′-GAGGGTGGGGGCGTGACTTAGAAG-3′); SM-myosin heavy chain (5′-CGCCAGAACAAGGAACTCCGAAGC-3′ and 5′-AATGAAGCCTCGTTTCCTCTCCTG-3′); TIMP-1 (5′-ACCACCTTATACCAGCGTTATGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGGATCTGATCCGTCCACAAGCA-3′); TIMP-2 (5′-CGCTGGACGTTGGAGGAAAGAAGG-3′ and 5′-GGGTCCTCGATGTCAAGAAACTCC-3′); and TIMP-3 (5′-GCCTTCTGCAACTCCGACATCGTG-3′ and 5′-GGCGTAGTGTTTGGACTGATAGCC-3′). Real-time PCR was performed using the following primers: MMP-2 (5′-CAAAGAAAGGTGCTGACCGTATC-3′ and 5′-CTGGAGAACCTGAAGTGTGGAG-3′); TIMP-2 (5′-AAGGAGATGGCAAGATGCAC-3′ and 5′-TGTAGCATGGGATCATAGGG-3′). Semiquantitative PCR images were captured and quantified using the ChemiImager 4400 and AlphaEaseFC™ Software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Real-time values were calculated using the comparative Ct method, as performed previously (26Phelps E.D. Updike D.L. Bullen E.C. Grammas P. Howard E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 290: C352-C361Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—SDS cell lysates were sonicated prior to analysis, while radioimmune precipitation assay buffer cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble material prior to BCA analysis (Pierce). Equal quantities of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and probed with the following primary antibodies: α-phospo-ERK, α-phospho-Akt (S473), α-Akt, and α-ERK (all antibodies from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence using secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Blots were imaged using an Epi Chemi II Darkroom Imaging System with Lab Works 4.0 Software (UVP, Upland, CA). Zymogram Analysis—Non-reduced conditioned media samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated with rocking in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, rinsed, and then incubated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3 overnight at 37 °C. After incubation, gels were visualized with Coomassie R-250 stain and captured using the ChemiImager 4400. Transcription Rate Analysis—Oligonucleotide primers were designed flanking the second intron of the MMP-2 gene and used to amplify that intron from Wistar-Kyoto rat genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-AGATGTGGCCAACTACAACTTCTTTC-3′ and 5′-TCATCCACTGTCTCAGGGTCCAGGTC-3′. This fragment was cloned and later nick-labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP for use as a probe in Southern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and DNase I-treated. RNA was then reverse-transcribed using random hexamers. The cDNA was then diluted 10-fold for use in semiquantitative PCR using the following primers to amplify a region within the second intron of the MMP-2 gene (5′-CATCCAGGGGCTTTGCATACAGAG-3′ and 5′-GTCAAACAAAGGGCAGAGCTCTCA-3′). The PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gels, which were denatured and neutralized before transfer to a nylon membrane. Amplimers were detected using the MMP-2 intron 2 probe described above. Phosphorimages were made using an Imaging Screen K and the Molecular Imager® FX (Bio-Rad), quantified using Quantity One 1-D Analysis software (Bio-Rad), and normalized to TIMP-2 mRNA levels obtained by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Proliferation Assay—Cells were plated into 96-well plates, grown to confluence, and serum-starved for 48 h. Cells were then stimulated in fresh serum-free medium plus the indicated concentrations of growth factor. After 48 h of growth factor stimulation, proliferation was measured using a Cell Titer 96® non-radioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega), per the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase Assays—Cells were plated into various multiwell plates and transiently transfected overnight with Lipofectamine and PLUS reagents (Invitrogen). In the case of co-transfections of reporter constructs with signaling pathway effectors, lysates were collected and processed after 24 h of serum starvation per manufacturer's instructions (Promega luciferase assay system). In transfections involving reporter constructs alone and co-transfections of reporter constructs with chimeric receptors, cells were treated with the indicated growth factor for 24 h prior to collection. Light production was measured using a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). cDNA and Reporter Constructs—The constructs used are as follows: 1) pCI-Blast (pCIB), the blasticidin resistance gene and associated promoters were removed from pUB/Bsd (Invitrogen) and ligated into pCI-neo (Promega) from which the neomycin resistance gene and associated promoter had been removed. 2) pCI-Blast-mAkt and pIRES2-EGFP-mAkt, myristoylated bovine Akt was PCR-amplified from pCMV3(myr)Akt-HA (a kind gift from Dr. Mark Coggeshall) and cloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Myristoylated bovine Akt was then subcloned into pCI-Blast and pIRES-EGFP. 3) pCI-Blast-p110α-CA, constitutively active bovine p110α was PCR-amplified from pEF-p110α-CA (a kind gift from Dr. Mark Coggeshall) and directionally inserted into pCI-Blast. 4) Chimeric CSF-1R-PDGFRβ receptor, the extracellular domain of the human CSF-1R was PCR-amplified from Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes (IMAGE) clone 5284461 (Invitrogen) with XbaI- and MluI-containing 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, which amplified 37 bases of the 5′-untranslated region and codons for amino acids 1 through 506. The trans-membrane and intracellular domain of the human PDGFRβ was PCR-amplified from Mammalian Gene Collection clone 34052 (ATCC) using MluI- and SalI-containing 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively, which amplified codons for amino acids 532 to the stop codon. Each receptor fragment was blunt-ligated into pBluescript II SK+. The CSF1R fragment was removed from pBluescript II SK+ with XbaI and MluI and cloned into pBluescript II SK+ containing PDGFRβ and cut with XbaI and MluI. The entire chimeric receptor was removed from pBluescript II SK+ with XbaI and SalI and ligated into pCI-Blast. 5) Chimeric CSF-1R-PDGFRβ receptor mutants, the Y740F,Y751F (amino acid numbering corresponds with the human PDGFRβ) mutant was generated through two rounds of mutagenic PCR performed on the pBluescript II SK+ PDGFRβ construct and inserted into a pCI-Blast construct containing only the extracellular domain of CSF-1R. 6) Rat MMP-2-promoter-pGL3B, the region from –1561 to –244 (+1 = A of translation start) of the rat MMP-2 promoter was cloned into pGL3Basic (27Bottles K.D.

Human MMP-2-promoter-pGL3B, the region ∼2.6 kb upstream of the translation start of MMP-2 was PCR-amplified from BAC clone RPCI11-M17 (Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA). The region, from –2565 to –228 of the human MMP-2 promoter, was subsequently cloned into pGL3-Basic. Phenotypic Modulation of VSMCs Occurs Concomitantly with Increased MMP-2 Expression but Is Delayed in Response to PDGF-BB When Compared with IGF-I—In response to several extracellular factors, VSMCs execute a program of de-differentiation that results in the down-regulation of contractile markers and the up-regulation of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar, 2Thyberg J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 169: 183-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Owens G.K.

We have developed a culture model that mimics a number of aspects of this VSMC phenotypic modulation. This involves growing WKY-HSMCs isolated from rat heart microvasculature to post-confluence, followed by 2 days of serum deprivation. Previous studies have demonstrated that such treatment potentiates the maintenance of the contractile VSMC phenotype (28Ma X. Wang Y. Stephens N.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1206-C1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other previously described cultured adult aortic SMCs, WKY-HSMCs assume a hill-and-valley monolayer when post-confluent and express the known markers for the differentiated SMC phenotype (29Lemire J.M. Covin C.W. White S. Giachelli C.M. Schwartz S.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1068-1081PubMed Google Scholar, 30Rao R.S. Miano J.M. Olson E.N. Seidel C.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 36: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Importantly, they express SM myosin heavy chain, which distinguishes SMCs from other contractile cells such as myofibroblasts and is considered to be a key marker of differentiated SMCs (3Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). To characterize our VSMC model, cells were grown on coverslips and subsequently fixed and stained to examine stress fiber organization. In the absence of de-differentiating factors, WKY-HSMCs displayed prominent stress fibers, consistent with the contractile phenotype, given that stress fiber formation is dependent on force generation (32Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Stimulation with IGF-I or PDGF-BB induced a gradual loss of stress fibers 48 h post-stimulation, consistent with a migratory, non-contractile phenotype (Fig. 1). An examination of gene expression revealed that, in response to IGF-I, WKY-HSMCs down-regulated their expression of several markers of the contractile/differentiated VSMC phenotype, including SM α-actin, SM myosin heavy chain, SM22α, and calponin (Fig. 2A). Several studies have demonstrated that IGF-I stimulates the migration of VSMCs in part by increasing the expression of proteolytic enzymes (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar, 2Thyberg J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 169: 183-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Owens G.K. Physiol.

Cardiol. 1996; 11: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we found that, concomitant with the loss of contractile markers, IGF-I stimulated an increased expression of MMP-2, both at the message level (Fig. 2A) and in protein accumulated in conditioned medium (Fig. 2D). The expression of TIMP-2 was not significantly altered and was used as a standard in both mRNA and protein analysis for monitoring changes in MMP-2 expression. We also noted an increased level of MT1-MMP message and a transiently decreased level of TIMP-1 message (Fig. 2A), consistent with the idea that IGF-I-mediated activation of VSMCs resulted in a migratory phenotype. PDGF-BB stimulation also resulted in the down-regulation of SM α-actin mRNA, but this was delayed by at least 12 h or more when compared with IGF-I treatment (Fig. 2B). PDGF-BB-mediated MMP-2 up-regulation was similarly delayed compared with IGF-I, which caused a more rapid, as well as a more robust, response (Fig. 2B). Increasing the stimulatory dose of either growth factor resulted in an increased, but not a more rapid, up-regulation of MMP-2 (Fig. 2C). Importantly, delayed induction of MMP-2 message by PDGF-BB also resulted in a delayed increase of MMP-2 protein, as measured by gelatin zymography (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that, in this VSMC model, both PDGF-BB and IGF-I induce phenotypic modulation but that IGF-I does so more rapidly. These findings also suggest that changes in MMP-2 expression are part of the program of VSMC phenotypic modulation, given that SM α-actin down-regulation and MMP-2 up-regulation show similar kinetics in response to both IGF-I and PDGF-BB. The Delay in PDGF-BB-versus IGF-I-induced MMP-2 Regulation Occurs at the Transcriptional Level—Previous studies have shown that decreased expression of SM α-actin during VSMC phenotypic modulation occurs at least in part due to decreased transcription (33Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To determine if increased MMP-2 expression is similarly due to growth factor-mediated changes in MMP-2 transcription, we developed a luciferase reporter construct incorporating a fragment (∼1.3 kb) of the rat MMP-2 promoter and used this in transient transfection assays. Cells were transfected with the reporter construct, and then split into parallel culture wells for treatment with growth factors. Both PDGF-BB and IGF-I stimulated increased activity of the MMP-2 promoter (Fig. 3A), suggesting that both growth factors have the ability to regulate MMP-2 transcription; however, no delay could be detected in th"
https://openalex.org/W2040754722,"Survivin, a member of the inhibitory apoptosis protein family, gives rise, by an alternative splicing, to four variants with different functions. Many experimental studies indicate that p53 can regulate the expression of survivin and some of its splice variants. Although both the expression of survivin splice variants and the p53 gene were frequently altered in human cancers, nothing is known about their interactions in in vivo tumour samples. Here, we report that, in 162 breast carcinomas, p53 mutations are significantly associated with an increased expression of survivin and, in particular, its antiapoptotic splice variants (survivin-DeltaEx3 and survivin-3B). The upregulation of these variant expressions is particularly related to p53 mutations occurring in the residues belonging to the tetramerization domain. The loss of heterozygosity in the p53 gene is also associated with an increased expression of the survivin-DeltaEx3 variant. The expression of the proapoptotic variants (survivin-2B and survivin-2alpha) is not affected by any of these alterations. Our results provide for the first time in vivo evidence that, in human breast cancer, the survivin expression as well as its splicing depends on the p53 status. The results also suggest that the upregulation of antiapoptotic survivin variant expression by the mutant p53 may increase breast cancer cells survival and resistance to therapy."

HIV-1 variants that utilize CCR5 as a coreceptor, R5 isolates, mediate transmission and predominate throughout most of the asymptomatic phase of infection. In many cases, coincident with the decline in immune function, variants emerge that can utilize a range of coreceptors in addition to CCR5, in particular CXCR4 (10Connor R.I. Sheridan K.E.

Virol. 1993; 67: 3978-3988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of a subset of CD4i antibodies are tyrosine-rich and tyrosine-sulfated. Like the CCR5 amino terminus, sulfation of these CDR3 regions is critical for the ability of these antibodies to bind gp120 and neutralize infection. Unlike most anti-gp120-neutralizing antibodies, these tyrosine-sulfated antibodies preferentially neutralize R5 rather than X4 isolates. Here we demonstrate that the CDR3 region of one such antibody, expressed as peptide, is capable of binding and precipitating HIV-1 gp120 and of inhibiting HIV-1 infection more efficiently than peptides based on the amino terminus of CCR5. This antibody-derived peptide is sensitive to alterations in gp120 that disrupt association with CCR5. Association of this peptide with gp120 is sulfate-dependent and enhanced by, but not dependent on, the presence of CD4. Our data provide further structural insight into the association of gp120 with the CCR5 amino terminus and raise the possibility that the tyrosine sulfate-binding domain of HIV-1 gp120 can be a useful target of anti-viral therapies.

Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and the human T cell line PM1, which expresses CCR5, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Immunoprecipitation of gp120—293T cells transfected with plasmids expressing peptide-Ig variants and, unless noted, a plasmid expressing TPST-2, were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine. Labeled supernatants were harvested 2 days post-transfection. In parallel, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the gp120 molecules of the HIV-1 isolates ADA, JR-FL, YU2, and HXB2 and metabolically labeled in the same manner. Protein was quantified by SDS-PAGE and diluted to equivalent concentrations. 500 μlof gp120-containing supernatant was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 300 μl of diluted supernatants containing peptide-Ig protein. Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the mixture, which was subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was washed twice with PBS and 1% CHAPSO (Anatrace) and once with PBS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments (Fig. 1B, for example), CD4-Ig was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, incubated with supernatants containing radiolabeled gp120 and supernatants containing radiolabeled pE51-Ig, p412d-Ig, p17b-Ig, or radiolabeled single-chain variants of the E51 or 412d antibodies (E51 scFv, 413 scFv (37Choe H.

Purification of Peptide-Ig Proteins—293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p17b-Ig, CD4-Ig, nR5-Ig, pΔE51-Ig, or variants thereof, and, except if noted otherwise, cotransfected with a plasmid encoding TPST-2. One day post-transfection, cells were washed and subsequently incubated in 293 SFM II medium (Invitrogen). Medium was harvested after 48 h and proteins precipitated with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 16 h. Beads were washed in PBS with 0.5 m NaCl, eluted with 50 mm sodium citrate/50 mm glycine (pH 2), and adjusted with NaOH to pH 7.4. Purified proteins were concentrated with Centricon filters (Amicon) and dialyzed in PBS. Protein amounts were quantified by comparison to bovine serum albumin standards in a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. Infection Assay—293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the genome of the NL4-3 HIV-1 isolate, modified to express the R5X4 envelope glycoprotein of the 89.6 isolate and GFP, or with an NL4-3 variant with a deletion in the env gene and cotransfected with the envelope glyocproteins of the ADA, YU2, NL4-3, JR-FL, SG3, or HXB2 isolates, or with the G protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (18Farzan M.

Supernatants of transfected cells were harvested, and reverse transcriptase activity was measured, as described previously (3Choe H. Farzan M. Sun Y. Sullivan N. Rollins B. Ponath P.D. Wu L.

These supernatants, diluted to 20,000 reverse transcriptase counts per ml, were added to PM1, GHOST-CXCR4, or GHOST-CCR5 cells in the presence of the indicated concentrations of p17b-Ig, nCCR5-Ig, pΔE51-Ig, and CD4-Ig. Media were changed the following day and GFP expression in infected cells was measured 2 days later by flow cytometry. The amino terminus of CCR5 includes several sulfated tyrosines that are critical to its role as an HIV-1 coreceptor (23Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

Tyrosine-sulfated peptides based on sequences from the CCR5 amino terminus bind HIV-1 gp120 and inhibit HIV-1 infection (24Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C.

A subset of CD4-inducible antibodies also utilize tyrosine sulfate to recognize the CCR5-binding region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (37Choe H. Li W. Wright P.L. Vasilieva N. Venturi M. Huang C.C. Grundner C. Dorfman T. Zwick M.B. Wang L. Rosenberg E.S. Kwong P.D. Burton D.R. Robinson J.E. Sodroski J.G. Farzan M.

We therefore sought to determine whether peptides deriving from the sulfated heavy-chain CDR3 regions of these antibodies bound gp120 and slowed infection more efficiently than peptides based on CCR5 sequences. A series of plasmids was generated that express the heavychain CDR3 regions of the CD4-inducible antibodies 412d, 17b, C12, 47e, and E51 fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (p412d-Ig, p17b-Ig, pC12-Ig p47e-Ig, and pE51-Ig; see Table 1). These plasmids, as well as one expressing the amino terminus of CCR5 also fused to the same Fc region (pR5-Ig), were cotransfected into 293T cells with a plasmid expressing human TPST-2. We have previously shown (37Choe H. Li W. Wright P.L. Vasilieva N. Venturi M. Huang C.C. Grundner C. Dorfman T. Zwick M.B. Wang L. Rosenberg E.S. Kwong P.D. Burton D.R. Robinson J.E. Sodroski J.G.

Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine. Cell supernatants, or sera from HIV-1-infected patients, were incubated with metabolically labeled gp120 (derived from the ADA isolate) and protein A-Sepharose, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Of the CDR3-Ig fusion proteins, only pE51-Ig detectably precipitated gp120 (Fig. 1A). Of note, pR5-Ig did not immunoprecipitate gp120, consistent with the relatively low affinity of sulfated CCR5-derived peptides for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.TABLE 1Peptide sequences characterized in this studyPeptide originSequenceCCR5 N terminusMDYQVSSPIYDINYYTSEPSQKE51 CDR3NSIAGVAAAGDYADYDGGYYYDMD412d CDR3PYPNDYNDYAPEEGMSWYFD47e CDR3GGEDGDYLSDPFYYNHGMDC12 CDR3DVGPDWDNDDYYDRSGRGVFD17b CDR3VYEGEADEGEYDNNGFLK Open table in a new tab To confirm a specific association between pE51-Ig and gp120, we used an alternative strategy in which CD4-bound gp120 was used to precipitate various CDR3-Ig and single-chain antibody proteins (Fig. 1B). Radiolabeled pE51-Ig, p412d-Ig, p17b-Ig, and single-chain variants of the sulfated antibodies E51 and 412d (E51 scFV, 412d scFv) were incubated with Sepharose beads conjugated to CD4-Ig and radiolabeled gp120. CD4-bound gp120 precipitated both single-chain antibodies. However, CD4-bound gp120 precipitated only pE51-Ig but not p412d-Ig or p17b-Ig. Together with the data of Fig. 1A, these data demonstrate a specific association between gp120 and pE51-Ig. We also assayed two variants of pE51-Ig for their ability to bind HIV-1 gp120. In one, pΔE51-Ig, the first nine uncharged residues of pE51-Ig were deleted. In a second, the final three (of five) tyrosines were altered to glutamic acid. This pE51-Ig variant is described as YYEEE-Ig to indicate the amino acids present at the five tyrosines of unmodified pE51-Ig (see Table 2 for pE51-Ig variant names and peptide sequences). As shown in Fig. 1C, pΔE51-Ig immunoprecipitated gp120 with an efficiency comparable with pE51-Ig, whereas YYEEE-Ig could not detectably bind gp120.TABLE 2Characterized pE51-Ig variantsSequenceBinding to gp120NameNSIAGVAAAGDYADYDGGYYYDMD+++pE51NSIAGVAAAGDYADYDGGEEEDMD-YYEEE.........

DYADYDGGYYYDGG+++PE51(12) Open table in a new tab We next assayed the ability of pE51-Ig, pΔE51-Ig, YYEEE-Ig, and patient sera to immunoprecipitate the gp120 proteins of clade B isolates YU2, JR-FL, ADA, and HXBc2 (Fig. 2). YU2, JR-FL, and ADA envelope glycoproteins utilize CCR5 to infect cells, whereas HXBc2 utilizes the coreceptor CXCR4. YU2 gp120 bound pE51-Ig and pΔE51-Ig as efficiently as ADA gp120, whereas that of JR-FL and HXBc2 bound pE51-Ig and pΔE51-Ig detectably, but less efficiently. In each case the addition of soluble CD4 enhanced association. YYEEE-Ig did not precipitate the gp120 of any isolate assayed. These data indicate some variation in affinity of the gp120 of clade B isolates for pE51-Ig and pΔE51-Ig and suggest that, like the E51 antibody, these fusion proteins bind a CD4-inducible epitope on gp120. We further defined the determinants on pΔE51-Ig essential for association with gp120 (Fig. 3). We characterized a series of pΔE51-Ig variants, in which each of the five tyrosines were individually altered to phenylalanine or to aspartic acid. Alteration of any of the five tyrosines to phenylalanine abolished detectable gp120 association. Alteration of the first four tyrosines to aspartic acid similarly abolished gp120 binding, whereas alteration of the fifth tyrosine diminished, but did not abolish, gp120 association. In this experiment we also assayed the contribution of pΔE51-Ig sulfation to its association with gp120 by expressing pΔE51-Ig in the absence of exogenous TPST-2. We have previously shown that protein overexpressed in 293T cells is not efficiently sulfated without the coexpression of exogenous TPST-2 (37Choe H. Li W. Wright P.L. Vasilieva N. Venturi M. Huang C.C. Grundner C. Dorfman T. Zwick M.B. Wang L. Rosenberg E.S. Kwong P.D. Burton D.R. Robinson J.E. Sodroski J.G. Farzan M. Cell. 2003; 114: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). pΔE51-Ig expressed in the absence of exogenous TPST-2 could not detectably precipitate gp120 (Fig. 3). These data suggest a critical role for tyrosines, and for sulfate groups on these tyrosines, in the ability of pΔE51-Ig to immunoprecipate gp120. To identify the region of gp120 bound by pE51-Ig, gp120 variants were generated in which each of three gp120 residues (residues 420, 421, and 422), previously demonstrated to be critical for association of gp120 to CCR5, were altered to alanine (40Rizzuto C.D. Wyatt R. Hernandez-Ramos N. Sun Y. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Sodroski J. Science. 1998; 280: 1949-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). As described, each of these variants bound CD4-Ig and was recognized by patient sera with comparable efficiency (Fig. 4A). However, none of these gp120 variants detectably bound pΔE51-Ig (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that pΔE51-Ig specifically binds gp120 in a region critical for its association with CCR5. If so, they also localize the tyrosine sulfate-binding region of gp120 to residues 420 through 422. Sulfated peptides based on the amino terminus of CCR5 specifically block HIV-1 infection, but only at 50–100 μm concentrations (24Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C.

Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ability of pΔE51-Ig, but not pR5-Ig, to precipitate gp120 in the presence and absence of CD4 suggested that pΔE51-Ig may be more effective at inhibiting HIV-1 infection. Accordingly, CD4-Ig, pΔE51-Ig, pR5-Ig, and p17b-Ig were compared for their ability to inhibit infection of an HIV-1 variant expressing GFP and the envelope glycoprotein of the R5X4 isolate 89.6 (Fig. 5A). Virus was incubated with the CD4-positive T-cell line PM1 and the indicated fusion proteins for 1 h and then washed. As we and others have previously reported for sulfated CCR5-derived peptides (24Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C. Dragic T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2000; 97: 5762-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 41Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), pR5-Ig partially inhibited infection at a concentration of ∼40 μm, whereas p17b-Ig had no detectable effect on HIV-1 entry. Consistent with its ability to bind gp120, pΔE51-Ig inhibited infection markedly more efficiently than did pR5-Ig, with 50% inhibition observed at ∼2 μm. Expectedly, CD4-Ig blocked infection in the nanomolar range. Similar results were obtained using a broader range of envelope glycoproteins of clade B isolates (Fig. 5, B and C). Infection mediated by the envelope glycoproteins of the R5 isolates ADA, YU2, JR-FL, and of the X4 isolates HXB2 and NL4-3 was inhibited by pΔE51-Ig, comparably that of the 89.6 isolate, and for all isolates pΔE51 inhibited entry more efficiently than pR5-Ig. However, the clade C isolate SG3 was only modestly inhibited by pΔE51. In addition, HIV-1 pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein was not substantially inhibited by pΔE51 (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that pΔE51-Ig neutralizes a broad range of HIV-1 isolates more efficiently than does pR5-Ig. Here we demonstrate that a peptide based on the tyrosine-sulfated CDR3 region of the antibody E51, fused to the Fc region of human IgG1, could immunoprecipitate gp120 of several clade B HIV-1 isolates. In contrast, an analogous fusion protein based on the tyrosine-sulfated amino terminus of CCR5 could not detectable precipitate gp120. This latter construct inhibited HIV-1 infection at approximately the same high concentration required for synthetic sulfated peptides, whereas the IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) of pΔE51-Ig was at least 10-fold lower. pΔE51-Ig has several notable properties. First, although its binding to gp120 appears to be enhanced by the presence of CD4, its association did not require CD4, suggesting that a tyrosine sulfate-binding pocket on gp120 is exposed in the absence of CD4. Second, most of its five tyrosines contribute to gp120 association. Third, as is the case with CCR5 and the E51 antibody, association of pΔE51-Ig with gp120 depends on sulfation of one or more tyrosines. Fourth, binding of pΔE51-Ig was abolished by gp120 alterations that most potently interfered with CCR5 association, localizing the interaction of this peptide, and presumably the sulfated region of CCR5, to this conserved region of gp120. The conservation of a tyrosine sulfate-binding pocket, and its exposure in the absence of CD4, suggest that this region of gp120 may be a useful therapeutic target. The present study shows that it is possible to enhance the antiviral activities of peptides that are similar to the CCR5 amino terminus. The basis of this enhancement is unclear, but replacement of hydrophobic residues, which may point into the body of CCR5 (Table 3), with glycines likely increases both the solubility and flexibility of the peptide. The elimination of additional residues separating tyrosine 3 and tyrosine 10 of CCR5 may permit binding of an additional sulfated tyrosine to gp120 without the entropic penalty of folding the small intervening loop.TABLE 3Alignment of pΔE51 and the CCR5 amino terminuspΔE51GDY....ADYDGGYYYDMDCCR5MDYQVSSPIYDINYYTSEP Open table in a new tab Although more efficient than CCR5-based peptides in inhibiting HIV-1 infection, pΔE51-Ig is still not sufficiently potent for therapeutic use. These studies nonetheless suggest that the sulfate-binding pocket, which is conserved both in R5 and X4 isolates, may be an important therapeutic target. Peptides like pΔE51 may also be useful when fused to soluble CD4 or other protein inhibitors of HIV-1 entry. Such fusion proteins would likely exhibit higher affinity than their unmodified counterparts and may limit viral escape. Finally, these studies suggest that work identifying additional sulfated antibodies may yield more potent entry inhibitors and provide additional insight into the CCR5 determinants necessary for its association with gp120."

SP desensitized NK1Rwt, NK1RΔ5K/R, and NK1RΔ10K/R. However, NK1RΔ5K/R and NK1RΔ10K/R resensitized 4–8-fold faster than NK1Rwt by cycloheximide-independent mechanisms. NK1RΔ325 (a naturally occurring truncated variant) showed incomplete desensitization, followed by a marked sensitization of signaling.

However, in comparison with endocytosis, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of post-endocytic sorting of GPCRs back to the plasma membrane (recycling) or to lysosomes or proteasomes (down-regulation). The nature of interaction between GPCRs and β-arrestins determines the rate of receptor recycling. GPCRs can be divided into two classes according to their interaction with β-arrestins (18Oakley R.H.

The existence of Ser and Thr residues within the C-terminal domains of these receptors, which are sites for phosphorylation by G-protein receptor kinases, specifies high affinity interactions with β-arrestins and therefore determines the rates of recycling (21Oakley R.H.

The concentration of agonist can also markedly influence the rate of receptor recycling, possibly by affecting the extent of receptor phosphorylation. For example, the trafficking of the NK1R is markedly influenced by the concentration of its agonist, substance P (SP). After stimulation with low concentrations (<1nm) of SP, the NK1R is minimally phosphorylated, internalizes into endosomes immediately beneath the plasma membrane, and rapidly dissociates from β-arrestins to recycle by Rab4a- and Rab11a-dependent mechanisms (23Kwatra M.M.

In contrast, higher concentrations (>10 nm) of SP induce rapid and extensive phosphorylation of the NK1R, internalization into early endosomes in a perinuclear location, and association with β-arrestins for prolonged periods (8McConalogue K.

The ubiquitination of cell-surface receptors and associated proteins such as β-arrestins has emerged as an important step in endocytic and post-endocytic sorting of these proteins (27Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 28Wojcikiewicz R.J. Trends Pharmacol.

Ubiquitin, a protein of 76 amino acids, is attached to lysine residues of target proteins by a mechanism that is catalyzed by three enzymes. The ubiquitin-activating enzyme uses ATP to “charge” the ubiquitin molecule to form a ubiquitin C-terminal adenylate. The activated ubiquitin molecule is then passed to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Finally, although not in all cases, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3) bind to the target protein and attach the C terminus of ubiquitin to lysine residues of the target. Although most species express a single ubiquitin-activating enzyme, larger numbers of ubiquitin-conjugating and E3 enzymes provide specificity and scope for regulation. Several GPCRs are ubiquitinated. In yeast, the agonists of the α-mating factor receptors Ste2p and Ste3p induce their ubiquitination, a step that is required for internalization and trafficking (29Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 30Roth A.F. Davis N.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).

Nothing is known about the role of ubiquitination in the trafficking of the NK1R. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic stimulation by agonists on the trafficking and signaling of the NK1R and to determine the contributions of ubiquitination to these processes. The NK1R is a class B receptor that is not normally targeted to the degradative pathway and efficiently recycles, although the time for resensitization of signaling depends upon the concentration of agonist used (25Roosterman D. Cottrell G.S. Schmidlin F. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30670-30679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that sustained exposure of the NK1R to high concentrations of SP would down-regulate the receptor because of ubiquitination of intracellular lysine residues. To assess down-regulation, we examined the effects of chronic stimulation with SP on Ca2+ signaling, trafficking, degradation, and ubiquitination of the NK1R. To establish the role of intracellular lysine residues and ubiquitin, we engineered mutant receptors lacking either lysine residues in the C-terminal tail or on the entire intracellular face of the receptor and generated a chimeric molecule of the NK1R conjugated to ubiquitin. Reagents—Antibodies were from the following sources: rabbit anti-NK1R antibody 94168 (35Grady E.F. Baluk P. Böhm S. Gamp P.D. Wong H. Payan D.G. Ansel J. Portbury A.L. Furness J.B. McDonald D.M.

(Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-polyubiquitin antibody FK1 (IgM) from Affiniti (Exeter, UK); high affinity rat antibody HA.11 from Roche Applied Science; mouse anti-FLAG antibody M2 and rabbit anti-FLAG, mouse anti-β-actin, and rabbit anti-γ-tubulin antibodies from Sigma; goat anti-mouse or anti-rat IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Rhodamine Red-X from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA); goat anti-mouse IgM and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 from Invitrogen; and goat anti-mouse IRDye™ 800 from Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc. (Gilbertsville, PA). An Alexa Fluor 594 labeling kit was from Invitrogen. SP and [Sar9,Met(O2)11]substance P (where Sar is sarcosine; SM-SP) were from Bachem (Torrance, CA). SM-SP was labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (referred to as Alexa-SM-SP) as described (9Schmidlin F. Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Grady E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were from Sigma Genosys (Woodlands, TX). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Vector Construction—cDNA encoding the rat NK1R with an N-terminal FLAG epitope was subcloned into pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen) (36Vigna S.R. Bowden J.J. McDonald D.M. Fisher J. Okamoto A. McVey D.C. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 834-845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The NK1R conjugated to a ubiquitin molecule (NK1R-Ub) was created by cloning the wild-type NK1R (NK1Rwt) cDNA in-frame into ubiquitin (see Fig. 1). Briefly, ubiquitin was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT with an upstream EcoRV site, followed by addition of NK1Rwt lacking a stop codon. Lysine-deficient mutants of the NK1R in which all predicted C-terminal tail lysines (designated NK1RΔ5K/R) or all intracellular lysines (NK1RΔ10K/R) were replaced with arginines were generated using the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (see Fig. 1). Point mutations of one, two, or three lysines to arginines in the C-terminal tail of the NK1R were similarly generated (see Fig. 1). For NK1RΔ10K/R, the N-terminal FLAG epitope was exchanged with the HA.11 epitope by PCR. 3Primer sequences are available on request. All constructs were sequenced. Cell Lines—Kirsten sarcoma virus-transformed normal rat kidney (KNRK) cells (epithelial; American Tissue Type Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C (36Vigna S.R.

KNRK-FLP cells (created with the Flp-In™ system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines) (33Jacob C. Cottrell G.S. Gehringer D. Schmidlin F. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol.

Stable cell lines were created by cotransfection with pcDNA5/FRT and pOG44, a vector that transiently expresses the Flp recombinase (Invitrogen). Cells were placed in medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. After 7–10 days, viable cells were pooled, and gene expression was assessed by Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and Ca2+ signaling. Cells were maintained in 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. KNRK cells expressing a truncation mutant of the NK1R corresponding to a natural variant (KNRK-NK1RΔ325 cells) were created and maintained as described previously (37Böhm S.K. Khitin L.M.

In some experiments, KNRK cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Activation of the NK1R and Drug Treatments—Cells were incubated with vehicle (control) or with 100 nm SP or SM-SP (unless stated otherwise) in Opti-MEM I. To inhibit new protein synthesis, cells were preincubated with cycloheximide (140 μm). The proteolytic activity of the proteasome was inhibited using epoxomicin (10 μm). Intracellular Ca2+ release was stimulated by thapsigargin (1 μm). All inhibitors were added 1 h prior to stimulation with SP or SM-SP. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1% SDS, boiled, and centrifuged. Lysates (10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8 or 10% acrylamide), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon FL, Millipore Corp.), and incubated with blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer with primary antibody (anti-ubiquitin P4D1 (1:5000), anti-ubiquitin FK1 (1:1000), anti-NK1R 94168 (1:5000), anti-FLAG polyclonal (1:5000), anti-β-actin (1:20,000), or anti-γ-tubulin (1:10,000)) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed and then incubated with secondary antibody coupled to either Alexa Fluor 680 or IRDye™ 800 (1:10,000–20,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were viewed using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). To deglycosylate the NK1R, a sonicated lysate was treated with the enzymes peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs), O-glycosidase, sialidase, β-galactosidase, and glucosaminidase (QA Bio, San Mateo, CA) in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) overnight at 37 °C. Membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation—For denaturing immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1% SDS, sonicated, and mixed with 4 volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm Na2P4O7, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The lysate was mixed by pipetting, and radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was added to a 1-ml final volume and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. For nondenaturing immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 30 min at 4 °C, scraped, and centrifuged. Supernatants from denaturing and nondenaturing preparations were rotated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 (3.5 μg/ml) or antibody HA.11 (250 ng/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G PLUS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added (30 μl), and samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were pelleted, washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, boiled in Laemmli buffer with β-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by Western blotting. Densitometry—Signals on Western blots were quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system. To quantify NK1R degradation, NK1R signals were compared with β-actin and γ-tubulin signals. To quantify ubiquitination, ubiquitinated NK1R signals were compared with total NK1R signals. Fluorescence Microscopy—To localize the NK1R, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) for 20 min at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with primary antibody (anti-NK1R 94168 or anti-FLAG M2 (1:500)) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin and 1% goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate or Rhodamine Red-X (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature. To examine NK1R recycling, live cells were incubated with antibodies to the extracellular epitopes (anti-FLAG M2 for NK1Rwt and NK1RΔ5K/R and HA.11 for NK1RΔ10K/R (1:100)) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed, incubated with SP or vehicle for 3 h, washed, and incubated in SP-free medium for 4 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and incubated with secondary antibody as described above. To examine binding and internalization of fluorescently tagged SM-SP, cells were incubated with Alexa-SM-SP for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and fixed. Cells were observed using Zeiss Axiovert and Bio-Rad MRC1000 confocal microscopes with a Zeiss Plan Apo ×100 (numerical aperture of 1.3) objective. Images were collected at a zoom of 1–2 (iris of <3 μm), and typically, 5–10 optical sections were taken at intervals of 0.5 μm. Images were colored to represent the appropriate fluorophores and processed to adjust contrast and brightness using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, CA). Measurement of [Ca2+]i—Cells were incubated with 2.5 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C and washed. Fluorescence was measured at 340 and 380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission in a Hitachi F-2500 spectrophotometer The ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to [Ca2+]i, was calculated. Statistics—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three or more experiments and were compared by analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Kuels test (multiple comparisons) or Student's t test (two comparisons), with p < 0.05 considered significant.

To examine the importance of ubiquitination for the trafficking and regulation of the NK1R, we generated a chimeric receptor composed of the wild-type receptor conjugated to a ubiquitin molecule (NK1R-Ub) and mutant receptors lacking all lysine residues in the C-terminal tail (NK1RΔ5K/R) or on the entire intracellular face of the NK1R (NK1RΔ10K/R) (Fig. 1). We also studied a truncated form of the NK1R (NK1RΔ325) lacking 83 residues of the C-terminal tail, including four lysines, which may correspond to a naturally occurring variant of this receptor (40Boyd N.D. White C.F. Cerpa R. Kaiser E.T. Leeman S.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 41Fong T.M. Anderson S.A. Yu H. Huang R.R. Strader C.D. Mol.

To verify that the chimeric, mutant, and truncated NK1Rs were appropriately localized at the plasma membrane of unstimulated cells, we used immunofluorescence. Using antibody 94168 against the C terminus of the NK1R (for NK1Rwt and lysine mutants) or antibody against the extracellular FLAG epitope (for NK1RΔ325), we detected NK1Rwt, NK1RΔ5K/R, NK1RΔ10K/R, and NK1RΔ325 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). Thus, mutation of lysine residues or truncation of the C-terminal tail does not affect targeting of the receptors to the plasma membrane. In contrast, NK1R-Ub (detected using antibody 94168) did not traffic to the plasma membrane, but was instead localized in an unidentified subcellular compartment (Fig. 2). This receptor was not studied further. To determine whether agonists induce endocytosis of the wild-type and lysine-deficient receptors, we incubated cells with Alexa-SM-SP. When cells were incubated at 4 °C, Alexa-SM-SP was confined to the plasma membrane of cells expressing NK1Rwt, NK1RΔ5K/R, or NK1RΔ10K/R (Fig. 3). After 30 min at 37 °C, Alexa-SM-SP was comple"

Although the biochemical processes underlying DNA repair and apoptosis have been extensively studied, the mechanisms by which cells determine whether the damage will be repaired or the apoptotic pathway will be activated is largely unknown. We have studied the role of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in cisplatin DNA damage-induced apoptotic cell death using both normal human fibroblasts and NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) XPA and XPG cells. The caspase-3 activation experiment demonstrated a greatly increased casapse-3 activation in the NER-defective cells following cisplatin treatment. The flow cytometry experiment revealed an altered cell cycle arrest pattern of the NER-defective cells following cisplatin treatment. The results obtained from the Western blot experiment showed that NER defects resulted in enhanced CHK1 phosphorylation and p21 induction after cisplatin treatment. The cisplatin treatment-induced ATM phosphorylation, however, was attenuated in NER-defective cells. The results obtained from our immunoprecipitation experiment further demonstrated that the ATM protein interacted with the TFIIH basal transcription factor and the XPG protein of the NER pathway. It also showed that a functional XPC protein was required for the association of the ATM protein to genomic DNA. These results suggest that the NER process may prevent the cisplatin treatment-induced apoptosis by activating the ATM protein, and that the presence of the XPC protein is essential for recruiting the ATM protein to the DNA template. DNA damage can lead to either DNA repair with cell survival or to apoptotic cell death. Although the biochemical processes underlying DNA repair and apoptosis have been extensively studied, the mechanisms by which cells determine whether the damage will be repaired or the apoptotic pathway will be activated is largely unknown. We have studied the role of nucleotide excision repair (NER) in cisplatin DNA damage-induced apoptotic cell death using both normal human fibroblasts and NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) XPA and XPG cells. The caspase-3 activation experiment demonstrated a greatly increased casapse-3 activation in the NER-defective cells following cisplatin treatment. The flow cytometry experiment revealed an altered cell cycle arrest pattern of the NER-defective cells following cisplatin treatment. The results obtained from the Western blot experiment showed that NER defects resulted in enhanced CHK1 phosphorylation and p21 induction after cisplatin treatment. The cisplatin treatment-induced ATM phosphorylation, however, was attenuated in NER-defective cells. The results obtained from our immunoprecipitation experiment further demonstrated that the ATM protein interacted with the TFIIH basal transcription factor and the XPG protein of the NER pathway. It also showed that a functional XPC protein was required for the association of the ATM protein to genomic DNA. These results suggest that the NER process may prevent the cisplatin treatment-induced apoptosis by activating the ATM protein, and that the presence of the XPC protein is essential for recruiting the ATM protein to the DNA template. The involvement of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein activation in nucleotide excision repair-facilitated cell survival with cisplatin treatment.

However, cancer cells can avoid this DNA damage-induced cell death through several mechanisms. DNA repair is one of the most important mechanisms that prevent DNA damage-induced cell death (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Although many studies have been done regarding DNA repair and apoptosis (2Edinger A.L. Thompson C.B. Curr. Opin.

The lack of such knowledge has significantly limited our understandings of cancer cell drug resistance and hindered our abilities in the design and development of new drugs for effective cancer treatment.

The XPG protein makes a 3′ incision, which is followed bya5′ incision made by the XPF/ERCC1, resulting in a single-stranded gap of 27–32 nucleotides (17O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The DNA polymerases (pol ϵ or pol δ) fill the gap and the DNA ligase seals the gap to complete the DNA repair process. Interestingly, defects in most of the NER proteins, including XPA, XPB, XPD, XPF and XPG, lead to elevated sensitivities of the cells to many DNA damaging reagents. However, defects of XPC and XPE proteins do not cause increased sensitivity of the cells to DNA damaging treatment (18Furuta T. Ueda T. Aune G. Sarasin A. Kraemer K.H. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4899-4902PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, studying the DNA damage-mediated signaling process in these NER-defective cells will provide important insights into the mechanism of DNA repair in preventing DNA damage-induced apoptosis. DNA damage also promotes cell cycle checkpoint regulation. Both ATM and ATR proteins play important roles in DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint regulation (19Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Xu B. Canman C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

This causes cell cycle arrest at both the G1 and G2/M checkpoints, which allow DNA repair to take place and result in cell survival after DNA damaging treatment. Therefore, the activation of ATM/ATR proteins is essential for cell survival to various DNA damaging treatments. We have studied the mechanisms by which the NER process prevents cisplatin treatment-induced apoptosis. Using both normal human fibroblasts (NF) and NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA) and group G (XPG) cells, we have demonstrated that the NER defects caused an increased caspase-3 activation after cisplatin treatment. The results obtained from our Western blots reveal that cisplatin treatment results in enhanced CHK1 phosphorylation and p21 induction in both XPA and XPG cells. In contrast, cisplatin treatment-induced ATM phosphorylation at Ser-1981 is attenuated in XPA and XPG cells. The results obtained from our immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments indicate that the ATM protein interacts with the TFIIH basal transcription factor, and that this interaction also requires the presence of the XPG protein. In addition, the IP results further reveal the requirement of a functional XPC protein for the association of the ATM protein to genomic DNA. These results suggest that the NER process may prevent cisplatin treatment-induced apoptosis by activating the ATM pathway, which in turn, enhances cell cycle arrest to allow for DNA repair to take place. The DNA damage recognition and binding of XPC protein helps recruit the ATM protein to the DNA template. These results provide an important insight into the mechanism by which the NER pathway coordinates with other cellular processes including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in determining the fate of damaged cells. Cell Lines and siRNAs—The NF (GM00043), XPA (GM05509), XPC (GM16684), XPG (GM03021), and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) (GM02052) cells were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository (Corriel Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). All the cells are primary fibroblasts and were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2× essential amino acids, nonessential amino acids, and vitamins at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The siRNAs against XPA and XPG genes were synthesized by Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The siRNA against the XPA gene (XPA1 siRNA) contained a sequence of 5′-GGAGGAGGCUUCAUUUUAG-3′ and the siRNA against the XPG gene (XPG1 siRNA) contained a sequence of 5′-GGGAAGAUCCUGGCUGUUG-3′. A control siRNA (Negative Control 2 siRNA) was also purchased from Ambion Inc. The control siRNA did not bind to any known target gene mRNA sequences. Cisplatin Treatment—Cisplatin was purchased from Sigma and prepared fresh before the experiments. Cisplatin was dissolved into dimethyl sulfoxide reagent and added to the cell growth medium at a ratio of 1:2000 to desired final concentrations (0–40 μm). The 10 μm cisplatin is relevant to the dosage used in most of anticancer treatments. The cells were cultured at 37 °C for 3 h. The medium was replaced with fresh cell growth medium and the cells were cultured for various lengths of times before harvesting. For the caspase-3 assay, the cells were harvested 40 h after cisplatin treatment. For the Western blotting assay, the cells were harvested 16 h after the treatment. Caspase-3 Assay—The cells were lysed in insect cell lysis buffer (BD Biosciences). The protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by a BCA assay (Sigma). Caspase-3 assay was performed in a 96-well plate using fluorogenic Ac-DEVD-AMC as a substrate (BD Biosciences). All samples and controls were run in triplicate. Caspase-3 activity was determined by a spectrafluorometer (Molecular Devices) for detecting free AMC released from the substrate during a 15-min incubation period at 37 °C with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 430–460 nm. Caspase-3 activity (nanomole of AMC/min/mg of protein) was determined for each cell lysate. siRNA Treatment—The NF cells were harvested and resuspended into Opti-Med I medium (Invitrogen Inc.) at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/700 μl. The siRNA was added into the medium at 300 nm and the mixture was electroporated with a setting of 250 V/950 μF. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then plated onto 100-mm cell culture dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/dish. The cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. Some cells were collected and lysed in RIPA cell lysis buffer for determining the silencing effect of the siRNAs using a Western blot assay. The rest of the cells were treated with cisplatin (0, 10, 20, and 40 μm) for 3 h and then cultured in fresh medium for various lengths of time before the cells were harvested for the desired assays. Western Blot Assay—The cell lysates were prepared from the cisplatin-treated cells 16 h after the treatment. Western blotting was performed as described previously (36Wang G. Chuang L. Zhang X. Colton S. Dombkowski A. Reiners J. Diakiw A. Xu X.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2231-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The p-ATM (Ser-1981) (10H11.E12), CHK1, CHK2, p-CHK1 (Ser-317), pCHK1 (Ser-345), and pCHK2 (Thr-68) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA). The ATM (2C1), ATR (N-19), DNA-PK (H-163), CDK7 (N-19), p21 (C-19), p62 (Q-19), and p89 (S-19) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). The XPC antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody) was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom). The β-actin antibody (Ab-1) was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). A mouse monoclonal antibody against human ATM protein (8F4) was generated in the laboratory of Dr. Y. A. Wang as described elsewhere (37Shen K. Wang Y. Brooks S.C. Raz A. Wang Y.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Assay—The cells were seeded onto 100-mm dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/dish and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Some of the dishes were treated with 40 or 10 μm cisplatin for 3 h and then replaced with fresh cell growth medium. The cells were incubated at 37 °C and harvested at various lengths of time (day 0, day 1, day 2, and day 3). The cells were washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 70% ethanol. For the flow cytometry assay, the cells were washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline three times and then digested with RNase A (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were stained with 5 μg/ml propidium iodide at room temperature for 10 min and analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience). The cell cycle profile was determined with Modfit LT software. IP Assay—The IP assay was performed using a protocol designed for the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) with some modification. In brief, the cultured cells (40∼50% confluence) were treated with cisplatin (40 μm) for 3 h and then cultured in fresh cell growth medium for 3 h. The cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and then washed with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline three times. The cells were resuspended into SDS lysis buffer (1 × 106 cells/200 μl) and sonicated to shear the genomic DNA to lengths of 200–1000 bp. As controls, the untreated cells were also fixed in 1% formaldehyde and sonicated in the same condition. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatants were collected. For the IP assay, the cell lysate (200 μl) was diluted at a ratio of 1:10 in the chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). A desired primary antibody (2 μg) was then added into the cell lysate and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was incubated with Protein A/G Plus-conjugated agarose beads (40 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were collected and washed three times in a washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl). Half of the beads were analyzed by Western blot for the detection of the desired proteins, including ATM, XPC, CDK7, and p89. The rest of the beads were resuspended into 100 μl of elution buffer (0.1 m NaCO3, 1% SDS, 200 mm NaCl) and incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the protein-DNA cross-links. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The amount of DNA carried by the beads was determined by a quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay for the detection of both β-actin and p53 gene sequences using primers that bind to either the β-actin or p53 gene coding region sequences. The primers used in the Q-PCR assay are the p53 forward primer (5′-CTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACC-3′), the p53 reverse primer (5′-CGTGCAAGTCACAGACTTGGCTG-3′), the β-actin forward primer (5′-GTACGTTGCTATCCAGGCTGTG-3′), and the β-actin reverse primer (5′-CATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAGGTC-3′). The threshold cycle (Ct) obtained from the Q-PCR assay was used to determine the relative amount of DNA pulled down by the beads from individual cell lysates. We have chosen the β-actin and p53 genes as our targets for the Q-PCR assay because of their different responses to the DNA damaging treatment: the level of β-actin protein is not affected by DNA damaging treatment, whereas the level of p53 is increased following most DNA damaging treatments. Statistic Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistically significant differences were determined using a one-factor analysis of variance with p < 0.01. The NER Defects Led to an Increased Caspase-3 Activation after Cisplatin Treatment—Although it is known that NER-defective cells are hypersensitive to many DNA damaging reagents, it is important to determine whether these elevated sensitivities are caused by DNA damage-induced apoptosis or other cellular responses such as necrosis. Therefore, we first determined the cisplatin treatment-induced activation of caspase-3, an important effector caspase indicative of irreversible apoptosis, in the NER-defective XPA and XPG cells (Fig. 1A). As a control, cisplatin treatment-induced caspase-3 activation was also determined in human NF cells (Fig. 1A). The cisplatin treatment-induced caspase-3 activation was also determined in XPC cells, which displayed less sensitivity to the cisplatin treatment (36Wang G. Chuang L. Zhang X. Colton S. Dombkowski A. Reiners J. Diakiw A. Xu X.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2231-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When the NF cells were treated with cisplatin, some caspase-3 activity was detected at high cisplatin concentrations such as 40 μm. However, more increased caspase-3 activity was detected in the NER-defective XPA and XPG cells following cisplatin treatment. For example, when NF cells were treated with cisplatin at 20 μm, only a 2-fold increase of the capsase-3 activity over the untreated cells was detected. When the NER-defective cells were treated with 20 μm cisplatin, however, a 15–20-fold increase of caspase-3 activity over the untreated cells was detected in the XPA and XPG cells, respectively. As a negative control, cisplatin treatment did not cause a significant increase of capsase-3 activity in XPC cells even at 40 μm (Fig. 1A). It was necessary to determine whether the increased caspase-3 activity of XPA and XPG cells following cisplatin treatment was indeed caused by defects of the XPA and XPG proteins, but not the other possible defects carried by these cells. Therefore, we studied further cisplatin treatment-induced caspase-3 activation in NF cells in which the XPA and XPG genes were individually silenced with specific siRNAs (Fig. 1B). As expected, silencing the XPA and XPG genes led to greater caspase-3 activations in NF cells following cisplatin treatment than in those of NF cells in which the XPA and XPG functions remained (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, when both XPA and XPG genes were silenced in the same experiment, more increased caspase-3 activities were detected in NF cells following cisplatin treatment. As a negative control, when the NF cells were treated with a control siRNA (negative control 2 siRNA) at the same concentration, cisplatin treatment-induced caspase-3 activity remained similar to that of the NF cells. These results suggest that a functional NER pathway is required for cell survival from cisplatin treatment and that defects of XPA and/or XPG proteins result in an increased apoptotic cell death of the cells following cisplatin treatment. The NER Defects Resulted in Altered Cell Cycle Arrest following Cisplatin Treatment—The results obtained from our caspase-3 activation assay suggested an important role of the NER process in preventing cisplatin treatment-induced apoptosis. To determine whether the pattern of cisplatin treatment-induced cell cycle arrest was also affected by the NER defects, we conducted a flow cytometry assay for cisplatin-treated NF, XPA, and XPG cells (Fig. 2). Indeed, the pattern of cisplatin treatment-induced cell cycle arrest was affected by NER defects. In NF cells, 40 μm cisplatin treatment caused a more transient accumulation of cells at the G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle. In both XPA and XPG cells, however, the cisplatin treatment-induced G2/M arrest was diminished. Instead, a large proportion of the cells were accumulated at the G1 phase. The sub-G1 cell population, indicative of cell death, also had accumulated over time in cisplatin-treated XPA and XPG cells (Fig. 2). To determine whether cisplatin concentrations have some effect on the cell cycle profile of the cells, we also performed a flow cytometry assay using cells treated with 10 μm cisplatin (supplemental data Fig. 1). The results obtained from this study revealed similar cell cycle profiles for the cells treated with 10 or 40 μm cisplatin. The proportion of the sub-G1 population in 10 μm cisplatin-treated XPA and XPG cells, however, was less than those treated with 40 μm cisplatin. These results suggest that the NER defects disrupt the normal cellular process and cause altered cell cycle regulation, resulting in increased cell death following cisplatin treatment. The NER Defects Caused an Enhanced CHK1 Phosphorylation and p21 Induction after Cisplatin Treatment—To determine whether the increased G1 population in cisplatin-treated XPA and XPG cells was caused by an altered cell cycle checkpoint regulation or continued cell growth, we determined the cisplatin treatment-induced phosphorylation of CHK1 (Ser-317 and Ser-345) and the induction of p21CIP1 in both NF and the NER-defective XPA and XPG cells. Phosphorylation of CHK1 at Ser-317 and Ser-345 is an important indication of CHK1 activation that leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase (34Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 38Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Similarly, induction of p21CIP1 is important for maintaining cells in the G1 phase (40Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar, 41Bartek J. Lukas J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The levels of the phosphorylated CHK1 protein (both Ser-317 and Ser-345) were significantly affected by the NER defects following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Cisplatin treatment caused a modest increase in CHK1 phosphorylation in the NF cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). In XPA and XPG cells, the magnitude of increase in CHK1 phosphorylation in response to cisplatin treatment was greater, and the maximum increases occurred at lower cisplatin concentrations (Fig. 3A). The level of the phosphorylated CHK2 (Thr-68), another important checkpoint kinase, however, was not significantly affected by the NER defects following cisplatin treatment (data not shown). To confirm that the enhanced CHK1 phosphorylation observed in the cisplatin-treated XPA and XPG cells were indeed caused by defects of the XPA and XPG proteins of the cells, we further determined cisplatin treatment-induced CHK1 phosphorylation in NF cells in which the XPA and XPG genes were silenced by siRNAs (Fig. 3C). Silencing of individual XPA and XPG genes resulted in enhanced CHK1 phosphorylation of NF cells following cisplatin treatment. When both XPA and XPG genes were silenced in the same experiment, cisplatin treatment-induced phosphorylation of CHK1 in these cells was even stronger than in those of the NF cells for which the XPA or XPG genes were individually silenced by the siRNAs. The NER defects also caused an enhanced p21CIP1 response following cisplatin treatment (Fig. 4). In NF cells, cisplatin treatment caused a modest increase in p21CIP1 protein. In the XPA and XPG cells, however, cisplatin treatment resulted in greater increases in the level of p21CIP1 protein. These results suggest that the altered cell cycle distributions of both XPA and XPG cells following cisplatin treatment were indeed caused by an altered cell cycle arrest of the cells. The NER Defects Caused Attenuated ATM Phosphorylation after Cisplatin Treatment—The results obtained from both the caspase-3 activation and flow cytometry experiments suggest that a functional NER pathway is required for cell survival to cisplatin treatment. The results obtained from our previous studies also demonstrated the involvement of the p53 signaling pathway in the cisplatin treatment-induced signaling process (36Wang G. Chuang L. Zhang X. Colton S. Dombkowski A. Reiners J. Diakiw A. Xu X.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2231-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To elucidate a mechanism by which the NER process leads to increased cell survival and p53 activation following cisplatin treatment, we further determined the i"

Those activities were analyzed by expressing PLCζ mutants tagged with fluorescent protein Venus by injection of cRNA into unfertilized eggs or 1-cell embryos after fertilization. Nuclear localization signal (NLS) existed at 374–381 in the X/Y linker region. Nuclear translocation was lost by replacement of Arg376, Lys377, Arg378, Lys379, or Lys381 with glutamate, whereas Ca2+ oscillations were conserved. Nuclear targeting was also absent for point mutation of Lys299 and/or Lys301 in the C terminus of X domain, or Trp13, Phe14, or Val18 in the N terminus of EF1. Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity was lost by the former mutation and was remarkably inhibited by the latter. A short sequence 374–383 fused with Venus showed active translocation into the nucleus of COS-7 cells, but 296–309 or 1–19 did not. Despite the presence of these special regions, both activities were deprived by deletion of not only EF1 but also EF2–4 or C2 domain. Thus, PLCζ is driven into the nucleus primarily by the aid of NLS and putative regulatory sites, but coordinated three-dimensional structure, possibly formed by a folding in the X/Y linker and close EF/C2 contact as in PLCδ1, seems to be required not only for enzymatic activity but also for nuclear translocation ability.

Larman M.G. Saunders C.M. Lai F.A. Reproduction. 2004; 127: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PLCζ is specifically expressed in the sperm (2Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and induces repetitive increase in [Ca2+]i called Ca2+ oscillations and subsequent early embryonic development when expressed in mouse eggs by injection of RNA encoding PLCζ (2Saunders C.M.

Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In mammalian fertilization, accumulated evidence indicates that a cytosolic sperm factor is driven into the ooplasm upon sperm egg fusion and induces Ca2+ oscillations (4Swann K. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Jones K.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar), which are caused by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum mainly through type 1 IP3 receptor (6Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and are a pivotal signal for egg activation characterized by resumption of the second meiosis and formation of PN (5Jones K.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). PLCζ is a strong candidate of the sperm factor, because 1) fertilization-like Ca2+ oscillations are produced by PLCζ expressed in a mouse egg at an estimated level comparable to the content in single mouse sperm (2Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Yoda A. Oda S. Shikano T. Kouchi Z. Awaji T. Shirakawa H. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 2) Injection of recombinant PLCζ into mouse eggs induces Ca2+ oscillations as well (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). 3) Ca2+ oscillation-inducing ability of sperm extract injected into eggs (4Swann K. Rev.

Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is lost when pretreated with an antibody against PLCζ (2Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4) PLCζ content in the mouse sperm and the number of Ca2+ spikes at fertilization are reduced by transgenic RNA interference of PLCζ (9Knott J.G. Kurokawa M. Fissore R.A. Schultz R.M. Williams C.J. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 992-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). 5) PLCζ has such a high Ca2+ sensitivity of PIP2-hydrolyzing activity that the enzyme can be active in the resting cells at ∼100 nm Ca2+ (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Nomikos M. Blayney L.M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 31011-31018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suitable for the sperm factor as the first stimulus in the egg cytoplasm at fertilization. Another important property of PLCζ is nuclear translocation ability. PLCζ expressed by RNA injection is accumulated into the formed PN (3Yoda A. Oda S. Shikano T. Kouchi Z. Awaji T. Shirakawa H. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Larman M.G. Saunders C.M. Carroll J. Lai F.A. Swann K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2513-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Sone Y. Ito M. Shirakawa H. Shikano T. Takeuchi H. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This is consistent with earlier observation that sperm-derived Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity is concentrated into PN formed several hours after fertilization, as examined by transfer of the ooplasm or PN into unfertilized eggs (13Kono T. Carroll J. Swann K. Whittingham D.G. Development. 1995; 121: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ oscillations cease at about the time of PN formation (14Jones K.T. Carroll J. Merriman J.A. Whittingham D.G. Kono T. Development. 1995; 121: 3259-3266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but continue without stopping when PN formation was prevented by injection of a lectin, WGA (15Marangos P. FitzHarris G. Carroll J. Development. 2003; 130: 1461-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that translocation of the sperm factor or PLCζ into PN plays a key role in cessation of Ca2+ oscillations at the interphase of a cell cycle (11Larman M.G. Saunders C.M. Carroll J. Lai F.A. Swann K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2513-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 13Kono T. Carroll J. Swann K. Whittingham D.G. Development. 1995; 121: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Marangos P. FitzHarris G. Carroll J. Development. 2003; 130: 1461-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Structure-function analysis of PLCζ is implicated, because PLCζ is a biologically important factor and can be practically utilized for artificial egg activation. PLCζ is composed of four EF-hand domains in the N terminus, X and Y catalytic domains, and C2 domain in the C terminus (2Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), common to other isozymes of PLC (16Williams R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but lacks N-terminal PH domain found in PLCβ, γ, δ, and ϵ (2Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A short form of PLCζ, s-PLCζ, is thought to be expressed in the mouse sperm, because mRNA encoding a protein, which lacks three EF-hand domains but is identical to PLCζ in other region, has been found to exist in the mouse testis (AK006672 in EMBL). Both 74- and 65-kDa protein bands are detected by Western blotting of mouse sperm extract using anti-PLCζ antibody (17Kurokawa M. Sato K. Wu H. He C. Malcuit C. Black S.J. Fukami K. Fissore R.A. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 376-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have found that s-PLCζ expressed in mouse eggs has much less Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity and is hardly accumulated in PN (3Yoda A. Oda S. Shikano T. Kouchi Z. Awaji T. Shirakawa H. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that EF-hand domains are responsible for these important properties. Actually, deletion of N-terminal EF-hand domains results in the loss of Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity (10Nomikos M. Blayney L.M. Larman M.G. Campbel K. Rossbach A. Saunders C.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31011-31018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Kouchi Z. Shikano T. Nakamura Y. Shirakawa H. Fukami K. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21015-21021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the molecular structure responsible for the nuclear translocation ability in a quantitative manner and in parallel with precise assay of Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity, focusing on the putative NLS region and EF-hand domain region. PLCζ or its mutants fused with a fluorescent protein Venus (19Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar) were expressed by injection of respective cRNA into mouse eggs. Nuclear translocation was investigated in PN of 1-cell embryos after artificial activation by PLCζ or fertilization by the sperm. Translocation was also examined in the nucleus of cultured somatic cells after transfection of cDNA. Preparation of Gametes and Insemination—Mature eggs at MII were obtained from superovulated B6D2F1 mice (see Ref. 20Kumakiri J. Oda S. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar for details), and freed from cumulus cells by 0.05% hyaluronidase (Sigma). M2 medium was used during egg preparation, RNA injection, [Ca2+]i measurement, and observation of eggs or embryos. Twenty to thirty eggs were transferred to a 400-μl drop of M2 medium covered with paraffin oil in a glass-bottomed plastic dish, which was placed on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (TMD, Nikon) and heated at 31–33 °C. Eggs were injected with cRNA (see below). In another experiments, cRNA was injected into 1-cell embryos after IVF. M16 medium was used for IVF and incubation of fertilized eggs. Spermatozoa were collected from the cauda epididymides and incubated at 37 °C (5% CO2 in air) for 1–1.5 h for capacitation (20Kumakiri J. Oda S. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A small amount of sperm suspension was added to a 200-μl drop of M16 medium containing M II eggs attached with cumulus cells. The eggs and spermatozoa were incubated for ∼5 h until the male and female PN were recognized. One-cell embryos were transferred to a 400-μl drop of M2 medium, treated with 0.05% hyaluronidase, and after washing, injected with cRNA. Construction of Plasmids—cDNA encoding full-length PLCζ (647 amino acid residues; see Fig. 1A) (GenBank™ accession number AF435950) or s-PLCζ lacking 110 amino acid residues from the N terminus (AK006672) was prepared using PCR techniques, fused with Venus (19Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2135) Google Scholar) in the C terminus, and subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+). The methods were the same as described previously (4Swann K. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Point replacement of an amino acid or partial deletion of amino acid sequence in cDNA of PLCζ was constructed by GeneTailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen), using PLCζ-Venus-pBluescript II-SK (+) as the template (see Fig. 1A for domain features and Tables for designation). To circumvent unwanted mutations, a region surrounding the targeted amino acid(s) and presenting unique restriction sites was subcloned in the parental vector and verified by DNA sequencing using Applied Biosystems ABI PRISM 310 DNA sequencer. Truncation was performed from the N terminus to a given number of amino acids between 4th to 39th residues or to the end of EF1 (D2–39), EF2 (D2–77), EF3 (D2–110), and EF4 (D2–167), leaving Met1. Truncated fragments were amplified by PCR using PLCζ-Venus-pBluescript II-KS (+) as the template. Amplified fragments were digested with KpnI and SpeI, and ligated to the KpnI and SpeI sites of the parental vector. All constructs were checked by sequence analysis. RNA and Polyadenylation—The constructed plasmids were digested with NotI, and resulting fragments were used as templates for in vitro transcription. RNA was synthesized by T3 or T7 polymerase using mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion). To facilitate RNA translation in the egg, RNA was added with more than 200 poly(A) in the 3′-tail (see Ref. 21Aida T. Oda S. Awaji T. Yoshida K. Miyazaki S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar for details). Dried RNA was resolved in 150 mm KCl solution (final concentration, ∼1.5 μg/μl). RNA was diluted to the range between 10 and 1,000 ng/μl and injected into MII eggs or 1-cell embryos using a glass micropipette (injected amount, ∼4 pl per egg or embryo of which volume is 200 pl). To make the expression level of various PLCζ mutants comparable, the concentration of RNA for injection was adjusted in such way that fluorescence intensity (F) of Venus in the egg was in the range between 55 and 90 (arbitrary unit) at 3 h after RNA injection. A standard concentration of PLCζ-Venus RNA was 50 ng/μl. RNA concentration used was raised up to 1,000 ng/μl, when extreme overexpression was necessary. Measurement of Venus Fluorescence—Of 30–40 MII eggs injected with cRNA, 4–9 eggs were left in the same dish and subjected to continuous measurement of F. Fluorescent images of eggs were acquired every 3 min at 31–33 °C, using an EB-CCD camera (C7190–23; Hamamatsu Photonics) and an image processor (Argus 50; Hamamatsu Photonics). Excitation light was passed through a 470–490-nm bandpass filter and a 20× objective lens. Emitted light was passed through the objective lens, a 510-nm dichroic mirror (DM510; Nikon), and a 520–560-nm bandpass filter. Autofluorescence of the egg, probably derived from oxidized flavins (22Shirakawa H. Miyazaki S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1739-1752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was subtracted from total fluorescence to obtain F. Other eggs were kept in another dish and subjected to precise observation at 3, 5, and 8 h after RNA injection using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM310, Carl Zeiss) with excitation light of 510 nm. Differential interference contrast images were recorded simultaneously by another sensor for transmitted laser light. All these procedures were also taken in the experiment in which cRNA was injected into 1-cell embryos about 5.5 h after insemination. Judgment of Nuclear Accumulation—The ratio of F in the PN to that in the cytoplasm (FPN/FC) at 6 h after RNA injection was taken as a parameter for nuclear accumulation. The evaluation criteria were tentatively defined, as indicated in the legend of Table 1. Values at 8 h were also presented to see the progression of nuclear accumulation.TABLE 1Point mutation in X domain or X/Y linker regionPLCζ mutantCa2+ oscillation-inducing abilityNuclear translocation abilityRNAaConcentration of RNA for injection.EggsF3hbF (mean value) of Venus at 3 h after RNA injection.Ca2+ cInduction of repetitive Ca2+ spikes. spikesDelaydThe time between RNA injection to 1st Ca2+ spike (mean value).RNA injeRNA injection into MII egg or 1-cell embryo.RNAaConcentration of RNA for injection.EggsF3hbF (mean value) of Venus at 3 h after RNA injection.FPN/FCfRatio of F (PN vs. cytoplasm) at 6 or 8 h after RNA injection (mean).NTgJudgment of nuclear translocation ability.

Open table in a new tab [Ca2+]i Measurement—Ca2+ oscillations were recorded in another optical system by conventional Ca2+ imaging method using an image processor. Four to five MII eggs were injected with 50 μm solution of the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura dextran (Molecular Probes Inc.) together with a cRNA and were subjected to [Ca2+]i measurement for 9 h after RNA injection. F of fura was measured without interference with that of Venus, by applying 340- and 380-nm UV lights alternatively and by leading emission light through a 400-nm dichroic mirror (DCLP; Omega) and a 500–520-nm bandpass filter. Fluorescence was detected by an EB-CCD camera (C7190–23; Hamamatsu Photonics). Ca2+ images were acquired at intervals of 20 s and processed to calculate F340/F380 later using NIH Image (a public domain image processing software for the Macintosh computer). Formation of the PN and nuclear translocation of a PLCζ mutant were examined 5 and 9 h after RNA injection, respectively. Nuclear Translocation in Cultured Somatic Cells—COS-7 cells cultured on glass coverslips were transfected with cDNA of Venus-tagged PLCζ mutants, using FuGENE6 (Roche Diagnostics) (23Awaji T. Hirasawa A. Shirakawa H. Tsujimoto G. Miyazaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fluorescent cells were observed 9, 24, 48, or 72 h later by confocal microscopy (LSM510META, Carl Zeiss). For [Ca2+]i measurement, cells were loaded with fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2 AM; Molecular Probes) by incubation in 4 μm fura-2 AM for 30 min at 24 °C. [Ca2+]i measurement was performed at 24 °C in Tyrode's solution 24 and 48 h after transfection. Ca2+ Oscillation-inducing Activity and Nuclear Translocation Ability of Wild-type PLCζ—The domain feature associated with amino acid number of PLCζ is illustrated in Fig. 1A. Under the present experimental conditions, expression of PLCζ in MII eggs was detected by Venus-derived F from 30 min after injection of 50 ng/μl RNA, increased up to 3–4 h, and attained a steady level (Fig. 2A). The magnitude of expression of PLCζ-Venus was compared in F at 3 h after RNA injection (Tables 1 and 2). The first Ca2+ transient was generated 30–40 min after injection of RNA of wild-type PLCζ (Fig. 1B). The delay time was a parameter that reflects Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity of expressed PLCζ mutants (Tables 1 and 2); that is, the higher activity shortened the delay time. The second and third Ca2+ spikes occurred at an interval of ∼20 min. The interval was shortened up to 10 min for succeeding Ca2+ spikes (Fig. 1B). These Ca2+ oscillations, which are probably caused by continuously produced IP3 (24Jones K.T. Nixon V.L. Dev. Biol. 2000; 225: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), lasted for 3–4 h and suddenly ceased prior to the formation of (female) PN at about 5 h after RNA injection. The higher PLCζ activity resulted in earlier termination of Ca2+ oscillations, possibly because of a negative feedback via production of diacylglycerol and subsequent activation of protein kinase C (25Ali H. Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and/or down-regulation of IP3 receptor type 1 which develops as a result of Ca2+ oscillations, notably ∼4 h after fertilization or parthenogenetic activation (26Brind S. Swann K. Carroll J. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 251-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Jullerette T. He C.L. Wu H. Parys J.B. Fissore R.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It should be noted that expressed PLCζ was continuously accumulated into the formed PN (Fig. 2A) as described previously (4Swann K. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). F in the PN (FPN) became more than twice of F in the cytoplasm (FC) 6 h after RNA injection (Table 1).

Open table in a new tab Nuclear translocation of PLCζ was observed as well, when RNA was injected into the 1-cell embryo in which male and female PN were recognized 5 h after insemination. In the 1-cell embryo, Ca2+ oscillations induced by IVF had already ceased (14Jones K.T. Carroll J. Merriman J.A. Whittingham D.G. Kono T. Development. 1995; 121: 3259-3266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Deguchi R. Shirakawa H. Oda S. Mohri T. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and another series of Ca2+ spikes were induced by expressed PLCζ after a long delay of ∼80 min and at long intervals of 40–60 min (Fig. 1C). Phosphoinositide signaling pathway and/or IP3 receptor-mediated Ca2+ release seems to be suppressed in the 1-cell embryo, at the interphase of cell cycle (11Larman M.G. Saunders C.M. Carroll J. Lai F.A. Swann K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2513-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B (line 2), FPN was lower than FC at the early stage after RNA injection, but exceeded the latter at 3.5 h. Subsequently, FPN continuously increased and became twice of FC at about 8 h. Venus alone was more expressed than PLCζ-Venus (Fig. 2B, line 1) because of the smaller molecule. For Venus alone, FPN/FC was close to 1.0 (photographs of the inset in Fig. 2B; Table 1), indicating free diffusion through nuclear pores. The nuclear translocation of PLCζ expressed in the 1-cell embryo after IVF served as a control for mutants that had quite low or no Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity and were incapable of activating the egg. For example, the mutant in which Asp210 in the X catalytic domain (see Fig. 1A) was replaced with arginine (D210R) was defective in Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity even when overexpressed (Fig. 1D and Table 1), as shown previously (2Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear accumulation of D210R took place (Fig. 2C), but it was substantially slower, compared with that of wild-type PLCζ (Table 1). F in the nucleolus was comparable to that in the nucleoplasm 12 h after RNA injection (Fig. 2C, paired photographs at the right). Some fraction of PLCζ may to be accumulated to the"

The Gα N terminus with its helical stretch is thought to be crucial for G protein/activated receptor (R*) interaction. The N-terminal fatty acylation of Gα is important for membrane targeting of G proteins. By applying biophysical techniques to the rhodopsin/transducin model system, we studied the effect of N-terminal truncations in Gα. In Gαβγ, lack of the fatty acid and Gα truncations up to 33 amino acids had little effect on R* binding and R*-catalyzed nucleotide exchange, implying that this region is not mandatory for R*/Gαβγ interaction. However, when the other hydrophobic modification of Gαβγ, the Gγ C-terminal farnesyl moiety, is lacking, R* interaction requires the fatty acylated Gα N terminus. This suggests that the two hydrophobic extensions can replace each other in the interaction of Gαβγ with R*. We propose that in native Gαβγ, these two terminal regions are functionally redundant and form a microdomain that serves both to anchor the G protein to the membrane and to establish an initial docking complex with R*. Accordingly, we find that the native fatty acylated Gα is competent to interact with R* even in the absence of Gβγ, whereas nonacylated Gα requires Gβγ for interaction. Experiments with N-terminally truncated Gα subunits suggest that in the second step of the catalytic process, the receptor binds to the αN/β1-loop region of Gα to reduce nucleotide affinity and to make the Gα C terminus available for subsequent interaction with R*.

A prototypical GPCR and the eponym of the largest family of the GPCR superfamily is rhodopsin, the visual pigment of retinal rod photoreceptor cells. Photon capture by rhodopsin's covalently bound chromophore 11-cis-retinal causes retinal cis/trans isomerization and thus activates rhodopsin. Within milliseconds, subsequent conversions in the protein moiety lead to the active rhodopsin conformation (R*), which is capable of catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange in the retinal G protein transducin (Gt) (3Okada T.

Samples containing rhodopsin in disk membranes (50 nm), Gα (0.6 μm), and Gβγ (0.5 μm) were illuminated with orange light (>495 nm, 10 s). Nucleotide uptake by the G protein was induced by adding GTPγS(5 μm final concentration) at 20 °C and constant stirring. The intrinsic GDP/GTP exchange of Gα subunits (0.6 μm) was monitored in the absence of Gβγ and rhodopsin (see Ref. 45Ernst O.P. Bieri C. Vogel H. Hofmann K.P.

To complete activation of the entire Gα pool, NaF and AlCl3 were added sequentially with ∼20 s between additions (final concentrations: 3.7 mm and 100 μm, respectively). Traces were normalized to the final fluorescence levels evoked by the Gα·GTPγS/Gα·GDP·AlF-4 mixture (15Herrmann R. Heck M. Henklein P. Henklein P. Kleuss C. Hofmann K.P. Ernst O.P. J. Biol.

The subunits (∼6 μm, 50 μl final volume) were loaded on a Superose 12 column (0.32 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with 20 mm, 1,3-bis-(tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl-amino)propane (BTP), pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol (10 °C) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min using a Smart System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The elution was monitored at 280 nm, and 40 μl fractions were collected for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Gα Subunits—Expression of non-fatty acylated Gα subunits in Escherichia coli and purification were as described before (15Herrmann R.

Experiments were performed with rat Gαi1 (termed Gαi) and a Gαt/Gαi1 chimera (here termed rGαt; originally termed Gtα* in Ref. 46Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

The expression vector pHis6-Gtα* for expression of rGαt was kindly provided by M. Natochin and N. Artemyev. Both Gα subunits are known to couple in combination with Gβ1γ1, as transducin couples to activated rhodopsin (47Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

In order to produce Δ25-rGαt, bases corresponding to residues 2-25 of the Gαt sequence were deleted by a PCR using pHis6-Gtα* as a template. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BstEII and subcloned into pHis6-Gtα*. For construction of Gαi mutants with N-terminal deletions, oligonucleotide duplexes with respective deletions were cloned into the EcoRI and BssHII restriction sites of the plasmid pGiL, which harbors the sequence coding for rat Gαi1 with an internal His6 tag (15Herrmann R.

The subunits termed Gαi-t, Δ29-Gαi-t, Δ31-Gαi-t, Δ33-Gαi-t, and Δ35-Gαi-t are derivatives of Gαi (vector pGiL) with a single Asn → Glu amino acid exchange to yield the Gαt C-terminal sequence (Fig. 1B). For Gαi-t and the respective deletion mutants, we obtained about 3 mg of pure protein/liter of cell culture.RESULTSIntrinsic Nucleotide Exchange and Heterotrimer Formation of Gα Subunits with N-terminal Deletions—In order to study the role of NTα in catalytic R*/G protein interaction and subunit interaction with Gβγ, we expressed three sets of Gα subunits in E. coli. Each set was composed of full-length Gα and mutants with N-terminal truncations of various length (see Fig. 1B). The most extensive truncation included the end of the N-terminal helix and first residues of the β1 strand, which were reported to be involved in receptor contact (36Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4883-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Blahos J. Fischer T. Brabet I. Stauffer D. Rovelli G. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3262-3269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since light-activated rhodopsin can interact with both Gαt/Gβ1γ1 and Gαi/Gβ1γ1 (47Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 48Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21808-21815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the first set was derived from recombinant Gαt (rGαt and Δ25-rGαt). rGαt is a chimera containing 16 residues from Gαi, which allows functional expression in E. coli (46Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Muradov K.G. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7865-7869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The other two sets were based on Gαi (Gαi and Δ29-Gαi) and a Gαi mutant containing the N346E substitution, which changes the C-terminal tail to the corresponding Gαt sequence (Gαi-t, Δ29-Gαi-t, Δ31-Gαi-t, Δ33-Gαi-t, and Δ35-Gαi-t). Gαi-t was preferentially used in the study, because the protein's termini are not modified by an affinity tag, and interaction with R* is similar to Gαt (11Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4819-4821Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 47Skiba N.P. Bae H. Hamm H.E. J. Biol.

Almost the same rates of GTPγS uptake were found for Gαi and Δ29-Gαi, in agreement with published data (41Nanoff C. Koppensteiner R. Yang Q. Fuerst E. Ahorn H. Freissmuth M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (data not shown). This was also observed for Gαi-t, Δ29-Gαi-t, and Δ31-Gαi-t, whereas Δ33-Gαi-t showed a slightly faster GTPγS uptake (Fig. 2A). After the addition of AlF-4, all of these subunits formed Gα·GDP·AlF-4 complexes, thus demonstrating functional folding of the Gα subunits. However, Δ35-Gαi-t did not show any fluorescence increase, after the addition of either GTPγSorAlF-4 (Fig. 2A, bottom trace), indicating that no GDP was bound in the nucleotide binding pocket.FIGURE 2Intrinsic nucleotide exchange and heterotrimer formation of N-terminal truncated Gα subunits. A, intrinsic nucleotide exchange of the Gα subunits (0.6 μm) Gαi-t (black), Δ29-Gαi-t (blue), Δ31-Gαi-t (green), Δ33-Gαi-t (red), and Δ35-Gαi-t (gray) was monitored by measuring the increase in fluorescence emission after the addition of GTPγS (5 μm; black arrow). The remaining Gα·GDP was activated by the addition (gray arrows) of NaF and AlCl3 to form Gα·GDP·AlF-4. Traces were normalized to the final fluorescence intensity. Nonnormalized final fluorescence intensities of different Gα subunits varied within 15%.

Nonacylated Gαi-t, Δ29-Gαi-t, Δ31-Gαi-t, and Δ33-Gαi-t as well as Gβγ eluted as single peaks from the size exclusion column, demonstrating the homogeneity of the subunit preparations (Fig. 2B). When combined with Gβγ, all four Gα subunits showed single peak elution profiles and shorter retention times as compared with the isolated Gα subunits. Almost identical results were obtained with nonacylated Gαi in combination with Gβγ (data not shown). Although truncation of the N-terminal region reduces the affinity of the subunits as previously reported for Gαt and other Gα subunits (39Navon S.E. Fung B.K. J. Biol.

Only Δ35-Gαi-t showed a complex elution profile with multiple maxima, indicating the presence of larger aggregates. Also, Gβγ had little effect on the retention time, suggesting that Δ35-Gαi-t was unstable or not correctly folded (data not shown).Influence of the N-terminal Region of Gα on the Interaction between the Heterotrimeric G Protein and R*—We applied kinetic light scattering, which is a monitor of R*/G protein interaction (42Heck M.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to study R* binding of nonacylated Gα subunits in the presence of Gβγ (Fig. 3). All full-length Gα subunits investigated, namely rGαt and Gαi-t (Fig. 3A), as well as Gαi (not shown) bound to R* in the presence of Gβγ. Similar binding to R* in the presence of Gβγ was observed for the N-terminal truncated subunits Δ25-rGαt, Δ29-Gαi-t, Δ31-Gαi-t, Δ33-Gαi-t (Fig. 3A), and Δ29-Gαi (not shown). As expected, Gβγ and the apparently misfolded Δ35-Gαi-t did not bind to R* (Fig. 3A, bottom).FIGURE 3Influence of N-terminal deletions of Gα on the interaction between heterotrimeric G proteins and R* monitored by kinetic light scattering. A, light-induced binding of non-fatty acylated Gα subunits (1 μm) in the presence of Gβγ (1 μm) and in the absence of exogenous nucleotides was monitored by kinetic light scattering. Binding is reflected by the increase in the relative intensity of scattered light (ΔI/I) observed after activation of rhodopsin (flash symbol;3 μm rhodopsin in disk membranes; 32% rhodopsin was activated by a green flash, pH 7.4, 23 °C). The Gα subunits investigated are indicated (abbreviated as in the legend to Fig. 1B). B, measurements as in A but in the presence of 50 μm GTP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the presence of Gβγ and excess GTP, light activation of rhodopsin did not give rise to binding signals of Gαi-t, Δ29-Gαi-t, Δ31-Gαi-t, or Δ33-Gαi-t (Fig. 3B). This result indicates that for all four Gα subunits, binding of Gαβγ heterotrimers to R* is followed by rapid GTP uptake and Gαβγ dissociation from both the receptor and the membrane. Furthermore, the lack of any light scattering change suggests that Gαβγ heterotrimers were not bound to the disk membrane in the dark (see Refs. 15Herrmann R. Heck M. Henklein P. Henklein P.

The same results were obtained with rGαt and Δ25-rGαt as well as with Gαi and Δ29-Gαi (data not shown).As another approach to address receptor-catalyzed G protein activation, GTPγS uptake by Gα subunits in the presence of Gβγ and catalytic amounts of R*-containing disk membranes was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Consistent with the results from the light scattering assay, the lack of the N-terminal helix in rGαt and Gαi-t had no severe effect on R*-catalyzed nucleotide exchange (Fig. 4). Similar observations were made for Gαi and Δ29-Gαi (data not shown). A gradual decrease in the kinetics was observed as the length of the deletion increased (compare Gαi-t, Δ29-Gαi-t, Δ31-Gαi-t, and Δ33-Gαi-t), which may arise from reduced Gαβγ formation. No GTPγS uptake was observed for Δ35-Gαi-t/Gβγ, again demonstrating the complete functional loss of this Gα mutant.FIGURE 4R*-catalyzed nucleotide exchange of Gα subunits monitored by the fluorescence activa"

The AAA cassettes, D1 and D2, were essential for peroxisome-restoring activity of Pex1p and Pex6p. In HEK293 cells, endogenous Pex1p was partly localized likely as a homo-oligomer in the cytoplasm, while Pex6p and Pex26p were predominantly localized on peroxisomes. Interaction of Pex1p with Pex6p conferred a conformational change and dissociation of the Pex1p oligomer. These results suggested that Pex1p possesses two distinct oligomeric forms, a homo-oligomer in the cytosol and a hetero-oligomer on peroxisome membranes, possibly playing distinct functions in peroxisome biogenesis.

More than 30 proteins, termed as PEX gene products or peroxins, are required for peroxisome assembly (2Eckert J.H. Erdmann R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

Pex1p and Pex6p are members of the large AAA-protein family involved in a wide range of different cellular processes including vesicular transport, DNA repair, proteolysis, and mitochondrial functions (10Vale R.D.

AAA proteins share one or two AAA cassettes that is characterized by a conserved sequence of 200–250 amino acids, termed D1 or D2 domain, including the Walker A and B motifs for ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis (13Beyer A.

Additional less conserved domains are often found at N-terminal and C-terminal regions (N and C domains) and are implicated to be involved in binding to the adaptor (15Shiozawa K. Maita N. Tomii K.

D2 domain of human Pex1p and Pex6p are apparently more conserved than the domains of D1, N, and C, suggesting that the D2 domain is responsible for the key function of Pex1p and Pex6p. It is noteworthy that yeast and human AAA peroxins were recently suggested to be involved in the export of Pex5p from peroxisomes (18Platta H.W. Grunau S. Rosenkranz K. Girzalsky W. Erdmann R. Nat.

However, the molecular mechanisms of Pex5p shuttling between the cytoplasm and peroxisomes remain elusive. Pex1p interacts with Pex6p in vivo (20Faber K.N. Heyman J.A. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

As a first step to understanding the function of AAA family peroxins, Pex1p and Pex6p, in peroxisome biogenesis, we herein mapped the region involved in mutual binding and investigated intracellular localization of Pex1p and Pex6p. Such interaction likely represents a relationship between peroxisomal localization and functions of AAA peroxins. Moreover, we propose that peroxisome biogenesis requires two distinct oligomer forms of Pex1p. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast two-hybrid plasmids were constructed by inserting a desired gene fragment downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BIND) in pDBLeu and the GAL4 activation domain (ACT) in pPC86 (24Okumoto K.

Plasmids coding for N-terminal deletion mutants of Pex1p, DraI-NotI fragment of HsPEX1 was ligated into the SmaI-NotI site in pPC86. Plasmids for C-terminal deletion mutants of Pex1p were generated by replacing SpeI-NotI region of full-length PEX1 in pPC86 with SpeI-NotI fragment of the PCR products amplified using a forward primer P1F9 (5′-CAAACTTGCCCATACGAC-3′) with a reverse P1–1151stopR (5′-GCTTGCGGCCGCTTAACA TTGTGAGCTCAAATC-3′) and P1–1217stopR (5′-TCCTGCGGCCGCTTAGGATTCGTCCTCTCCACT-3′).

For cloning of plasmids for C-terminal deletion mutants, pDB-Pex6p-(1–676) and pDB-Pex6p-(1–882) were generated by replacing BssHII-NotI fragment of pCMVSPORT-HsPEX6-(1–676) and -HsPEX6-(1–882) that had been constructed by replacing the XhoI-NotI fragment of the PCR products amplified using a primer P6F2 (5′-GGGCTCGGACCGCGAGTC-3′) with P6–677stopR (5′-CTGCGCGGCCGCCTAAGCCAGGAGAGGAAAGCC-3′) and P6–883stopR (5′-TGTGGCGGCCGCCTAAACGCGTAGCTGGGAGGC-3′), respectively. To construct plasmids for N-terminal deletion mutants of Pex6p, two types of SalI-NotI fragments were amplified by PCR using primers P6SalI385F (5′-GTTTGTCGACGTGAAGAAAACAGTTGGG-3′) and P6SalI593F (5′-TGAGGTCGACGTGCCTGCTCTGTCAGAG-3′) with P6–883stopR. Each fragment was cloned into the SalI-NotI site in pDBLeu, following insertion of the NheI-NotI fragment of HsPEX6 at the NheI-NotI site. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using a ProQuest two-hybrid system (Invitrogen). Saccharomyces cerevisiae MaV203 (Mata, leu2-3, 112, trp1-901, his3Δ200, ade2-101, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, SPAL10::URA3, GAL1::lacZ, HIS3UAS GAL:: [email protected], can1R, cyh2R) was used as a host strain (24Okumoto K. Abe I. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25700-25710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid manipulations and assays were conducted as recommended by the manufacturer, as described (24Okumoto K. Abe I. Fujiki Y. J. Biol.

Mutagenesis in the Walker Motifs of Pex1p and Pex6p—Oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension by PCR (26Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S.

Two sets of reactions were carried out: the first using primers of P1F5 (5′-ATGCATGCCGTAGTCAGG-3′), corresponding to nucleotide residues 1276–1293 of HsPEX1 cDNA, and antisense mutagenic oligonucleotide; the second using P1R3 (5′-CATCCTGGAGTCCACTCG-3′), corresponding to residues 3194–3211 of HsPEX1 cDNA, and sense mutagenic oligonucleotide. The mutagenic oligonucleotides with base changes underlined at mutation sites were K605E(A1), sense 5′-AAGTGGAGAATCAACTTTAGCCA-3′ and antisense 5′-GTTGATTCTCCACTTCCCTTTCC-3′; D662N(B1), 5′-CTGCTGAATGACCTTGACCTCAT-3′ and 5′-AAGGTCATTCAGCAGGACAACAG-3′; K887E(A2), 5′-AACAGGAGAAACCTTACTAGCTG-3′ and 5′-AAGGTTTCTCCTGTTCCAGGCGG-3′; D940N(B2), 5′-TTTCTTTAATGAATTTGAATTTG-3′ and 5′-AATTCATTAAAGAAAAGAATGCA-3′. The amplified products were combined and used as a template for the second PCR, using P1F5 and P1R3 as primers. Second PCR produced a 1936-base pair, amplified fragment containing the mutation and harboring EcoRI and SpeI sites. Following the digestion with EcoRI and SpeI, the fragment was cloned into the EcoRI-SpeI sites each of pCMVSPORT/HsPEX1 and pCMVSPORT/HsPEX1-HA. Next, following sets of oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis of HsPEX6. First, P6F3 (5′-TCTCTGATAGACTGGGAC-3′) corresponding to residues 752–769 of HsPEX6 and antisense-mutated oligonucleotide, and the second using sense-mutated oligonucleotide together with P6R1 (5′-CTAGCAGGCAGCAAACTTGCGCTGGATGCGC-3′) primer. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used were K476E(A1), sense 5′-CTGTGGGGAGACCACAGTAGTTG-3′ and antisense 5′-GTGGTCTCCCCACAGCCTGGGGG-3′; D532N(B1), 5′-AGCTGTGAACCTTCT GGGCCGGG-3′ and 5′-AGAAGGTTCACAGCTGTGAGCAA-3′; K750E(A2), 5′-CACCGGCGAGACCCTTCTGGCCA-3′ and 5′-AGGGTCTCGCCGGTGCCAGGGGG-3′; D803N(B2), 5′-CTTCTTTAATGAACTGGACTCTT-3′ and 5′-AGTTCATTAAAGAAGATAATGCA-3′. The resulting two DNA fragments were subjected to second PCR using P6F3 and P6R1 primers. The PCR products with 2192-base pairs were digested with EcoRI and BglII and cloned into the EcoRI-BglII site of pCMVSPORT/HsPEX6 and pCMVSPORT/HsPEX6-HA. All of the mutations and PCR-amplified regions were confirmed by sequencing. Generation of Mutant Constructs—The wild-type construct, pCMVSPORT/HsPEX1 (27Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and pCMVSPORT/HsPEX1-HA and pCMVSPORT/HsPEX6-HA encoding C-terminally HA-tagged Pex1p and Pex6p, respectively (7Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), were as described. The heterozygous mutations identified in the CG1 PBDE-04 patient PEX1, termed L664P and del634–690 (27Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), were introduced into pCMVSPORT/HsPEX1-HA by replacing the BglII-XhoI fragment with nucleotide residues 1327–3192 of normal PEX1 with the BglII-XhoI fragment of the patient-derived PEX1 (27Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PEX6-(385–980)-HA coding for Pex6p deleted in N-terminal residues 1–384 was constructed by replacing the SalI-BglII region of full-length PEX6-HA in pCMVSPORT with SalI-BglII fragment of the PCR products amplified by primers P6SalI-385.F (5′-CGGGTCGACACCATGGTGAAGAAAACAGTTGGG-3′) and P6R1-BglII (5′-TGGGAGATCTGCAGGCAGCAAACTTGCGCTGGATGCG-3′). PEX6-HA variants, PEX6-(1–676)-HA and PEX6-(1–882)-HA, were constructed as follows. SalI-BglII fragments were prepared by PCR using pCMVSPORT-HsPEX6 as a template with each set of primers, SP6 with P6(677stop)BglII.R (5′-CAAAAGATCTAGCCAGGAGAGGAAAGCC-3′) and SP6 with P6(883stop)BglII.R (5′-TGGCAGATCTAACGCGTAGCTGGGAGGC-3′). Respective SalI-BglII fragments were separately cloned into the SalI-BglII sites of pCMVSPORT-PEX1-HA, resulting in pCMVSPORT-PEX6-(1–676)-HA and pCMVSPORT-PEX6-(1–882)-HA, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Mammalian Two-hybrid Analysis—We used plasmids of the CheckMate system (Promega, Madison, WI). The reporter pG5luc expresses the firefly luciferase under the control of a minimal TATA box and five GAL4-binding sites. The coding sequences of PEX1 and PEX6 were cloned as BamHI-NotI fragments of pCMVSPORT-FLAG-PEX1 and BamHI-NotI fragment of pCMVSPORT-FLAG-PEX6, respectively, into the pBIND vector in-frame with the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain, termed pBIND-PEX1 and pBIND-PEX6. The coding sequences of PEX1 and PEX26, namely the BamHI-NotI fragments of pCMVSPORT-FLAG-PEX1 and pCMVSPORT-FLAG-PEX26, were separately cloned into the pACT vector in-frame with the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain, named pACT-PEX1 and pACT-PEX26. To generate Walker motif mutants of pACT-PEX1, pCMVSPORT-PEX1 harboring Walker motif mutations were digested with BamHI and SalI, and the 3.0-kb BamHI-SalI fragments were then ligated into the pACT-PEX1 vector. To construct in the pBIND vector Walker motif mutants of PEX6 and deletion mutants including a CG4 patient-derived PEX6del207–292 (25Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Moser A. Moser H.W. Braverman N. Suzuki Y. Shimozawa N. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 46: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), corresponding mutant forms of pCMVSPORT-PEX6 were digested with BssHII and BglII. Resulting BssHII-BglII fragments were separately inserted into the pBIND-PEX6 vector. DNA transfection into PEX1-defective, pex1 ZP107 and PEX6-deficient, pex6 ZP164 cells was achieved by the lipofection method using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) (27Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R.

Luciferase activity was determined using 105 cells with a luciferase assay system, PicaGene (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan), and was represented as a fold-activation by taking as 1 the value with mock vectors, pACT and pBIND, termed relative light unit (RLU). Morphological Analysis—DNA transfection into CHO-K1, pex1 ZP107, and pex6 ZP164 cells was performed by lipofection. Peroxisomes were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence light microscopy using rabbit antibodies against human catalase (25Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Moser A. Moser H.W. Braverman N. Suzuki Y.

Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat antibodies against rabbit immunoglobulin G (MP Biomedicals-Cappel, Irvine, CA.), under a Carl Zeiss Axioskop FL microscope. Peroxisome-restoring activity of the Walker motif mutants of PEX1 and PEX6 were verified by expressing in pex1 ZP107 and pex6 ZP164, respectively. The number of peroxisome-positive cells was counted in three separate areas. Subcellular Fractionation—HEK293 cells were homogenized on ice by ten strokes of an Elvehjem-Potter homogenizer in a homogenizing buffer: 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml antipain. The homogenates were centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) fraction was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate organelles (heavy and light mitochondrial, microsomal fractions) and the cytosol. Blue Native-PAGE Analysis—The compositions of blue native gels and gel buffers were as described (30Dekker P.J. Martin F. Maarse A.C. Bomer U. Muller H. Guiard B. Meijer M. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5408-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The resolving gel contained an acrylamide gradient from 4 to 16%. Sample (15 μl) containing 50 μg of protein was mixed with 15 μl of 10× Blue Native-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.3 m aminocaproic acid, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 m Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-25 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and was incubated for 20 min on ice. The protein complexes were separated at 4 °C for 4 h at 100 V. For Western blot analysis of the first dimension, the protein complexes were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). For the second, denaturing gel dimension, a lane of the blue native gel containing the sample was cut into a strip of gel slice. The gel slices were equilibrated for 30 min at 60 °C with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol. They were transferred to a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresed at 30 mA. Other Methods—CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2, 95% air (31Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was done with primary rabbit antibodies against Pex1p (27Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Pex6p (21Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Fujiki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), Pex14p (32Shimizu N. Itoh R. Hirono Y. Otera H. Ghaedi K. Tateishi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Harano T. Mukai S. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12593-12604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and Pex26p (7Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and a second antibody, donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, with ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Anatomy of Pex1p and Pex6p—We first attempted to define the regions of the two human AAA peroxins involved in the Pex1p-Pex6p interaction as well as those required for restoring the impaired protein import in respective pex1 and pex6 cell mutants. We constructed various truncated Pex1p and Pex6p variants and verified them for interaction by yeast two-hybrid assays. Patient-derived mutants, Pex1pΔ634–690 and Pex1pL664P, were abrogated in the interaction with Pex6p (Fig. 1A). According to the predicted domain structure (33Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the sequence of Pex1p and Pex6p were divided into three parts: the N-terminal region, the AAA-cassette (D1 and D2), and the C-terminal region. The deletion of N-terminal region, such as 551-amino acid truncation in Pex1p-(552–1283), did not influence the Pex1p-Pex6p binding. C-terminal side deletion mutants, Pex1p-(1–1216) and Pex1p-(1–1150), showed a reduced and barely detectable level of the interaction with Pex6p. Thereby, it is more likely that the AAA cassette and C-terminal part of Pex1p-(552–1283) are sufficient for interacting with Pex6p (Fig. 1A). Moreover, based on the results using the patient PBDE-04-derived Pex1p mutants, D1 domain is critical for the binding to Pex6p and the C-terminal domain is also involved in the interaction. These results are consistent with the observation that Pex1p·Pex6p heteromeric complexes are assembled in an ATP-dependent manner (20Faber K.N. Heyman J.A. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Pex1p binding site of Pex6p was similarly investigated with truncation mutants of Pex6p (Fig. 1B). In the yeast two-hybrid assays, Pex6p variants truncated in the N- and C-terminal region, Pex6p-(385–980) and Pex6p-(1–882), interacted with Pex1p. Regarding to the AAA cassette of Pex6p, deletion of D1 (Pex6p-(593–980)) or D2 (Pex6p-(1–676)) significantly eliminated the interaction with Pex1p. Both N- and C-terminal regions of Pex6p might have a role for stabilizing interaction with Pex1p. Pex1p-(552–1283) and Pex6p-(385–980) were sufficient to maintain the mutual interaction (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these findings demonstrate the importance of the AAA cassette (D1 and D2) together with C-terminal region of both Pex1p and Pex6p for the stable interaction. Various truncated forms of Pex1p and Pex6p were separately subcloned into mammalian expression vector pCMVSPORT. Pex1p variants were verified for complementing activity by expressing in PEX1-defective, pex1 ZP107 cells. In ZP107 cells transfected with wild-type PEX1, numerous PTS1- and catalase-positive peroxisomes were detected in a punctate staining pattern, indicating the restoration of PTS1 protein and catalase import (Fig. 1D, panels a and b). In contrast, in ZP107 cells expressing Pex1p-(552–1283) PTS1- and catalase-positive particles were not discernible (Fig. 1D, panels c and d). We earlier reported that L664P and del634–690 mutants of Pex1p were incompetent to restore peroxisome biogenesis (27Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Other truncation mutants shown in Fig. 1A also failed to restore import of PTS1 proteins and catalase in ZP107 cells. Similarly, PTS1- and catalase-positive particles were discernible in PEX6-deficient, pex6 ZP164 cells that had been transfected with full-length PEX6 but not with all of the truncation mutants examined, including Pex6p-(385–980) (Fig. 1D, panels e–h). Collectively, the N-terminal region and the AAA cassette as well as the C-terminal part of Pex1p and Pex6p were required for the complementing activity. Ternary Complex Formation of Pex1p, Pex6p, and Pex26p—Next, the interaction between Pex1p and Pex6p was likewise assessed by means of two-hybrid system in mammalian cells. Wild-type Pex1p was fused to ACT in pACT vector, and wild-type Pex6p was fused to BIND in pBIND vector. As a mock control, expression of only ACT-Pex1p or BIND-Pex6p in pex6 ZP164 cells did not show transcriptional activation of the reporter luciferase gene (Fig. 2B). Co-expression of ACT-Pex1p and BIND-Pex6p gave rise to a significant level of luciferase activity, indicative of positive interaction. We also performed the two-hybrid assay in PEX26-defective, pex26 ZP167 cells. Luciferase activity comparable to that seen in ZP164 was detected, hence indicating that the Pex1p-Pex6p interaction is less likely modulated by Pex26p (data not shown). Next, two plasmid constructs, one encoding wild-type Pex26p fused to transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 in pACT vector and the other containing wild-type PEX1 ligated into pBIND vector, were co-transfected into ZP164 cells with or without PEX6 in pCMVSPORT. Co-expression of ACT-Pex26p and BIND-Pex1p showed high luciferase activity in the presence of Pex6p, while the luciferase activity was very low in the absence of Pex6p similar to that by ACT-Pex26p alone (Fig. 2B). These results strongly suggested that Pex1p and Pex26p binding is dependent to Pex6p, consistent with our earlier report on the co-immunoprecipitation assays (7Matsumoto N. Tamura S. Fujiki Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Moreover, interaction between Pex6p and Pex26p was observed at a level slightly lower than that obtained in the presence of Pex1p (Fig. 2B). Mutation of Walker Motif Affects the Function of Pex1p and Pex6p—The AAA cassette D1 and D2 domains and C-terminal region are involved in the interaction of Pex1p and Pex6p (see Fig. 1A). Mutation of the lysine residue in the P-loop of the Walker A eliminates the ATP binding, while that of acidic residues in the Walker B blocks the ATP hydrolysis (14Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). To determine whether these cassettes are essential for the Pex1p-Pex6p interaction, we introduced site-directed mutations into the Walker motifs A and B of Pex1p and Pex6p (Fig. 2A). We constructed Pex1p variants, termed A1(K605E) and A2(K887E), where lysine residues at positions 605 and 887 in the Walker motifs A1 and A2 were substituted by glutamic acid, and B1(D662N) and B2(D940N) with replacement of aspartic acid residue at 662 and 940 with asparagines in the Walker motifs B1 and B2. We likewise constructed Pex6p mutants, A1(K476E) and A2(K750E) in the Walker A and B2(D803N) in the Walker B. With respect to B1 in Pex6p, the conserved aspartic acid residue in the Walker B motif was not present, rather replaced to threonine. Therefore, we tentatively introduced D532N mutation at three-amino acid downstream, termed Pex6p(B1). We verified these Walker motif mutants for interaction in the mammalian two-hybrid system. Co-expression of ACT-Pex1pB2(D940N) with BIND-Pex6p gave rise to about 80% luciferase activity a"

However, the precise molecular sites and the function for UT-A1 N-glycosylation are not known. In this study, we compared Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing wild-type (WT) UT-A1 to Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines stably expressing mutant UT-A1 lacking one (A1m1, A1m2) or both glycosylation sites (m1m2). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that UT-A1 has two glycosylation sites at Asn-279 and -742. Urea flux is stimulated by 10 nm vasopressin (AVP) or 10 μm forskolin (FSK) in WT cells. In contrast, m1m2 cells have a delayed and significantly reduced maximal urea flux. A 15-min treatment with AVP and FSK significantly increased UT-A1 cell surface expression in WT but not in m1m2 cells, as measured by biotinylation. We confirmed this finding using immunostaining. Membrane fractionation of the plasma membrane, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum revealed that AVP or FSK treatment increases UT-A1 abundance in both Golgi and plasma membrane compartments in WT but not in m1m2 cells. Pulse-chase experiments showed that UT-A1 half-life is reduced in m1m2 cells compared with WT cells. Our results suggest that mutation of the N-linked glycosylation sites reduces urea flux by reducing UT-A1 half-life and decreasing its accumulation in the apical plasma membrane.

These two forms are not due to proteolytic cleavage of the core protein but result from different states of glycosylation. After deglycosidase PNGase F treatment, both the 97- and 117-kDa bands disappear, yielding a single 88-kDa deglycosylated UT-A1 protein (7Bradford A.D. Terris J.M. Ecelbarger C.A. Klein J.D. Sands J.M. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F133-F143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the potassium channel EagI, in which the lower molecular mass band of 110 kDa is a core-glycosylated glycoprotein (8Napp J. Monje F. Stuhmer W. Pardo L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29506-29512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the 97-kDa glycoprotein is not an immature glycosylation form for UT-A1, as its glycosylation is sensitive to endoglycosidase F (7Bradford A.D. Terris J.M. Ecelbarger C.A. Klein J.D. Sands J.M. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F133-F143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a single polypeptide chain is glycosylated to two different extents to generate the 97- and 117-kDa forms. Experiments using differential centrifugation to fractionate inner medullary membranes show that both glycoproteins are expressed in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions (9Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Sands J.M. Knepper M.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 729-736PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study shows that both the 97- and 117-kDa glycoprotein forms of UT-A1 are phosphorylated in response to AVP stimulation (10Zhang C. Sands J.M. Klein J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F85-F90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). N-Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification of membrane proteins. It is a cotranslational event that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus in which an oligosaccharide chain is transferred to the nascent polypeptide at asparagine residues within the consensus N-linked glycosylation site (NX(S/T), where X ≠ proline) (11Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). Glycosylation has been associated with a number of glycoprotein functions, such as modulating protein biological activity, directing protein folding, regulating cell-surface expression and membrane localization, affecting substrate affinity, or stabilizing the mature protein structure (7Bradford A.D.

Commun. 2000; 276: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The effect of glycosylation on the functional activity of different types of membrane transport proteins has been described previously (7Bradford A.D. Terris J.M. Ecelbarger C.A. Klein J.D.

N-Glycosylation is required for functional activity of many membrane transporters; however, deglycosylation does not always abrogate transporter function (18Lucien N. Sidoux-Walter F. Roudier N.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5420-5429Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The precise role of N-linked glycosylation may vary depending upon the specific protein of interest as well as the different glycosylation sites within the glycoprotein. UT-A1 has four potential consensus glycosylation sites at Asn-13, -279, -544, and -742, but it is not clear which site(s) are responsible for the two glycosylated forms of 97 and 117 kDa. Interestingly, the relative abundance of the two forms varies under different conditions. The 117-kDa form increases dramatically in several states associated with decreased urine concentration, such as streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (20Kim D. Sands J.M. Klein J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F303-F309Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Pech V. Klein J.D. Kozlowski S.D. Wall S.M. Sands J.M. Am. J.

Nephrol. 1998; 9: 729-736PubMed Google Scholar), hypercalcemia (23Sands J.M. Flores F.X. Kato A. Baum M.A. Brown E.M. Ward D.T. Hebert S.C. Harris H.W. Am. J.

A tubule perfusion study of initial IMCDs from streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus rats shows that the appearance of the 117-kDa form in the inner medullary base is associated with increased urine transport activity (21Pech V. Klein J.D. Kozlowski S.D. Wall S.M. Sands J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: F531-F535Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that changes in the relative abundance of the 97- and 117-kDa forms of UT-A1 may have important regulatory roles for UT-A1 function. Therefore, the goals of the present study were to determine the glycosylation sites in UT-A1 and to investigate the functional effects of glycosylation, including the response to AVP stimulation. Plasmid Constructs—For the generation of stably transfected UT-A1 MDCK cell lines, the UT-A1 genes were subcloned into a pcDNA5/FRT vector (Invitrogen) that contains an integrated Flp recombination target (FRT) site for homologous recombination. Mutagenesis of N-Glycosylation Sites—The two potential N-linked glycosylation sites were mutated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The asparagine (N) residue was substituted with glutamine (Q). The oligonucleotide 5′-CTGCGTCTTCAGCGCCCCAGATCACCTGGTCAGAG-3′ was used to mutate the first asparagine residue at N279; oligonucleotide 5′-GCAGTTACCACACCCCAGATCACCTGGTCAGAT-3′ was used for the second asparagine residue mutation at N742. Two single and one double mutant constructs were generated. The mutation of Asn-279 in the first large extracellular loop is denoted as A1m1, the one in the second large extracellular loop as A1m2, and the double mutant as m1m2. The glycosylated UT-A1 is denoted as wild-type (WT). The constructs were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. Establishment of Glycan Mutant UT-A1 MDCK Cell Line—Glycosylation mutant UT-A1 MDCK cell lines were generated using our previously described method (24Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1264-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (in press)Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We used our existing MDCK-FRT cell line and cotransfected with pOG44 (Invitrogen), a vector for transiently expressing the Flp recombinase, and with pcDNA5/FRT/UT-A1 glycan mutant constructs. The pcDNA5/FRT vector has an FRT site for homologous recombination and a hygromycin resistance gene for recombinant clone selection. Cells were grown in the presence of 800 μg/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem) medium and the protein expression verified by Western blot analysis. Enzymatic Deglycosylation—For the peptide N glycosidase F (PNGase F) digestion, cell lysates were first denatured in 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10 min. After adding 1% Nonidet P-40, the samples were split into two, and 1 μl of PNGase F (500 units/μl, New England Biolabs) was added to one tube and incubated at 37 °C overnight; the control tube was incubated with water instead of PNGase F. These digested samples were then processed for Western blot analysis. Cell Urea Flux Measurements—Cells were grown on collagen-coated Costar Transwell inserts (Corning). The transmembrane resistance was measured daily using an epithelial resistance meter (EVOMX-G, World Precision Instruments). We used only cells with 800 ohms or higher resistance for urea flux measurements. The method we used for transepithelial 14C-urea flux has been described previously (24Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1264-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (in press)Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The urea flux medium contained Hanks' balanced salt solution without bicarbonate supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 5 mm urea. For the flux measurements, we replaced the medium on the apical side with 400 μl of prewarmed flux medium containing 0.4 μCi 14C-urea. The inserts were then transferred at 3-min intervals from well to well, each well containing 1.5 ml of flux medium at 37 °C. We then collected the medium for liquid scintillation counting. Ten nanomolar AVP (Sigma) or 10 μm forskolin (FSK, Sigma) were applied to the basolateral side to stimulate urea transport. Cell Surface Biotinylation—After treatment, the cells were placed on ice to minimize protein trafficking and endocytosis and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were labeled twice with freshly prepared 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide disulfide-Biotin (Pierce) in borate buffer for 20 min in a cold room with gentle shaking. The biotin reaction was quenched for 20 min with 0.1 ml-lysine (Sigma) in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, followed by two phosphate-buffered saline washes. The cells were lysed in 700 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). The homogenates were centrifuged at 8,000 revolutions/min for 10 min to remove cell debris. Fifty microliters of supernatant was saved for Western blot as prebead total proteins, whereas 600 μl of supernatant was incubated with 20 μl of Immunopure immobilized streptavidinagarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The beads were washed five times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and biotin-labeled proteins were resuspended in 60 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blot. ER, Golgi, and Plasma Membrane (PM) Isolation—Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was performed according to the method of Kaplan and colleagues (26Laughery M.D. Todd M.L. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34794-34803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Cells were grown in 10-cm plates to confluence and treated with 10 nm AVP or 10 μm FSK for 15 min and then frozen at -20 °C for 1 h. The cell pellets were collected and resuspended in HB (250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Cells were disrupted via Dounce homogenization, and the cell mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 × g to remove intact cells and debris. ER, Golgi, and PM compartments were separated by loading supernatant on a five-step sucrose gradient (2.0, 1.6, 1.4, 1.2, and 0.8 m sucrose) and ultracentrifuged in a SW28 rotor at 25,000 revolutions/min for 2 h. After centrifugation, ER, Golgi, and PM were collected from density interfaces (1.6/1.4, 1.4/1.2, 1.2/0.8 m interfaces, respectively) and diluted (1:3) in HB for further ultracentrifugation with an SW50.1 rotor at 30,000 revolutions/min for 2 h. The pellets were resuspended in HB containing protease inhibitors for Western blot analysis. Pulse-Chase Stability Assay—We performed the pulse-chase assay according to the method of Hendriks et al. (13Hendriks G. Koudijs M. van Balkom B.W. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Deen P.M. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2975-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 6-cm tissue culture dishes, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then preincubated for 30 min with methionine- and cysteine-free minimum Eagle's medium (Sigma). The cells were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with 0.2 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Biosciences), washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm methionine, and 1 mm cysteine for complete protein translation. The cells then were chased for the indicated times in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and collected in 700 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors) on ice. The cells were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 revolutions/min for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Supernatants were precleared by incubation with bovine serum albumin-coated protein-A beads for 1 h at 4°C and then transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with UT-A1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day, 10 μl of protein-A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated for 1 h. After complete washing with 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, the samples were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Determination of UT-A1 N-Linked Glycosylation Sites—The amino acid sequence of UT-A1 contains four consensus sites for N-glycosylation. Based on the predicted membrane topology of UT-A1, Asn-13 and -544 are on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Thus, these two are unlikely to be the sites of glycosylation. It appears that the two most likely sites of glycosylation are Asn-279 located in the first large extracellular loop and Asn-742 in the second large extracellular loop (Fig. 1A). We performed site-directed mutagenesis of these two sites by substituting glutamine (Q) for asparagine (N) in the consensus sequence and generated two single glycosylation site mutants of UT-A1, A1m1 (N279Q) and A1m2 (N742Q), and a double mutant m1m2 (N279Q/N742Q) and created stably transfected UT-A1 MDCK cell lines. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, all three of these UT-A1 mutants (A1m1, A1m2, and m1m2) have reduced molecular size; the double mutant m1m2 further reduces the molecular size to a band with a molecular mass of ∼88 kDa. These data suggest that both the Asn-279 and -742 sites are involved in N-linked glycosylation for UT-A1. This conclusion is further supported by glycosidase digestion. As shown in Fig. 1C, PNGase F treatment brought down all bands to 88 kDa. The double mutant m1m2 has the same size band as the deglycosylated form of UT-A1 treated by PNGase F, showing that UT-A1 has only the two glycosylation sites at Asn-279 -742. The single mutant bands A1m1 and A1m2 are larger than the deglycosylated UT-A1 protein, but the size of these two bands are different. The Asn-742 site in the second extracellular loop appears to have a greater extent of glycosylation than the Asn-279 site in the first extracellular loop. Unglycosylated UT-A1 Expressed in MDCK Cells Has a Delayed Response to AVP—We then tested whether elimination of the two glycosylation sites affected urea transporter function by examining the effect of AVP and FSK on urea transport in stably transfected MDCK cells expressing the UT-A1 protein. We have previously shown that both AVP and FSK stimulated transepithelial urea transport in UT-A1-MDCK cells (24Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1264-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (in press)Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, Fig. 2 shows that both in the absence of a urea transport activator and in the presence of a urea transport inhibitor, the transepithelial urea flux in these cells is low, corresponding to the lipid bilayer permeability of the epithelium. In wild-type cells, transepithelial urea fluxes were increased nearly 5-fold in response to AVP. However, in the mutant cells, this response was attenuated by >80%. Furthermore, the time course of urea flux activation differed between wild-type and mutant cells. In wild-type cells, urea flux activation appeared to have two components, a small early component that reached maximum within ∼10 min and a slower component that required about 30 min to reach maximum and that constituted ∼70% of the total response amplitude. In the mutant cells, the slow component was attenuated by 80%, and the early activation component (in response to AVP) appears to be completely eliminated. A similar effect was observed in response to FSK, which is a more potent stimulator of urea transport and where the late component makes up a much larger portion of the overall activation. For an unknown reason, the resistance of the two single mutant cells (A1m1, A1m2) could not reach 800 ohms. Therefore, we were unable to measure transepithelial urea flux in these two cell lines; hence, we do not know whether the two glycosylation sites have different roles in urea transport activity. Unglycosylated UT-A1 Has Reduced Ability to Move to the Cell Surface—To investigate whether the loss of glycosylation affects the ability of UT-A1 to reach the cell surface, we performed cell surface biotinylation. A 15-min treatment with 10 nm AVP or 10 μm FSK significantly increased UT-A1 cell surface expression in WT cells but not in m1m2 cells (Fig. 3A). However, a 15-min exposure to AVP or FSK did not significantly increase total UT-A1 protein abundance in either WT or m1m2 cells (Fig. 3B). The cell surface expression of UT-A1 (biotinylation assay) was confirmed using immunohistochemistry, where AVP and FSK increased UT-A1 staining in the apical cell surface of WT cells but not in m1m2 cells (Fig. 3C). Unglycosylated UT-A1 Is Retained in ER and Golgi Complex—To explore whether unglycosylated UT-A1 can exit the ER or Golgi complex, we performed ultracentrifugation to isolate the PM, Golgi apparatus, and ER (26Laughery M.D. Todd M.L. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34794-34803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Gatto C. McLoud S.M. Kaplan J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C982-C992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for those UT-A1 molecules in the cytoplasm trafficking between ER to Golgi or Golgi to PM, the largest amount of UT-A1 in subcellular compartments was in the ER in WT cells. These molecules include folded, unfolded, and misfolded UT-A1. A 15-min treatment with AVP or FSK markedly enhanced UT-A1 export, both from ER to Golgi and Golgi to the cell surface (Fig. 4). However, in m1m2 glycan mutant cells, there is no such redistribution of UT-A1 molecules among these three compartments with a 15-min treatment with AVP or FSK. Interestingly, when comparing untreated WT and m1m2 cells, we observed that relatively more unglycosylated UT-A1 was retained in the Golgi apparatus in the m1m2 cells, reflecting the possibility that glycosylation may have an important role in directing UT-A1 movement out of the Golgi to the cell surface. Unglycosylated UT-A1 Is Unstable—To address whether the N-linked oligosaccharide chain could stabilize the UT-A1 protein, we pulsed WT and glycan mutant m1m2 cells with 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine and then chased with unlabeled medium to assess protein stability at different time points. As seen in Fig. 5, unglycosylated UT-A1 (m1m2) demonstrates decreased stability when compared with WT UT-A1. The urea transporter UT-A1 plays a key role in the urine-concentrating mechanism. UT-A1 is a glycoprotein with two different glycosylated forms of 97 and 117 kDa; both are derived from the same 88-kDa core protein (7Bradford A.D. Terris J.M. Ecelbarger C.A. Klein J.D. Sands J.M. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F133-F143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major findings in the present study are 1) UT-A1 is glycosylated at two sites located individually in the two large extracellular loops at Asn-279 and -742, 2) unglycosylated UT-A1 stably expressed in MDCK cells has a delayed and decreased stimulation in response to AVP and FSK treatment compared with WT UT-A1, 3) less unglycosylated UT-A1 protein is delivered to the cell membrane in the first 15 min after AVP and FSK stimulation than WT UT-A1, 4) unglycosylated UT-A1 is mainly retained in the Golgi apparatus even after stimulation by AVP and FSK, and 5) unglycosylated UT-A1 has decreased stability than WT UT-A1. The amino acid sequence of UT-A1 contains four potential N-linked glycosylation consensus sites. However, it is not known whether some or all of these four are the actual sites of UT-A1 N-linked glycosylation. A previous study using limited protein enzyme digestion shows only one possible glycosylation site for UT-A1 in the N-terminal half of the molecule, namely Asn-279 (7Bradford A.D. Terris J.M. Ecelbarger C.A. Klein J.D. Sands J.M. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F133-F143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we determined that the two sites, Asn-279 and -742, residing in the two large extracellular loops are responsible for UT-A1 N-linked glycosylation and that these two sites have different extents of glycosylation. The site at Asn-742 appears to have a greater extent of glycosylation than the site at Asn-279, suggesting differential glycan synthesis and trimming (Fig. 1B). Our data show that both of the glycosylation sites contribute to UT-A1 glycosylation. However, we cannot determine whether, in vivo, the 97-kDa protein form shifts to 117 kDa due to an extended carbohydrate chain in one site or in both sites. We also cannot explain why the cells transfected with UT-A1 cDNA only produce a single 97 kDa size protein rather than the two bands of 97 and 117 kDa detected in rat inner medulla. However, enzymatic deglycosylation can reduce the 97-kDa UT-A1 to its core molecular mass of 88 kDa. This suggests that UT-A1 glycosylation may vary within the tissue or the cultured cells. Our previous (24Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1264-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (in press)Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and current studies have shown that the 97-kDa UT-A1 expressed in MDCK cells has urea transport activity. The function of a transport protein relies on its presence in the plasma membrane. Compared with glycosylated forms, the fully deglycosylated UT-A1 has reduced urea transport activity. One of the mechanisms might be that loss of the oligosaccharide chain affects the movement of the UT-A1 molecule to the cell surface. In many cases, N-linked glycosylation is critical for membrane protein intracellular movement and its eventual delivery to the cell surface. Most membrane proteins targeted to the plasma membrane possess N-linked glycosylation (12Matsuda K. Zheng J. Du G.G. Klocker N. Madison L.D. Dallos P. J.

Glycosylation has also been shown to be essential for the efficient function and surface expression of the NaCl cotransporter (14Hoover R.S. Poch E. Monroy A. Vazquez N. Nishio T. Gamba G.

Physiol. 2003; 285: G371-G381Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that AVP and FSK can stimulate urea flux in MDCK cells stably expressing UT-A1 (24Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1264-C1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Fröhlich O. Klein J.D. Smith P.M. Sands J.M. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291 (in press)Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, m1m2 cells have a delayed and significantly reduced maximally stimulated urea flux. As shown in Fig. 2, mutant UT-A1 lost the early response to AVP and FSK stimulation; one possible reason could be that mutant UT-A1 lost its ability to rapidly target to the cell membrane. Consistent with the flux results, WT UT-A1 translocates to the cell surface both in the presence of either AVP or FSK. However, the double mutant m1m2 has significantly less abundance in the cell surface, as judged from experiments with biotinylation, ultracentrifugation, and confocal microscopy. Hendriks et al. (13Hendriks G. Koudijs M. van Balkom B.W. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Deen P.M. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2975-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) report that the glycan mutant AQP2 is unable to exit the Golgi apparatus and be delivered to the cell membrane. Our results from fractional ultracentrifugation revealed that unglycosylated UT-A1 is mainly trapped in the Golgi apparatus, and it significantly lost its ability to move to the cell surface in response to AVP and FSK (for 15 min). This suggests that loss of glycosylation will affect UT-A1 exiting both the ER and Golgi, especially when moving from the Golgi to the cell surface. Unlike AQP2, which completely lost its ability to move to the cell surface in response to AVP and FSK treatment (13Hendriks G. Koudijs M. van Balkom B.W. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Deen P.M. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2975-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we still could see some mutant UT-A1 able to reach the cell surface in the biotinylation assay (Fig. 3A) and ultracentrifugation (with long exposure, data not shown), which may explain why unglycosylated UT-A1 still had some urea transport activity in the later phase. We currently do not know how the small amount of unglycosylated UT-A1 could escape from the ER quality control system and exit the Golgi complex to move to the cell surface. A previous study reports that AVP does not regulate UT-A1 trafficking to the cell membrane (31Inoue T. Terris J. Ecelbarger C.A. Chou C.-L. Nielsen S. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F559-F566PubMed Google Scholar). However, that conclusion is based on studies of Brattleboro rats, which do not have AVP. We have data in normal Sprague-Dawley rats showing that acute AVP or FSK administration significantly increases UT-A1 accumulation in the plasma membrane of rat IMCD suspensions and WT UT-A1-MDCK cells (32Klein J.D. Froehlich O. Blount M.A. Martin C.F. Smith T.D. Sands J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The present study further supports the hypothesis that AVP increases UT-A1 accumulation in the apical plasma membrane and suggests that it is one of the important mechanisms for regulation of urea transport by UT-A1. Stabilization of the mature protein is critical to its proper function. The mechanism for glycosylation-regulating transporter activity may also contribute to glycoprotein stabilization. Removal of the glycosylation site in AQP2 produces a protein with a reduced half-life (13Hendriks G. Koudijs M. van Balkom B.W. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Deen P.M. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2975-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our pulse-chase metabolic labeling study revealed that glycosylated UT-A1 is more stable than its non-glycosylated counterpart. Unglycosylated immature protein tends to stay longer in the ER (13Hendriks G. Koudijs M. van Balkom B.W. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Deen P.M. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2975-2983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The prolonged residence in the ER may facilitate UT-A1 breakdown by the ER quality control mechanisms. Even if an unglycosylated protein escapes from the ER, it is more susceptible to proteolytic attack and has a greater chance of being degraded before being inserted into the plasma membrane (33Li L.B. Chen N. Ramamoorthy S. Chi L. Cui X.N. Wang L.C. Reith M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21012-21020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Additionally, post-ER quality control mechanisms, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, may also exist. Li et al. (33Li L.B. Chen N. Ramamoorthy S. Chi L. Cui X.N. Wang L.C. Reith M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21012-21020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) also found that the non-glycosylated dopamine transporter was less stable at the cell surface, as demonstrated by apparently enhanced endocytosis. It is very likely that the decreased urea flux amplitude for glycan mutant UT-A1 is caused by an unstable UT-A1 protein in the cytoplasm or inserted into the membrane due to the lack of its N-glycan chain. Phosphorylation of UT-A1 has been shown to be one of the important mechanisms by which vasopressin rapidly increases urea permeability in vivo (10Zhang C. Sands J.M. Klein J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F85-F90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation could be another reason that mutant UT-A1 lost the early response to AVP and FSK stimulation. Wall et al. (22Wall S.M. Suk Han J. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F989-F998PubMed Google Scholar) in 1992 observed that vasopressin increases urea permeability in rat terminal IMCDs within 5-10 min. Previous work from our laboratory (10Zhang C. Sands J.M. Klein J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F85-F90Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrates that vasopressin treatment increases UT-A1 phosphorylation at 2 min. The peak is at 5-10 min, and the phosphorylation remains elevated for up to 30 min. We also examined whether the phosphorylation of UT-A1 could be one of the mechanisms for unglycosylated UT-A1 to lose its responsiveness to vasopressin in the early phase. However, we did not see any difference in protein phosphorylation between WT and glycan mutant UT-A1 (data not shown). In summary, the urea transporter UT-A1 has two glycosylation sites at Asn-279 and -742. These two sites make different contributions to the glycosylation of UT-A1. The Asn-742 site in the second extracellular loop appears to have a greater extent of glycosylation than the Asn-279 site in the first extracellular loop. Removing these two glycan sites affects urea transport activity, especially reducing AVP-stimulated activity. We further found that the reduced activity of the unglycosylated forms in response to AVP treatment is at least partially because of its impaired trafficking to the cell membrane and reduced molecule stability. Our study provides new insight that, in vivo, under certain circumstances, IMCD cells may be able to regulate urea transport by changing the extent of UT-A1 glycosylation and thereby increasing or decreasing (or even losing) its responsiveness to AVP stimulation."

We discovered that, in the kidney, cyclin I is uniquely expressed in the glomerular podocyte, and have constructed cyclin I knock-out mice to explore the biological function of cyclin I in these cells. Cyclin I knock-out (–/–) podocytes showed an increased susceptibility to apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Following induction of experimental glomerulonephritis, podocyte apoptosis was increased 4-fold in the cyclin I –/– mice, which was associated with dramatically decreased renal function. Our previous data showed that the Cdk inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 protects podocytes from certain apoptotic stimuli. In cultured cyclin I –/– podocytes, the level of p21Cip1/Waf1 was lower at base line, had a shorter half-life, and declined more rapidly in response to apoptotic stimuli than in wild-type cells. Enforced expression of p21Cip1/Waf1 reversed the susceptibility of cyclin I –/– podocytes to apoptosis. Cyclin I protects podocytes from apoptosis, and we provide preliminary data to suggest that this is mediated by stabilization of p21Cip1/Waf1.

Cyclins were originally discovered for their role in governing cell cycle progression and proliferation (1Evans T. Rosenthal T.E. Youngblom J. Distel D. Hunt T. Cell. 1983; 33: 389-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). More recently it has been appreciated that cyclins may influence a wide range of additional cellular functions, including apoptosis, hypertrophy, and differentiation. The increasingly diverse members of the cyclin protein family are all characterized by the presence of a conserved domain through which they bind to cyclin-dependent kinases, the cyclin box (2Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cyclin I, the focus of this manuscript, is most abundant in post-mitotic tissues. In contrast to the classical cyclins, its level does not fluctuate during the cell cycle (3Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y.F. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 4Jensen M.R. Audolfsson T. Factor V.M. Thorgeirsson S.S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 256: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cyclin I shows highest sequence homology to cyclins G1 and G2, and these three proteins are considered to form a separate subgroup (5Bates S. Rowan S. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1103-1109PubMed Google Scholar). However, the biological function of cyclin I is not known. Our data show that within the kidney cyclin I is specifically expressed by glomerular podocytes. These are terminally differentiated, post-mitotic, highly specialized epithelial cells, which serve as the major barrier to prevent the excretion of serum proteins into the urine. The inability to replace podocytes lost by apoptosis is thought to underlie the subsequent development of glomerulosclerosis and progressive renal impairment, regardless of the initiating injury (6Rennke H.G.

Given their limited regenerative capacity, prevention of podocyte apoptosis is of critical importance for the maintenance of normal renal function. The restricted expression of cyclin I to the renal podocyte suggested that it might play a specialized biological role in these cells. We describe here the characterization of cyclin I expression in the normal kidney and the first analysis of its function using cyclin I knock-out mice. We report that cyclin I regulates podocyte apoptosis, both in vitro and in a model of glomerular disease in vivo. Previous work has shown that p21Cip1/Waf1 has an important role in preventing podocyte apoptosis (15Kim Y.-G. Alpers C.E. Brugarolas J. Johnson R.J. Couser W.G. Shankland S.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2349-2361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and we show here that cyclin I may control p21Cip1/Waf1 abundance by regulating its stability. We propose a role for cyclin I in protecting terminally differentiated cells from apoptosis. An 11-kb NotI fragment of the cyclin I gene was obtained from a mouse 129/Sv λ genomic library and sequenced. The sequencing data were then assembled into contigs 4The abbreviations used are: contig, group of overlapping clones; +/+, wild-type; –/–, knock-out; ES, embryonic stem; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; PAN, puromycin aminonucleoside; GFP, green fluorescent protein; UUO, unilateral ureteric obstruction; WT-1, Wilm's tumor protein 1; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription. using Sequencher software. The knock-in vector was constructed by cloning a 1.3-kb SpeI-SacI fragment that encompasses the intron sequence immediately 5′ to the second exon of cyclin I as the upstream arm and a 4.5-kb BstEII-HindIII fragment that contained a portion of the coding region of the last exon of cyclin I and intron sequence cloned into the SA-β gal vector as the downstream arm. The vector was linearized with ScaI and electroporated into XY AK7 ES cells. The ES cells were then selected in 400 μg/ml G418. ES cell colonies with homologous recombination were identified by PCR amplification of a 2-kb fragment with a primer from the SA-β gal gene (SARev, 5′-CATCAAGGAAACCCTGGACTACTG-3′) and a primer from cyclin I genomic DNA just 5′ to the SpeI site (1BR+, 5′-TAGGACATGGGTCTCAGC-3′). PCR reactions were performed for 40 cycles (93 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 2 min). Proper recombination within the cyclin I locus was also confirmed by Southern blot of PstI digested genomic DNA using a probe designed with cyclin I sequences not contained within the original knock-in vector. ES cells were introduced into 5 days post-coitus C57/B6J mouse embryos. Germ line transmission, as determined by PCR, was identified in chimeric males obtained from two independent clones that were used for subsequent experiments. The wild-type allele of cyclin I was amplified using the 2718 oligonucleotide (5′-GGTGTGACTCTATGGTATTTC-3′) and the 1BR primer described above using the same PCR conditions. Day 13 embryos were washed twice in PBS and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% gluteraldehyde in PBS containing 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) for 2 h at 4 °C. Fixed embryos were washed for 15 min three times in PBS. Embryos were incubated for 6–8 h at room temperature in staining solution (2.5 mm ferrocyanide, 2.5 mm ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS) containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (diluted from a 40× stock solution in N,N-dimethylformamide). After staining, embryos were extensively washed in PBS and photographed. Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from 13-day-old embryos and maintained using standard procedures. To induce quiescence, confluent MEFs were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Quiescent cells were trypsinized, replated at low density, and stimulated with complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to enter the cell cycle. Entry into S phase was monitored by estimating the DNA content of propidium iodide-stained nuclei using fluorescence-activated flow cytometry or by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Mouse Podocytes—Female cyclin I –/– mice were crossed with a male H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mouse (ImmortoMouse; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and the F1 generation intercrossed. Conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes were derived from cyclin I +/+ and –/– littermates as described previously (16Mundel P. Reiser J. Zuniga Mejia Borja A. Pavenstadt A. Davidson G.R. Kriz W. Zeller R. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Briefly, proliferating podocytes were grown on collagen I (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) at 33 °C in medium supplemented with recombinant mouse γ-interferon (10 units/ml; Coulter, Hialeah, FL) to promote expression of the thermosensitive SV40 large T antigen. To induce quiescence and the differentiated phenotype, cells were grown at 37 °C in the same medium with no γ-interferon for 14 days and characterized by their expression of podocyte specific proteins. A similar strategy was used to generate p21Waf1/Cip1 –/– podocytes. The expression of cyclin I by cultured mouse podocytes was determined by RT-PCR. cDNA was amplified in a semiquantitative fashion using primer sets specific for the mouse cyclin I gene (forward primer, 5′-ATGAAGTTTCCAGGACCTTTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTACATGACAGAAACAGGCTG-3′). The PCR reaction was performed as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and normalized to expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Total cell protein was extracted using TG buffer (1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For Western blot analysis, 15–40 μg of protein extracts were separated under reduced conditions on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following commercially available primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-p21 (clone SX118, PharMingen), anti-human p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p27 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-p53 (clone PAb421, Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-Grb2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-actin (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). The cyclin I antibody was developed in house. Cyclin I was subcloned into pET16b (Novagen, Madison, WI) as a full-length coding sequence or the sequence encoding the amino terminus (amino acids 1–52). Protein inductions were performed in BL21 pLysS bacteria and purified under denaturing conditions with 8 m urea on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Antibodies to the two cyclin I proteins were raised in New Zealand White rabbits and affinity-purified using antigen immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Antibody was eluted from the column using 4 m MgCl2 and dialyzed extensively against PBS at 4 °C. Proteins were visualized using the chromagen 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) or ECL reagents (Pierce). Apoptosis was induced in 80–90% confluent, differentiated cyclin I +/+ and –/–, and p21Cip1/Waf1 –/– podocytes grown in 24-well plates (Primaria, VWR, West Chester, PA). Each experimental condition was carried out in quadruplicate, and experiments were performed at least three times. Apoptosis was detected as described below. Three apoptotic stimuli were used. (i) uv-C irradiation, 0–25 J/m2 using a Hoefer cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were irradiated in the absence of media and apoptosis assessed after 6 h. Protein was harvested from similarly treated cells for Western blot analysis. (ii) Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) has previously been shown to induce podocyte apoptosis in culture (17Sanwal V.

Nishino T. Kimura T. Kurioka H. Fujimoto S. Dohi K. Pathobiology. 1998; 66: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the presence of 0–100 μg/ml PAN (Sigma) and apoptosis measured after 24 h. (iii) Anti-podocyte antibody induces podocyte injury in vitro and in vivo and as described below was also used to induce experimental glomerulonephritis in mice. Cells were exposed to media containing 0–5% nephrotoxic or normal sheep serum for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed in HBSS and fresh media applied. Apoptosis was assessed after 16 h. In separate experiments, cells were fixed overnight in ice-cold methanol prior to immunofluorescence to confirm equal antibody binding. At the end of each experiment, Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 mm was added to each well. At least 400 cells were counted for each well, and the number of apoptotic nuclei expressed as a percentage of the total. Apoptosis was also assessed by a caspase 3 activity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). pBabe vectors encoding cyclin I, wild-type human p21Cip1/Waf1, lysineless (ΔK) human p21Cip1/Waf1, or GFP were transfected into Phoenix packaging cells to generate retrovirus. The retrovirus-containing media were harvested and filtered onto 50% confluent proliferating, undifferentiated cyclin I –/– podocytes. Following 48-h selection with puromycin (2.5 μg/ml), cells were passaged and transferred to growth restrictive conditions. Apoptotic susceptibility following uv-C irradiation was assessed as above. Crescentic Glomerulonephritis—Glomerulonephritis was induced in 10–12-week-old male cyclin I +/+ and –/– matched control mice by the intraperitoneal injection of sheep anti-rabbit glomerular antibody (0.5 ml/20 g of body weight) on 2 consecutive days, as described previously (20Ophascharoensuk V.

Hughes J. Roberts J.M. Shankland S.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized this model in detail and demonstrated that the observed pathological changes are not due to the presence of infiltrating cells. Cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice (n > 6/group) were sacrificed on days 7 and 14 after the second injection of anti-glomerular antibody. Urine was collected from each animal before disease induction and just prior to sacrifice for quantification of proteinuria by the sulfosalicylic acid method. Blood was collected at sacrifice to measure serum creatinine (Sigma kit number 555-A). Renal tissue was embedded in OCT compound (Miles, Elkart, IN) and frozen at –70 °C or fixed in either 10% neutral buffered formalin or methyl-Carnoy's solution (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid) for immunostaining (see below). Unilateral Ureteric Obstruction (UUO)—Experimental UUO was performed on anesthetized 8–10-week-old cyclin I +/+ and –/– animals (n = 8/group) by ligation of the left ureter at the ureteropelvic junction (22Truong L.D. Petrusevska G. Yang G. Gurnipar T. Shappell S. Lechago J. Rouse D. Suki W.N. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 200-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Mice were sacrificed at day 7 and kidneys fixed as above for histological assessment. The contralateral non-obstructed kidney served as control. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining was performed on formalin or methyl-Carnoy's fixed tissue with antibodies against β-galactosidase (1:1000 dilution, Abcam), WT-1 (sc192, 1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and fibronectin (1:500 dilution, Chemicon International Inc.). Measurement of apoptosis was by the TUNEL assay, performed as described previously (23Baker A.J. Mooney A. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was also quantified in the thymus of unmanipulated cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice. Frozen sections were rehydrated in PBS and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to sheep IgG (Cappel, Durham, NC), to ensure comparable glomerular antibody deposition between the cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice. The autologous phase of the disease was similarly assessed by immunostaining with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody to mouse IgG (Cappel). Double immunostaining for β-galactosidase (goat polyclonal antibody, 1:100 dilution, Biogenesis, Kingston, NH) and WT-1 (sc192 rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed. After washing, sections were incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Binding was detected using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:100 dilution; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and Alexa Fluor 594 streptavidin (Molecular Probes). Glomerulosclerosis was determined on periodic acid Schiff-stained sections for a minimum of 50 glomeruli in each animal and was graded quantitatively based on the percentage of glomerular tuft area involvement as follows: grade 1 = <25%; grade 2 = 25–50%; grade 3 = 50–75%; grade 4 = 75–100%. Slides were viewed using a Leica confocal microscope (Leica, Deerfield, IL) using either bright-field or appropriate epifluorescent optics. All results are expressed as mean + S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student's t test. Targeted Disruption of the Cyclin I Gene Creates a Null Mutation—We constructed a cyclin I knock-out (–/–) mouse in which the cyclin I coding exons were replaced with the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (Fig. 1A). Staining of day 13 embryos for β-galactosidase activity confirmed expression of the transgene (Fig. 1B). Viable cyclin I –/– mice were obtained from intercrosses of cyclin I +/– heterozygotes at the normal Mendelian frequency of 25% (142/512) and showed no apparent developmental defects. The genotype of the offspring was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 1C). Protein extracts from various tissues from one month old pups underwent Western blot analysis, and highest expression was seen in the brain, followed by testis (data not shown), although cyclin I –/– mice were fertile and displayed no behavioral abnormalities. The lack of cyclin I protein expression in the homozygous knock-out mice was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with an anti-cyclin I antibody (Fig. 1D). To test whether cyclin I –/– cells had detectable defects in cell proliferation, we isolated MEFs from 13-day-old embryos (Fig. 1E). Cyclin I –/– MEFs responded to serum stimulation and progressed through the cell cycle at the same rate as control MEFs (Fig. 1F). Population doubling times were also unaffected by the absence of cyclin I (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggested that cyclin I was not required for cell proliferation, and its abundant expression in some post-mitotic cells suggested that it may have a role distinct from the cell cycle. Cyclin I Is Expressed by Podocytes in Vitro and in Vivo —We used immunohistochemical analysis of β-galactosidase to determine the pattern of cyclin I expression in the kidney, as this gene has been introduced in place of cyclin I. As expected, no β-galactosidase expression was detected in the cyclin I +/+ mice (Fig. 2A). However, in the cyclin I –/– mice, distinct staining was seen in the glomerulus in a podocyte distribution (Fig. 2B). Weaker and variable expression was seen in tubular cells (data not shown). Wilm's tumor protein 1 (WT-1) was used as a podocyte specific marker (24Mundlos S. Pelletier J. Darveau A. Bachmann M. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Development (Camb.). 1993; 119: 1329-1341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by immunofluorescence co-localized with β galactosidase (Fig. 2, C–E), confirming within the glomerulus the exclusive expression of β-galactosidase (and therefore the cyclin I gene) by podocytes in vitro. To confirm the podocyte-specific expression of the endogenous cyclin I protein, we used RT-PCR (Fig. 2F) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 2G) for cyclin I using RNA and protein from proliferating, undifferentiated and from post-mitotic, differentiated podocytes. Cyclin I expression was similar in proliferating and quiescent cells. Similarly to MEFs, cyclin I –/– podocytes showed no detectable defects in cell proliferation. For our further studies we focused on the role of cyclin I in renal podocytes. Cultured Cyclin I –/– Podocytes Are More Susceptible to Apoptosis—The expression of cyclin I in post-mitotic cells suggested involvement in pathways other than the cell cycle. We therefore induced apoptosis in cultured cyclin I +/+ podocytes using uv-C irradiation. Western blot analysis demonstrated down-regulation of cyclin I protein levels in podocytes following irradiation (Fig. 3A). We then hypothesized that cyclin I might be important for determining the threshold at which podocytes undergo apoptosis following stimulation and explored this using cyclin I +/+ and –/– cultured podocytes. As determined by Hoechst 33342 staining, apoptosis occurred earlier, and was of a greater magnitude, in the cyclin I –/– podocytes following induction by three different stimuli: (i) uv-C (Fig. 3B), (ii) PAN (Fig. 3C), and (iii) anti-podocyte antibody (Fig. 3D). Apoptosis induced by uv-C activates both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptotic signaling (25Scoltock A.B. Cidlowski J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas PAN principally activates the intrinsic pathway (26Wada T. Pippin J.W. Marshall C.B. Griffin S.V. Shankland S.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2615-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the mechanism by which the anti-podocyte antibody causes apoptosis is unknown. The increased susceptibility of the cyclin I –/– podocytes to apoptosis induced by all three stimuli suggests that cyclin I acts distally in the pathways converging to cause cell death. To further confirm the increased apoptosis in cyclin I –/– cells, we performed an activity assay for caspase 3 using uv-C-irradiated cyclin I +/+ and –/– podocytes (Fig. 3E). The increased caspase 3 activity in the irradiated cyclin I –/– podocytes validates the results using Hoechst 33342 staining, showing that apoptosis was significantly increased in cyclin I –/– cells compared with cyclin I +/+ cells receiving the same stimulus. Apoptosis of Cyclin I –/– Podocytes Is Rescued by Reconstitution of Cyclin I—To verify that the lowered apoptotic threshold observed in cyclin I –/– podocytes is indeed due to a deficiency in cyclin I itself (rather than due to altered expression of an adjacent gene that might have been affected by the deletion of cyclin I) we stably reintroduced cyclin I into cyclin I –/– podocytes by retroviral transduction. GFP served as a negative control. Following cyclin I reconstitution in cyclin I –/– cells, apoptosis was measured 6 h following irradiation with 25 J/m2 (Fig. 3F). The reconstitution of cyclin I completely reversed the apoptotic susceptibility of the cyclin I –/– cells. Podocyte Number and Renal Function Are Normal in Unmanipulated Cyclin I –/– Mice—We next studied the role of cyclin I in vivo. The cyclin I –/– mouse is phenotypically normal under physiological conditions. Renal function and histology were evaluated in detail from 12-week-old male cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice (n = 6/group). There was no difference in serum creatinine (+/+, 0.23 + 0.06 mg/dl; –/–, 0.28 + 0.08 mg/dl, p = not significant), urine protein:creatinine ratio (+/+, 8.2 + 4.6 mg/mg; –/–, 8.3 + 7.8 mg/mg, p = not significant) or podocyte number (+/+, 8.1 + 0.3; –/–, 7.9 + 1.0 per glomerular cross-section, p = not significant) between the two groups. These results indicate that cyclin I is not required for normal glomerular development nor for maintenance of normal renal function. Apoptosis Is Increased in Cyclin I –/– Nephritic Mice—We reasoned that a critical role for cyclin I might be revealed following injury, as suggested by the in vitro data. To test this hypothesis, experimental glomerulonephritis was induced in cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice with a sheep anti-podocyte antibody (20Ophascharoensuk V. Pippin J. Gordon K.L. Shankland S.J.

Med. 1998; 4: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that this model is not characterized by the presence of infiltrating leukocytes, and the observed rates of apoptosis are in resident glomerular cells (20Ophascharoensuk V. Pippin J. Gordon K.L. Shankland S.J. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1998; 54: 416-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence, equal deposition of sheep and mouse immunoglobulin was seen in both cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice at the same time points (data not shown), confirming comparable initiating injury. Consistent with our in vitro data, glomerular cell apoptosis was increased 4-fold in the cyclin I –/– mice at day 7 of nephritis (0.07 + 0.03 versus 0.28 + 0.08 apoptotic cells per glomerular cross-section, p < 0.005), and these apoptotic cells were in a podocyte distribution (Fig. 4, A and B). To characterize the consequences of the early increased apoptosis, the number of podocytes was determined by counting WT-1-positive cells. There was no difference in podocyte number in unmanipulated mice (Fig. 5, A and B). However, by day 14 after disease induction podocyte number was significantly less in the cyclin I –/– versus wild-type mice (1.46 + 1.24 versus 3.19 + 0.90 cells per glomerular cross-section; p < 0.01) (Fig. 5, E and F).FIGURE 5Podocyte loss, matrix accumulation, and glomerulosclerosis are increased in cyclin I –/– nephritic mice. Podocytes were identified by immunostaining for WT-1. In unmanipulated animals, a similar complement of podocytes was seen in both the cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice (A and B). In contrast, at day 14 of nephritis there were significantly fewer podocytes in the cyclin I –/– mice (E and F). C and D, there was no difference in base-line immunostaining for fibronectin in the cyclin I +/+ and –/– mice. G and H, at day 14 of nephritis, there was greater accumulation of fibronectin in the cyclin I –/– mice. I, podocyte loss at day 14 was greater in the cyclin I –/– mice. J, glomerulosclerosis at day 7 was similar in the two groups but progressed to extensive involvement in the –/– mice at day 14. K, there was a strong correlation between the decline in WT-1-positive podocytes and glomerulosclerosis for both groups of mice (R2 = 0.616). **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005.

https://openalex.org/W2094850996,"Glycine max serine acetyltransferase 2;1 (GmSerat2;1) is a member of a family of enzymes that catalyze the first reaction in the biosynthesis of cysteine from serine. It was identified by interaction cloning as a protein that binds to calcium-dependent protein kinase. In vitro phosphorylation assays showed that GmSerat2;1, but not GmSerat2;1 mutants (S378A or S378D), were phosphorylated by soybean calcium-dependent protein kinase isoforms. Recombinant GmSerat2;1 was also phosphorylated by soybean cell extract in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of recombinant GmSerat2;1 had no effect on its catalytic activity but rendered the enzyme insensitive to the feedback inhibition by cysteine. In transient expression analyses, fluorescently tagged GmSerat2;1 localized in the cytoplasm and with plastids. Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies showed that an increase in GmSerat2;1 phosphorylation occurred in vivo within 5 min of treatment of soybean cells with 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide, whereas GmSerat2;1 protein synthesis was not significantly induced until 1 h after oxidant challenge. Internal Ca2+ was required in the induction of both GmSerat2;1 phosphorylation and synthesis. Treatment of cells with calcium antagonists showed that externally derived Ca2+ was important for retaining GmSerat2;1 at a basal level of phosphorylation but was not necessary for its hydrogen peroxide-induced synthesis. Protein phosphatase type 1, but not type 2A or alkaline phosphatase, dephosphorylated native GmSerat2;1 in vitro. These results support the hypothesis that GmSerat2;1 is regulated by calcium-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation in vivo and suggest that increased GmSerat2;1 synthesis and phosphorylation in response to active oxygen species could play a role in anti-oxidative stress response.

In plants and microorganisms, cysteine is the point of entry for inorganic sulfur into organic compounds. Cysteine synthesis proceeds via two steps: 1) l-serine + acetyl-CoA → O-acetylserine + CoA and 2) O-acetylserine + S2- → l-cysteine + acetate. In the first step, serine acetyltransferase (SAT, 5The abbreviations used are: SAT, serine acetyltransferase; OAS, O-acetylserine, OAS-TL, O-acetylserine (thiol)lyase; IP3, clone encoding interacting protein 3; GmSerat2;1, G. max serine acetyltransferase 2;1; CDPK, calcium-dependent protein kinase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PP, protein phosphatase; IP3, interacting protein 3; EST, expressed sequence tag; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FL, full-length G. max serine acetyltransferase 2;1; ΔN, amino-terminal deleted version of GmSerat2;1 encoded by IP3; gAb, general antibody; cAb, C-terminal antibody; pAb, phospho-specific antibody; IP, immunoprecipitation; A9C, anthracene-9-carboxylate; ST, staurosporine; NAS, N-acetylserine; DTT, dithiothreitol; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1, 3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. EC 2.3.1.30) transfers an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to serine to form the intermediate product, O-acetylserine (OAS). In the next reaction, catalyzed by O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase (OAS-TL, EC 4.2.99.8), sulfide reacts with OAS, forming cysteine. In plants, SAT and OAS-TL are found in multiple subcellular compartments, and the activity of SAT in these compartments is 4-300-fold less than that of OAS-TL (1Nakamura K. Hayama A. Masada M. Fukushima K. Tamura G. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 885-891Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 2Droux M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 41: 619-627Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Wirtz M. Hell R. J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 163: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The availability of OAS has been found to be limiting for cysteine biosynthesis (4Liszewska F. Blaszczyk A.

Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and SAT is in a position to regulate not only cysteine synthesis but also sulfur homeostasis for the whole plant (6Wirtz M. Droux M. Photosyn. Res. 2005; 86: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). SAT activity is thought to be regulated by formation of a complex with OAS-TL (3Wirtz M. Hell R. J.

Biochem. 1998; 255: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and some forms of plant SATs are feedback-inhibited by cysteine. In Arabidopsis, two of the three cytosolic SATs are inhibited by cysteine, while the plastidic and mitochondrial SATs are not (8Kawashima C.G. Berkowitz O. Hell R. Noji M. Saito K.

Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2003; 41: 619-627Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The variation among species in the sensitivity of plastidic and cytosolic SATs to cysteine suggests variation in the regulation of cysteine synthesis from species to species and compartment to compartment. Species differences in other parts of the sulfur assimilation pathway (10Kopriva S. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2006; 97: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) further emphasize variation in sulfur metabolism and its regulation in plants. Glutathione (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) or homoglutathione (γ-GluCys-β-Ala) in legumes, including soybean, protects plants from oxidative damage that arises from various stress conditions. Considerable increases in the pool size of glutathione have been reported in plants exposed to various abiotic and biotic stresses such as chilling (11Kocsy G. Brunner M. Ruegsegger A. Stamp P. Brunold C. Planta. 1996; 198: 365-370Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar), drought (12Dhindsa R.S. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), herbicide safeners (13Kocsy G. von Ballmoos P. Ruegsegger A. Szalai G. Galiba G. Brunold C.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1367-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Increased glutathione concentrations were observed when cysteine content was increased artificially by supplying sulfate (15De Kok L.J. Kuiper P.J.C. Physiol.

Bot. 2004; 55: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting cysteine availability plays an important role in determining glutathione content. Recent evidence shows that in addition to increasing glutathione, stresses such as heat shock, chilling, hypoosmolarity, and exogenous application of H2O2 trigger increases in reactive oxygen species and cytosolic calcium in plant cells and seedlings (21Rentel M.C.

In this paper we show that a serine acetyltransferase from soybean (GmSerat2;1) is a substrate of CDPK (calcium-dependent protein kinase). CDPKs function as both Ca2+ sensors and effectors (27Harmon A.C. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GmSerat2;1 at a specific serine residue in the carboxyl terminus renders the enzyme insensitive to feedback inhibition by cysteine. Using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies, we show that GmSerat2;1 is phosphorylated in soybean cells. Furthermore, treatment of cells with H2O2 induces both phosphorylation and protein synthesis of GmSerat2;1, and internally derived calcium and kinase activity are involved in the induction. Based on these results we propose that H2O2-induced increase in the activity of GmSerat2;1 contributes to the oxidative stress response in soybean. Plant Material—Soybean cell suspension cultures (Glycine max L.) were maintained as described previously (28Bachmann M. Shiraishi N. Campbell W.H. Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Huber S.C. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured every 7 days, and all treatments were done using cells 3 days after transfer to fresh medium. Inhibitors and H2O2 were added to the indicated concentrations. Following incubation for the indicated times, cells were collected on Miracloth (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), drained of culture medium, and washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.4 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm Na2MO4. DNA Sequencing—Sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing performed by the University of Florida DNA Sequencing Core Facility. The sequence for GmSerat2; 1ΔN (IP3) has been deposited in the GenBank™ data bank under the accession number AY422685. Interaction Cloning—Procedures for interaction cloning (identification of proteins expressed from a cDNA library that bind to a labeled probe) were adapted from Blanar and Rutter (29Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and Stone et al. (30Stone J.M. Collinge M.A. Smith R.D. Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Science. 1994; 266: 793-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A soybean cDNA library made in the UniZap™ XR vector, which allows expression of cDNA inserts as fusion proteins with β-galactosidase, was the gift of R. Tenhaken and C. Lamb. Plating of phage and expression and transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes were performed using a picoBlue™ immunoscreening kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Nitrocellulose membranes were washed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 three times at 25 °C and incubated in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1-2 h at 4 °C. Probes were purified recombinant soybean CDPKα,-β, and -γ labeled with 32P by autophosphorylation in 100 μl of phosphorylation buffer (31Harmon A.C. Yoo B.-C. McCaffery C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) for 15 min at 25 °C. After autophosphorylation and removal of unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP by gel filtration, probes were equilibrated with binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 50 mm NaCl), and the concentration adjusted to 2-5 × 105 cpm/ml. Hybridization was performed at 4 °C overnight with continuous shaking in binding buffer supplemented with 1% nonfat dry milk. Membranes were washed three times for 10 min each at 25 °C in the same buffer, air-dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Complementation Assay—Escherichia coli strain JM39 (F+, cysE51, recA56), which lacks serine acetyltransferase activity and requires l-cystine for growth (32Jones-Mortimer M.C. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was transformed with putative SAT clones and tested for complementation by growth on mediim lacking l-cystine. Plasmid Construction and Site-directed Mutagenesis—To make a construct encoding maltose-binding protein (MBP) fused to the NH2 terminus of GmSerat2;1ΔN, the open reading frame of clone IP3, which encoded interacting protein 3, was PCR-amplified and cloned into pMal-cRI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The 5′ primer was 5′-GCGGATCCCATATGGCCACTTGTGTT (BamHI, NdeI, underlined) and 3′ primer was 5′-GCGGATCCCTATATAACATAATC (BamHI). The BamHI-digested fragment was ligated into pMal-cRI. The integrity of subcloning was verified by complementation assay as described above. The point mutation (S378A) was made by recombination PCR (33Jones D.H. Howard B.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 62-66PubMed Google Scholar). pBluescript KS/GmSerat2;1ΔN, constructed by subcloning BamHI-digested pMal-cRI/GmSerat2;1ΔN into pBluescript KS, was linearized and used as a template for PCR with mutagenic primers: primer 1, 5′-GATGCCTga/cTTTTACtATGGACCATACTTCATGGTCTGATTA-3′; primer 2, 5′-CATAATCAGACCATGAAGTATGGTCCATaGTAAAAg/tcAGGCATCTTATCC-3′; primer 3 (2266-2286), 5′-TGCGCAACGTTGTTGCCATTG-3′; primer 4 (2283-2260), 5′-TGGCAACAACGTTGCGCAAACTAT-3′. The resultant plasmid, pBluescript KS/GmSerat2;1(S378A), was digested with BamHI and ligated into pMal-cRI. A GmSerat2;1 cDNA containing a full-length open reading frame was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR using total RNA prepared from soybean culture cells and gene-specific primers. PCR products were cloned into either pdGN (34Lee J.-Y. Taoka K. Yoo B.-C. Ben-Nissan G. Kim D.-J. Lucas W.J. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) for expression of carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion proteins or pdYN 6J.-Y. Lee, unpublished data. for expression of COOH-terminal YFP fusion proteins under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. For construction of pMal-cRI/GmSerat2;1, PCR was performed with primers YooP1 (5′-CGGAATTCATGAATGTTCTGGCTCTAGGGCG-3′) and YooP2 (5′-CGGGATCCTATATAACATAATCAGACCATG-3′) and pdGN/GmSerat2;1 as template. GmSerat2;1(S378D) was constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis with primers YooP1, YooP4 (5′-GACCATGAAGTATGGTCCATGATAAAATCAGGCATCTTATCCAATTTAATAGGG-3′) and pBluescriptSK-GmSerat2;1 as a template. The PCR product was the template in a second PCR reaction with primers YooP1 and YooP9 (5′-GTATGGTCCATGGTAAAATCAGGCATC-3′). An NcoI-digested fragment was subsequently isolated and ligated into NcoI-digested pBluescriptSK-GmSerat2;1. Expression and Purification of Fusion Proteins—Protocols for expression of recombinant proteins were described previously (35Lee J.Y. Yoo B.C. Harmon A.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6801-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For purification of MBP fusion proteins, bacterial cells were resuspended in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed by sonication. After clarification by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and loaded onto a column of amylose-agarose (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with a binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl). After extensive washing with binding buffer, proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose in binding buffer. Purified proteins were stored in 50% glycerol at -80 °C. The activity of MBP-GmSerat2;1 was stable at room temperature for several days, and small losses of activity (10-20%) were observed after several cycles of freezing and thawing. Inclusion of DTT and glycerol in the purification buffers did not affect yield but appeared to help preserve activity during freezing and thawing. Expression and purification of His6-CDPKα was described previously (31Harmon A.C. Yoo B.-C. McCaffery C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assay—CDPK activity assays were performed as described previously (31Harmon A.C. Yoo B.-C. McCaffery C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Serine Acetyltransferase—Phosphorylation of SAT was performed on ice in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm CaCl2 (omitted for calciumfree reactions), 1 mm DTT, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm [32P]ATP (∼500 cpm/pmol), and 4 ng of His6-CDPKα for every 1 μg of MBP fusion protein. The reactions were initiated by addition of ATP and stopped by the addition of 4 volumes of stop buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA). Aliquots of reactions were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to x-ray film. To determine phosphorylation stoichiometry (moles of 32P incorporated per mole of protein) protein bands were excised from gels, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. To test the effect of phosphorylation on SAT activity, phosphorylation reactions were carried out as described above except without radioisotope, and aliquots were used to measure SAT activity. Activity Assays of Serine Acetyltransferase—The radiometric assay was carried out in a 100-μl mixture that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm acetyl-CoA, and 1 mm [3H]l-serine (1 μCi), with or without 1 mm l-cysteine, and with indicated amounts of SAT, either untreated or phosphorylated by CDPK. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [3H]l-serine, incubated for various times at 30 °C, stopped by addition of 0.2 volume of concentrated ammonium hydroxide, and incubated an additional 60 min to ensure complete conversion of OAS to N-acetylserine (NAS) (36Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 4955-4965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An aliquot of the reaction mixture was passed over 0.5 ml of AG 50W-X8 resin (Bio-Rad) to resolve NAS from serine (37Smith I.K. Thompson J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1969; 35: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NAS was eluted with 3 ml of water, and aliquots were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. A blank reaction containing all components except acetyl-CoA was run in parallel and subtracted as a background reading. The identities of the reaction products, the completeness of the conversion of OAS to NAS, and the efficiency of NAS elution were examined by TLC, ninhydrin staining, and autoradiography, using standard compounds as controls. TLC was performed on Cellulose 300, 100-μm TLC plates (Selecto Scientific, Inc., Suwanee, GA) and developed with butanol:water: acetic acid, 65:25:15 by volume. Activities of full-length GmSerat2;1 constructs were determined by a spectrophotometric assay based on the absorbance of acetyl-CoA at 232 nm (ϵ = 4500). Reactions were carried out at room temperature (23 °C) in a volume of 1 ml containing 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm acetyl-CoA, 5 mm l-serine, various concentrations of l-cysteine, and 1 μg of SAT. Absorbance readings were collected every 3 s for a period of 1 min during which time the reaction rate was linear. Specific activities determined by the two assays differed (Tables 1 and 2), but the effects of mutations, phosphorylation, and cysteine on activity were consistent, regardless of the assay used.TABLE 1SAT activity measured by the spectrophotometric assayEnzymeActivityaActivity was determined from the disappearance of acetyl-CoA measured by the change in absorbance at 232 nm and calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 4500.Standard deviationnbNumber of independent determinations of activity.

Open table in a new tab Antibodies—SAT general antibody (gAb) was made with MBP-GmSerat2;1ΔN as antigen by Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA. Antibodies precipitated from 10 ml of antiserum by 50% saturated ammonium sulfate were dialyzed against TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and then loaded onto an affinity column of GmSerat2;1ΔN-Sepharose. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of TBS, and antibodies were eluted with 1 m acetic acid, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 2.0. Fractions with the highest absorption readings at 280 nm were pooled, buffer-exchanged to TBS, concentrated, and lyophilized. GmSerat2;1 COOH-terminal antibodies (cAb) were made by Cocalico Biologicals, with 20-mer peptides CPPNPIKLDKMPSFTMDHTS and CPPNPIKLDKMP(pS)FTMDHTS as antigens. Peptides were synthesized by the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida and included NH2-terminal cysteine residues used for coupling of the peptide to SulfoLink gel (Pierce), spacer proline residues, and the COOH-terminal phosphorylation site of GmSerat2;1 (residues 368-385). A 50% ammonium sulfate fraction of the antiserum was dialyzed against antibody-binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm NaF) and loaded onto the dephosphopeptide column, and then flow-through fractions were loaded onto phospho-peptide column (P-column). The P-column was washed first with 10 column volumes of antibody-binding buffer and then with 10 column volumes of washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl). Antibodies were eluted from P-column with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.0, buffer-exchanged to TBS, and concentrated. Unexpectedly, the purified antibodies recognized both dephospho- and phospho-MBP-GmSerat2; 1ΔN equally well. Polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognized phosphorylated GmSerat2;1 (pAb), were made by Sigma-Genosys, The Woodlands, TX, using a 13-mer peptide, CPLDKMP(pS)FT-MDH (residues 372-383 of GmSerat2;1 plus NH2-terminal CP). Antibodies were affinity purified on a column of immobilized phosphopeptide; however, they also recognized dephosphoGmSerat2;1. To obtain the phospho-specific antibody (pAb) the latter antibodies were further purified by the same protocol used for purification of gAb, except that phospho- and dephospho-13-mer peptides were used for affinity purification. Aliquots of antibodies were stored at -20 °C. Protein Extraction and Immunoprecipitation—Harvested soybean cells were homogenized in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mm Na2VO3, 1 μm Microcystin LR, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 60 min at 40,000 × g, and proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by ammonium sulfate at 20-50% saturation. Protein pellets were resuspended in desalting buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2MO4, 1 mm Na2VO3). The solution was clarified by centrifugation and passed over a desalting column equilibrated with desalting buffer. The desalted fraction was supplemented with 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and 1% Nonidet P-40 and precleared of nonspecific proteins by incubating with protein-G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out with 5 μg of antibodies for 2 h at 4°C, with the same amount of total protein for each experiment, as determined according to Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein-G-Sepharose was added to bring down immunocomplexes. Protein-G pellets were washed four times with desalting buffer, once with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved either in conventional 10% Laemmli SDS-PAGE gels using Tris-glycine buffer or in precast 10% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) using MOPS running buffer. Immunoaffinity Purification of GmSerat2;1 from Cell Extracts—A 20-50% ammonium sulfate fraction of cell extract was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2MO4, and 1 mm Na2VO3, passed through a desalting column to exchange the buffer for Ag/Ab binding buffer (Pierce), and then loaded onto gAb-Sepharose. After the column was washed with 15 bed volumes of binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted using gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce). Fractions with the highest absorption readings at 280 nm were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and stored in aliquots at -20 °C. Immunoblotting Analysis—Proteins blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane were detected by incubation with the indicated primary antibody and γ-chain-specific goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) as secondary antibody. Signals were visualized with Western SuperSignal Femto substrate (Pierce) and exposure to Biomax ML film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For additional analysis of the same blot, antibodies were stripped off the membrane with Western blot Restoring Buffer (Pierce) and probed with a different primary antibody. Signals on films were scanned, digitized, and, where indicated, quantified using NIH Image (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Calibration was done using known concentrations of His6-CDPKα. For quantification of phosphorylation and total protein of GmSerat2;1, signals were normalized to those measured for untreated cells and presented as relative units. Protein Phosphatase Assay—Resuspended 20-50% ammonium sulfate fractions from cell extracts were desalted on a gel filtration column equilibrated in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)). For protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) the assay buffer was supplemented with 200 μm Mn2+, and the PP1-specific inhibitor PPI-2 was added for some reactions. For alkaline phosphatase, 1 mm Mg2+ and 0.1 mm Zn2+ were added to the reaction. Reactions proceeded for 10 min at 30 °C and were stopped by the addition of Microcystin LR and EDTA to final concentrations of 1 μm and 1 mm, respectively. PP1, PP2A, and PPI-2 were from Calbiochem and alkaline phosphatase from Sigma. Subcellular Localization—Constructs encoding GmSerat2;1 fused to the NH2 terminus of either GFP or YFP were introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves or dark-germinated soybean radicles by microprojectile bombardment with a Bio-Rad PDS-1000. A Zeiss LSM 510 NLO Multiphoton confocal microscope was used to collect images 12-24 h post-bombardment. Identification of GmSerat2;1 by Interaction Cloning—To identify potential substrates and/or interacting proteins of soybean CDPKs, we adapted a well established interaction cloning protocol (29Blanar M.A. Rutter W.J. Science. 1992; 256: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which was instrumental in identification of proteins that interact with protein kinases (30Stone J.M. Collinge M.A."

They may also be involved in the deactivation of odorants (1Pelosi P. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 30: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Lazar J. Greenwood D. Rasmussen L. Prestwich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11786-11794Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Only a few OBP subtypes have been found in any given organism, indicating relatively low ligand specificity, with dissociation constants in the micromolar range (3Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillaud C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 4Loebel D. Strotmann J. Jacob M. Breer H. Chem. Senses. 2001; 26: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The all α-helical OBPs of insects have been suggested to possess intrinsic conformational flexibility (for a review, see Ref. 5Tegoni M. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that would allow them to modify their conformation on ligand binding, and which would thereby constitute a mechanism for specific olfactory receptor recognition of the ligand-bound protein. For example, an insect PBP-pheromone complex has been suggested from electrophysiological evidence to be responsible for activation of pheromone receptors (6Pophof B. Naturwissenschaften. 2002; 89: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mammalian OBPs fold into an antiparallel β-barrel and are members of the lipocalin superfamily (for a review, see Ref. 7Flower D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In many studies, this fold has been assumed to be unlikely a priori to undergo conformational modifications. However, the first structure of a mammalian OBP (8Tegoni M. Ramoni R. Bignetti E. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Bianchet M. Bains G. Pelosi P. Pevsner J. Snyder S. Monaco H. Amzel L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 934-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), that of the cow, revealed a domain-swapped dimer, in which the helix near the C-terminal region of each monomer packed against the β-barrel of the other. Subsequent studies of OBPs from other species and mutant proteins demonstrated that the domain swapping seen in bovine OBP is an exception, arising from a different linker length joining the helix to the barrel domain as well as the absence of the C-terminal disulfide conserved in other lipocalins (10Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Bonicel J. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7913Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11Ramoni R. Vincent F. Ashcroft A. Accornero P. Grolli S. Valencia C. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 739-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the occurrence of domain swapping itself is a reminder that the lipocalin structure is not inert. Indeed, other conformational changes in lipocalins appear to occur under certain conditions, and may be involved in signaling the presence of ligand. In rat OBP, changes in measured amino acid pKa values and circular dichroism spectra suggest that conformational change at some level occurs upon odorant binding (12Nespoulous C Briand L Delage M.-M. Tran V. Pernollet J.-C. Chem. Senses. 2004; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Larger modifications of the lipocalin framework are not without precedent as well. The ligand-bound form of the retinol-binding protein is recognized preferentially by transthyretin because of a subtle conformational change induced by ligand binding (13Monaco H. Rizzi M. Coda A. Science. 1995; 268: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 14Monaco H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, recent work on this lipocalin has suggested that it may also undergo conformational changes to release the ligand at the cell surface (15Paci E. Greene L.H. Jones R.M. Smith L.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). β-Lactoglobulin, despite being the prototypical member of the lipocalin superfamily exhibiting the characteristic β-barrel structure, nevertheless has a high α-helix propensity; in denaturation/renaturation experiments, structures with a higher helical content than the native structure appear as intermediates (16Hamada D. Segawa S. Goto Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). NMR data from refolding (17Forge V. Hoshino M. Kuwata K. Arai M. Kuwajima K. Batt C. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and pressure-induced unfolding (18Kuwata K. Li H. Yamada H. Batt C. Goto Y. Akasawa K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) studies of β-lactoglobulin have also indicated the presence of intermediate structured forms. The dynamics of OBP and their potential modifications upon ligand binding have been little studied, but it should be kept in mind that any modulation of pre-existing conformational equilibria of the lipocalin framework by ligand binding would confer upon OBPs a more complex role than that implied in a simple passive transport or scavenging model, and could be linked to interactions of the protein with other partners. Data concerning putative interactions between OBP and olfactory receptors are also scarce, but Matarazzo et al. (19Matarazzo V. Zsurger N. Guillemot J.-C. Clot-Faybesse O. Botto J.-M. Dal Farra C. Crowe M. Demaille J. Vincent J.-P. Mazella J. Ronin C. Chem. Senses. 2002; 27: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), using purified, radiolabeled protein, have presented evidence of selective, nanomolar binding of unligated porcine OBP to a human olfactory receptor, suggesting that OBPs may well be involved directly in the signal transduction mechanism. In such a case, ligand-linked conformational changes would have important consequences in the molecular events accompanying the initial steps of olfaction. We report here molecular dynamics studies of the dynamics of the OBP-odorant binding interaction for rat and porcine OBP. Such calculations provide atomic-level descriptions of conformational changes and pathway intermediates that are difficult to study directly. The odorant molecule thymol was chosen for this study because of its small size and limited flexibility as well as the availability of the crystal structure of its complex with porcine OBP (3Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillaud C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). From a series of independent molecular dynamics trajectories, we observed a consensus pathway for ligand unbinding for rat OBP-1F, and calculated the PMF along this path. Titration microcalorimetry confirmed specific binding of thymol to rat OBP and permitted experimental measurement of the binding affinity, which is interpreted in terms of the PMF and the dynamics results. Marked changes in the dynamic properties of OBP are seen in the presence of ligand, and suggest a promising direction for study in understanding the role of OBPs in olfaction. Starting Structures—Two OBP protein structures were used in this work: the crystal structure of the porcine OBP-thymol complex (Ref. 3Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillaud C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, PDB identifier 1E06) and the rat OBP-1F homology-modeled structure (12Nespoulous C Briand L Delage M.-M. Tran V. Pernollet J.-C. Chem. Senses. 2004; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) in which hamster aphrodisin (1EFP; 43% sequence identity) was used as template after secondary structure-weighted multiple alignment of six related lipocalins of known structure. The homology model was energy-minimized and verified using Procheck (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 12Nespoulous C Briand L Delage M.-M. Tran V. Pernollet J.-C. Chem. Senses. 2004; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additional ProsaII analyses (21Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) revealed the entire structure to be in the favored negative-energy region. Further verifications of the homology-modeled structure are described under “Results.” Initial thymol placement in the rat structure was obtained by superimposition of the porcine OBP-thymol complex, followed by energy minimization using CHARMm (22Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 93: 2487-2502Google Scholar). Force Field and Parameterization—Molecular dynamics trajectories for the rat and porcine OBP-thymol complexes in explicit solvent were calculated using parameter set 27 of the CHARMm package (22Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 93: 2487-2502Google Scholar) as described below. InsightII (Accelrys, Inc.) was used to calculate the atomic partial charges on the thymol molecule using MOPACK-AM1. As has been pointed out elsewhere (e.g. Refs. 23Feig M. Brooks C.L.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biology. 2004; 14: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar and 15Paci E. Greene L.H. Jones R.M. Smith L.J. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4826-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), sampling in explicit solvent simulations is generally much more computationally intensive than in implicit solvent approaches. In particular, equilibration of explicit solvent molecules during ligand passage through a deep binding channel, as is the case in the lipocalin systems, depends on highly stochastic events and poses a particular challenge to canonical or microcanonical explicit solvent approaches (see Refs. 24Resat H. Marrone T.J. McCammon J.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 522-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 25Kosztin I. Barz B. Janosi L. J. Chem. Phys. 2006; 124: 64106-64118Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Implicit solvent models not only mitigate such solvent sampling problems but also globally increase conformational sampling. Thus, for unbinding trajectories (described below), we used the CHARMm implementation of the SASA force field (26Ferrara P. Apostolakis J. Caflisch A. Proteins: Structure Function and Genetics. 2002; 46: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), providing a surface area-based estimation of hydrophobic surface solvation, while retaining the dielectric model and reduced charge approach of EEF1 (27Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Prot. Struct. Func. Gen. 1999; 35: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Use of this force field provides better qualititative matches of the α-carbon fluctuation profiles obtained from crystal structure temperature factors than those obtained with simpler approaches (26Ferrara P. Apostolakis J. Caflisch A. Proteins: Structure Function and Genetics. 2002; 46: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Here, fluctuation profiles were seen to be very similar to those obtained from crystallographic data for aphrodisin and porcine OBP (data not shown). Design of the Restraint Potential—For unbinding studies an umbrella sampling approach was taken, in which a restraining potential Vr was added to the internal energy, defined in terms of the distance d of the thymol center of mass (CM) from that of a fixed set of atoms defining the binding site in Equation 1, Vrd=kr/2d-d02(Eq. 1) in which d0 is a chosen target distance and the force constant kr = 10 kcal Å2. The set of atoms used to determine the binding site was obtained operationally. The average position of the ligand CM was first calculated in an unrestrained 200-ps preliminary trajectory of the rat OBP-thymol complex. The binding site was then defined as the set of atoms contained within a sphere of optimal radius (12 Å) centered at this position in the protein structure obtained at the end of the preliminary trajectory. The optimal radius was chosen empirically to be large enough to minimize fluctuations of the center of mass of the included atoms while not being so large as to extend beyond the protein surface. The resulting restraint potential is thus defined in terms of an internal coordinate, eliminating the need to apply rotational and translational constraints to the protein-ligand system. Molecular Dynamics Trajectories—CHARMm was used for all molecular dynamics calculations and subsequent structural analyses. In all cases the system (protein alone or protein plus solvent) was initially energy minimized using harmonic restraints about the starting protein atom positions using a force constant starting at 250 kcal/mol-Å, which was reduced by half in a cyclic fashion after each round of minimization until it fell below 10 kcal/mol-Å and removed completely before final minimization. The system was then heated to 300 K in 25-degree steps using a different random seed for each trajectory and equilibrated for 100 ps. Unrestrained explicit solvent calculations (1-2 ns each, ∼23,000 atoms depending on the system) were run in the NPT ensemble (1 atm, 300 K) using periodic boundary conditions and an orthorhombic geometry, with a 9-Å nonbonded cutoff and shift electrostatics in the cutoff region (28Garemyr R. Elofsson A. PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Genetics. 1999; 37: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 29Beck D.A.C. Armen R.S. Daggett V. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SHAKE was used to constrain heavy atom hydrogen covalent bonds. Both 1- and 2-fs integration time steps were tested in the explicit solvent calculations with no appreciable differences in the stability of the simulations. Each explicit solvent trajectory was calculated using a distinct distribution of counterions (calculated using Solvate, Ref. 30Grubmuller H. Solvate 1.0, Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysikalische Chemie. 1996; Google Scholar) and random seed. As to the restrained MD used to explore thymol unbinding, each unbinding run consisted of a single, long trajectory (5-15 ns) using a 1-fs time-step and the method of Berendsen et al. (31Berendsen H. Postma J. DiNola A. Haak J. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23947) Google Scholar) for temperature control. The ligand site distance restraint d0 was maintained at 0 Å throughout minimization, heating, equilibration, and the first 100 ps of production, and was then increased by 0.2 Å every 100 ps. After each modification of the distance restraint, dynamics runs were restarted with the coordinates and velocities preserved from the previous step. The resulting trajectories were quasi-continuous, exhibiting no abrupt changes in system properties upon application of successive umbrella potentials. Hydrogen Bonding Calculations—Hydrogen bonding between the ligand and the protein were evaluated using a heavy atom distance cutoff of 3.2 Å, an angular cutoff of 45 degrees from linear for the D-H.A atoms and a lifetime detection threshold of 1 ps. PMF Calculation—The potential of mean force as a function of the ligand site distance was calculated using the umbrella sampling technique coupled with application of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM; Refs. 32Kumar S.

Chem. 1999; 78: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) describe related approaches including the calculation of protein-ligand affinities from molecular dynamic trajectories using implicit solvent representations. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were carried out with an MCS System (MicroCal) microcalorimeter as previously described (12Nespoulous C Briand L Delage M.-M. Tran V. Pernollet J.-C. Chem. Senses. 2004; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Protein concentration, as determined by UV spectroscopy using a extinction coefficient of 14,173 m-1 cm-1 at 276.3 nm, was 20 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 30 °C in the cell. Odorant solution in the syringe (200 μm in MeOH 0.2%) was injected in 40 successive 5-μl aliquots at 4-min intervals. Data, corrected for heat of ligand dilution, were analyzed as described previously (12Nespoulous C Briand L Delage M.-M. Tran V. Pernollet J.-C. Chem. Senses. 2004; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The rat OBP-1F system (Fig. 1) was chosen for study of the unbinding process because of the availability of thermodynamic and biochemical characterizations of this system together with a well documented homology-modeled structure (Refs. 37Loebel D. Marchese S. Krieger J. Pelosi P. Breer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Briand L. Nespoulous C. Perez V. Remy J. Huet J.-C. Pernollet J.-C. Eur. J.

Senses. 2004; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and references therein). We performed additional verifications of the homology model by comparing its dynamic properties to those of the homologous porcine OBP as determined by x-ray crystallography (3Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillaud C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For each of the rat and porcine OBP-thymol complexes, several unrestrained molecular dynamics trajectories in explicit solvent (1-2 ns each) were performed, in which the thymol remained in the calyx throughout. The α-carbon root mean square (rms) deviation of the rat OBP β-barrel with respect to the starting structure was small throughout the trajectories (0.8-1.8 Å), and very similar to those calculated for the corresponding trajectories obtained with the porcine OBP structure (0.7-1.5 Å). Further, backbone hydrogen bonding patterns obtained from the explicit solvent trajectories for both rat and porcine structures presented very similar characteristics overall (presented below), as did backbone water bridging interaction patterns (data not shown). Unbinding Pathways—Several types of molecular dynamics trajectories were performed to study the thymol unbinding process in rat OBP. In preliminary runs, a 200-ps unrestrained simulation was performed and used to define the zero position of the restraint potential as described under “Materials and Methods.” Then eight individual trajectories (up to 15 ns), each incorporating a series of incrementally increasing distance restraints, were performed to characterize the ligand unbinding path. Finally, a control run was carried out with the protein alone (10 ns). An implicit solvation approach was used for all unbinding studies in order to increase conformational sampling during the unbinding process. The lipocalin barrel remained stable throughout all the trajectories, with only one unbinding run exhibiting α-carbon rms deviations greater than 2.5 Å. In the absence of any angular restraint, the thymol was free to choose the path taken in exiting the protein in each individual trajectory. In all cases the ligand emerged toward the wider end of the barrel, except trajectory 4, in which it traveled in the opposite direction. Pairwise averages of the differences in the paths followed by the ligand center of mass showed that three trajectories were very similar (average distance, <2.2 Å), and five were within3Åof each other. These five trajectories will be referred to collectively as the consensus pathway, which we describe here in detail. The average position of the thymol center of mass in the different trajectories is shown in Fig. 1, as well as the consensus path. The variation in color from blue to red indicates the relative degree of fluctuation of the thymol center of mass at a given restraint distance in a given trajectory. Fig. 2 depicts the amino acids interacting with the thymol along this path. In the top panel, the principal hydrogen bonding partners are shown. In the lower panel, the interaction surface is shown, with the color code indicating the degree of hydrophobic contact, measured by the number of molecular dynamics steps for which the contact was made. Residues interacting the most strongly with the thymol in the binding region are shown explicitly in this figure. The side chains of Ala37 and phenylalanines 55 and 88 made extensive hydrophobic contacts with the ligand in the binding region. Asn86, a hydrogen-bonding partner farther along the unbinding pathway, also provided hydrophobic contacts in this region. Fig. 3 shows a histogram of the percentage of molecular dynamics integration steps spent in hydrogen bonds at different distances along the unbinding pathway. Little hydrogen bonding occurred at restraint distances smaller than 2 Å, corresponding to the minimum energy position (see PMF discussion below). Indeed, the thymol is almost completely buried in this region (see curve in Fig. 3), suggesting a principally hydrophobic character for the binding interaction. The most extensive hydrogen bonds were formed at larger distances along the unbinding pathway, primarily with the carbonyl oxygens from Leu35 mentioned earlier and Tyr82, as well as with the side chains of Asn86, Ser83, and Asn104 (Fig. 2). Many of the observed hydrogen bonding partners form a neck at the entrance to the internal cavity, the base of which narrows to form the actual binding pocket for the aromatic ligand. The shape of the binding pocket is also reflected in the values of the thymol solvent-accessible surface measured along the consensus unbinding pathway. As shown by the curve in Fig. 3, there was virtually no exposed thymol surface in the depths of the binding pocket. About 2 Å into the unbinding pathway, however, the accessible surface began to gradually increase up to restraint distances of about 5 Å. The value then remained constant or even decreased with increasing restraint distances until about 6 Å, before increasing again steadily until the thymol exited the protein. For the large part, the normal to the plane of the thymol aromatic ring was oriented away from the β-barrel axis throughout the unbinding pathway (supplementary Fig. S1). This effect stems from the somewhat flattened shape of the lipocalin β-barrel, which tends to align the plane of the ring parallel to the axis. No rotational orientation in the plane of the ring was seen, judging from the orientation of the thymol C-O bond throughout the unbinding runs. The absence of a marked orientational preference is consistent with the elevated B-factors seen for different ligands in crystal structures of complexes obtained with porcine OBP (3Vincent F. Spinelli S. Ramoni R. Grolli S. Pelosi P. Cambillaud C. Tegoni M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Free Energy Profiles and Affinity—The conformational sampling obtained from molecular dynamics trajectories using umbrella sampling in either implicit or explicit solvent can be used to calculate a free energy profile for a given molecular process, in this case ligand unbinding. This potential of mean force for the unbinding trajectories was calculated with the WHAM procedure, using the overlapping histograms of ligand-site distances obtained from the umbrella sampling procedure. By definition, the PMF must approach zero at a sufficiently large distance separating the ligand from the protein, but inadequate sampling prevents this limit from being attained with the present approach. The PMF calculated for the pooled trajectories of the consensus path is shown as the heavy line in Fig. 4, after being set to zero at the plateau that was reached at about 12 Å in all the consensus simulations. At this point the ligand had exited the cavity but remained in contact with the protein. Also appearing in this figure are the PMFs calculated individually for the consensus trajectories. Although the overall profiles are related, the PMF from any single trajectory clearly has much larger uncertainty because of the smaller sampling period. The minimum in the PMF was observed at d = 1.2 Å. This free energy minimum does not coincide with the starting ligand position (d = 0), as a result of the fact that the zero position was chosen in a nonphysical way, being assigned by averaging over ligand positions in a preliminary MD run (see “Materials and Methods”). As seen above, the minimum corresponds to a region of the path in which there are extensive hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 2) and very little solvent exposure of the ligand (Fig. 3). At a distance of about 4 Å the ligand appears to be partly stabilized, despite the gradually decreasing packing interactions at that distance. Increasing hydrogen bonding interactions described above may partially compensate the poorer packing around the thymol in this region. Beyond this distance no net stabilizing interactions between the OBP and the thymol ligand were seen. The results presented up to this point are independent of the absolute value of the unbound end point of the PMF. Knowledge of this value is of interest, however, because it allows one to calculate the binding affinity theoretically (e.g. Ref. 35Woo H.-J. Roux B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6825-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In the current study such a calculation cannot be made rigorously, for we cannot attribute the end point value directly, and, further, no quantitative assessment of free energies obtained with the SASA approach has yet appeared. With this caveat, however, it is of interest to note that in Fig. 4 the PMF appears to reach a plateau at ligand site distances of 12 Å and can be reasoned to be essentially zero. This implies that no net change in free energy accompani"

Certain Wnt ligands stabilize the β-catenin protein, leading to the ability of β-catenin to activate T cell factor-regulated genes. In the absence of Wnts, β-catenin is phosphorylated at defined serine and threonine residues in its amino (N) terminus. The phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by a β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP) and associated ubiquitin ligase components.

Structural studies have implicated β-catenin lysine 19 as the major target for βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination, but Lys-19 mutations in cancer have not been reported. We studied the consequences of single amino acid substitutions of the only 2 lysine residues in the N-terminal 130 amino acids of β-catenin. Mutation of Lys-19 minimally affected β-catenin levels and functional activity, and mutation of Lys-49 led to reduced β-catenin levels and function. In contrast, β-catenin proteins with substitutions at both Lys-19 and Lys-49 positions were present at elevated levels and had the ability to potently activate T cell factor-dependent transcription and promote neoplastic transformation. We furthermore demonstrate that the K19/K49 double mutant forms of β-catenin are stabilized as a result of reduced βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination. Our findings suggest that Lys-19 is a primary in vivo site of βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination and Lys-49 may be a secondary or cryptic site.

The “canonical” Wnt pathway is the best characterized Wnt-dependent signaling pathway, and mutations altering essential factors in this pathway have been most clearly implicated in cancer. In the canonical pathway, the β-catenin protein is a key downstream mediator, with certain Wnts (e.g. Wnt-1) acting to stabilize β-catenin. In the absence of activating Wnt signals, glycogen synthase kinase 3β functions in concert with the Axin and adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor proteins and other factors, such as casein kinase Iα, to phosphorylate β-catenin at defined serine and threonine residues in its N-terminal domain.

In the nucleus, β-catenin can bind to members of the T cell factor (TCF) transcription factor family, and β-catenin-TCF complexes modulate transcription of an array of genes, several of which have been shown to play roles in effecting changes in cell fate, proliferation, and other processes. Mutational mechanisms with major contributing roles to dysregulation of β-catenin in human cancer include inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli, AXIN1 or AXIN2 tumor suppressor proteins, or activating (oncogenic) mutations in a key regulatory motif in the N-terminal domain of β-catenin. This regulatory motif consists of the apparent casein kinase I α phosphorylation site at serine 45; the glycogen synthase kinase 3 β phosphorylation sites at threonine 41, serine 37, and serine 33; and the 6-residue destruction motif encompassing amino acids 32-37 of β-catenin, to which βTrCP1 shows Ser-33 and Ser-37 phosphorylation-dependent binding. In cancer cells with inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli or AXIN proteins or oncogenic β-catenin mutations, the β-catenin protein is constitutively stabilized in the absence of Wnt signals, and altered transcription of downstream β-catenin/TCF-regulated target genes ensues, including proto-oncogenes such as c-myc and cyclin D1 (reviewed in Refs. 3Bienz M.

Though much is known about factors regulating β-catenin in normal and cancer cells, gaps in our knowledge remain. For example, elegant structural studies from Wu et al. (11Wu G. Xu G. Schulman B.A. Jeffrey P.D. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1445-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) suggested that binding of the F-box protein βTrCP1, via its WD repeat domain, to amino acids 32-37 of β-catenin directs ubiquitin conjugation to lysine 19 of β-catenin by the βTrCP1-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase known as SCF (Skp1, Cullin, F-box). Yet, assuming Lys-19 is the critical lysine for SCF-βTrCP1-mediated ubiquitination of β-catenin, it is curious that mutational analyses of β-catenin in cancer have not uncovered Lys-19 mutations. Although the studies of Wu et al. indicated β-catenin Lys-19 was the probable site for SCF-βTrCP1-mediated ubiquitination, the authors did not define in vivo sites of ubiquitination on the full-length β-catenin protein. The authors did, however, note that in β-catenin and other proteins with a destruction motif the location of the ubiquitinated lysine relative to the destruction motif was likely a critical factor for optimal efficiency of SCF-βTrCP1-mediated ubiquitination. The optimal distance was judged to be 9-14 amino acids N-terminal to the destruction motif. While Lys-19 is 13 residues N-terminal to the destruction motif, β-catenin also has another lysine, Lys-49, located roughly a similar distance carboxyl (C)-terminal to the destruction motif. Of interest, one prior study of mutant β-catenin proteins carrying missense substitutions of Lys-19 and/or Lys-49 had suggested mutation of Lys-19 or Lys-49 on their own had little effect on β-catenin ubiquitination and both Lys-19 and Lys-49 needed to be mutated to reduce β-catenin ubiquitination even minimally (18Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). These results were not investigated further. In light of uncertainties surrounding the significance of Lys-19 and Lys-49 in regulation of β-catenin stability and function, we have pursued studies to address the biological activity of β-catenin proteins carrying missense substitutions of Lys-19 and Lys-49. We show here that single amino acid substitutions of either Lys-19 or Lys-49 minimally affect the biological activity of β-catenin and in the case of K49R even reduce expression levels. In contrast, β-catenin proteins with substitutions at both Lys-19 and Lys-49 have the ability to activate TCF transcription and promote neoplastic transformation in a fashion akin to that of a cancer-derived mutant form of β-catenin in which serine 33 is mutated to tyrosine (i.e. S33Y). Plasmids—The β-catenin cDNAs utilized in these studies were subcloned into the pBMN-Z retroviral vector. The wild type and S33Y (S33Y) mutant β-catenin constructs have been previously described (19Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell.

Cells were plated in 35-mm dishes 12 h prior to transfection, and 0.85 μg of plasmid DNA encoding a mutant or WT form of β-catenin were transfected along with 0.75 μg of either the pTOPFLASH or pFOPFLASH reporter construct and 0.4 μg of Lacz/PCDNA-3 in duplicate. 48 h post-transfection cells were washed once with 1× PBS and suspended in reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer after adding luciferase assay reagent (Promega) to the cell lysates. β-galactosidase activities were determined according to standard methods and were used to control for transfection efficiency. Transfection of Cells and Analysis of the Ubiquitination or Phosphorylation Levels—HEK293 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes 12 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6. 48 h post-transfection, cells from all of the plates were harvested into 1 ml of cold 1× PBS and lysed using a 1% Triton-based lysis buffer with addition of 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 200 mm sodium fluoride. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (19Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein expression levels for WT, S33Y, and other mutant forms of β-catenin were detected with a monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Stratagene). Expression of β-actin was used to control for the loading of the lanes and was detected utilizing an anti-β-actin polyclonal antibody (Sigma). Fractionation of cells into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was performed using the “NE-PER” extraction reagent (Pierce). Total cellular extracts were produced as described previously (19Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies used for confirmation of cell fractions were a rabbit polyclonal against the nuclear protein TIP-49 (23Feng Y. Lee N. Fearon E.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8726-8734PubMed Google Scholar) and a monoclonal against β-galactosidase (Promega), which was expressed from the cotransfected plasmid pCDNA3 LacZ to demonstrate equal transfection efficiency. For the ubiquitination studies, cells were transfected according to the above protocol with β-catenin constructs and a HA epitope-tagged ubiquitin. 60 h post-transfection, MG-132 (AG-Scientific) at a final concentration of 40 μm was added to the cells with fresh medium for 6 h. The cells were harvested in the Triton-based lysis buffer described above. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal M2-FLAG-linked agarose beads (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoprecipitated lysates were run on a low percentage SDS-PAGE gel and blotted utilizing an anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and M2-anti-FLAG antibody as a loading control. For the phosphorylation studies, HEK293 cells were transfected with β-catenin constructs and lysed/immunoprecipitated as above. Following SDS-PAGE, β-catenin phosphorylation was assessed using an anti-phospho-β-catenin-33/37/41 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). The M2-anti-FLAG was used to measure total ectopic β-catenin levels. Western blots were quantified using the ImageJ analysis software (NIH). C-terminal E-cadherin/Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion-mediated Precipitation of the Free β-Catenin Pool—To determine the free pool of β-catenin in transfected cells, a C-terminal E-cadherin/glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was used. In brief, the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of human E-cadherin was amplified using the following primers: Sense, 5′-CGGGATCCAGAGCGGTGGTCAAAGAGCC-3′, and Antisense, 5′-CGGAATTCGCCTCTCTCGAGTCCCCTA-3′ from a full-length E-cadherin cDNA plasmid. The resulting product was gel purified and subcloned into pCR TOPO4 (Invitrogen) for sequencing. The verified product was subcloned into the PGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) vector using the BamHI and EcoRI sites. Bl-21 Escherichia coli were transformed with the completed construct and induced using 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the sonicates were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cell debris was pelleted, and the supernatant removed for analysis. The GST-E-cadherin fusion product was purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to protocol. The product was dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C. In accordance with the desired precipitation reaction, purified protein (13 μg) was rotated with 40 μlof50% slurry for 40 min at room temperature. The beads were pelleted (1000 × g, 5 min), washed with 1× PBS, and resuspended in 20 μl of 1× PBS. Experimental lysates (300-500 μg of protein) were precleared by rotation with unbound glutathione beads for 45 min at 4 °C, after which the beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min) and the supernatant was transferred to a tube containing 20 μl of the E-cad/GST beads and rotated for 1 h at 4°C. The beads were washed two times with lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and resuspended in 40 μl of 5× Laemelli's protein loading buffer. Half of the recovered protein lysate was used in Western blot analysis with the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Stratagene). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Five μg of total RNA were separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad) by capillary action. To prevent cross hybridization with endogenous β-catenin, a probe was used that detects sequences from the vector pBMN located immediately downstream of the open reading frame for β-catenin. It was obtained by PCR using pBMN-WT-β-catenin as template and the primers pBMN2 sense AGTAACGCCATTTTGCAAGG and pBMN2 reverse CGACTCAGTCAATCGGAGGA. Radioactive labeling was performed by random priming with [32P]dCTP. Hybridization and washing steps were performed by standard methods. Signals were detected by exposure to Bio-Express Blue Basic Autoradiography Film (ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT) at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. β-catenin proteins show greatest conservation in their central roughly 560-amino acid region, which consists of the 12 armadillo repeats that mediate β-catenin binding to adenomatous polyposis coli, AXIN, and TCFs. The N-terminal region of β-catenin also has some highly conserved motifs in vertebrate homologues and the Drosophila β-catenin homologue armadillo. In addition to conservation of the serine and threonine residues that are phosphorylated by casein kinase I α and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β and the βTrCP1-binding/destruction motif at amino acids 32-37, the lysines corresponding to Lys-19 and Lys-49 in the human sequence are conserved (Fig. 1A). In fact, though most vertebrate β-catenin homologues have 26 lysine residues, only two lysines are located in the first 130 amino acids, with the remainder in the central armadillo repeat region. To address the role of the Lys-19 and Lys-49 residues in β-catenin function, we generated β-catenin alleles containing missense mutations at these positions. Both charge-conservative (e.g. substitution of arginine (R), K19R, also termed 19R) and charge-non-conservative (e.g. substitution of glutamic acid (E), K19E also termed 19E) mutant alleles were generated, together with selected double mutation alleles (e.g. K19R/K49R; also termed RR; Fig. 1B). In prior published work, we have shown that use of the RK3E cell line for focus formation assays is a robust strategy for assessing the biological activity of wild type and mutant β-catenin alleles (18Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 19Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kolligs F.T. Kolligs B. Hajra K.M. Hu G. Tani M. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1319-1331PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, RK3E is an adenovirus E1A-immortalized rat kidney epithelial line that grows in a contact-inhibited and anchorage- and serum-dependent fashion. β-catenin proteins that are stabilized by mutations affecting the conserved N-terminal domain serine/threonine residues or the destruction motif will readily induce large numbers of morphologically transformed neoplastic foci in a TCF-dependent fashion. Wild type β-catenin does not induce transformed foci in RK3E. Consistent with our prior published results, we found the cancer-derived S33Y mutant β-catenin protein induced large numbers of transformed foci and wild type β-catenin or the empty expression vector did not generate foci (Fig. 2). Single mutations at codon 19 (19R and 19E) very minimally activated β-catenin-transforming activity relative to the S33Y mutant, and single mutations at Lys-49 (49R and 49E) did not activate the transforming activity of β-catenin. In contrast to the effect of the single mutations at Lys-19 and Lys-49, β-catenin alleles carrying mutations at both Lys-19 and Lys-49 had potent ability to neoplastically transform RK3E. Alleles carrying charge-conservative substitutions at Lys-19 (i.e. RR and RE alleles) showed greater activity than a double mutant allele carrying charge-non-conservative substitutions at both Lys-19 and Lys-49 (Fig. 2, EE). Consistent with the ability of the double mutant β-catenin alleles to promote neoplastic transformation in RK3E cells, we found the RR mutant allele strongly activated the TCF-dependent TOP-FLASH model reporter gene construct in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3). Whereas the 19R allele had roughly twice the activity of wild type β-catenin in the TCF reporter gene assays and the 49R allele was no more active than wild type β-catenin, the RR allele had roughly 5-fold the activity of wild type β-catenin and roughly half the activity of the S33Y mutant allele (Fig. 3). The RK3E transformation and TCF reporter gene assay results, taken together with our prior published results (19Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), imply that a threshold level of β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity is needed for neoplastic transformation in RK3E cells. But, beyond that level, only minimal enhancement of neoplastic transformation in RK3E is seen. To address the basis for the potent transforming and TCF activation properties of the double mutant RR β-catenin proteins and the lack of such activities in the single mutant proteins, we sought to assess the abundance of the free pool of β-catenin in cells expressing these proteins. Previous studies have shown that a recombinant GST fusion protein in which GST sequences are fused in-frame to the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin can readily be used to monitor the abundance of the free pool of β-catenin, i.e. the pool of β-catenin that is stabilized in response to activating Wnt signals (24Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 25Muller T. Choidas A. Reichmann E. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25562-25567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, following ectopic expression of the S33Y mutant form of β-catenin in HEK293 cells or LiCl treatment of HEK293 cells to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3 β-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of endogenous β-catenin, very substantial increases in the levels of the free pool of β-catenin were seen, as demonstrated by recovery of β-catenin with the GST-E-cadherin protein in these settings. In contrast, in HEK293 cells transfected with wild type β-catenin or in cells treated with NaCl, little if any β-catenin was recovered from the cell lysates following incubation with the GST-E-cadherin protein (Fig. 4B). Using the GST-E-cadherin recombinant protein, we found that abundance of the RR double mutant β-catenin protein in the free pool was nearly on par with that of the S33Y mutant. The 19R single mutant protein showed reduced free pool levels relative to the RR and S33Y mutants but clearly increased abundance compared with the 49R or wild type β-catenin proteins. To confirm that increases in the free pool of β-catenin were associated with increased cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of β-catenin, we analyzed the relative abundance of wild type and mutant forms of β-catenin in whole cell extracts and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. As shown in Fig. 5, the whole cell, cytoplasmic, and nuclear levels of the RR double mutant were nearly equivalent to those seen for the S33Y mutant. The 19R mutant showed increased levels relative to wild type β-catenin. Despite the fact that the 49R mutant was essentially as active as the wild type β-catenin protein in the TCF reporter gene assay (Fig. 3), the abundance of the 49R mutant in whole cell extracts and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was reduced compared with those for wild type β-catenin (Fig. 5A). To exclude that the observed differences in protein levels after transfection of different β-catenin expression constructs were caused by variations in mRNA levels, we performed a Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5B, all constructs led to equivalent mRNA levels. We next sought to clarify how mutations at Lys-19 and/or Lys-49 affected the biological activity and levels of β-catenin. We pursued studies with an antibody that reacts with β-catenin when it is phosphorylated at serines 33 and 37 and threonine 41 (i.e. anti-phospho 33/37/41 β-catenin). Because phosphorylation at these residues targets wild type β-catenin for ubiquitination and degradation, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to inhibit protein degradation. Following ectopic expression of the FLAG epitope-tagged β-catenin constructs in HEK293 cells and MG-132 treatment of the transfected cells, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody or the anti-phospho-33/37/41 antibody. As expected, the S33Y mutant protein showed negligible reactivity with the anti-phospho-33/37/41 antibody (Fig. 6). Although a minimal increase in the relative abundance of phospho-33/37/41 β-catenin forms was seen in cells transfected with the 49R and RR mutant proteins (Fig. 6 and data not shown), there was no evidence that mutations at Lys-19 and/or Lys-49 had marked effects on the ability of the mutant proteins to be phosphorylated at serines 33 and 37 and threonine 41 (Fig. 6). Because reduced phosphorylation of the regulatory regions of the 19R and RR mutant forms of β-catenin did not appear to play a contributing role in their increased expression levels, we pursued studies to assess the ubiquitination of the mutant proteins. Following co-expression of the FLAG epitope-tagged β-catenin constructs in HEK293 cells together with an expression construct encoding an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged ubiquitin polypeptide, the transfected cells were treated with MG-132. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. After normalizing for the abundance of the ectopically expressed proteins via immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG antibody, substantial differences were seen in the amount of HA-tagged ubiquitin that was linked to β-catenin when comparing wild type and certain mutant β-catenin proteins. The S33Y mutant protein showed minimal evidence of ubiquitinated species, either low molecular weight (LMW) or high molecular weight (HMW) forms (Fig. 7A). The RR double mutant showed considerably reduced LMW and HMW ubiquitin adducts compared with wild type β-catenin, albeit not as great a reduction as was seen for the S33Y mutant (Fig. 7A). The 19R mutant showed intermediate levels of ubiquitination compared with the wild type and RR mutant forms. Consistent with its reduced levels in the whole cell and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts relative to the wild type protein, the 49R mutant was ubiquitinated to the degree of or even above the levels seen for the wild type β-catenin protein (Fig. 7A). To implicate βTrCP1 in the ubiquitination of the wild type and mutant β-catenin proteins, we ectopically expressed an F-box-deleted βTrCP1 protein that functions as a dominant negative (dnβTrCP1) together with the FLAG epitope-tagged β-catenin constructs and the HA-tagged ubiquitin construct. The dnβTrCP1 protein potently inhibited the ubiquitination of wild type β-catenin and all mutant forms, essentially rendering the relative levels of ubiquitination of all proteins equivalent. These data indicate that the predominant factor(s) likely to be responsible for the ubiquitination of β-catenin proteins under the conditions studied was either βTrCP1 or βTrCP2. A good deal is known about factors and mechanisms regulating levels and localization of β-catenin in normal and cancer cells. For instance, there is strong evidence that β-catenin levels are tightly regulated as a result of ubiquitin conjugation to β-catenin by the SCF-βTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex. The ability of this complex to regulate β-catenin appears to depend on direct binding of βTrCP1/2 to the 6-residue destruction motif encompassing amino acids 32-37 of β-catenin and to which βTrCP1/2 shows Ser-33 and Ser-37 phosphorylation-dependent binding. Notwithstanding the progress to date, certain aspects of β-catenin regulation remain to be fully clarified. For example, while structural studies had previously implicated Lys-19 as the critical lysine for SCF-βTrCP-mediated ubiquitination of β-catenin, convincing evidence that Lys-19 is ubiquitinated in vivo has not previously been offered. Moreover, if Lys-19 were the unique site for βTrCP-mediated ubiquitination, it is perhaps surprising that mutational analyses of β-catenin in cancer had not uncovered Lys-19 mutations as a means of constitutively stabilizing β-catenin. In addition, prior studies by Aberle et al. (18Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar) had generated data suggesting that neither Lys-19 nor Lys-49 mutations on their own much affected β-catenin ubiquitination and K19/49 double mutations reduced, but did not abrogate, ubiquitination. In our studies, we found β-catenin proteins with single missense substitutions at the Lys-19 or Lys-49 positions were minimally (Lys-19) or not at all (Lys-49) stabilized relative to wild type β-catenin. However, the K19/K49 double mutant β-catenin was present at elevated levels and had the ability to potently activate TCF transcription and promote neoplastic transformation. The K19/K49 double mutant β-catenin was stabilized as a result of reduced βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination. Interestingly, the transforming potential of β-catenin mutants was not directly proportional to the transcriptional activation potential observed. In fact, as previously suggested (19Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transformation of RK3E cells seems to require the bypass of a certain threshold of activity. It is tempting to speculate that the modest subthreshold increase in transcriptional activity by the K19R mutation of β-catenin is not sufficient to confer a sufficient selective advantage in vivo that would allow selection of a secondary mutation at Lys-49, thereby producing a double mutant. Comparison of the relative levels and functional activity of wild type β-catenin to that of each mutant β-catenin protein studied here, along with the data on the relative levels of ubiquitination, offers new insights into the likely in vivo site(s) of βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination for β-catenin. Specifically, although single missense mutations at Lys-19 of β-catenin had negligible ability to activate the transforming potential of β-catenin, the 19R mutant protein had clearly detectable increases in its free levels and TCF transcriptional activation potential relative to wild type β-catenin. Additionally, a clear-cut reduction in ubiquitination of the 19R mutant protein was seen. In contrast to the findings for the 19R mutant, no stabilization or enhanced function of the 49R mutant protein was seen and no evidence for reduced ubiquitination was seen for the 49R mutant. These findings suggest the principal site of βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination on wild type β-catenin is likely to be Lys-19 and not Lys-49. However, when the Lys-19 site is mutated, βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination may be directed to secondary sites, perhaps most efficiently at lysine residues within a certain physical distance from the 32-37-amino acid βTrCP binding motif, such as Lys-49. Nevertheless, because the K19R/K49R double mutant β-catenin protein showed residual βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination, whereas the S33Y mutant protein, which fails to bind to βTrCp1/2, shows essentially no ubiquitination by βTrCP, it seems that βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination of other lysines may be somewhat promiscuous following binding of βTrCP1 to the 32-37-amino acid destruction motif, resulting in low levels of ubiquitination at one or more of the 24 lysine residues located outside of the N-terminal 130 amino acids of β-catenin. Besides clarifying the likely in vivo site(s) of βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination for β-catenin, a few other points of interest have emerged from our studies. Although the Lys-49 residue does not appear to be a principal site for βTrCP-dependent ubiquitination, the fact that the 49R mutant β-catenin protein showed considerably reduced levels in the “free pool” of β-catenin in the nucleus and cytoplasm relative to wild type β-catenin suggests the Lys-49 residue may play some role in regulating the levels, localization, and/or functional activity of β-catenin. Perhaps this reflects the potential for other post-translational modifications of Lys-49, such as acetylation (26Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) or even conceivably methylation or sumoylation. The possibility that post-translational modifications other than polyubiquitination at Lys-49 might be required for optimal functional activity of β-catenin is not inconsistent with our findings showing that the RR double mutant protein is essentially stabilized to the degree of the S33Y mutant protein but is not as active in RK3E transformation or TCF transcriptional activation. Another issue clarified by our findings showing that both Lys-19 and Lys-49 have to be mutated to demonstrably active transforming activity of β-catenin is why single missense mutations at Lys-19 have not been reported in human cancer. Because an array of single nucleotide substitutions can lead to missense substitutions with dramatic effects on β-catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase Iα or glycogen synthase kinase 3β and/or binding by βTrCP1/2, it is not unexpected that double mutations affecting both Lys-19 and Lys-49 would very rarely, if ever, be seen in human cancer. Further studies of the regulation of β-catenin by post-translational modification at Lys-19 and Lys-49 will undoubtedly shed even greater light on factors and mechanisms regulating β-catenin in normal and cancer cells.

https://openalex.org/W2110505909,"The capsid of hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles is considered to be composed of the mature form (p21) of core protein.

Remarkably, although maturation to p21 was only partially inhibited by mutations in insect cells, p23 was the only form of core protein found in HCV-like particles. Finally, newly developed assays demonstrated that p23 capsids are more stable than p21 capsids. These results show that SPP-catalyzed cleavage of core protein is dispensable for HCV budding but decreases the stability of the viral capsid.

Golde T.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R201-R206Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). SPP is highly conserved in higher eucaryotes from plants to humans, including insects (2Weihofen A.

This membrane protein with nine proposed transmembrane domains exerts its action in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it resides by virtue of a classical ER retrieval signal (3Casso D.J. Tanda S.

The SPP substrates identified so far have in common a type II (N terminus facing the cytosol and C terminus facing the lumen) orientation but do not unequivocally point to a common role for SPP activity. In humans, SPP carries out the intramembrane cleavage of signal peptides of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I molecules after they have been cleaved off by signal peptidase; the short N-terminal signal peptide remnants then serve as epitopes presented at the cell surface by nonpolymorphic human lymphocyte antigen-E molecules for immune surveillance (6Lemberg M.K. Bland F.A. Weihofen A. Braud V.M. Martoglio B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6441-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, SPP activity may promote the liberation from the ER lipid bilayer of some bioactive signal peptide fragments. Another role of SPP activity may be to protect cells from the toxicity of some signal peptides, e.g. the signal peptide of eosinophil cationic protein (7Wu C.-M. Chang M.D.-T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 585-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, the substrate spectrum of SPP may not be restricted to signal peptides but extend to transmembrane domains of polytopic proteins (8Moliaka Y.K. Grigorenko A. Madera D. Rogaev E.I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The recent finding that a misassembled transmembrane domain of a polytopic protein interacted with SPP has suggested a role for SPP in the ER quality control of membrane proteins (9Crawshaw S.G.

Beside cellular substrates, an internal signal sequence of the polyprotein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was shown to interact with and be cleaved by SPP (10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 11Okamoto K. Moriishi K. Miyamura T. Matsuura Y. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6370-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This makes SPP a potential target for therapeutic intervention, but a clear understanding of the role of SPP in the HCV life cycle is needed before this approach can be envisaged. HCV was discovered by molecular cloning, but its life cycle has remained speculative due to difficulties encountered in reproducing infection in tissue culture cells (12Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th. 1. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 991-1041Google Scholar). Entry of this enveloped virus into target cells most likely involves virion internalization by endocytosis followed by envelope-mediated fusion upon endosomal acidification (13Tscherne D.M. Jones C.T. Evans M.J. Lindenbach B.D. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The viral capsid must then be disassembled to begin translation of the positive strand RNA genome, but no data are available regarding the uncoating process. Flanked by 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions, the single long open reading frame of the HCV genome encodes a polyprotein of about 3,000 amino acids. During and after translation, this polyprotein undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages by host and viral proteases, which generate the structural and nonstructural proteins, respectively. The nonstructural proteins are sufficient for replication of the viral genome but are not believed to be contained in virus particles, whereas the structural components (including core protein and two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2) assemble with the viral genome to form progeny virions. That HCV morphogenesis most certainly proceeds through budding of nascent particles into the ER lumen is supported by several arguments as follows: (i) the analogy with other viruses of the Flaviviridae family (12Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 4th. 1. Lippincott/Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 991-1041Google Scholar, 14Mackenzie J.M. Westaway E.G. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10787-10799Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar); (ii) the rare available EM images of liver tissue from HCV-infected patients or chimpanzees showing putative particles in ER-related cisternae of hepatocytes (15Shimizu Y.K. Feinstone S.M. Kohara M. Purcell R.H. Yoshikura H. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 205-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bosman C. Valli M.B. Bertolini L. Serafino A. Boldrini R. Marcellini M. Carloni G. Res. Virol. 1998; 149: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); (iii) the orientation of HCV core and envelope proteins with respect to the ER membrane; and (iv) the accumulation of E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins in the ER due to ER retention signals (17Op De Beeck A. Dubuisson J. Rev. Med. Virol. 2003; 13: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HCV core protein is the most N-terminal component of the viral polyprotein and terminates with a signal peptide (Fig. 1A) (18McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). This signal peptide directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the ER membrane and induces translocation of the downstream E1 region into the ER lumen, while leaving the core protein region on the cytosolic side. Cleavage by signal peptidase at the luminal side of the ER separates E1 from the so-called immature form of core protein, containing 191 residues, which migrates in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa (p23). This complete form of HCV core protein is anchored in the ER lipid bilayer by the C-terminal signal peptide (10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Intramembrane cleavage catalyzed by SPP generates the so-called mature form of core protein, which migrates in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa (p21). The precise position of the SPP cleavage site has been debated (10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Hüssy P.

Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a direct mass spectral analysis of HCV core protein processed in insect cells has recently suggested that p21 ends with residue 177 (22Ogino T. Fukuda H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kohara M. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11766-11777Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because cleavage by SPP removes the C-terminal anchor of core protein, it loosens its attachment to the ER membrane and allows it to travel to other organelles within the cell. Indeed, a characteristic feature of the intracellular distribution of HCV core protein is its association with the surface of lipid droplets (10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 23Moradpour D. Englert C. Wakita T. Wands J.R.

This was demonstrated not only in a variety of tissue culture cells, but also in liver biopsies from HCV-infected patients and chimpanzees. A fraction of HCV core protein was also shown to localize to the outer membrane of mitochondria in several cell lines (28Okuda M. Li K. Beard M.R. Showalter L.A. Scholle F. Lemon S.M. Weinman S.A. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 366-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 29Schwer B. Ren S. Pietschmann T. Kartenbeck J. Kaehlcke K. Bartenschlager R. Yen T.S.B. Ott M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7958-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). When SPP-catalyzed cleavage to generate p21 was inhibited, however, none of these subcellular locations was reached, and the unprocessed p23 was retained in the ER membrane (10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 29Schwer B. Ren S. Pietschmann T. Kartenbeck J. Kaehlcke K. Bartenschlager R. Yen T.S.B. Ott M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7958-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because core protein in sera from HCV-infected patients has an identical molecular mass to p21, this form is considered to constitute the HCV virion capsid (18McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 21Yasui K. Wakita T. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Funahashi S.-I. Ichikawa M. Kajita T. Moradpour D. Wands J.R. Kohara M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It might be inferred from this observation that cleavage of core protein by SPP is a prerequisite for HCV particle morphogenesis. As a capsid protein is expected to reside at the virus budding site, however, the propensity of the processed p21 to move to other sites seems paradoxical and may be related to at least some of the many other reported functions of the HCV core protein (18McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). By contrast, p23 is not free for trafficking from the ER to other organelles within the cell (10McLauchlan J. Lemberg M.K. Hope G. Martoglio B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 29Schwer B. Ren S. Pietschmann T. Kartenbeck J. Kaehlcke K. Bartenschlager R. Yen T.S.B. Ott M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7958-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and may therefore be prone to virus particle budding. This would imply that HCV morphogenesis can occur when SPP-catalyzed cleavage to generate the p21 form of HCV core protein is abolished. The aim of this study was to decide between these two opposite hypotheses regarding the role of SPP in the HCV life cycle. Two independent approaches, one pharmacological and the other genetic, were used to inhibit SPP-catalyzed cleavage of core protein in two complementary experimental systems that allow the study of HCV morphogenesis in a cellular context. The first uses a recombinant Semliki forest virus (SFV) replicon to express HCV structural proteins in mammalian BHK-21 cells (30Blanchard E. Brand D. Trassard S. Goudeau A. Roingeard P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4073-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Blanchard E. Hourioux C. Brand D. Ait-Goughoulte M. Moreau A. Trassard S. Sizaret P.-Y. Dubois F. Roingeard P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10131-10138Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because HCV budding is abortive in this system, it does not allow the isolation of virus-like particles but instead appears as a choice model for EM visualization of budding events in situ in the ER. In the second system, expression of HCV structural proteins is achieved in insect Sf9 cells by means of a recombinant baculovirus vector, which leads to the recovery of enveloped virus-like particles (32Baumert T.F. Ito S. Wong D.T. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3827-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Baumert T.F. Vergalla J. Satoi J. Thomson M. Lechmann M. Herion D. Greenberg H.B. Ito S. Liang T.J.

Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 3659-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These have been shown to resemble putative virions isolated from HCV-infected patients on the basis of biophysical, morphological, and antigenic properties. The results of our study not only show that SPP activity is dispensable for HCV particle budding but further point to a role for SPP in destabilizing the viral capsid. These findings are consistent with a model in which p23 is the form of HCV core protein that is committed to virus particle morphogenesis, and cleavage by SPP occurs during and/or after virus budding in the ER to predispose the capsid to subsequent disassembly during virus uncoating in a new target cell. Plasmid Constructs—The pFastBac-HCV1a construct was generated by inserting into the multiple cloning site of the vector pFastBac™1 (Invitrogen) the BamHI-BglII fragment of the pGmAc-5′NTRm-NS2Δ plasmid (35Girard C. Ravallec M. Mariller M. Bossy J.-P. Cahour A. López-Ferber M. Devauchelle G. Inchauspé G. Duonor-Cérutti M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 3659-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), a generous gift from M. Duonor-Cérutti and G. Devauchelle (CNRS UMR 5160, Saint-Christol-lès-Alès, France). This fragment contains the portion of the cDNA of the HCV-H strain (genotype 1a) coding for all HCV structural proteins and the first 5 amino acids of NS2 protein, downstream of the complete 5′-noncoding region modified by the mutation of its five AUG codons (35Girard C. Ravallec M. Mariller M. Bossy J.-P. Cahour A. López-Ferber M. Devauchelle G. Inchauspé G. Duonor-Cérutti M. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 3659-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For expression in BHK-21 cells, this fragment was also inserted into the unique BamHI site of the vector pSFV1 (36Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), yielding the pSFV-HCV1a construct. The plasmid pFastBac-HCV1b (originally designated as pFastBacHCV.S in Ref. 32Baumert T.F. Ito S. Wong D.T. Liang T.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3827-3836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the portion of the cDNA of the HCV-J strain (genotype 1b) coding for all HCV structural proteins and the first 21 amino acids of NS2 protein downstream of the 71 last nucleotides of the 5′-noncoding region, was a kind gift from T. J. Liang (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). For expression in BHK-21 cells, the 2432-bp NruI-NdeI fragment of this plasmid was subcloned into the pSFV1 vector modified by the insertion of restriction sites for NruI and NdeI immediately downstream of the BamHI site, yielding the pSFV-HCV1b construct. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis by the Kunkel method (37Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) was used to introduce mutations into the sequence encoding the signal peptide at the core-E1 junction. To do this, the 2534-bp HindIII-BglII fragment of pGmAc-5′NTRm-NS2Δ and the 1702-bp EcoRI-NotI fragment of pFastBac-HCV1b, which contained the sequences to be mutated, were subcloned into the vectors pGEM-3Zf(+) and pGEM-11Zf(+) (Promega), respectively. Mutagenesis was designed both to introduce an SpeI restriction site and to replace residues Ala180, Ser183, and Cys184 of HCV polyprotein by Val, Leu, and Val, respectively (Fig. 1A). The mutated fragments were then inserted in place of the homologous wild-type (WT) fragments into the pFastBac-HCV1a and pFastBac-HCV1b plasmids. For expression in mammalian cells, they were also inserted in place of the homologous WT fragments into the pSFV-HCV1a and pSFV-HCV1b plasmids. The presence of the desired mutations was checked both by restriction map analysis and DNA sequencing. Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection—BHK-21 cells were grown in Glasgow minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma), and 5% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection, the WT and mutated forms of pSFV-HCV1a or pSFV-HCV1b plasmids were linearized at the SpeI and SphI site, respectively, and served as templates for in vitro transcription by the Sp6 RNA polymerase. Typical reactions were performed for 2 h at 37 °C in a mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 1 mm of the cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (Invitrogen), 1.6 units/μl recombinant RNasin® ribonuclease inhibitor (Promega), and 0.6 units/μl Sp6 RNA polymerase (Promega). For the negative control, recombinant RNA coding for β-galactosidase (SFV-lacZ) was synthesized from the SpeI-linearized pSFV3-lacZ plasmid (36Liljeström P. Garoff H. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). BHK-21 cells in mid-log phase were detached with trypsin, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), mixed with the capped transcripts in an electroporation cuvette (0.4-cm gap), and pulsed twice at 0.83 kV, 25 microfarads, in a Gene Pulser® II electroporator (Bio-Rad). Immediately after electroporation, cells were plated and cultured for 20 h in growth medium, containing 20 μm (Z-LL)2-ketone (Calbiochem) where indicated. Insect Cell Culture and Recombinant Baculovirus Generation—Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells were grown in monolayer cultures at 28 °C in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories). The WT and mutated forms of pFastBac-HCV1a and pFastBac-HCV1b were used to generate recombinant baculoviruses by using the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. For the negative control, the plasmid pFastBac™1-Gus (Invitrogen), which contains the cDNA coding for β-glucuronidase, was used to generate the recombinant baculovirus BV-gus. Recombinant baculoviruses harvested from the supernatant of transfected Sf9 cells were amplified by subsequent rounds of Sf9 cell infection until a high titer was achieved. For all expression experiments, Sf9 cells in mid-log phase were infected with the appropriate recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 5 and cultured for 3–4 days. Where indicated, (Z-LL)2-ketone was added every 12 h to the growth medium at a final concentration of 20 μm. Isolation of HCV-like Particles and Capsids—Recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were washed three times in PBS and collected by centrifugation. Cells were ruptured by three freeze-thaw cycles, using dry ice plus ethanol for freezing and a 37 °C water bath for thawing, and suspended in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 0.2 mg/ml of the protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (ICN Biomedicals) plus RNasin® (complete TNE buffer). Homogenization further proceeded with 10 passages through a 23-gauge needle. After low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was pelleted over a 2-ml cushion of 20% (w/w) sucrose in complete TNE, at 77,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The pellet was allowed to dissolve in complete TNE buffer for 2 h at 4°C, before loading on a sucrose gradient made in complete TNE. To partially purify enveloped HCV-like particles, this consisted of an 8-ml continuous 30–65% (w/w) sucrose gradient overlaid with a 1.5-ml layer of 15% (w/w) sucrose, itself covered with a 0.5-ml layer of 10% (w/w) sucrose. Isopycnic ultracentrifugation was performed at 150,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C, followed by fractionation from the bottom of the tube into 18 fractions of 0.6 ml. The density of each fraction was determined by measuring the refractive index of a 10-μl aliquot with an Abbe refractometer (Atago) at a constant temperature of 20 °C. To isolate capsids of HCV-like particles, a protocol was adapted from the “spin-thru” method described for the purification of mature human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) capsids (38Kewalramani V.N. Emerman M. Virology. 1996; 218: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, isopycnic ultracentrifugation was performed as described above except that the 15% sucrose layer contained 60 mm octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (nOG) (Sigma). In this method, the 10% sucrose layer serves as a barrier to minimize mixing of the virus and detergent interfaces prior to centrifugation, and the enveloped particles pass through the detergent interface at the quickest possible speed, thus minimizing the time that particles are incubated in detergent. Western Blotting—For analysis of HCV structural protein expression, recombinant SFV RNA-transfected BHK-21 cells or recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were lysed in reducing sample buffer. Cell lysates or fractions collected from sucrose gradients were electrophoresed in SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (PROTRAN®, Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skimmed milk and probed overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies against HCV core protein (1856, Virostat), E1 glycoprotein (A4 (39Dubuisson J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 7672-7682Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), kindly provided by A. H. Patel, MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Glasgow, UK), diluted 1:10,000, 1:750, and 1:500 in blocking buffer, respectively. Excess antibody was removed with four washes, and the second-step antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked mouse-specific sheep antibody; Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2,000 in blocking buffer was allowed to bind for 1 h. After several washes, protein bands were visualized using membrane incubation in SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce) and exposure to BioMax Light films (Eastman Kodak). Blots used for multiple hybridizations were stripped of antibodies by washing for 30 min at 55 °C in stripping buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and reprobed as described above. Capsid Stability Assays—Freshly prepared capsids were tested for stability under different conditions. After isopycnic ultracentrifugation using the spin-thru method described above, the fractions with densities ranging from 1.23 to 1.26 g/ml were pooled and diluted 1:10 in TNE buffer, in high salt TNE buffer (TNE containing 1 m instead of 100 mm NaCl), or in low pH TNE buffer (TNE adjusted to pH 5.5). Following incubation at 37 °C for various times, samples were split in half. The total proteins contained in one-half were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 15% in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; the precipitate was spun down at 13,000 × g in a microcentrifuge, washed with acetone to remove the trichloroacetic acid, and resuspended in reducing sample buffer for Western blotting detection of total HCV core protein. The other half was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 77,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in reducing sample buffer for Western blotting detection of pelletable HCV core protein. The NIH ImageJ version 1.33 software was used for quantitative evaluation of the relative intensities of the bands. For each incubation time, the capsid stability index was calculated as follows: 100 × (intensity of the band of pelletable core protein at the given time/intensity of the band of pelletable core protein at time 0)/(intensity of the band of total core protein at the given time/intensity of the band of total core protein at time 0). EM Analyses—For in situ visualization of HCV-like particle budding, recombinant SFV RNA-transfected BHK-21 cells were fixed for 1 h with 3% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.1 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2), and post-fixed for 2 h with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. Fixed cells were washed in water for 5 min, then in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer for 15 min, and finally in 0.2 m cacodylate buffer for 30 min. They were transferred to 30% m"

The receptor protein tyrosine kinase Tie2 and its ligands, the angiopoietins, have important functions in the regulation of angiogenesis. Here, we report a detailed structural and functional characterization of the extracellular region of Tie2. Sequence analysis of the extracellular domain revealed an additional immunoglobulin-like domain resulting in a tandem repeat of immunoglobulin-like domains at the N terminus of the protein. The same domain organization was also found for the Tie1 receptor that shares a high degree of homology with Tie2. Based on structural similarities to other receptor tyrosine kinases and cell adhesion molecules, we demonstrate that the N-terminal two immunoglobulin-like domains of Tie2 harbor the angiopoietin-binding site. Using transmission electron microscopy we furthermore show that the extracellular domain of Tie receptors consists of a globular head domain and a short rod-like stalk that probably forms a spacer between the cell surface and the angiopoietin-binding site. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the head domain consists of the three immunoglobulin-like domains and the three epidermal growth factor-like modules and that the stalk is formed by the three fibronectin type III repeats. These findings might be of particular interest for drug development because Tie receptors are potential targets for treatment of angiogenesis-associated diseases.

Overexpression and knock-out studies in mice have revealed that Ang1 is an agonist promoting stabilization of vessels by maximizing interactions between endothelial cells and their surrounding support cells and the extracellular matrix (11Suri C.

In contrast Ang2 was found to be a context-dependent antagonist that promotes angiogenic sprouting or vessel regression depending on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (13Gale N.W.

Ang3 and Ang4 also show context-dependent actions as antagonistic and agonistic ligands, respectively, and they are believed to represent widely diverged counterparts of the same gene in mouse ANGPT3 and human ANGPT4 (10Valenzuela D.M.

Although Tie1 is considered an orphan receptor with no known ligands, it has recently been found that Ang1 and Ang4 can induce Tie1 phosphorylation (16Saharinen P. Kerkela K. Ekman N. Marron M.

Furthermore, it has been shown that Tie1 and Tie2 form heteromeric complexes in cells that express both receptors, which is consistent with the observation that phosphorylation of Tie1 is significantly amplified through Tie2 (16Saharinen P.

However, the mechanistic details of how angiopoietins differentially regulate Tie receptor activity are currently not known. Mutations in the kinase domain of Tie2 resulting in ligand-independent activation are associated with vascular anomalies such as multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations and intramuscular hemangiomas (18Vikkula M.

Pathol. 2004; 204: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Ang/Tie2 signaling has been studied extensively and is known to activate several downstream pathways that ultimately result in endothelial cell survival and cell migration (4Eklund L. Olsen B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 630-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although the lack of a ligand has made it difficult to elucidate the function of Tie1, experiments using a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor and the intracellular domain of Tie1 show that Tie1 activation can induce phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (27Kontos C.D. Cha E.H. York J.D. Peters K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1704-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, signaling involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is also one of the major pathways activated through Tie2 phosphorylation, which indicates overlapping functions of Tie1 and Tie2. Consistent with their expression in some other cells such as in the hemopoietic lineage, Tie receptors are found to be required specifically during postnatal bone marrow hematopoiesis (28Puri M.C. Bernstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12753-12758Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recently, a critical role of the Tie2/Ang1 signaling pathway has also been demonstrated in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells in the quiescent state in the bone marrow niche (29Arai F. Hirao A. Ohmura M. Sato H. Matsuoka S. Takubo K. Ito K. Koh G.Y. Suda T. Cell. 2004; 118: 149-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). It has been shown that activation of Tie2 on hematopoietic stem cells promotes tight adhesion of the cells to the niche, resulting in their quiescence and enhanced survival. Tie1 and Tie2 receptors share a high degree of homology. The extracellular regions of both receptors contain, three EGF-like modules that are flanked by two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, and three fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats (6Dumont D.J. Yamaguchi T.P. Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Breitman M.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1471-1480PubMed Google Scholar, 7Partanen J. Armstrong E. Makela T.P. Korhonen J. Sandberg M. Renkonen R. Knuutila S. Huebner K. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1698-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The first Ig-like domain and the EGF-like modules of Tie2 are necessary and sufficient to bind both Ang1 and Ang2, suggesting that differential receptor binding is not likely to be responsible for the different functions of Ang1 and Ang2 (30Fiedler U. Krissl T. Koidl S. Weiss C. Koblizek T. Deutsch U. Martiny-Baron G. Marme D. Augustin H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1721-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic regions contain tyrosine kinase domains including a number of phosphorylation and protein interaction sites (31Shewchuk L.M. Hassell A.M. Ellis B. Holmes W.D. Davis R. Horne E.L. Kadwell S.H. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: 1105-1113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Given the important functions of both receptors in a large number of biological processes, here we perform a detailed structural and functional characterization of the extracellular portion of Tie2 using biochemical and biophysical methods. Expression Plasmids—The following inserts were amplified by PCR and cloned into a modified pCEP-Pu vector that contains a secretory signal sequence for BM-40/osteonectin (32Poschl E. Fox J.W. Block D. Mayer U. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3741-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar): the fibrinogen-like domain of human Ang1 (residues 266-498) fused at its N terminus to the coiled-coil domain of human matrillin-3 (residues 443-486, Mat3-Ang1); the extracellular domain (ECD) of human Tie2 (residues 23-745) fused to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (Tie2 ECD Fc) or a His6 tag (Tie2 ECD); a truncated Tie2 construct coding for the first 420 amino acids (Tie2(23-442)); the first two Ig-like domains (residues 23-210) fused to the Fc tag (Tie2 Ig12 Fc) or a C-terminal His6 tag (Tie2 Ig12); the whole extracellular domain of Tie1 (residues 21-760) fused to the Fc tag (Tie1 ECD Fc); and the extracellular domain of the Tie1 splice variant (missing the first EGF-like repeat, residues 305-347) fused to the Fc tag (Tie1ΔEGF1 ECD Fc). The Tie2 Ig12 (residues 23-210) construct was also cloned into the pHis vector, a derivative of pET-15b (Invitrogen). All mammalian vector constructs contain a C-terminal His6 tag, and the bacterial Tie2 Ig12 construct supplies the tag at the N terminus. A schematic representation of the Tie protein fragments used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. Expression of Recombinant Proteins—All recombinant proteins were obtained by expression in HEK293 EBNA cells using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). After selection with puromycin (5 μg/ml) cells were expanded for the production of the recombinant proteins. Serumfree supernatants were harvested from transfected cells, and the recombinant proteins were purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on Ni2+-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Tie2 Ig12 was expressed in bacterial strain JM109(DE3) and purified under denaturing conditions as described previously (33Frank S. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Mini T. Jeno P. Engel J.

Fig. 2 was prepared with the program PyMOL. 4DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA. Electron Microscopy—For glycerol spraying/low angle, rotary metal shadowing, 20 μl of protein samples (0.1-0.3 mg/ml in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 30% glycerol) were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica at room temperature and rotary-shadowed in a BA 511 M freeze-etch apparatus (Balzers) with platinum/carbon at an elevation angle of 3-5° (40Fowler W.E. Aebi U. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1983; 83: 319-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken in a Philips Morgagni transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 80 kV equipped with a Megaview III charge-coupled device camera at ×54,000 nominal magnification. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy—CD measurements were made on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The cuvette pathlength was 10 mm. Data points were recorded at 1-nm intervals using a 2-nm bandwidth and 8-s response times. Ellipticities in millidegrees were converted to molar ellipticities (degree cm2 dmol-1) by normalizing for the concentration of peptide bonds. ELISAs—96-well plates (Costar) were coated with Mat3-Ang1 at 5 μg/ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 3 h at room temperature. The appropriate ligands were added to each well at decreasing concentrations and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline and incubated with a rabbit anti-Tie2 primary antibody (1:50 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature, washed as described above, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution, Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. The amount of ligand bound to Mat3-Ang1 was quantified by addition of 2,2-anzino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) substrate. The ECD of Tie Receptors Contains a Third Ig-like Domain—The first 188 N-terminal residues of Tie2 that precede the EGF-like repeats have been reported to fold into a single C2-type Ig-like domain (6Dumont D.J. Yamaguchi T.P. Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Breitman M.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1471-1480PubMed Google Scholar, 7Partanen J. Armstrong E. Makela T.P. Korhonen J. Sandberg M. Renkonen R. Knuutila S. Huebner K. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1698-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Ig-like domains typically consist of about 90 residues; therefore, approximately half of the sequence has no domain assignment. We therefore analyzed the N-terminal sequence stretch in detail by several methods. Secondary structure analysis using Jpred (35Cuff J.A. Clamp M.E. Siddiqui A.S. Finlay M. Barton G.J. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 1998; 14: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) predicted the entire sequence to fold into 14 distinct β-strands (data not shown). The C2-type Ig-like fold is characterized by seven β-strands, an observation that immediately suggested the presence of a second Ig-like domain in the N terminus preceding the EGF-like repeats. Because a correlation between exon structure and domain structure is frequently found for domains composed of multiple sequence repeats (41Springer T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 837-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the exon-intron organization of the Tie2 gene was also analyzed. The exon-intron boundaries correlate very well with the secondary structure prediction and strongly support the hypothesis that the N terminus of Tie2 harbors an additional, third, Ig-like domain. The existence of an additional Tie2 Ig-like domain is further supported by sequence threading using the protein fold recognition program 3D-PSSM (36Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), which confidently predicts a high similarity to the tandem Ig-like repeats of the RTKs Axl-Tyro3 (39Sasaki T. Knyazev P.G. Clout N.J. Cheburkin Y. Gohring W. Ullrich A. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 42Heiring C. Dahlback B. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6952-6958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2 (43Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)) According to the model shown in Fig. 2, the first and second domains of Tie2 are composed of residues 23-120 and 124-210, respectively. As expected from its high degree of homology to Tie2, the additional Ig-like domain was also predicted for Tie1 (data not shown). The presence of a tandem repeat of Ig-like domains in Tie receptors has some potentially important functional implications. Pairs of Ig-like domains are frequently found in other RTKs and cell adhesion proteins, where they play important roles for ligand binding. A prominent example is the Axl-Tyro3 RTK, which plays important roles in angiogenesis, cancer, spermatogenesis, immunity, and platelet function (44Hafizi S. Dahlback B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2006; 17: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of Axl-Tyro3 consists of two Ig-like loops followed by two FNIII repeats and therefore has a domain organization very similar to that of Tie receptors. Recently, the crystal structure of the two Ig-like domains of the Axl-Tyro3 in complex with the natural ligand Gas6 has been determined (39Sasaki T. Knyazev P.G. Clout N.J. Cheburkin Y. Gohring W. Ullrich A. Timpl R. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Gas6 comprises two laminin G-like domains, but interestingly in the crystal structure only the first domain binds two Axl-Tyro3 tandem Ig-like repeats at distinct and opposite sites, indicating how the receptor becomes activated through dimerization. Both contacts to Gas6 involve edge β-strands and are required for signaling. The structural similarity to Axl-Tyro3 strongly suggested that the Ig-like domain pair of Tie2 harbors the Ang-binding epitope. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study, although the authors reached a different conclusion. In an attempt to map the Ang-binding site in Tie2, Fiedler et al. (30Fiedler U. Krissl T. Koidl S. Weiss C. Koblizek T. Deutsch U. Martiny-Baron G. Marme D. Augustin H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1721-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) expressed a series of Tie2 truncation constructs as fusion proteins to a Fc tag in the baculovirus system and analyzed their binding properties to Ang1 and Ang2 by immunoprecipitation and ELISA. Consistent with our findings they showed that the first Ig-like loop of Tie2 in combination with the EGF-like repeats (amino acids 1-360) is required and sufficient to bind both Ang1 and Ang2, suggesting that differential receptor binding is not likely to be responsible for the different functions of Ang1 and Ang2. In contrast, the first Ig-like domain (residues 1-199) or the EGF-like repeats alone (residues 211-360) are not capable of binding Ang1 and Ang2. Closer inspection of the construct encoding the first Ig-like domain of Tie2, however, revealed that part of the second predicted Ig-like domain is missing. In fact, the construct lacks the last 11 C-terminal residues, which essentially removes strand G of the second Ig-like domain. It is therefore very unlikely that the truncated domain folds properly into a stable structure. Misfolding of the second domain would also result in a structural disruption of a putative ligand-binding site at the interface of the domain pair, providing a plausible explanation for the inability of the truncated protein to interact with angiopoietins. Further evidence for the importance of the pair of Ig-like domains of Tie2 in Ang binding is provided by the finding that knock-out mice lacking exon 2 of Tie2 do express a truncated Tie2 protein that misses the first Ig-like domain (30Fiedler U. Krissl T. Koidl S. Weiss C. Koblizek T. Deutsch U. Martiny-Baron G. Marme D. Augustin H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1721-1727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The mutant receptor missing the first Ig-like domain is functionally inactive as shown by the lack of ligand binding and receptor phosphorylation. Together these findings demonstrate that both domains of the Ig-like tandem repeat of Tie2 are required to bind to angiopoietins. Analysis of the EGF-like repeats suggests that these domains are unique to the Tie2 receptors. From the presence of eight cysteine residues the Tie EGF-like repeats have the greatest similarity to the laminin epidermal growth factor-like (LE) module, which is found in the extracellular matrix proteins laminins, agrin, and perlecan (45Stetefeld J. Mayer U. Timpl R. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 644-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consecutive LE domains mainly act as spacers but can also be involved in protein-protein interactions. The LE module shows little secondary structure and has disulfide bond connections Cys1-Cys3 (loop a), Cys2-Cys4 (loop b), Cys5-Cys6 (loop c), and Cys7-Cys8 (loop d), the first three being identical to EGF although with differences in the spacing of cysteine residues. Because of the close proximity of Cys2 and Cys4 the arrangement of disulfide bridges seen in LE modules is very unlikely for Tie EGF-like repeats, suggesting different disulfide bridge connections in these domains. The ECD of Tie Receptors Has a Lollipop-like Structure—As a first step toward a structural characterization of the extracellular domain of the Tie2 receptor, we expressed the full-length ectodomain of the human protein fused to the constant part of human IgG1 in HEK293 EBNA cells (see “Experimental Procedures” for details; see also Fig. 1). Analysis of purified recombinant fusion protein by SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig. 3. Inspection of the Tie2 ECD Fc molecules by TEM after glycerol spraying and rotary metal shadowing yielded uniformly appearing particles in which three globular structures are connected by short rod-like stalks (Fig. 4, A and B). The Fc fusion proteins form disulfide-linked dimers as evidenced by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (data not shown), therefore the central globule seen in the particles is likely to represent the Fc part of the fusion protein that connects two lollipop-like structures. The apparent length of the rod-like stalks (12 nm) is roughly consistent with the mean length expected for three consecutive FNIII domains (∼10 nm (46Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The terminal globuli are therefore likely to correspond to the remaining Ig-like domains and the EGF-like repeats, which together have a similar size as the four Ig domains of the Fc. To test this assumption we prepared two additional Tie2 fragments: the monomeric full-length ECD and the portion of the receptor corresponding to the Ig-like domains and the EGF-like repeats (Fig. 1).

https://openalex.org/W2009826605,"The Snf1 kinase and its mammalian orthologue, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), function as heterotrimers composed of a catalytic α-subunit and two non-catalytic subunits, β and γ. The β-subunit is thought to hold the complex together and control subcellular localization whereas the γ-subunit plays a regulatory role by binding to and blocking the function of an auto-inhibitory domain (AID) present in the α-subunit. In addition, catalytic activity requires phosphorylation by a distinct upstream kinase. In yeast, any one of three Snf1-activating kinases, Sak1, Tos3, or Elm1, can fulfill this role. We have previously shown that Sak1 is the only Snf1-activating kinase that forms a stable complex with Snf1. Here we show that the formation of the Sak1·Snf1 complex requires the β- and γ-subunits <i>in vivo</i>. However, formation of the Sak1·Snf1 complex is not necessary for glucose-regulated phosphorylation of the Snf1 activation loop. Snf1 kinase purified from cells lacking the β-subunits do not contain any γ-subunit, indicating that the Snf1 kinase does not form a stable αγ dimer <i>in vivo</i>. <i>In vitro</i> kinase assays using purified full-length and truncated Snf1 proteins demonstrate that the kinase domain, which lacks the AID, is significantly more active than the full-length Snf1 protein. Addition of purified β- and γ-subunits could stimulate the kinase activity of the full-length α-subunit but only when all three subunits were present, suggesting an interdependence of all three subunits for assembly of a functional complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091599617,"Heavy metals are required by all organisms for normal function, but high levels of heavy metals are toxic. Therefore, homeostasis of these metals is crucial. In the human malaria-causing agent Plasmodium falciparum, the mechanisms of heavy metal transport have yet to be characterized. We have developed a P. falciparum line resistant to heavy metals from a wild-type line sensitive to heavy metals. A molecular and biochemical analysis of the involvement of the P. falciparum multidrug resistance 2 (pfmdr2) gene, an ABC-type transporter, in heavy metal homeostasis was studied. Using a novel uptake assay applied on these two strains, it was demonstrated that, when exposed to heavy metals, the sensitive line accumulates metal, whereas no accumulation was observed in the resistant line. The accumulation occurs within the parasite itself and not in the cytoplasm of the red blood cell. This difference in the accumulation pattern is not a result of amplification of the pfmdr2 gene or of a change in the expression pattern of the gene in the two lines. Sequencing of the gene from both lines revealed a major difference; a stop codon is found in the sensitive line upstream of the normal termination, resulting in a truncated protein that lacks 188 amino acids that contain a portion of the essential cytoplasmatic transporter domain, thereby rendering it inactive. In contrast, the resistant line harbors a full-length, active protein. These findings strongly suggest that the PFMDR2 protein acts as an efflux pump of heavy metals."
https://openalex.org/W2064462460,"Lipopolysaccharide is the major glycolipid of the cell wall of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, a Gram-negative commensal and pathogen of humans. Lipopolysaccharide is both a virulence determinant and a target for host immune responses. Glycosyltransferases have high donor and acceptor substrate specificities that are generally limited to catalysis of one unique glycosidic linkage. The H. influenzae glycosyltransferase LpsA is responsible for the addition of a hexose to the distal heptose of the inner core of the lipopolysaccharide molecule and belongs to the glycosyltransferase family 25. The hexose added can be either glucose or galactose and linkage to the heptose can be either β1–2 or β1–3. Each H. influenzae strain uniquely produces only one of the four possible combinations of linked sugar in its lipopolysaccharide. We show that, in any given strain, a specific allelic variant of LpsA directs the anomeric linkage and the added hexose, glucose, or galactose. Site-directed mutagenesis of a single key amino acid at position 151 changed the hexose added in vivo from glucose to galactose or vice versa. By constructing chimeric lpsA gene sequences, it was shown that the 3′ end of the gene directs the anomeric linkage (β1–2 or β1–3) of the added hexose. The lpsA gene is the first known example where interstrain variation in lipopolysaccharide core structure is directed by the specific sequence of a genetic locus encoding enzymes directing one of four alternative possible sugar additions from the inner core.

Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) 3The abbreviations used are: Hi, H. influenzae;NTHi, nonencapsulated, nontypeable H. influenzae strain; Hep, heptose; Hex, hexose; PCho, phosphorylcholine; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LPS-OH, O-deacylated LPS; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; ESI-MSn, multiple-step tandem ESI-MS; OS, core oligosaccharide fractions; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; TOCSY, total correlated spectroscopy; GT, glycosyltransferase; T, Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. is a host-adapted bacterium that regularly colonizes the respiratory tract of humans. Encapsulated strains can cause invasive disease, such as meningitis or septicaemia, whereas nonencapsulated, nontypeable (NTHi) strains commonly cause otitis media, sinusitis, and acute lower respiratory tract infections. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a glycolipid that is a major component of the cell wall, functions as a virulence determinant (1Preston A. Mandrell R.E. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 139-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and is a target for host immune responses. The structure of the LPS of Hi consists of a membrane-anchoring lipid A moiety, which is linked to a phosphorylated 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid residue, which in turn is linked to a l-glycero-d-manno-heptose (Hep) trisaccharide unit. The middle heptose (HepII) is substituted at the 6-position by a phosphoethanolamine (2Schweda E.K. Hegedus O.E. Borrelli S. Lindberg A.A. Weiser J.N. Maskell D.J. Moxon E.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 246: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This forms the invariant inner core of the LPS molecule. The Hep residues each provide a point at which a hexose (Hex) can be added; these can in turn be further extended into oligosaccharide chains that form the outer core of the LPS molecule. The outer core is very heterogeneous both between and within strains. Substitution with other residues, such as phosphate, acetyl groups, glycine, and sialic acid can further add to the structural variability of the LPS molecule (Fig. 1). Glycosyltransferases (GTs) (EC 2.4.1.-) are key enzymes involved in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates, including glycolipids, glycoproteins, and polysaccharides. They transfer an activated mono- or oligosaccharide residue to an acceptor molecule. Hundreds of independent glycosyltransferase functions are required to generate all known glycosidic linkages. Glycosyltransferases have high donor and acceptor substrate specificities and are in general limited to catalysis of one unique glycosidic linkage (3Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It has yet to be determined how glycosyltransferases create these glycosidic linkages or how donor and acceptor specificity is determined (4Lazarus B.D. Milland J. Ramsland P.A. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Campbell et al. (5Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V.V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) introduced a classification system for glycosyltransferases to place them into families based on similarities in amino acid sequence. There were initially 27 GT families containing 600 sequences (5Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V.V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Since then, the number of families has grown to 86, containing over 33,000 sequences (6Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the vast majority of sequences have been added solely on the basis of sequence similarity; very few of the GTs have been defined biochemically. To utilize this genomic resource to the fullest, it is essential to understand the sequences of the enzymes themselves and how these sequences relate to an enzyme's structure, mechanism, and specificity of action. Having a confirmed function for specific transferase sequences is essential in achieving this end. The Hi glycosyltransferase LpsA has been shown to be responsible for addition of a Hex to the distal heptose (HepIII) of the inner core of the Hi LPS molecule (7Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Allen T. Masoud H. Martin A. Brisson J.R. Fleischmann R. Venter J.C. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 951-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and belongs to the family 25 GTs (6Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B.

Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that the Hex can be either Glc or Gal; moreover, the linkage of the Hex to HepIII can be by a β1–2 or β1–3 linkage (9Hood D.W. Deadman M.E. Cox A.D. Makepeace K.

Each Hi strain has been shown to produce only one of the four possible combinations of linked sugar in its LPS, suggesting that the addition might be directed by a specific sequence of the gene present in any given strain. In this paper, we investigate the lpsA gene and its function in 28 Hi strains and conclude that variations in the sequence of the GT direct both the specificity of the linkage and the addition of hexose (glucose or galactose). The capsular and nontypeable Hi strains used in this study (Table 1) have been described previously (12Hood D.W. Makepeace K. Deadman M.E. Rest R.F. Thibault P. Martin A. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R.

Following transformation into E. coli, the correct clones were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and PCR amplification using the oligonucleotides 6018C (anneals 120–106 bp upstream of the lpsA initiation codon) and 6018A (anneals 84–103 bp downstream of the lpsA stop codon). To construct plasmids containing intact lpsA genes linked to a kanamycin resistance marker, a cassette was inserted into DNA adjacent to lpsA for selection. Plasmids, derived from DNA amplified by PCR using primers 6018F/6018G from each strain, were digested with the restriction endonuclease SnaB1, which cuts in the HI0767 open reading frame, and then ligated with a kanamycin resistance cassette released from pUC4kan by digestion with HincII. Following transformation into E. coli, plasmid clones were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and PCR amplification using the 6018A/6018C primer set. Plasmids containing the cloned lpsA and interrupted HI0767 genes were designated p10.6SA, p11.7SA, p176.2KanA, and p486.1Kan for lpsA genes from strains Rd, Eagan, NTHi 176, and NTHi 486, respectively. All plasmid constructs used in this study are listed in Table 1. Oligonucleotide primers 6018C and 6018A were used to specifically amplify the lpsA gene by PCR from the chromosomal DNA of the 28 Hi strains described in Table 1, under conditions described above. Sequencing of the PCR products was performed using dye terminator technology (Big Dye DNA sequencing kit; PE Applied Biosystems) and oligonucleotides listed in Table 2, with an ABI-Prism 377 autosequencer. DNA sequence was assembled and analyzed as described previously (13Cody A.J. Field D. Feil E.J. Stringer S. Deadman M.E. Tsolaki A.G. Gratz B. Bouchet V. Goldstein R. Hood D.W. Moxon E.R. Infect. Genet. Evol. 2003; 3: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Single Amino Acid Changes—Site-specific changes in single amino acids of the encoded protein were introduced into the cloned lpsA gene using the QuikChange (Stratagene) protocol and oligonucleotide primers containing a specific sequence mismatch (underlined in Table 2). Briefly, RdC151Tfor and RdC151Trev (reverse and complement of RdC151Tfor primer) and 176T151Cfor and 176T151Crev (reverse and complement of 176T151Cfor primer) were used to amplify the plasmids p10.6SA and p176.2KanA, respectively (all primers anneal 434–472 bp downstream of the lpsA initiation codon). The PCR products were digested with the restriction endonuclease DpnI and then used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue super-competent cells. The resulting transformants were checked by PCR amplification with specific primers, and the lpsA genes in the plasmids were sequenced to verify that the correct mutation had been included. Plasmids pC151TRd and pT151C176 were chosen as clones in which the encoded amino acid had been confirmed as altered in the strain Rd and 176 lpsA genes, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis to Introduce an AflII Site—To facilitate the construction of chimeric lpsA genes, site-specific change of a single nucleotide was performed using the QuikChange protocol, to insert an AflII site into the lpsA gene in plasmids p10.6SA (Rd), p486.1Kan, and pC151TRd3 with no resulting change in the encoded amino acid sequence. Oligonucleotide primers RdAflIIfor and RdAflIIrev (reverse and complement of RdAflIIfor primer), which anneal 207–237 bp downstream of the Rd lpsA initiation codon, and 486AflIIfor and 486AflIIrev (reverse and complement of 486AflIIfor primer), which anneal 206–236 bp downstream of the NTHi 486 lpsA initiation codon containing a specific sequence mismatch (underlined in Table 2) were designed to create a unique AflII restriction site (boldface type in Table 2) in the cloned lpsA genes. The primers were used to amplify the plasmids p10.6SA (Rd), pC151TRd3, or p486.1Kan by PCR. Following processing and transformation, clones p10.6SAAflII, pC151TRd3AflII, and p486.1KanAflII were digested by restriction endonucleases AflII and SacII, and the fragments were run on a 1% agarose gel and then purified (Qiaex II gel extraction kit; Qiagen) to obtain two fragments, each containing part of the lpsA region from each strain. The 495-bp SacII/AflII fragment containing the 5′ portion of the lpsA gene was denoted 5′, and the 6261-bp AflII/SacII fragment containing the 3′ portion of the lpsA gene plus the remainder of the insert and the vector was denoted 3′. The fragments were then ligated to produce chimeric plasmids p5′486/3′Rd, p5′486/3′C151TRd, and p5′Rd/3′486 and then transformed into E. coli. Plasmids purified from the resulting transformants were checked by PCR amplification with specific primers and by DNA sequencing to confirm that the constructs were correct. Plasmids containing disrupted lpsA genes were linearized by digestion with XbaI and then used to transform Hi strains Rd, Eagan, NTHi 486, and NTHi 176 by the MIV procedure (17Herriot R.M. Meyer E.M. Vogt M.J. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated upon brain heart infusion-kanamycin, and then transformants were confirmed as lpsA mutants by PCR using the 6018A/6018C primer set and by Southern analysis (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids containing lpsA and a kanamycin resistance cassette in HI0767 were digested with BamHI and XbaI to release the insert from the vector and then used for transformation of the appropriate H. influenzae strains by the MIV procedure. The chimeric plasmids were similarly digested and used to transform the Hi strains Rd, Eagan, and NTHi 486 only. Allelic exchange in transformants was confirmed by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing as described above. LPS was prepared from bacterial lysates and analyzed by T-SDS-PAGE as previously described (12Hood D.W. Makepeace K. Deadman M.E. Rest R.F. Thibault P. Martin A. Richards J.C. Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Each LPS was structurally investigated using chemical, NMR, and mass spectrometry methods following a protocol outlined previously (18Månsson M. Hood D.W. Moxon E.R. Schweda E.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2979-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Schweda E.K. Richards J.C. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 71: 161-183PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from 5-liter batch cultures (5 × 1 liter) were harvested after overnight growth, and LPS was extracted from lyophilized bacteria. O-Deacylated LPS (LPS-OH) was prepared by mild hydrazinolysis. Core oligosaccharide fractions (OS) were obtained following mild acid hydrolysis of LPS. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) on LPS-OH and OS samples was recorded on a VG Quattro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) in the negative ion mode. Multiple step tandem ESI-MS (ESI-MSn) experiments on permethylated OS samples were performed in the positive ion mode on a Finnigan LCQ iontrap mass spectrometer (Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA). Sugars were identified as their alditol acetates using authentic standards. Methylation analysis was accomplished on dephosphorylated OS obtained after treatment with 48% hydrogen fluoride. NMR spectra were recorded for OS samples in deuterium oxide (D2O) at 25 °C. Spectra were acquired on a JEOL 500-MHz spectrometer using standard pulse sequences as previously described. For interresidue correlation, two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy experiments with a mixing time of 200 or 250 ms were used. TOCSY experiments were done using mixing times of 50 and 180 ms. The gene lpsA is required to add the first hexose sugar (Glc or Gal) to the third heptose (HepIII) of the conserved triheptose backbone of Hi LPS (Fig. 1). Using PCR amplification, it was shown that sequences homologous to lpsA were present in each of 28 distinct H. influenzae isolates that included both encapsulated and capsule-deficient (nontypeable) strains (data not shown). We sequenced lpsA from each of the strains (GenBank™ DQ647395–DQ647422) and aligned the deduced amino acid sequences (Fig. 2). When the strain Rd LpsA sequence was compared with the closest 48 matches obtained by searching with the BLASTP algorithm, it was atypical. Based on the annotation of lpsA (HI0765) from the KW20 genome sequence (16Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J. Tomb J.F.

Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4722) Google Scholar), in which GTG (Val) was proposed as the translational initiation codon, the predicted open reading frame would encode 282 amino acids. In contrast, in the matching glycosyltransferases in GT family 25, translation is initiated with an ATG (Met) initiation codon, located 26 amino acids downstream of the suggested Val translational start of HI0765 and resulting in an open reading frame of 256 amino acids. If Val were to be the initiation codon, the proposed lpsA open reading frames in 11 of the 28 strains would be truncated due to the presence of termination codons. However, if Met is proposed as the initiation codon, the prediction would be that only three strains (NTHi 285, 477, and 981) would have truncated lpsA reading frames. We analyzed the structure of the LPS obtained from NTHi 285, 4E. K. Schweda, unpublished results. 477, 5J. C. Richards, unpublished results. and 981 (18Månsson M. Hood D.W. Moxon E.R. Schweda E.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2979-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and, consistent with our prediction of Met as the initiation codon, these three strains are the only three of the 28 where there was no addition of a Hex to HepIII. Based on this evidence, we have assigned Met as amino acid 1 and the Val (the original suggested initiation codon) as –26 (Fig. 2). The lpsA gene in strain NTHi 285 has a 5-base pair insertion localized to between 5 and 29 base pairs into the reading frame. This predicts that the downstream sequence would be out of frame with the start codon and would result in a truncated open reading frame of only 14 amino acids. The insertion results in three tandem copies of a perfect 5′-ACAGT pentanucleotide repeat immediately followed by two imperfect copies, both of which have one base pair that varies from the repeat motif (Fig. 3). Considering next the lpsA genes of NTHi strains 477 and 981, each has a 57-base pair deletion located 282 base pairs downstream of the proposed ATG (Met) start. This deletion results in the loss of 19 amino acids, including two of three amino acids that make up the DXD motif of GTs (20Wiggins C.A. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 21Shibayama K. Ohsuka S. Tanaka T. Arakawa Y. Ohta M. J.

Based on crystal structures of several GTs, it has been proposed that this DXD region binds Mn2+ and forms the catalytic domain for the donor sugar (23Gastinel L.N. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3546-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of this functional domain and the remaining 17 amino acids would explain the lack of GT activity (no additions to HepIII) in strains 477 and 981. The only strain that does not have an ATG at positions 1–3 of its lpsA coding sequence is NTHi 723, which has a G to T transversion at the third base pair of the proposed ATG initiation codon. Structural analysis of the LPS of strain 723 has shown that a Glc is added to HepIII, but at relatively low levels (24Yildirim H.H. Li J. Richards J.C. Hood D.W. Moxon E.R. Schweda E.K. Carbohydr. Res. 2005; 340: 2598-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based upon bacterial codon usage tables, ATT (Ile) has been proposed to act as an alternative Met initiation codon (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/); this may initiate translation, but relatively inefficiently. Upstream and downstream of the proposed reading frame there are two regions (–75 to –45 bp upstream of the initiation codon and +2 to +45 bp downstream of the termination codon) of inverted repeats that would form strong stem-loop terminating structures. These repeat regions both contain tandem inverted copies of the Haemophilus 9-bp core uptake sequence (5′-AAGTGCGGT) (25Kroll J.S. Wilks K.E. Farrant J.L. Langford P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12381-12385Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The most striking observation from the alignment of the lpsA sequences was that they represent two families. One major group (22 strains) had limited polymorphisms between sequences when compared with the KW20 genome sequence (designated Rd-like; 94–99% identity to Rd). The other six strains resembled the NTHi 486 lpsA gene sequence (designated 486-like; 95% identity to 486); five strains, including NTHi 285, are at least 99% identical to each other. The NTHi 486 sequence has regions of homology to both families; 76% overall identity to Rd lpsA and 95% identity to the other five strains, a mosaic sequence pattern that may reflect interstrain allelic exchange.

The two-dimensional electron spin echo envelope modulation spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled protein show two well resolved cross-peaks with weak couplings of ∼0.3-0.4 and 1.1 MHz in addition to couplings in the range of 6-8 MHz from two coordinating Nδ of histidine ligands. The quadrupole coupling constants for weakly coupled nitrogens determined from S-band electron spin echo envelope modulation spectra identify them as Nϵ of histidine ligands and peptide nitrogen (Np), respectively. Analysis of the line intensities in orientation-selected S-band spectra indicated that Np is the backbone N-atom of Leu-132 residue. The hyperfine couplings from Nϵ and Np demonstrate the predominantly isotropic character resulting from the transfer of unpaired spin density onto the 2s orbitals of the nitrogens. Spectra also show that other peptide nitrogens in the protein environment must carry a 5-10 times smaller amount of spin density than the Np of Leu-132 residue. The appearance of the excess unpaired spin density on the Np of Leu-132 residue indicates its involvement in hydrogen bond formation with the bridging sulfur of the Rieske cluster. The configuration of the hydrogen bond therefore provides a preferred path for spin density transfer.

Proteins containing Rieske-type[2Fe-2S] clusters with two histidyl and two cysteinyl ligands play important roles in many biological electron transfer reactions such as aerobic respiration, photosynthesis, and biodegradation of various alkene and aromatic compounds. The distinct biological functions of this protein family are in part associated with the cluster redox potential and the pK of the oxidized form, which are roughly correlated with the number of hydrogen bonds from protein side chains and the peptide backbone to the cluster and its immediate ligands (1Mason J.R.

In the cytochrome bc1/b6f family, a Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) 4The abbreviations used are: ISP, Rieske iron-sulfur protein; ESEEM, electron spin echo envelope modulation; ISF, the water soluble proteolyzed extrinsic domain of the Rieske subunit (the iron-sulfur fragment) of the bc1 complex from R. sphaeroides; HYSCORE, hyperfine sublevel correlation; NQR, nuclear quadrupole resonance; Np, peptide nitrogen; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; mT, millitesla. is a constituent of the high potential electron transfer chain that accepts the first electron in the bifurcated reaction at the ubihydroquinone (quinol, QH2) oxidizing Qo site. In the catalytic mechanism at the Qo site, the redox reaction involves extraction of both an electron and a proton from the bound quinol and their transfer to the ISP through a short pathway that includes the ISP His-161 ring and the H-bond between Nϵ and the -OH of the quinol substrate (7Hong S.J. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the electron transfer is gated by the low probability of finding the H-atom of the H-bond in the kinetically favorable position, determined by the pK difference between the quinol and the oxidized ISP (ISPox) (reviewed in Refs. 5Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 689-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar and 6Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The pK on ISPox is contributed by one of the cluster ligands, His-161 in bovine numbering, and is associated with H+ dissociation from the Nϵ involved in the H-bond. The gating accounts for the fact that this first electron transfer is slower by more than 3 orders of magnitude than would be expected from the short distance (∼7 Å) involved (6Crofts A.R. Biochim.

The first electron transfer is the ratedetermining step in quinol oxidation under conditions of substrate saturation. Rate determination at this reaction is demonstrated by the fact that the overall rate depends on its driving force in a classical Marcus fashion, as shown through use of mutants of the ISP with modified redox potential (6Crofts A.R.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7436-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the driving force, ΔGo, for the first electron transfer is determined by the redox potential difference between the donor (SQ/QH2) and acceptor (ISPox/ISPH) couples. Assuming that mutations in the ISP do not change Em(SQ/QH2), a change in Em (ISPox/ISPH) will effect the driving force. Marcus theory relates the rate constant to the driving force, and a plot of log10k v. ΔGo follows the expected form for rates measured in mutants generated in mitochondria or in different species of bacteria (6Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7436-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the oxidation of QH2 is the limiting partial process and the Marcus limitation is seen for the first but not the second electron transfer step, the location of the limiting step is unambiguous (6Crofts A.R.

It is clear, therefore, that, for this crucial reaction, a deeper analysis of the factors contributing to changes in Em of ISP, and in the pKa values of the Nϵ, will play a key role in our understanding of the overall mechanism (5Crofts A.R.

An informative approach to studying the environment of the reduced Rieske cluster is through application of high resolution EPR techniques. Indeed, the coordination of the Rieske cluster by histidyl ligands was initially established by electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy (14Gurbiel R.J. Batie C.J. Sivaraja M. True A.E.

Chem. 2004; 9: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have shown that the major contribution in these spectra comes from the coordinating Nδ of histidines. Other more weakly coupled 14N nitrogens present in the cluster environment do not produce recognizable lines in the spectra, because of the influence of the nuclear quadrupole interaction of 14N. Whether or not lines are seen depends on a particular relation between nuclear Zeeman frequency and hyperfine coupling (23Flanagan H. Singel D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 5606-5616Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Yu. D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” Recently, it was demonstrated that the weakly coupled nitrogens produce readily observed lines in X-band two-dimensional ESEEM (HYSCORE) spectra of 15N-labeled sulredoxin, another Rieske-like protein (25Iwasaki T. Kounisu A. Uzawa T. Samoilova R.I. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 125: 13902-13903Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In particular, two weak couplings of ∼0.7 and 0.25 MHz (where the values reflect a recalculation of frequencies for comparison with 14N) were observed and tentatively assigned to peptide nitrogen of the backbone, and to Nϵ of the histidine ligands, respectively, based on comparison with model complexes and other clusters (25Iwasaki T. Kounisu A. Uzawa T. Samoilova R.I. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 125: 13902-13903Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these data did not provide any direct indication for the chemical nature of the nitrogens producing the couplings observed. This finding is important in the context of functional studies of the bc1/b6f family because it opens the way for the spectroscopic characterization of the Nϵ nitrogen involved in H-bonding with the occupant of the Qo site and the nitrogen(s) Np forming H-bonds with the cluster. In the present article, we have applied X-band (∼9.7 GHz) and S-band (∼3.1 GHz) spectroscopy to the water soluble proteolyzed extrinsic domain of the Rieske subunit (the iron-sulfur fragment (ISF)) of the bc1 complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides to further study the weakly coupled nitrogens around the Rieske cluster. Sample Preparation—Growth of R. sphaeroides, purification of the bc1 complex, and isolation of the ISF were previously described (26Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R.

Imai T. Urushiyama A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein isotopically labeled with 15N was prepared from R. sphaeroides grown in Sistrom medium as described previously (26Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B. Crofts A.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 15: 370-380Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but with the following modifications: 50% less nitrilotriacetic acid was used, l-aspartate and l-glutamate were not used, and 15N ammonium sulfate (Aldrich) replaced 14N ammonium sulfate. The working buffer used for all of the ISF samples was 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 400 mm NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The samples were reduced with 5 mm buffered (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) sodium ascorbate and placed into a quartz cuvette (Wilmad-Labglass, Bueno, NJ) with Teflon tubing to prevent scratching. In all of the spectra reported in this paper, the ISF was used rather than the intact complex. As a consequence, no interactions between the ISP extrinsic domain and occupants of the Qo site could occur, and the spectra therefore lack the features associated with such interactions. Pulsed EPR Spectroscopy—In pulsed EPR, a magnetization vector, reflecting a population of electron spins aligned along the magnetic field, is rotated to a new alignment, and the kinetics of relaxation back to the equilibrium alignment is followed by detecting the microwave emission (the echo). The rotation of the magnetization is determined by the pulse length, 90° for a π/2 pulse, 180° for a π pulse. The interaction with nuclear spins results in modulation of the decay kinetics, and Fourier transformation of these modulations reveals the frequencies of the interacting species. In practice, the resolution is improved through use of ESEEM (see below). For the Rieske protein in frozen solution, different orientations of the cluster relative to the magnetic field vector can be selected by tuning the magnetic field within the anisotropic EPR line from the rhombic g-tensor. The orientation of the g-tensor axes is strictly connected with the cluster. Several types of electron spin echo measurements with different pulse sequences were used, with appropriate phase cycling schemes employed to eliminate unwanted features from experimental echo envelopes (29Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Yu. D. Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) Spectroscopy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 412Google Scholar, 30Schweiger A. Jeschke G. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001: 578Google Scholar). Among them were two-pulse sequence and one- and two-dimensional three- and four-pulse sequences (29Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Yu. D. Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) Spectroscopy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 412Google Scholar, 30Schweiger A. Jeschke G. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance.

Wiley Interscience, New York1994: 308Google Scholar). Two-pulse Field Sweep—In experiments using the two-pulse sequence (π/2 - τ - π - τ - echo), the intensity of the echo signal was measured with a fixed interval, τ, between two microwave pulses with spin vector rotation angles π/2 and π. The echo intensity varies with magnetic field strength (units mT) to show the spectrum of the absorbing species. This type of measurement is termed a “field sweep,” and at settings at which modulation from magnetic nuclei are minimized (long pulse lengths, π ≥ 100 ns), the EPR line is comparable with the integral of the derivative spectrum collected by continuous wave-EPR. One-dimensional Three-pulse ESEEM—In ESEEM spectroscopy, the spin echo envelope, resulting from measurement of changes in amplitude of the echo with variation of pulse timing, provides an averaging of the relaxation kinetics of the spin population, improving resolution. In the one- dimensional three-pulse measurement (π/2 - τ - π/2 - T - π/2 - τ - echo), the intensity of the stimulated echo signal after the third pulse is recorded as a function of time, T, at constant time, τ, to generate an echo envelope. The set of three-pulse envelopes recorded at different τ values forms, after Fourier transformation, a two-dimensional three-pulse data set showing the spectra caused by nuclear spins interacting with the paramagnetic center (29Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Yu. D. Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) Spectroscopy. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 412Google Scholar, 30Schweiger A. Jeschke G.

Electron Paramagnetic Resonance: Elementary Theory and Applications. Wiley Interscience, New York1994: 308Google Scholar). HYSCORE—In the two-dimensional four-pulse experiment (π/2 - τ - π/2 - t1 - π - t2 - π/2 - τ-echo) known as HYSCORE, the intensity of the inverted echo after the fourth pulse was measured with varied t1 and t2 and constant τ (30Schweiger A.

Such a two-dimensional set of echo envelopes gives, after Fourier transformation, a four-quadrant spectrum that selects different correlations between nuclear frequencies from two manifolds with opposite electron spin projections, with equal resolution in each frequency coordinate. Because the spectrum is symmetrical with respect to the zero axes, only two quadrants are usually shown (30Schweiger A. Jeschke G. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001: 578Google Scholar). The data are usually presented as contour plots to show the peak positions in the spectra arising from different nuclear spin interactions or as three-dimensional projections of the same peaks. X-band Instrumentation—The X-band field sweep and ESEEM measurements were made with an ELEXSYS E580 X-band spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA) with an Oxford CF 935 cryostat. S-band Instrumentation and Software—The S-band EPR experiments were performed on a home-built pulsed S-band EPR spectrometer (32Weber A. Rohrer M. Törring J.T. Prisner T.F. Ziessow D. Lubitz W. Lendzian F. Proceedings of the 29th Congress AMPERE/13th ISMAR. 2. International Society of Magnetic Resonance, Berlin1998: 1138Google Scholar). Control of the experiment was accomplished through X-epr software using an ELEXSYS console including SpecJet and PatternJet (Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany.) The probe used was an ER 4118CF liquid helium flow cryostat with a Flexline (Bruker) cavity holder and a home-built bridged loop-gap resonator. Spectral processing of three- and four-pulse ESEEM patterns was performed with Bruker WIN-EPR software. Processing first consisted of subtracting the monotonic component of the decay from time traces (real and imaginary parts) by a cubic or sixth order polynomial to remove the echo decay function. The time trace was then zero-filled to increase the number of experimental data points to a power of one greater than that collected. Following this, a Hamming window function was applied, and the magnitude Fourier spectra were calculated (29Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Yu. D. Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) Spectroscopy.

Wiley Interscience, New York1994: 308Google Scholar). The Factors Leading to the “Cancellation Condition” in 14N ESEEM Spectra—Because of the I = 1 nuclear spin, and the quadrupole interactions resulting from this, the 14N nucleus can produce up to six lines in an ESEEM spectrum, three from each of the two electron spin manifolds with mS =+½ or -½. In measurements of amorphous (powder) samples (such as the frozen suspensions of the ISF used here), because of their different orientation dependence, not all transitions contribute equally to the spectra. The type of spectrum expected from 14N with predominantly isotropic hyperfine coupling A is governed by the ratio between the effective nuclear frequency in each manifold, νef±, given by νef± = |νI ± |A|/2|, and the quadrupole coupling constant, K, given by K = e2qQ/4h (23Flanagan H. Singel D.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 87: 5606-5616Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 24Dikanov S.A. Tsvetkov Yu. D. Bowman M.K. Astashkin A.V. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1982; 90: 149-153Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). If νef±/K =∼0, i.e. νef± ≅ 0 (the situation called a cancellation condition because νI ≅ A/2, i.e. the external magnetic field matches the local hyperfine field producing a situation of pure nuclear quadrupole resonance), then the three nuclear frequencies from a corresponding manifold will be close to the three pure nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) frequencies of 14N. In this case, three narrow peaks at the following frequencies,ν+=K(3+η)ν-=K(3-η)ν0=2Kη would appear in the powder ESEEM spectra, with the property ν+ = ν- + ν0 (the term η is an asymmetry parameter). These frequencies would also be present in orientation-selected spectra. However, their intensities depend on the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the g-tensor (i.e. cluster) and the respective NQR tensor in each particular experiment. The frequencies described by Equations 1-3. can appear in spectra up to a ratio of νef±/K =∼0.75-1 but are broadened as this value departs from 0. If νef±/K > 1, only a single line is expected from each corresponding manifold without any pronounced orientation dependence. This line is produced by a transition at the maximum frequency, which is actually a double-quantum transition between the two outer states with mI =-1 and 1. The frequency of this transition is well described by the following formula,νdq±=2[νef±2+κ]1/2 where κ = K2(3 + η2). Such a line might show a change in its frequency of the order of 2Δ(νI) that is dependent on orientation selection because of variation of the Zeeman frequency. However, it has an order of ∼0.12 MHz in S-band experiments, where the width of the EPR spectrum is ∼20 mT. Two other single-quantum transitions, involving the central level with mI = 0, have a significant orientation dependence from quadrupole interaction and could produce lines at varying frequencies in the orientation-selected spectra. Two-pulse field sweep X- and S-band electron spin echo spectra of dithionite-reduced Rieske [2Fe-2S] center in ISF show a rhombic EPR line shape consistent with a g-tensor having principal values (gz,y,x = 2.03, 1.90, 1.76) (Fig. 1). The width of the EPR line in S-band is smaller than that in X-band and is proportional to the ratio of microwave frequencies used (3.1 GHz for S-band and 9.7 GHz for X-band) (30Schweiger A. Jeschke G. Principles of Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001: 578Google Scholar, 31Weil J.A. Bolton J.R. Wertz J.E. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance: Elementary Theory and Applications. Wiley Interscience, New York1994: 308Google Scholar). In addition, the shape of the field sweep spectrum is influenced by the ESEEM. This influence is different at different regions of the line shape and is stronger in S-band than in X-band. The effect smoothes the gx feature in the S-band spectrum, which is, however, clearly seen in the X-band spectrum of the same sample. X-band 15N HYSCORE—X-band 15N HYSCORE spectra measured at different magnetic fields along the EPR line contain the cross-features produced by different types of nitrogens (Fig. 2). In the (+-) quadrant, two pairs of cross-peaks with a contour parallel to the diagonal are detected that have been attributed to the two coordinated 15Nδ1,2 with the hyperfine splittings of the order of 6 and 8 MHz (25Iwasaki T. Kounisu A. Uzawa T. Samoilova R.I. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 125: 13902-13903Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The contour line shape analysis of these features recorded at different field positions (33Dikanov S.A. Bowman M.K. J. Biol. Inorg.

These tensors are very similar to those reported for other Rieske-type proteins obtained by orientation-selected 15N Q-band electron nuclear double resonance (16Gurbiel R.J. Doan P.E. Gassner G.T. Macke T.J. Case D.A. Ohnishi T. Fee J.A. Ballou D.P. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7834-7845Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and 15N HYSCORE (25Iwasaki T. Kounisu A. Uzawa T. Samoilova R.I. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 125: 13902-13903Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Of particular interest in the HYSCORE spectra of 15N-ISF is the (++) quadrant, in which two well resolved pairs of the cross-features are clearly detected at (2.05, 0.95) MHz (Np) and (1.68, 1.28) MHz (Nϵ) near gz. These features are centered symmetrically around the diagonal point with 15N Zeeman frequency and are attributed to weakly coupled 15N in the immediate cluster environment. They were also observed in the HYSCORE spectra recorded near gx and gy and also at some intermediate field positions. The splittings are practically the same within the range 1.1-1.2 and 0.3-0.4 MHz in all of the spectra recorded, indicating their predominantly isotropic character. This is a result of the transfer of unpaired spin density onto the corresponding nuclei. Similar couplings were previously observed in the 15N HYSCORE spectra of the archaeal Rieske protein sulredoxin and assigned to the peptide nitrogen of the backbone (larger coupling) and to the remote Nϵ of coordinating histidine ligands (smaller coupling) (25Iwasaki T. Kounisu A. Uzawa T. Samoilova R.I. Dikanov S.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 125: 13902-13903Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From these results, we can tentatively suggest the same assignment for ISF. However, neither ISF nor sulredoxin show spectra that resolve two different couplings from Nϵ-atoms, probably because of the small differences between them. S-band ESEEM and HYSCORE—Although the 15N HYSCORE spectra at X-band provide evidence for the presence of weakly coupled nitrogens, we could only speculate about their chemical nature. To obtain additional information about these nitrogens, we have employed S-band ESEEM spectroscopy. Fig. 3 shows typical three-pulse S-band ESEEM spectra of ISF with natural isotope abundance in the region appropriate for the 14N nuclei, recorded at three different magnetic fields t"

In living cells, growth is the result of coupling between substrate catabolism and multiple metabolic processes that can be assumed to take place during net biomass formation and maintenance processes (i.e. maintenance of ionic gradients, protein, lipid, and nucleic acid turnover) (1Westerhoff H.V. Hellingwerf K.J. van Dam K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Gustafsson L. Thermochim.

During the last two decades, the complete thermodynamic description of growth processes has been obtained by establishing the balanced chemical reactions for anabolism and catabolism. A crucial parameter for growth evaluation is its yield, i.e. the efficiency of the transformation processes (from substrate consumption to biomass formation). The quantification of enthalpy efficiency (the energy converted into biomass divided by the energy input) has been successfully achieved for microorganisms (3Dermoun Z. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 377-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Dermoun Z. Belaich J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 742-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Blomberg A. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. J.

Bioeng. 1991; 38: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as for cultured mammalian cells (7Guan Y. Kemp R.B. Westerhoff H.V. Snoep J.L. Wijker J.E. Sluse F.E. Kholodenko B.N.

Biothermokinetics of the Living Cell. Biothermokinetics Press, Amsterdam1996: 398-406Google Scholar). This approach is based on the continuous measurement of heat production and on the exhaustive determination of substrates and by-products, thus allowing the construction of enthalpy balances (see Refs. 2Gustafsson L. Thermochim. Acta. 1991; 193: 145-171Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar and 9von Stockar U. Gustafsson L. Larsson C. Marison I. Tissot P. Gnaiger E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1183: 221-240Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar for reviews). Using this approach, we have previously shown (10Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that the enthalpic growth yield remains constant during any growth phase in yeast on respiratory substrate (i.e. exponential and transition phase). This constant enthalpic growth yield is owed to a tight adjustment of mitochondrial enzyme content to cellular energy demand (10Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This indicates that molecular mechanisms are involved in the growth yield homeostasis that allow a constant yield all throughout growth for a considered strain. However, when one is able to bypass the mitochondrial enzyme content adjustment, for example, through overactivation of the Ras/cAMP pathway, the growth yield is largely decreased (11Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Alonso A.P. Bunoust O. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1554: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This led us to wonder whether any and every yeast strain has its own growth yield. In this paper, we have described a new and very simple method to assess the enthalpic growth yield through the amount of oxygen consumed to generate 1 mg of biomass, which allows the study of numerous strains. The main finding of this study is that the growth yield is identical regardless of the strain and growth phase, clearly pointing to a homeostasis process. We also show that the cellular respiratory rate is always strictly controlled by the respiratory chain content. Thus, the growth yield homeostasis is based on the tight adjustment of the cellular content of respiratory chain compounds to the growth rate. Any process leading to a defect in this adjustment allows an energy waste and consequently an energy yield decrease.

Growth Media—The following growth media were used: (a) YPL 2% (1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.12% ammonium sulfate, 2% lactate, pH 5.5); (b) YPEG (1% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, 50 mm KH2PO4, 80 mg/ml adenine, 3% glycerol, 2% ethanol, pH 6.2); (c) SML 2% (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, without amino acids, without ammonium sulfate, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% lactate, pH 5.5 (the concentration of auxotrophic requirements was 100 mg/liter)); (d) SML 0.2% (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, without amino acids, without ammonium sulfate, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.2% lactate, pH 5.5 (the concentration of auxotrophic requirements was 100 mg/liter)); (e) SCL 2% (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, without amino acids, without ammonium sulfate, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% lactate, pH 5.5, 1 g/liter casein hydrolysate (the concentration of auxotrophic requirements was 100 mg/liter)); and (f) SCL 0.2% (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, without amino acids, without ammonium sulfate, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.2% lactate, pH 5.5, 1 g/liter casein hydrolysate (the concentration of auxotrophic requirements was 100 mg/liter)). Respiratory Rate Measurements—The oxygen consumption of cells was measured polarographically at 28 °C using a Clark oxygen electrode in a 1-ml thermostatically controlled chamber. Respiratory rates (JO2) were determined from the slope of a plot of O2 concentration versus time. Respiration assays of growing cells were performed in the growth medium, except in the case of the uncoupled respiration rate, which was performed after cells were harvested in the following buffer: 2 mm magnesium sulfate, 1.7 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm glucose, and 100 mm ethanol, pH 6.8. Determination of Biomass over Oxygen Ratio—Growth was measured spectrophotometrically in different media by assessing the turbidity at 600 nm. Dry weight determinations were performed on samples of cells harvested throughout the growth period and washed twice in distilled water. For each strain, the relationship between dry weight and optical density was determined. The biomass over oxygen ratio (1/QO2) was the inverse of the integrated value of oxygen consumption by cells during the time necessary to increase the biomass of 1 mg dry weight. It was expressed as mg of dry weight/microatoms of oxygen. Cytochrome Content Determination—The cellular content of c + c1, b, and a + a3 hemes was calculated as described in Dejean et al. (10Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), taking into account the respective molar extinction coefficient values and the reduced minus oxidized spectra recorded using a dual beam spectrophotometer (Aminco DW2000). Growth Yield Homeostasis—During the aerobic metabolism of mammalian cells, the calorimetric-respirometric ratio (i.e. CR ratio, defined as the ratio of heat production flux to oxygen consumption flux) has been proposed for assessing metabolic efficiency (12Clark D.G. Filsell O.H. Topping D.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Jarrett I.G. Clark D.G. Filsell O.H. Harvey J.W. Clark M.G. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A disproportional increase in heat production compared to oxygen uptake has been observed in isolated cells under conditions of enhanced futile substrate cycling (12Clark D.G. Filsell O.H. Topping D.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 501-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Jarrett I.G. Clark D.G. Filsell O.H. Harvey J.W. Clark M.G. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (14Hoffner S.E. Meredith R.W. Kemp R.B. Cytobios. 1985; 42: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar). However, such high CR ratio values have been reinterpreted as a consequence of an increase in glycolysis under aerobic conditions rather than as a change in metabolic efficiency per se (15Kemp R.B. Gnaiger E. Wieser W. Gnaiger E. Energy Transformations in Cells and Organisms. Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989: 91-97Google Scholar, 16Gnaiger E. Kemp R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although on-line calorimetry has been widely used to detect transitions in global metabolic activity during the growth of microorganisms (6Larsson C. Blomberg A. Gustafsson L. Biotechnol.

Acta. 1991; 193: 145-171Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar for review), the relationships between oxygen consumption flux and heat production rate are poorly documented (but see Ref. 21Hoogerheide J.C. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1975; 12: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We have previously developed a respirometric and calorimetric approach to determine the enthalpy efficiency of respiration-linked energy transformations of isolated yeast mitochondria and yeast cells under resting and growing conditions (22Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Bunoust O. Fleury C. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast to enthalpic balance approaches, this method does not rely on the exhaustive and tedious determination of the metabolites and elemental composition of biomass. Moreover, during the complete combustion of purely respiratory substrate such as lactate, each thermodynamic step corresponding to the consumption of one atom of oxygen corresponds to the same variation in enthalpy (21Hoogerheide J.C. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1975; 12: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because calorimetric-respirometric ratio assessment is a technique that requires heavy and rare equipment (microcalorimeter), we envisioned the possibility that the measure of both oxygen consumption and biomass would allow us to indirectly assess the enthalpic growth yield. When yeast cells are grown on a purely respiratory substrate, biomass generation is entirely connected to substrate oxidation through oxidative phosphorylation and, hence, to oxygen consumption. In a previous study, we have shown that either uncoupling or overactivation of the Ras/cAMP pathway leads to a decrease in the enthalpic growth yield through uncoupling between biomass synthesis and catabolism (10Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Alonso A.P. Bunoust O. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1554: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These peculiar conditions gave us a broad range of enthalpic growth yields, which were connected to the biomass over oxygen ratio under the same experimental conditions. Fig. 1 clearly shows that there is a unique linear relationship between enthalpic growth yield and the biomass over oxygen ratio. This ratio is defined as the inverse of the amount of oxygen necessary to generate 1 mg dry weight of biomass. This validates our hypothesis, and by measuring both respiratory and growth rates, we have a good estimate of the growth yield. Moreover, this method, which has the advantages of being quick and simple, allowed us to investigate (i) whether the fact that enthalpic growth yield does not vary during growth is a general rule regardless of the yeast strain and the respiratory medium or (ii) whether the growth yield is a parameter that varies as a function of the yeast strain considered and/or the respiratory medium or a general feature that would be constant regardless of the strain. We measured the spontaneous respiratory rate as well as the growth rate of numerous yeast strains in different growth phases and in different respiratory media. Fig. 2 shows that there is a linear relationship between these two parameters on a broad range of values (respiratory rate varied from 60 to ∼350 nanoatoms of oxygen/min/mg dry weight). This shows that there is a tight adjustment between growth and respiratory rates, which is further confirmed by the fact that the growth yield expressed as the biomass over oxygen ratio remains almost constant. This shows that there is an actual homeostasis of growth yield in yeast. Loss of Growth Yield Homeostasis—However, from Fig. 1, one can see that, under peculiar conditions (uncoupling, overactivation of the Ras/cAMP cascade), the enthalpy growth yield is decreased, thus indicating that this homeostasis in growth yield can be lost. Obviously, when the coupling between respiratory chain and ATP synthase activities is altered, the growth yield must be affected by the increase in proton permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This is clearly shown in Fig. 3; when uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is achieved either by means of UCP1 expression (22Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Bunoust O. Fleury C. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1503: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or controlled depletion of the δ subunit of the ATP synthase (23Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M.F. Velours J. di Rago J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), cells have a higher respiratory rate than control cells, which is not associated with a concomitant increase in growth rate. Consequently, there is a loss in growth yield homeostasis for these cells; the biomass over oxygen ratio is significantly decreased compared to wild type cells. Furthermore, previous work from our laboratory has shown that overactivation of the Ras/cAMP cascade induces a deregulation between the mitochondrial enzyme content and the growth rate (11Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Alonso A.P. Bunoust O. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1554: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Bunoust O. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, these mutants present an increase in the amount of mitochondrial enzyme content, which does not lead to a concomitant increase in growth rate. Depending on the kind of overactivation induced (Ras2Val19, cAMP addition), the increase in respiratory rate can be more or less important. This increase in respiratory rate from 180 to 340 nanoatoms of oxygen/min/mg dry weight does not lead to any increase in growth rate; thus, under these conditions, the relationship between respiratory rate and growth rate reaches a plateau (Fig. 3). Consequently, there is an exponential decrease in the biomass over oxygen ratio (see Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that whatever the means (uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation or overactivation of the Ras/cAMP cascade) by which the tight adaptation between growth rate and respiratory rate is lost, there is the same relationship between either respiratory rate and growth rate or respiratory rate and biomass over oxygen ratio. This is indeed noteworthy, because the increase in respiratory rate has very different origins in the two situations: (i) UCP1 expression or controlled deletion of the ATP synthase δ subunit induces an increase in respiratory rate by inducing an increase in mitochondria inner membrane proton leak or (ii) in the case of the overactivation of the Ras/cAMP cascade, the increase in respiratory rate originates in an increase in the amount of mitochondrial enzymatic content. In this case, the mitochondria have been shown to be well differentiated and coupled (not shown) (see Ref. 11Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Alonso A.P. Bunoust O. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1554: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Control of the Cellular Respiratory Rate—We then investigated the molecular basis of the homeostasis described above. Under conditions where yeast is grown on purely respiratory substrates, ATP synthesis mostly occurs within oxidative phosphorylation. A constant growth yield indicates that the part of ATP turnover involved in either biosynthesis or maintenance is constant. Yeast cell growth is characterized by two phases, an exponential one and the transition phase. We have shown that, during the last one, the decrease in growth rate is tightly linked to a decrease in mitochondrial enzyme content in such a way that the enthalpic growth yield is kept constant (10Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The question that is now raised is whether the fact that the growth yield is the same for any studied strain implicates that there is a tight adjustment between growth rate and the mitochondrial enzyme content. The amount of respiratory chains within a cell can be estimated through the cellular amount of mitochondrial cytochromes. We thus assessed the mitochondrial cytochrome content in the different strains under consideration, in different respiratory media and growth phases. If one plots the respiratory rate in these cells against the amount of each kind of cytochrome, one can clearly see that there is a linear relationship between these two parameters, indicating that respiratory rate in this case is mostly controlled by the amount of respiratory chain (Fig. 4). Because homeostasis is due to an adjustment between respiratory and growth rates, this implies that the mitochondrial enzyme content controls the growth rate. The question then arises as to understanding what controls the respiratory rate under conditions where the homeostasis is lost. We considered the loss of homeostasis due to overactivation of the Ras/cAMP pathway, because in this case, the oxidative phosphorylation remained well coupled. Fig. 4 shows that, in this case, the relationship between respiratory rate and cytochrome content is identical to the one obtained in the case of homeostasis. Therefore, cellular respiratory rate is always tightly controlled by cytochrome content. In this paper, we have unambiguously shown that the determination of the total amount of oxygen consumed to generate 1 mg of cell dry weight during growth on purely respiratory substrate allows an easy assessment of the growth yield. We have studied multiple strains and shown that the growth yield is maintained constant regardless of the strain considered, the growth phase, and of the respiratory substrate. In any wild type yeast strain, there is an actual homeostasis of growth yield, which is due to a tight adjustment of respiratory rate to the growth rate leading to a constant energy waste. Regardless of the pathway(s) allowing such an adjustment, it is clear that this process involves a good adjustment between the amount of cytochromes and the growth rate. In previous studies, Boumans et al. (25Boumans H. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using a number of strains varying in steady state levels of assembled bc1 complex, have shown that there is a linear relationship between the level of bc1 complex and the respiratory rate of growing cells (see Ref. 26Boumans H. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. van Dam K. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, they observed that a reduced level of bc1 complex is associated with a parallel decrease in the steady state amount of cytochrome oxidase. They have proposed that the respiratory chain in yeast behaves as a single functional unit (24Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Bunoust O. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Schägger H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 28Bunoust O. Devin A. Averet N. Camougrand N. Rigoulet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3407-3413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, Schägger has shown that Complexes III and IV are assembled into large supramolecular complexes. Along the same line but using another approach, we have shown that there is a very specific competition between electrons to enter the respiratory chain, which is also in favor of a supramolecular organization of the respiratory chain in which the relative ratio between any cytochrome remains constant (28Bunoust O. Devin A. Averet N. Camougrand N. Rigoulet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3407-3413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This is in close agreement with the results presented in this paper, as we observed a parallel variation in all of the cytochromes for the different strains considered. It should be stressed that, for any of the cytochromes, there is a linear relationship between the cellular respiratory rate and the cytochrome amount crossing through the origin (see Fig. 4). This clearly indicates that the respiratory rate is fully controlled by each component of the respiratory chain. Such a fact indicates that there are respiratory chain units in which the electrons are channeled along the respiratory chain complexes. This is a strong argument in favor of a supramolecular organization of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in yeast, which is a hypothesis that clearly accounts for the full kinetic control of the oxygen consumption flux by each of the electron carriers. One of the pathways involved in the tight adjustment between the growth rate and the amount of cytochromes has been shown to be the Ras/cAMP pathway, which is involved in nutrient sensing. Whenever the activity of this pathway is increased, Ras2Val19 strain or OL556 strain in the presence of cAMP, the energy waste is increased because of the loss of adjustment of the respiratory rate to the growth rate in such a way that respiratory rate is increased, whereas growth rate remains constant. Indeed, in these mutants, the relationship between the amount of cytochromes and the respiratory rate is identical to the one obtained in various wild type strains (see Fig. 4). Consequently, the oxidative phosphorylation stationary state remains constant, i.e. the amount of oxygen consumed per minute and per unit of respiratory chain is constant. It is worth noting that there are physiological advantages for the cell to keep a constant stationary state in oxidative phosphorylation at ∼70% of the maximal rate of respiration observed in the presence of the uncoupler. Indeed, a higher respiratory rate requires a decrease in phosphate potential (i.e. the free energy in ATP synthesis), which would impair the cell functions, but lowering the respiratory rate leads to an increase in protonmotive force, which is well known to induce an increase in the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species. Indeed this last situation has been observed when yeast cells enter the stationary phase and lead to a large enhancement of protein oxidation (29Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nystrom T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35396-35404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The fact that there is a unique relationship between respiratory rate and cytochrome content implies that respiratory rate and consequently ATP synthesis do not adjust to cellular energy demand. Indeed, in mutants overactivated in the Ras/cAMP pathway, both cytochrome content and respiratory rate increased, whereas the growth rate did not increase, leading to a decrease in growth yield, which implies an increase in energy waste. Consequently, the homeostasis in growth yield is due to the ability of cells to adapt the mitochondrial enzyme content to the growth rate. Even though the precise molecular mechanisms of this process are unknown to this day, it is clear that the Ras/cAMP pathway plays an important role in this regulation. We thank Dr. M. Jacquet for the OL556 strain, Prof. J. Thevelein for the YSH652, YSH286, and YSH672 strains, and Dr. J. P. Di Rago for the SDC6 strain."

TGF-β1 stimulates phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and activates other signaling molecules as well. The molecular link between these other kinases and Smads is not known. We sought new binding partners for Smad3 in renal cells and identified receptor for activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1) as a novel binding partner of Smad3. The linker region of Smad3 and the tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat 6 and 7 of RACK1 are sufficient for the association. RACK1 also interacts with Smad3 in the human kidney epithelial cell line, HKC. Silencing RACK1 increases transcriptional activity of TGF-β1-responsive promoter sequences of the Smad binding element (SBE), p3TP-Lux, and α2(I) collagen. Conversely, overexpressed RACK1 negatively modulates α2(I) collagen transcriptional activity in TGF-β1-stimulated cells. RACK1 did not affect phosphorylation of Smad3 at the C terminus or in the linker region. However, RACK1 reduced direct binding of Smad3 to the SBE motif. Mutating a RACK1 tyrosine at residue 246, but not at 228, decreased the inhibitory effect of RACK1 on both α2(I) collagen promoter activity and Smad binding to SBE induced by TGF-β1. These results suggest that RACK1 modulates transcription of α2(I) collagen by TGF-β1 through interference with Smad3 binding to the gene promoter.

The phosphorylation causes association of the R-Smads with Smad4. Heteromultimerization and translocation of these Smads into the nucleus leads to transcriptional activation of various genes, including those encoding ECM proteins. The TGF-β1/Smad pathway stimulates the expression of type I and type IV collagen and fibronectin in renal cells (6Hansch G.M. Wagner C. Burger A. Dong W. Staehler G. Stoeck M. J. Cell.

Previously, we found that in human mesangial cells, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated by TGF-β1 within 15-30 min. The ERK MAP kinase pathway, but not the JNK MAP kinase pathway, is critical for TGF-β1-induced α1(I) collagen expression (9Hayashida T. Poncelet A.C. Hubchak S.C. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1710-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Type I collagen synthesis is enhanced by ERK-dependent phosphorylation at the linker region of R-Smad, whereas the TGF-β receptor directly phosphorylates the C-terminal serine residues of R-Smads. This auxiliary effect of ERK MAP kinase is required for optimal Smad activity in human mesangial cells (10Hayashida T. Decaestecker M. Schnaper H.W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High glucose conditions stimulate TGF-β expression and enhance ECM production through the ERK MAP kinase pathway in mouse mesangial cells (11Isono M. Cruz M.C. Chen S. Hong S.W. Ziyadeh F.N. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 2222-2230PubMed Google Scholar) and increase the Smad response to TGF-β1 in human mesangial cells (12Hayashida T. Schnaper H.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2032-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The latter effect is mediated through activation of protein kinase Cδ (13Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase also modulates TGF-β1-stimulated collagen expression (14Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2632-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which these other pathways interact with Smad signaling are poorly understood. TGF-β receptors function as membrane-bound serine/threonine kinases, whereas many of these accessory pathways are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases. This observation suggests that some intracellular mediators exist between Smad signaling and these other pathways. To identify additional proteins that might bridge these distinct pathways, we employed a yeast two-hybrid assay. Novel proteins were isolated by their ability to interact with human Smad3. We identified several potential binding partners, including a scaffolding protein, receptor for activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1) (15Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). RACK1 is able to interact with several key molecules, including c-Src, β-integrin and others (16Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol.

Thus, it seemed an ideal candidate to affect cross-talk between ERK MAP kinase and Smad signaling. Here we show that RACK1 affects TGF-β1-mediated cell signaling via a negative effect on Smad-mediated type I collagen transcription in renal epithelial cells. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant human TGF-β1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and reconstituted as a 4 μg/ml stock solution in 4 mm HCl with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. For RACK1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody H-187 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for immunoprecipitation (19Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Barrow R.K. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2328-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) from BD Transduction Laboratories was used for immunoblot analyses. Anti-Smad1/2/3 mAb (H-2) and anti-human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mAb (F-7), were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphoserine antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.

Anti-FLAG M2 mAb was obtained from Sigma, and anti-phospho-Smad3 (Ser-433/Ser-435) antibodies were from Cell Signaling technology (Beverly, MA). Plasmid Constructs—A FLAG-tagged Smad3 in pEXL was obtained from H. F. Lodish and X. Liu (Whitehead Institute, MA). The p3TP-Lux construct was a kind gift from J. Massague (21Wrana J.L. Attisano L.

Immortalized human renal epithelial (HKC) cell lines were kindly gifted from L. Racusen and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium with 10% HI-NBCS, glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and HEPES buffer (25Racusen L.C. Monteil C. Sgrignoli A. Lucskay M.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using human Smad3 as bait according to the Clontech MATCHMAKER protocol (Clontech). Total RNA was isolated from human mesangial cells treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 15 min as described (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). One hundred ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primers, and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random primer from Clontech. Long distance-PCR was employed for amplification of cDNA library. Briefly, an AH109 yeast line (Clontech) was co-transfected with Smad3-pGBKT7, the cDNA library, and pGADT7-Rec (Clontech). Co-transfection of the double-stranded library DNA and pGADT7-Rec causes homologous recombination within yeast so that the outcome is a fully functional Gal4 activation domain/cDNA expression vector. Transformants of yeast were screened for their ability to grow on a nutrient-deficient selection medium. Yeast can make colonies only when bait protein (Smad3) and library protein interact in the yeast and the association functions as transcriptional activators for the absent essential amino acids to grow on the selection medium. Robust and well isolated colonies were picked up for further selection by restreaking three times on selection medium. Sixty-four transformants were selected as true positives. The library plasmids were isolated using the YEAST-MAKER isolation kit (Clontech). Transfection Assays—HKC cells were transfected with either pEXL-FLAG-Smad3 or empty pEXL using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours later, transfection was performed using 3 μg of plasmid DNA and FuGENE 6 (2 μl/1 μg of plasmid DNA). Five hours later, cells were replaced in fresh media containing 10% HI-NBCS. The next day, the cells were again replaced in serum-free media for an additional 24 h and then treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for appropriate time periods. For detecting phosphorylated Smad3, 80% confluent HKC cells were transfected with pEXL-FLAG-Smad3 and treated the same way with the above. Before harvesting cells, TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) was added for 30 min. Protein Extractions, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed on ice in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5; 10 mm NaCl; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm EDTA; 1 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate; 50 mm sodium fluoride; 40 mm β-glycerophosphate), and then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of antibody against RACK1 (H-187) followed by absorption with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were eluted to 50 μl of Laemmli buffer by boiling and aliquoted in two. The samples were electrophoresed through an SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred onto Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein binding sites on the membranes were blocked by incubating 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween (0.1%). Membranes were incubated with anti-RACK1 or anti-Smad1/2/3 mAb for 1 h. After washing, they were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories Inc. for RACK1 blots, goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for Smad. Proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For detecting the phosphorylation level of RACK1, HKC cells were treated with or without TGF-β1 or serum (10% HI-NBCS). Total cell lysate (0.5 mg) was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) mAb (20Chang B.Y. Chiang M. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20346-20356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and immunoblotted with anti-RACK1 mAb. Anti-FLAG mAb was used for immunoprecipitation of transfected FLAG-Smad3. Transfected HKC cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer following immunoprecipitation. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphoserine or anti-phospho-Smad3 antibodies. These membranes were stripped with a stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; 2% SDS; 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) at 55 °C for 30 min and reblotted with anti-Smad1/2/3 mAb to check whether the same amount of FLAG-tagged Smad3 proteins was immunoprecipitated. Total cell lysates were analyzed to know the expression level of overexpressed RACK1 using anti-RACK1 mAb or anti-HA mAb and the expression level of FLAG-Smad3 using anti-Smad1/2/3 mAb. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HKC cells were seeded on 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/well, and transfection was performed 20 h later with the indicated plasmid DNAs along with CMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency. After 5 h of transfection, 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 was added, and the cells were incubated for additional 20 h. Cells were harvested with reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured as described previously (9Hayashida T. Poncelet A.C. Hubchak S.C. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1710-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection—Chemically synthesized, double-stranded RACK1 siRNA or control siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For reporter assay, HKC cells were seeded on 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105/well 20 h before transfection. The siRNAs were mixed with FuGENE 6 (2 μl/1 μl siRNA) and serum-free/antibiotic-free medium and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The indicated reporter construct (0.5 μg/well) and CMV-SPORT-β-galactosidase (0.15 μg/well) were incubated with FuGENE 6 (2 μl/1 μg of DNA constructs) for 30 min separately from siRNA. These two mixtures were added to the cells at same time. TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml) was added to the cells 5 h after transfection for p3TP-Lux and 20 h after for the SBE-Luc and COL1A2 reporter constructs. The final concentration of siRNAs was 10 nm. Twenty hours later, the cells were harvested, and lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. For detecting protein levels, HKC cells were transfected with siRNAs and treated as above. Total cell lysates were collected followed by Western blot with anti-RACK1 mAb. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay (DAPA)—HKC cells were transfected with either the pcDNA3-HA-RACK1 constructs or the control pcDNA3. After treating with TGF-β1, nuclear extracts (50 μg) were prepared in a standard manner, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with 4 μg of biotin-labeled double-stranded probes (Sigma Genosys) containing the SBE sequence for 3 h at 4 °C. Then samples were incubated with 20 μl of streptavidin-agarose in a 50% slurry (Pierce) for 90 min (27Deng W.G. Zhu Y. Montero A. Wu K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Ghosh A.K. Bhattacharyya S. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47455-47463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the pellet was washed four times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and bead-bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer followed by SDS-PAGE. After transfer, the membranes were immunoblotted with anti-Smad1/2/3 mAb. Nuclear extracts (15 μg) were analyzed by Western blots using appropriate antibodies. Statistical Analysis—The data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical differences between experimental and control groups were determined by analysis of variance, and a value of p < 0.05 by Student's t test was considered significant. RACK1 as a Novel Binding Partner of Smad3—Yeast two-hybrid interaction trap method and multiple subsequent restreakings identified 64 robust colonies, suggesting that strong interaction with human Smad3 occurs in yeast. One cDNA clone encoded amino acids 251-317 of the scaffolding protein, RACK1. This clone contains one-fifth of the full-length cDNA for RACK1, including its C terminus. To verify bait dependence of the interaction and to map the possible interaction domain of Smad3, the isolated RACK1 plasmid was reintroduced into a parental yeast line AH109 in combination with expression vectors encoding WT or one of several deletion mutants of Smad3 (Fig. 1A). Empty pGBKT7 vector was used as a negative control for Smad3. All of the colonies, except those with the control vector, showed positive for β-galactosidase (data not shown), which further indicates that all the colonies were true positives. Bait-clone interaction was permissive for the yeast colonies to grow. As shown in Fig. 1B, colonies grew wherever clones included the sequence of the Smad3 linker region. These results demonstrate that the linker region of Smad3 is important for the interaction between RACK1 and Smad3 and that the tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat 6 (WD6) and/or WD 7 domain (Fig. 1C) of RACK1 is sufficient for this binding. RACK1 Interacts with Smad3 in Renal Cells—To examine whether RACK1 and Smad3 interact in mammalian cells, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using whole cell lysate from HKC cells, a renal epithelial cell line. Co-immunoprecipitation with several different commercial antibodies against Smad was technically difficult because of a strong nonspecific band migrating around the anticipated size of RACK1. Instead, polyclonal antibody against RACK1 was used for immunoprecipitation. We were unable to detect interaction between endogenous proteins. HKC cells were then transfected with either the FLAG-Smad3-pEXL construct or the empty pEXL construct. The interaction was detected by observation if a band developed with anti-Smad1/2/3/mAb only when the FLAG-Smad3-pEXL was transfected (Fig. 2A). To investigate the effect of TGF-β1 on the interaction, immunoprecipitates were prepared from cells treated with TGF-β1 for different time periods. We also analyzed the same samples by Western blot using anti-RACK1 mAb to check whether equal amounts of RACK1 were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B, second panel). Total cell lysates were analyzed to check the level of Smad3 (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Basal interaction was observed without TGF-β1 treatment. In the experiment shown, the level of co-immunoprecipitation slightly increased and slowly decreased subsequently (Fig. 2B, top panel). In other experiments, we observed a similar pattern of interaction, with a slight increase at 10-20 min followed by a decrease over time (data not shown). A similar association between RACK1 and Smad3 was demonstrated in human mesangial cells (data not shown), although the quality of the image was poor, likely due to the low transfection efficiency of the cells. RACK1 Inhibits TGF-β1-stimulated Transcriptional Activity—We performed several experiments to assess the functional significance of RACK1. First, we examined whether silencing RACK1 expression affects transcriptional activity in HKC cells using the SBE-Luc, p3TP-Lux, and -376COL1A2-Luc reporter constructs. The SBE-Luc construct contains four copies of the CTCTAGAC sequence that has been shown to bind recombinant Smad3 and Smad4 (22Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). Also conventionally utilized in studying TGF-β1/Smad signaling, the p3TP-Lux reporter activity is stimulated by both TGF-β1 and activin through the mediation of their responsive receptors and Smad3 (21Wrana J.L.

Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). RACK1 siRNA decreased RACK1 expression, as demonstrated by Western blot using RACK1 mAb (Fig. 3A). This treatment increased the fold induction of SBE-Luc and p3TP-Lux activity by 1.7 and 2.6 times, respectively (Fig. 3B). The effect of RACK1 siRNA on the COL1A2 promoter was more complex; basal activity was stimulated 3.4-fold, and TGF-β1-stimulated activity was 3.6 times higher. Since decreased RACK1 enhances TGF-β1/Smad3 responsiveness, these data suggest that RACK1 acts as an inhibitor of this signaling pathway. We then examined the effect of overexpressing RACK1 on COL1A2 promoter activity. As anticipated, RACK1 WT reduced TGF-β1-stimulated transcriptional activity by 70% (Fig. 4A). These results further suggest that RACK1 plays a negative role in TGF-β1/Smad3-mediated signal transduction in renal cells. We next examined the effect of overexpressed RACK1 mutants on type I collagen promoter activity in HKC cells. Two point mutant constructs, pcDNA3-HA-RACK1 Y228F and pcDNA3-HA-RACK1 Y246F, and a double mutant with phenylalanine replacing both Tyr-228 and Tyr-246 residues (RACK1 DM) were employed in the experiment. It has been reported that the tyrosine residues at 228 and 246 in the WD6 domain of RACK1 (Fig. 1C) are critical for regulating Src kinase activity (31Chang B.Y. Harte R.A. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7619-7629Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The RACK1 Y228F mutants still had an inhibitory effect on COL1A2 promoter activity. However, the inhibitory effect of RACK1 Y246F mutant was significantly reduced when compared with RACK1 WT and Y228F mutant. Expression of RACK1 DM partially inhibited the promoter activity induced by TGF-β1 (Fig. 4B). This finding suggests that the tyrosine at residue 246, but not 228, of RACK1 has a critical role in regulating collagen transcription in TGF-β1-stimulated renal cells. To examine the effect of the interaction between RACK1 and Smad3 on COL1A2 transcription, we overexpressed both of these molecules together in HKC cells and measured reporter activity. Interestingly, overexpression of Smad3 overcame the inhibitory effect of both WT and the two point mutants of RACK1 (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that abundantly expressed Smad3 is sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of RACK1. Phosphorylation of RACK1 and Smad3 in TGF-β1-stimulated HKC Cells—Since the tyrosine residues at 228 and 246 could play a role in COL1A2 transcription in renal cells, we investigated the potential mechanism of this effect. Because phosphorylation of RACK1 is critical for its regulation of Src kinase activity (20Chang B.Y. Chiang M. Cartwright C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20346-20356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), serum-starved HKC cells were treated with TGF-β1, and the total phosphorylation of RACK1 was examined. Even with 24 h of serum starvation, there was basal phosphorylation of RACK1. With brief TGF-β1 treatment, phosphorylation was slightly decreased, whereas serum treatment tested as a positive control dramatically increased it (Fig. 5A). This suggests that TGF-β1 has little effect on phosphorylation of RACK1 or its subsequent Src kinase activity. Next, we investigated whether overexpressed RACK1 affects phosphorylation of Smad3. In a previous report, we found that TGF-β1-activated ERK phosphorylates serine residues,"
https://openalex.org/W2006525803,"Docked vacuoles are believed to undergo rapid lipid mixing during hemifusion and then a slow, rate-limiting completion of fusion and mixing of lumenal contents. Previous genomic analysis has suggested that Bem1p, a scaffold protein critical for cell polarity, may support vacuole fusion. We now report that bem1Δ strains have fragmented vacuoles (vps class B and C). During in vitro fusion reactions, vacuoles from bem1Δ strains showed a strong reduction in the rate of lipid mixing when compared with vacuoles from the BEM1 parent. The reduction in the overall rate of fusion with bem1Δ vacuoles was modest, consistent with lipid mixing as a non-rate-limiting step in the pathway. Although the fusion of either BEM1 (wild-type) or bem1Δ vacuoles is stimulated by recombinant Bem1p, the lipid mixing of docked bem1Δ vacuoles is highly dependent on rBem1p under certain reaction conditions. Bem1p-stimulated lipid mixing is blocked by well characterized fusion inhibitors including lipid ligands and antibodies to Ypt7p, Vps33p, and Vam3p. Although full-length Bem1p is required for maximal stimulation, a truncation mutant comprising the SH3 domains and the Phox homology (PX) domain retains modest stimulatory activity. In contrast to an earlier report (Han, B. K., Bogomolnaya, L. M., Totten, J. M., Blank, H. M., Dangott, L. J., and Polymenis, M. (2005) Genes Dev. 19, 2606–2618), we did not find phosphorylation of Bem1p at Ser-72 to be required for Bem1p-stimulated fusion. Taken together, Bem1p is a positive regulator of lipid mixing during vacuole hemifusion and fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2152963416,"The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is important for several different biological functions during development. The recruitment at the phosphorylated Tyr1062 site in RET of a number of different phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing adaptor proteins, including Shc and Frs2, plays a dominant role for the multiple different biological functions of the RET receptor during development, including stimulation of cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that a competitive recruitment of Shc as opposed to Frs2 mediates the survival signaling arising from RET activation. Based on results from a peptide array, we have genetically engineered the PTB domain binding site of RET to rewire its recruitment of the PTB proteins Shc and Frs2. An engineered RET that has a competitive interaction with Shc at the expense of Frs2, but not a RET receptor that only recruits Frs2, activates cell survival signaling pathways and is protective from cell death in neuronal SK-N-MC cells.

Following their association with receptors, PTB domain proteins are themselves phosphorylated at tyrosine sites that selectively recruit the SH2 domains of downstream targets in a fashion that can be critical for cellular responses to RTKs (1Blaikie P.

PTB domain proteins thereby serve as scaffolds to assemble specific signaling complexes and to stimulate intracellular pathways with the potential to modulate a range of different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, cell motility, and cell survival. PTB domains fold into an antiparallel pseudo-β-sheet with a C-terminal α-helix, to create a binding site for peptides with a β-turn. These peptide motifs often have the sequence consensus NPXY, although the proline at the -2-position can be dispensable (5Wolf G. Trüb T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M.

In addition, the PTB domains of Shc, Frs2, IRS, and Dok family members require phosphorylation of the Tyr residue within the NXXY motif for high affinity binding (6Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 12: 2207-2216Crossref Scopus (843) Google Scholar). PTB domains can be rather versatile in their binding properties, and indeed the PTB domain of Frs2 engages an extended peptide sequence in the juxtamembrane region of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1) in a different mode from NPXpY motifs and in a fashion that is constitutive, although its activation is ligand-dependent (7Xu H.

In addition to binding a core NXXpY motif, the PTB domains of proteins, such as Shc and Frs2, discriminate between related binding sites on the basis of residues immediately amino-terminal to the NXXpY motif that influence the binding affinity. Thus, amino acid differences at positions -4 to -8 promote preferential binding to the Shc or Frs2 PTB domains (5Wolf G. Trüb T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J.

Consistent with this notion, the insulin receptor, which associates primarily with the PTB domain of IRS-1, but not Shc, can be re-engineered to selectively interact with ShcA by a single amino acid substitution at the -5-position in the sequence N-terminal to the core NXXpY PTB domain binding site (11van der Geer P.

Gain- and loss-of-function mutations in ret can cause severe diseases in humans, including papillary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, and 2B(III), familial medullary thyroid carcinoma, and Hirschsprung disease.

J. Clin Oncol. 1999; 17: 380-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cysteine substitutions convert an intramolecular disulfide bond to an intermolecular linkage, resulting in permanent RET dimerization and ligand-independent activation (26Asai N. Iwashita T.

In contrast, in most MEN2B cases, there is a methionine to threonine substitution at position 918 (M918T) of the kinase domain, which constitutively activates the kinase and may alter RET substrate specificity. Tyr1062 of RET, an in vivo autophosphorylation and multidocking site, conforms to the NXXpY consensus for PTB domain recognition. Phosphorylation of Tyr1062 appears functionally important, since substituting this tyrosine with phenylalanine impairs the transforming activity of the oncogenic MEN2A and MEN2B RET receptors (28Asai N.

Unlike ShcA, Frs2 can also complex with the Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase, which enhances stimulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway of RET (33Kurokawa K. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Kawai K. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). ShcA can also associate with proteins, such as Memo, that are not known to bind Frs2 (40Marone R. Hess D. Dankort D. Muller W.J. Hynes N.Y. Badache A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These results have led to the hypothesis that the balance of Shc and SNT/Frs2 binding to the Tyr(P)-1062 site may affect the nature of the intracellular signaling for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival induced by activated RET (33Kurokawa K. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Hayashi H. Kawai K. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the binding of the PTB domain of one docking protein excludes the recruitment of another to the same site, different PTB domain proteins may compete for interaction with RET. In this study, we have engineered the RET receptor to generate receptors that preferentially engage Shc, but not Frs2, and vice versa, designated RetShc+ and RetFrs+, respectively. We find that RetShc+ but not RetFrs+ activates signaling pathways resulting in cell survival. This difference in biological outcome supports the idea that one level of functional specificity in RTK signaling resides in the recruitment of different PTB domain proteins. The affinity profiles of a given RTK for distinct PTB domain proteins may therefore determine which of these docking proteins successfully compete for the activated receptor and thereby influence specific cellular functions. Our results may provide a better mechanistic insight into how different receptor tyrosine kinases instruct different cellular functions as a result of environmental signals. DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—The human cDNA for ret9 was originally obtained in the PJ7Ω vector as a gift from Marc Billaud (Université Claude Bernard). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using primer pairs according to QuikChange methods (Stratagene). Constructs were sequenced using BigDye version 1.1 kit (Applied Biosystems) with an ABI Prism 310 sequencer. RetFrs+ constructs were made through PCR cloning of the FGFR1 juxtamembrane segment (residues 410-426) with a C-terminal hemagglutinin epitope (the hemagglutinin epitope was not used for detection in this study) and subcloned in pCDNA3. Mammalian expression constructs for ShcA and Frs2α were gifts from R. Bradshaw (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) and H. Berger (University of Birmingham). GST fusion constructs of ShcA- and Frsα-PTB were made in pGEX-4T2 vector (GE Healthcare). Flurorescent markers used (green or red) were from the Enhanced FP range of Clontech. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% serum (fetal bovine serum) and 1 mm glutamine, whereas the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 12% fetal bovine serum and 1 mm glutamine. All ligand stimulations were performed using 50 ng/ml recombinant human GDNF and 100 ng/ml of recombinant human GFRα1/FC chimera (RnD Systems). All transfections were performed using polyethylenimine at 0.8 μg/ml in PBS (25 kDa; Sigma) as described previously (41Scott R.P. Eketjäll S. Aineskog H. Ibánez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13442-13449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Growth medium was replaced 5-7 h after transfection. Transfection efficiency as monitored by EGFP fluorescence was consistently >90%. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against RET9 and phosphotyrosine (PY99) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against hexahistidine tags were from BD Biosciences. Anti-GST antibodies were from GE Healthcare. Antibodies for CREB, phospho-CREB Ser133, Akt, phospho-Akt Ser473, p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p44/42 MAPK, NFκB, phospho-NFκB, and cleaved caspase-3 Asp175 were from Cell Signaling. Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. GDNF and GFRα1 were purchased from R & D Biosystems. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—pGEX-4-T2 plasmids containing the specific construct were transformed into the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli. Exponentially growing cells were induced with 0.7 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. The bacteria were centrifuged, and the pellet was dissolved in cold PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice, after which PBS plus 2% Triton X-100 was added at 1:1. The suspension was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4°C. After repeated washings, captured protein was eluted by the addition of buffer containing 12 mm reduced gluthatione (Sigma), 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). When appropriate, the GST tag was enzymatically cleaved off by incubation with Trombine (GE Healthcare). Purified proteins were dialyzed (Pierce Slide-Alyzer-Bags) against 50% glycerol in PBS buffer and stored at -20 °C until use. Purity was checked by running samples on polyacrylamide gels followed by Commassie Blue staining of gels. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Peptide Spot Arrays—Peptide arrays were prepared according to the spot synthesis method using standard Fmoc chemistry (42Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Fmoc-protected and -activated amino acids (Intavis) were spotted on high density 24 × 18 arrays on 130 × 90-mm cellulose membranes with an AbiMed (Langfield, Germany) ASP422 robot. Membranes were blocked overnight in 10% skimmed milk, incubated with 1 μm purified GST fusion proteins in 0.1% Tween in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h at 4°C, washed three times, and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody. Primary antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation, Pull-down Assays, and Protein Immunoblots—Cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 10% glycerol). For caspase-3 experiments, cells were lysed in CHAPS buffer (Amresco) and subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. Immunoprecipitations were carried out overnight at 4 °C using the appropriate antibodies immobilized on protein G-Sepharose. GST pull-down assays were done using the GST fusion protein baits immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. In far Western experiments, membranes were incubated with GST-equipped purified peptides for 6 h at 4°C. When competitive immunoprecipitation was performed, purified peptides equipped with a GST tag (100 pmol) replaced antibodies, and increasing amounts of the competitive peptide (without tag) were added. Precipitated protein were eluted by boiling in reducing Laemmli buffer. Proteins were fractionated on polyacrylamide gels and immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Equal RET expression levels were determined by RET Western blot on cell lysates. Western blot detection was carried out by the ECL method using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Protein bands were analyzed using ImageQuant software. Cell Survival Assays—Cell survival response to GDNF was assessed using MTT reagent. Transfected SK-N-MC cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml GDNF the day after transfection. One hour after ligand stimulation, cells were challenged with anisomycin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Medium was replaced with anisomycin-free growth medium after 6 h, and cells were incubated for an additional 10 h. MTT reagent was subsequently added and incubated for 4 h. Converted MTT was solubilized with 0.04 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm with background subtraction at 650 nm. For siRNA experiments, 27-mer oligonucleotides against ShcA (5′-CUACUUGGUUCGGUACAUGGG-3′) and ShcC (UCAAUGAGGUCUCUUGACUUCAGUACA; MWG, Germany) used at 6 nm were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The efficacy of the siRNA were examined by Western blotting toward pan-Shc. 36-50 h after siRNA transfection, the cells were challenged with anisomycin. Cell survival was determined by counting of cell numbers. Experiments with inhibitors were performed as described above using LY294002 at 25 μm and U0126 at 12 μm. The inhibitors were added to starvation media approximately 1 h prior to the addition of RET ligands. Proliferation Assay—SK-N-MC cells were transfected with RET mutants. 20 h later, the medium was replaced to a “starvation” medium containing 0.5% bovine serum and ligand for 12 h, and the proliferative response was assayed using spectrometry of MTT conversion 36 h later. Apoptosis Assay—SK-N-MC cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected and stimulated with GDNF the following day. Anisomycin treatment was done at a final concentration of 40 μg/ml for 6 h. Cells were briefly rinsed with PBS, fixed in 3.8% PFA, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 5% goat serum. Fixed and permeabilized cells were then treated with antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 at 4 °C overnight. After washings in PBS, cells were incubated with Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were mounted in Vectashield H-1000 (Vecta Laboratories), and positively stained cells were quantified under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2 with ×40/0.95 Korr objective) and normalized to total number of cells. Images were captured with a Jenoptik ProgRes-C14 camera using OpenLab image acquisition software. Distinction between ShcA and Frs2α PTB Domain Interaction with Ret—Our first objective was to understand how residues flanking Tyr(P)-1062 of the RET receptor contribute to the strong binding of either ShcA or Frs2α PTB domains. We used spot synthesis technology to create an array of 12-mer peptides spanning residues 1054-1065 of the short isoform of RET (RET9). In these arrays, which are synthesized on a derivatized cellulose membranes, each residue in the RET peptide is changed, one at a time, to every other amino acid. We probed these RET 12-mer peptide arrays with the PTB domains of either ShcA or Frs2α, fused to the C terminus of GST. For each PTB domain, this approach reveals which amino acids are preferred or selected against at any given position of the RET peptide; this identifies the similarities and differences in the ligand-binding selectivity of the ShcA or Frs2α PTB domains, in the context of the RET Tyr(P)-1062 motif (Fig. 1A). The spot blot arrays confirmed the strict adherence to the PTB interaction consensus, NXXpY, such that substitution of either RET residue Asn-1059 or Tyr(P)-1062 abolished interaction with the PTB domains of both ShcA and Frs2α. In contrast, the replacement of intervening residues (Lys-1060 and Leu-1061) revealed differences between the binding specificities of the two PTB proteins. Selectivity at the -1-position (Leu-1061) was pronounced and showed minimal overlap between ShcA and Frs2α PTB domains. The peptide arrays also suggested different recognition specificities for ShcA and Frs2α extending beyond the canonical NXXpY binding consensus. Replacement of residues both upstream and downstream of the core NXXpY motif was tolerated differently by either PTB domain. For example, Lys at any position within the 12-mer peptide, with the exception of Lys-1060, disfavored interaction with the ShcA PTB domain, which contrasted with the binding observed for Frs2α-PTB. Interestingly, the Frs2α PTB domain interaction was notably compromised by replacement of Trp-1056, which conversely appeared to enhance ShcA-PTB binding (e.g. W1056A and W1056D).

These mutations were initially established in the context of a constitutively active MEN2A (C634R mutation; abbreviated 2aRet) variant of RET in order to facilitate assessment of interaction with ShcA and Frs2α. The panel of RET point mutants were then co-expressed with either GST-tagged ShcA or His6-tagged Frs2α in both HEK293T and COS-7 cells and analyzed for co-precipitation. In agreement with the spot array data, the substitutions W1056A and W1056D augmented association with ShcA to the detriment of Frs2α (Fig. 1B). The mutation E1058D, which we introduced based on ShcA binding to EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3, did not affect binding to either scaffold proteins relative to wild-type RET but proved to be beneficial to ShcA binding at the expense of Frs2α in the conjunction with the W1056A in the double mutant W1056A/E1058D. The RET double mutant W1056A/E1058D, which from hereon we designate as RetShc+, showed a 1.8-fold enhancement of ShcA and a 3.3-fold reduction in Frs2α association as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, C-E, Table 1). None of the mutations made that were predicted to establish a bias for Frs2α association (S1054K, T1055K, I1057K, I1057M, and R1064M) compromised"

Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about Fui1p. Fui1p belongs to the uracil/allantoin permease family (Fur family) of yeast, which also includes Fur4p, Thi10p (thiamine permease), and Dal4p (allantoin permease). Fui1p (629 amino acids, 72 kDa) shares high amino acid identity (50-60%) with the other family members. The predicated topology of Fur4p consists of 10 transmembrane (TM) segments with long N- and C-terminal tails, which have been shown to be intracellular (17Garnier C. Blondel M.O. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is believed that the two-dimensional Fur4p structural model could be extended to all members of the yeast uracil/allantoin permease family (14Pinson B. Chevallier J. Urban-Grimal D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 37-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of amino acid sequences is greatest in the putative TM segments of the four proteins. Based on the high sequence identity of Fur4p and Fui1p, we hypothesized that these two transporters might have similar transport mechanisms and that Fui1p might operate as an electrogenic proton/permeant symporter. Charged amino acid residues in the membrane-spanning regions of transporters are known to play important roles in permeant binding (18Unkles S.E. Rouch D.A. Wang Y. Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D.

Although Fur4p contains three charged amino acid residues in TM regions, only the one located in TM segment 4 (Lys272), which is highly conserved in the uracil/allantoin permease family, was identified as a critical residue involved in uracil binding and translocation (14Pinson B. Chevallier J. Urban-Grimal D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 37-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional importance of the corresponding lysine residue of Fui1p (Lys288) in TM segment 4 and of the only two other charged TM residues (in TM segments 3 and 7) was investigated in this study. In vivo labeling of DNA using nucleosides and nucleoside analogs such as thymidine and 5-bromo-2′-dUrd has long been a cornerstone of replication studies. S. cerevisiae has been used extensively as a model organism in defining the genetic elements required for DNA replication. In the absence of the introduction of heterogeneous nucleoside transporters (e.g. human (h) ENT1) (23Vernis L. Piskur J. Diffley J.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Fui1p is the dominant route that allows entry of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs into S. cerevisiae. Among the nucleoside transporters identified so far from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, only S. cerevisiae Fui1p mediates transport of Urd but not that of other naturally occurring pyrimidine and purine nucleosides, implying a specialized function for Urd in S. cerevisiae. The abundance of Fur4p is determined by extracellular uracil availability by regulation of the efficiency of its ubiquitylation (24Blondel M.O. Morvan J. Dupre S. Urban-Grimal D. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Volland C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fui1p has also been shown to be sorted for early vacuolar degradation in cells exposed to toxic levels of Urd, indicating that extracellular Urd controls Fui1p trafficking and prevents harmful Urd uptake that results in a decrease in growth rate (24Blondel M.O.

Knowledge of the transport mechanism and permeant selectivities of Fui1p will contribute to an understanding of its physiological significance in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, one of the most important model organisms for DNA replication and repair studies. Fui1p orthologs of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata with high sequence identities to Fui1p of S. cerevisiae (>70%) were revealed from contigs (groups of overlapping clones) of the Stanford C. albicans genome sequence data bank and the assembled open reading frame (ORF) data bank of the C. glabrata genome (GenBank™ GI:50287475) (25Dujon B.

One of the most commonly encountered human pathogens, C. albicans causes a wide variety of infections, ranging from superficial disorders in generally healthy individuals to invasive, rapidly fatal systemic infections in individuals with impaired immunity. C. glabrata has emerged as the second causative agent of human candidiasis worldwide and is more resistant to drug therapy than C. albicans. Few classes of drugs are effective against these fungal infections, and drug efficacy is limited by toxicity and side effects. Nucleoside antibiotics such as the nikkomycins and neopolyoxins have been considered as candidate inhibitors of opportunistic candidal infections in AIDS and organ transplant patients (26Kimura K. Bugg T.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 252-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Efforts to develop more effective nucleoside analogs are under way (27Rapp R.P. Pharmacotherapy. 2004; 24 (quiz 29S-32S): 4S-28SCrossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We report here the functional characterization of Fui1p in a double-permease knock-out yeast strain (fur4Δfui1Δ) that enabled us to analyze Fui1p-mediated Urd uptake in an otherwise nucleoside transport-free background. Fui1p transported Urd into yeast with high affinity and high capacity in a protondependent manner. The roles of three charged amino acid residues (Glu259, Lys288, and Asp474) in putative TM segments 3, 4, and 7, as well as the cellular location of the mutant transporters, were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and green fluorescent protein (GFP) and c-Myc tags. Of the three charged residues, only Lys288 was important for the transport capacity of Fui1p. A quantitative inhibitor sensitivity assay was used to gain an understanding of the structural regions of Urd that interact with Fui1p. Because transportability is a potential determinant of the cytotoxic efficacy of nucleoside analog drugs, knowledge of the Urd binding profile of Fui1p will guide the design of novel antifungal nucleoside analogs that may selectively target Fui1p orthologs in pathogenic fungi. Strains and Media—BY4742-YBR021W (MATα, his3, leu2, lys2, ura3, fur4Δ), which contains a disruption in FUR4, the gene encoding the endogenous uracil permease, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used as the parental yeast strain to generate the double-permease knock-out strain fur4Δfui1Δ (previously named fui1::HIS3) by deleting FUI1 using the PCR-mediated one-step gene disruption method as described previously (28Zhang J. Smith K.M. Tackaberry T. Visser F. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P. Nowak I. Karpinski E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Other strains were generated by transformation of the yeast-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pYPGE15 (29Brunelli J.P. Pall M.L. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) into fur4Δfui1Δ using a standard lithium acetate method (30Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains were maintained in complete minimal medium (CMM) containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), amino acids (as required to maintain auxotrophic selection), and 2% glucose (CMM/Glc). Agar plates contained CMM with various supplements and 2% agar (Difco). Plasmids were propagated in E. coli strain TOP10F′ (Invitrogen) and maintained in Luria broth with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Plasmid Construction—All oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. For S. cerevisiae expression, the FUI1 ORFs were amplified from vector pYSE2-FUI1 (6Vickers M.F. Yao S.Y.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25931-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by PCR methodology using primers 5′-XbaI-FUI1 (5′-CTG TCT AGA ATG CCG GTA TCT GAT TCT GGA TTC-3′, with the restriction site underlined) and 3′-XhoI-FUI1 (5′-CGA CTC GAG TTA GAT ATA TCG TAT CTT TTC ATA GC-3′). For construction of c-Myc-tagged Fui1p, the c-Myc tag (CAG ATC CTC TTC TGA GAT GAG TTT TTG TTC) was introduced into primer 3′-XhoI-FUI1. For Xenopus oocyte expression, primers 5′-BamHI-FUI1 (5′-GTC GGA TCC ATG CCG GTA TCT GAT TCT GGA TTC-3′) and 3′-XbaI-FUI1 (5′-CGA TCT AGA TTA GAT ATA TCG TAT CTT TTC ATA G-3′) were used. To construct GFP-tagged Fui1p, the ORF of FUI1 without a stop codon was first amplified using forward primer 5′-XbaI-FUI1 and a reverse primer containing (3′ to 5′) 21 bases with homology to FUI1 and a unique tag sequence complementary to the first 50 nucleotides of the ORF of GFP. C-terminally GFP-tagged Fui1p was obtained by overlapping PCR using the product of the first run PCR and the pGFPuv vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as templates and 5′-XbaI-FUI1 and 3′-KpnI-GFP (5′-CTG GGT ACC CTA TTT GTA GAG CTC ATC CAT GCC) as primers. GFP-ORF was also amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-XbaI-GFP (5′-CGT TCT AGA ATG GCC AGC AAA GGA GAA CTT-3′) and reverse primer 3′-EcoRI-GFP (5′-CGT GAA TTC CTA TTT GTA GAG CTC ATC CAT GCC). The amplified ORFs were inserted into pYPGE15 (a high copy number episomal yeast vector that expresses the inserted DNA constitutively under the transcriptional control of the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter) to generate pYPFUI1, pYP-FUI1-GFP, and pYPGFP or into the Xenopus expression vector pGEM-HE to generate pGEFUI1. pYPFUI1-K288A, pYPFUI1-K288E, pYPFUI1-K288R, pYPFUI1-E259A, pYPFUI1-D474A, and pYPFUI1-E259A,D474A and the corresponding GFP- and c-Myc-tagged versions were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The PCRs were performed using Pwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI PRISM 310 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Nucleoside Transport in S. cerevisiae—The uptake of [3H]Urd or 5-[3H]fluorouridine (FUrd; Moravek Biochemicals Inc., Brea, CA) into logarithmically proliferating yeast cells was measured using a cell harvester as described previously (31Zhang J. Visser F. Vickers M.F. Lang T. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P. Nowak I. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Visser F.

Yeast cells containing pYPFUI1, pYPFUI1-GFP, or individual mutant transporters were grown in CMM/Glc to A600 = 0.7-0.9, washed twice with fresh medium, and resuspended to A600 = 4.0. Uptake assays were performed at room temperature at pH 4.5 unless specified otherwise by adding 50-μl portions of yeast suspensions to 50-μl portions of twice concentrated 3H-labeled nucleoside in CMM/Glc in 96-well microtiter plates. Yeast cells were collected on filter mats using a Micro96 cell harvester (Skatron Instruments, Lier, Norway) and rapidly washed with deionized water. The individual filter circles corresponding to wells of the microtiter plates were removed from filter mats and transferred to vials for scintillation counting. The binding of Urd and its analogs to recombinant Fui1p was assessed by measuring their abilities to inhibit inward transport of 1 μm [3H]Urd in an “inhibitor sensitivity” assay as follows. Yeast cells producing Fui1p were incubated with 1 μm [3H]Urd for 30 s in the absence or presence of graded concentrations of Urd or Urd analogs. The 30-s exposures to [3H]Urd were shown in time course experiments to be sufficient to provide true initial rates of uptake into yeast cells, thereby providing rates of transport across plasma membranes rather than rates of intracellular metabolism (see Fig. 1, upper panel). Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Nonspecific radioactivity was determined in the presence of 10 mm nonradioactive Urd, and these values were subtracted from total uptake values. Data were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software (Version 3.0; GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) to obtain IC50 values (concentrations that inhibited reactions by 50%) for Urd and Urd analogs. Ki (inhibitory constant) values were determined from the Cheng-Prusoff equation (33Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar) and the Km values for Urd. Gibbs free energy (ΔG°) was calculated from ΔG° =-RT ln(Ki), where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. The thermodynamic stability of transporter-inhibitor complexes was quantitatively estimated from ΔG° as described (34De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Acta Trop. 2001; 80: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Measurements of Fui1p-induced H+ Currents and H+/Urd Coupling Ratios—pGEFUI1 was linearized with NheI and transcribed with T7 polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHI-NE™ transcription system (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). In vitro synthesized transcripts were injected into isolated mature stage VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis as described previously (35Smith K.M. Ng A.M.L. Yao S.Y.M. Labedz K.A. Knaus E.E. Wiebe L.I. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Chen X.-Z. Karpinski E. Young J.D. J. Physiol. 2004; 558: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mock-injected oocytes were injected with water alone. Electrophysiological studies used transport medium in which choline was substituted for sodium, i.e. 100 mm choline chloride (ChCl), 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (for pH values >6.5) or 10 mm MES (for pH values ≤6.5). Proton dependence was tested in ChCl-containing transport medium at pH 4.5-8.5. Urd-induced membrane currents were measured in Fui1p-producing oocytes at room temperature (20 °C) using a GeneClamp 500B oocyte clamp (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in the two-electrode voltage-clamp mode as described previously (35Smith K.M. Ng A.M.L. Yao S.Y.M. Labedz K.A. Knaus E.E. Wiebe L.I. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Chen X.-Z. Karpinski E. Young J.D. J. Physiol. 2004; 558: 807-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and interfaced to an IBM-compatible PC via a Digidata 1200A/D converter and controlled by pCLAMP software (Version 8.0; Axon Instruments). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances that ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 mΩ megaohms. Oocytes were penetrated with the microelectrodes, and their membrane potentials were monitored for periods of 10-15 min. Oocytes were discarded when membrane potentials were unstable or more positive than -30 mV. The oocyte membrane potential was clamped at a holding potential of -50 mV, and Urd was added in the appropriate transport medium. Current signals were filtered at 20 Hz (four-pole Bessel filter) and sampled at intervals of 20 ms. For data presentation, the signals were further filtered at 0.5 Hz by the pCLAMP program suite. The H+/Urd coupling ratio for Fui1p was determined by simultaneously measuring H+ currents and uptake of [14C]Urd (200 μm, 1 μCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) under voltage-clamp conditions. Individual Fui1p-producing oocytes were placed in a perfusion chamber and voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -50 mV in sodium-free (100 mm ChCl) and nucleoside-free medium (pH 5.5) for a 10-min period to monitor base-line currents. When the base line was stable, the nucleoside-free medium was exchanged with medium of the same composition containing [14C]Urd. Current was measured for 2 min, and uptake was terminated by washing the oocyte with nucleoside-free medium until the current returned to the base line. The oocyte was then transferred to a scintillation vial and solubilized with 1% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of oocyte-associated radioactivity. Urd-induced current was calculated as the difference between base-line current and total inward current. The total charge translocated into the oocyte during the uptake period was calculated from the current-time integral and correlated with the measured radiolabeled flux for each oocyte to determine the charge/uptake ratio. Basal [14C]Urd uptake was determined in control water-injected oocytes (from the same donor frog) under equivalent conditions and used to correct for endogenous non-mediated nucleoside uptake over the same incubation period. Coupling ratios (±S.E.) were calculated from slopes of least-squares fits of Urd-dependent charge versus Urd accumulation in oocytes. Confocal Microscopy of Yeast—Logarithmically growing yeast cells transformed with a GFP-tagged vector (10 μm, A600 = 0.7-0.9) were mixed with 30 μl of anti-fading mounting medium, smeared on a glass slide, and checked for green fluorescence using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Confocal images were collected using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope with a 63 × 1.4 objective (Plan-Apochromat) using a frame size of 512 × 512 pixels with a pixel resolution of 0.08 μm and a pixel depth of 8 bits. Isolation of Plasma Membranes and Immunoblotting—Yeast membranes were fractionated on sucrose gradients as described (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of yeast cells at A600 = 1 was collected, washed with sucrose breaking buffer (0.4 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) containing additional protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science), and lysed by vortexing in the presence of glass beads (425-600 μm; Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed from lysates by centrifugation at 500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation of lysates at 21,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The resulting crude membrane pellets were resuspended in sucrose breaking buffer containing protease inhibitors. The crude membranes were layered onto a stepwise sucrose gradient (0.4, 1.1, 1.65, and 2.25 m sucrose) containing 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and protein inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 80,000 × g (Beckman SW 41 Ti rotor) for 14 h at 4 °C, fractions of band 3 from the top, which contained enriched plasma membranes, were collected and resuspended with sucrose breaking buffer containing protease inhibitors. After centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, the pellets were dissolved with sucrose breaking buffer, and the proteins present in the membranes were separated electrophoretically and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (31Zhang J. Visser F. Vickers M.F. Lang T. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P. Nowak I. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used in immunoblotting were monoclonal antibodies against the c-Myc epitope tag (9E10; BAbCo, Richmond, CA), against Pma1 (plasma membrane marker; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), against Dpm1p (dolichol phosphate mannose synthase endoplasmic reticulum membrane marker; Invitrogen), and against the V-ATPase 100-kDa subunit (vacuole membrane marker; Invitrogen). The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography on a film. The film was scanned, and the quantities of the proteins were evaluated using ImageQuant software (Version 5.2; GE Healthcare). Urd Analogs—The structures of Urd and its analogs were given previously (31Zhang J. Visser F. Vickers M.F. Lang T. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P. Nowak I. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Urd analogs used in this study were either obtained from R.I. Chemical, Inc. (Orange, CA) or synthesized as described previously (31Zhang J. Visser F. Vickers M.F. Lang T. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P. Nowak I. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of test compounds were prepared in water or Me2SO (Sigma), and the final concentration of Me2SO in transport reactions was 0.1% when Me2SO was used as a solvent. The fur4Δfui1Δ yeast strain with or without pYPGE15 has no active uptake of Urd as described previously (28Zhang J. Smith K.M. Tackaberry T. Visser F. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P. Nowak I. Karpinski E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At pH 4.5, the uptake of 1 μm [3H]Urd into fur4Δfui1Δ yeast containing pYPFUI1 was rapid and linear over 90 s, with a mean rate (±S.E.) of 285 ± 5 pmol/mg of protein/s (Fig. 1, upper panel). This rate was reduced to 0.3 ± 0.1 pmol/mg of protein/s in the presence of 10 mm nonradioactive Urd, indicating the presence of functional Fui1p in yeast plasma membranes. Urd uptake rates were determined for all subsequent"
https://openalex.org/W2061266943,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDK1-4) are the molecular switch that down-regulates activity of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex through reversible phosphorylation. We showed previously that binding of the lipoyl domain 2 (L2) of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex to PDK3 induces a cross-tail conformation in PDK3, resulting in an opening of the active site cleft and the stimulation of kinase activity. In the present study, we report that alanine substitutions of Leu-140, Glu-170, and Glu-179 in L2 markedly reduce binding affinities of these L2 mutants for PDK3. Unlike wildtype L2, binding of these L2 mutants to PDK3 does not preferentially reduce the affinity of PDK3 for ADP over ATP. The inefficient removal of product inhibition associated with ADP accounts for the decreased stimulation of PDK3 activity by these L2 variants. Serial truncations of the PDK3 C-terminal tail region either impede or abolish the binding of wild-type L2 to the PDK3 mutants, resulting in the reduction or absence of L2-enhanced kinase activity. Alanine substitutions of residues Leu-27, Phe-32, Phe-35, and Phe-48 in the lipoyl-binding pocket of PDK3 similarly nullify L2 binding and L2-stimulated PDK3 activity. Our results indicate that the above residues in L2 and residues in the C-terminal region and the lipoyl-binding pocket of PDK3 are critical determinants for the cross-talk between L2 and PDK3, which up-regulates PDK3 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1983860153,"The R2 protein of class I ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) generates and stores a tyrosyl radical, located next to a diferric iron center, which is essential for ribonucleotide reduction and thus DNA synthesis. X-ray structures of class Ia and Ib proteins from various organisms served as bases for detailed mechanistic suggestions. The active site tyrosine in R2F of class Ib RNR of Salmonella typhimurium is located at larger distance to the diiron site, and shows a different side chain orientation, as compared with the tyrosine in R2 of class Ia RNR from Escherichia coli. No structural information has been available for the active tyrosyl radical in R2F. Here we report on high field EPR experiments of single crystals of R2F from S. typhimurium, containing the radical Tyr-105*. Full rotational pattern of the spectra were recorded, and the orientation of the g-tensor axes were determined, which directly reflect the orientation of the radical Tyr-105* in the crystal frame. Comparison with the orientation of the reduced tyrosine Tyr-105-OH from the x-ray structure reveals a rotation of the tyrosyl side chain, which reduces the distance between the tyrosyl radical and the nearest iron ligands toward similar values as observed earlier for Tyr-122* in E. coli R2. Presence of the substrate binding subunit R1E did not change the EPR spectra of Tyr-105*, indicating that binding of R2E alone induces no structural change of the diiron site. The present study demonstrates that structural and functional information about active radical states can be obtained by combining x-ray and high-field-EPR crystallography."
https://openalex.org/W2104459135,"The membrane-bound closed state of the colicin E1 channel domain was investigated by site-directed fluorescence labeling using a bimane fluorophore attached to each single cysteine residue within helix 2 of each mutant protein. The fluorescence properties of the bimane fluorophore were measured for the membrane-associated form of the closed channel and included fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence anisotropy, apparent polarity, surface accessibility, and membrane bilayer penetration depth. The fluorescence data show that helix 2 is an amphipathic α-helix that is situated parallel to the membrane surface, but it is less deeply embedded within the bilayer interfacial region than is helix 1 in the closed channel. A least squares fit of the various data sets to a harmonic wave function indicated that the periodicity and angular frequency for helix 2 in the membrane-bound state are typical for an amphipathic α-helix (3.8 ± 0.1 residues per turn and 94 ± 4°, respectively) that is located at an interfacial region of a membrane bilayer. Dual quencher analysis also revealed that helix 2 is peripherally membrane associated, with one face of the helix dipping into the interfacial region of the lipid bilayer and the other face projecting outwardly into the aqueous solvent. Finally, our data show that helices 1 and 2 remain independent helices upon membrane association with a short connector link (Tyr363–Gly364) and that short amphipathic α-helices participate in the formation of a lipid-dependent, toroidal pore for this colicin."
