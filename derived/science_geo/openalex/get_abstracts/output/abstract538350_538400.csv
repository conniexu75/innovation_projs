https://openalex.org/W1874466506,"Somatic stem cells contribute to tissue ontogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration through sequential processes. Systematic molecular analysis of stem cell behavior is challenging because classic approaches cannot resolve cellular heterogeneity or capture developmental dynamics. Here we provide a comprehensive resource of single-cell transcriptomes of adult hippocampal quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) and their immediate progeny. We further developed Waterfall, a bioinformatic pipeline, to statistically quantify singe-cell gene expression along a de novo reconstructed continuous developmental trajectory. Our study reveals molecular signatures of adult qNSCs, characterized by active niche signaling integration and low protein translation capacity. Our analyses further delineate molecular cascades underlying qNSC activation and neurogenesis initiation, exemplified by decreased extrinsic signaling capacity, primed translational machinery, and regulatory switches in transcription factors, metabolism, and energy sources. Our study reveals the molecular continuum underlying adult neurogenesis and illustrates how Waterfall can be used for single-cell omics analyses of various continuous biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1787222452,"Infections are associated with extensive platelet consumption, representing a high risk for health. However, the mechanism coordinating the rapid regeneration of the platelet pool during such stress conditions remains unclear. Here, we report that the phenotypic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment contains stem-like megakaryocyte-committed progenitors (SL-MkPs), a cell population that shares many features with multipotent HSCs and serves as a lineage-restricted emergency pool for inflammatory insults. During homeostasis, SL-MkPs are maintained in a primed but quiescent state, thus contributing little to steady-state megakaryopoiesis. Even though lineage-specific megakaryocyte transcripts are expressed, protein synthesis is suppressed. In response to acute inflammation, SL-MkPs become activated, resulting in megakaryocyte protein production from pre-existing transcripts and a maturation of SL-MkPs and other megakaryocyte progenitors. This results in an efficient replenishment of platelets that are lost during inflammatory insult. Thus, our study reveals an emergency machinery that counteracts life-threatening platelet depletions during acute inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1564678055,"Host defense against viruses and intracellular parasites depends on effector CD8(+) T cells, whose optimal clonal expansion, differentiation, and memory properties require signals from CD4(+) T cells. Here, we addressed the role of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in initial activation of the two T cell types and their co-operation. Surprisingly, initial priming of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells was spatially segregated within the lymph node and occurred on different DCs with temporally distinct patterns of antigen presentation via MHCI versus MHCII molecules. DCs that co-present antigen via both MHC molecules were detected at a later stage; these XCR1(+) DCs are the critical platform involved in CD4(+) T cell augmentation of CD8(+) T cell responses. These findings delineate the complex choreography of cellular interactions underlying effective cell-mediated anti-viral responses, with implications for basic DC subset biology, as well as for translational application to the development of vaccines that evoke optimal T cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W1891667186,"The breakthrough of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has raised the possibility that patient-specific iPSCs may become a renewable source of autologous cells for cell therapy without the concern of immune rejection. However, the immunogenicity of autologous human iPSC (hiPSC)-derived cells is not well understood. Using a humanized mouse model (denoted Hu-mice) reconstituted with a functional human immune system, we demonstrate that most teratomas formed by autologous integration-free hiPSCs exhibit local infiltration of antigen-specific T cells and associated tissue necrosis, indicating immune rejection of certain hiPSC-derived cells. In this context, autologous hiPSC-derived smooth muscle cells (SMCs) appear to be highly immunogenic, while autologous hiPSC-derived retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are immune tolerated even in non-ocular locations. This differential immunogenicity is due in part to abnormal expression of immunogenic antigens in hiPSC-derived SMCs, but not in hiPSC-derived RPEs. These findings support the feasibility of developing hiPSC-derived RPEs for treating macular degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1637819512,"Classical theories of associative memory model CA3 as a homogeneous attractor network because of its strong recurrent circuitry. However, anatomical gradients suggest a functional diversity along the CA3 transverse axis. We examined the neural population coherence along this axis, when the local and global spatial reference frames were put in conflict with each other. Proximal CA3 (near the dentate gyrus), where the recurrent collaterals are the weakest, showed degraded representations, similar to the pattern separation shown by the dentate gyrus. Distal CA3 (near CA2), where the recurrent collaterals are the strongest, maintained coherent representations in the conflict situation, resembling the classic attractor network system. CA2 also maintained coherent representations. This dissociation between proximal and distal CA3 provides strong evidence that the recurrent collateral system underlies the associative network functions of CA3, with a separate role of proximal CA3 in pattern separation."
https://openalex.org/W1779226031,"We asked whether the structural heterogeneity of the hippocampal CA3-CA2 axis is reflected in how space is mapped onto place cells in CA3-CA2. Place fields were smaller and sharper in proximal CA3 than in distal CA3 and CA2. The proximodistal shift was accompanied by a progressive loss in the ability of place cells to distinguish configurations of the same spatial environment, as well as a reduction in the extent to which place cells formed uncorrelated representations for different environments. The transition to similar representations was nonlinear, with the sharpest drop in distal CA3. These functional changes along the CA3-CA2 axis mirror gradients in gene expression and connectivity that partly override cytoarchitectonic boundaries between the subfields of the hippocampus. The results point to the CA3-CA2 axis as a functionally graded system with powerful pattern separation at the proximal end, near the dentate gyrus, and stronger pattern completion at the CA2 end."
https://openalex.org/W2239399748,"C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) are an emerging family of pattern recognition receptors that recognizes pathogens or damaged tissue to trigger innate immune responses. However, endogenous ligands for CLRs are not fully understood. In this study, we sought to identify an endogenous ligand(s) for human macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (hMincle). A particular fraction of lipid extracts from liver selectively activated reporter cells expressing hMincle. MS analysis determined the chemical structure of the active component as cholesterol. Purified cholesterol in plate-coated and crystalized forms activates reporter cells expressing hMincle but not murine Mincle (mMincle). Cholesterol crystals are known to activate immune cells and induce inflammatory responses through lysosomal damage. However, direct innate immune receptors for cholesterol crystals have not been identified. Murine macrophages transfected with hMincle responded to cholesterol crystals by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Human dendritic cells expressed a set of inflammatory genes in response to cholesterol crystals, and this was inhibited by anti-human Mincle. Importantly, other related CLRs did not bind cholesterol crystals, whereas other steroids were not recognized by hMincle. These results suggest that cholesterol crystals are an endogenous ligand for hMincle and that they activate innate immune responses."

Here, we examine the lineage relationship among MGE-derived interneurons using a replication-defective retroviral library containing a highly diverse set of DNA barcodes. Recovering the barcodes from the mature progeny of infected progenitor cells enabled us to unambiguously determine their respective lineal relationship. We found that clonal dispersion occurs across large areas of the brain and is not restricted by anatomical divisions. As such, sibling interneurons can populate the cortex, hippocampus striatum, and globus pallidus. The majority of interneurons appeared to be generated from asymmetric divisions of MGE progenitor cells, followed by symmetric divisions within the subventricular zone.

As such, it is likely that clonally related interneurons have considerable flexibility as to the particular forebrain circuits to which they can contribute. Understanding the principles by which brain circuits are constructed is a fundamental goal in developmental neuroscience. The assembly of complex brain circuitry begins with the generation of prescribed cell types from what are thought to be stereotyped lineages. While neuronal lineages have been well documented in invertebrates (Kohwi and Doe, 2013Kohwi M. Doe C.Q. Temporal fate specification and neural progenitor competence during development.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2013; 14: 823-838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the relationships between progenitors and their progeny are less clear in vertebrates. Over 25 years ago, a retroviral lineage approach was developed that provided the means to identify lineages within different areas of the central nervous system (CNS) (Golden et al., 1995Golden J.A. Fields-Berry S.C. Cepko C.L. Construction and characterization of a highly complex retroviral library for lineage analysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Widespread dispersion of neuronal clones across functional regions of the cerebral cortex.Science. 1992; 255: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These efforts provided the first indications that lineages within the cortex do not necessarily result from a precisely orchestrated transposition of cells from the proliferative zone to post-mitotic areas. Following these original studies, a number of methods have been developed that allow for the directed labeling and tracking of progenitors from discrete proliferative zones (Ciceri et al., 2013Ciceri G. Dehorter N. Sols I. Huang Z.J. Maravall M. Marín O. Lineage-specific laminar organization of cortical GABAergic interneurons.Nat.

In the cortex, the use of these methods indicates that pyramidal cell migration is more radially coherent than was previously thought. While some degree of dispersion occurs, the majority of clones populate columns and even participate functionally in common circuits as predicted by Rakic’s “protomap” hypothesis (Rakic, 1988Rakic P. Specification of cerebral cortical areas.Science. 1988; 241: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar). A similar understanding of the subpallial-derived interneuron lineages has yet to be achieved. Work from several laboratories, including our own, has demonstrated that inhibitory interneuron populations are entirely derived from the subpallium (reviewed in Fishell and Rudy, 2011Fishell G. Rudy B. Mechanisms of inhibition within the telencephalon: “where the wild things are”.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 535-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar; Figure 1A), most prominently from the medial and caudal ganglionic eminences (medial ganglionic eminence [MGE] and CGE, respectively). In mice, the MGE produces 70% of all cortical interneurons and the entirety of both the parvalbumin and somatostatin populations, not only within the cortex (Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J.B. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) but also in the associated hippocampus (Tricoire et al., 2011Tricoire L. Pelkey K.A. Erkkila B.E. Jeffries B.W. Yuan X. McBain C.J. A blueprint for the spatiotemporal origins of mouse hippocampal interneuron diversity.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 10948-10970Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), as well as in subpallial structures, such as the striatum (Marin et al., 2000Marin O. Anderson S.A. Rubenstein J.L. Origin and molecular specification of striatal interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and amygdala nuclei (Nery et al., 2002Nery S. Fishell G. Corbin J.G. The caudal ganglionic eminence is a source of distinct cortical and subcortical cell populations.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Two recent studies have attempted to connect the lineage relationship of MGE-derived interneurons to their cell type and position (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.-H. Tan X. Zhang X.-J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D. Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Ciceri et al., 2013Ciceri G. Dehorter N. Sols I. Huang Z.J. Maravall M. Marín O. Lineage-specific laminar organization of cortical GABAergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These groups used mouse genetics to specifically label interneuron progenitor cells in the MGE with fluorescently tagged retroviruses. Their results suggested that interneurons arising from a common progenitor preferentially form clusters within either cortical layers and/or columns. An inherent limitation of this approach is that dispersed interneurons labeled with the same fluorophore were assumed ab initio to be derived from independent clones. To overcome this drawback, we have reinvestigated this question using a barcoded GFP-expressing retroviral library (Golden et al., 1995Golden J.A. Fields-Berry S.C. Cepko C.L. Construction and characterization of a highly complex retroviral library for lineage analysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), restricted in its infection to progenitor cells of the MGE that express the avian virus receptor, TVA, as dictated by a Cre-dependent TVA reporter allele (Seidler et al., 2008Seidler B. Schmidt A. Mayr U. Nakhai H. Schmid R.M. Schneider G. Saur D. A Cre-loxP-based mouse model for conditional somatic gene expression and knockdown in vivo by using avian retroviral vectors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 10137-10142Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To our considerable surprise, while a minority of clones were found to be densely clustered, the majority of MGE clones dispersed over large areas, both within and across telencephalic structures. Complementing these efforts, we analyzed the acute dispersion of clones using both retroviral and MADM (mosaic analysis with double markers) approaches in the context of short-survival periods. These experiments indicated that most MGE lineages originate from radial glia progenitors in the MGE ventricular zone (VZ) and can be locally amplified in the subventricular zone (SVZ). We conclude that while sibling interneurons may occasionally form coherent clusters, the final positions of clonally related interneurons are generally not constrained by lineal relationships. To identify the cortical interneuron populations produced by individual MGE progenitor cells, we used ultrasound-backscatter microscopy (UBM)-guided microinjection to inject a retroviral library into the lateral ventricles of transgenic E10.5–E12.5 embryos, the beginning of the peak phase of interneuron neurogenesis in this region (Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J.B. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar; Figures 1A and 1B). The viral library encodes GFP and contains approximately 105 random 24-bp oligonucleotide tags (barcodes). To retrieve barcodes, infected cells can be identified by GFP and collected from brain sections by laser capture microdissecion (LCM). Due to the high complexity of the library, and the relatively low number of clones, cells sharing the same barcode are almost certainly siblings (Golden et al., 1995Golden J.A. Fields-Berry S.C. Cepko C.L. Construction and characterization of a highly complex retroviral library for lineage analysis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 5704-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Fuentealba et al., 2015Fuentealba L.C. Rompani S.B. Parraguez J.I. Obernier K. Romero R. Cepko C.L. Alvarez-Buylla A. Embryonic origin of postnatal neural stem cells.Cell. 2015; 161: 1644-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The retroviral library used here was pseudotyped with the ASLV-A envelope glycoprotein (EnvA), which restricts infection to cells expressing the cognate avian virus receptor for this glycoprotein, TVA (Bates et al., 1993Bates P. Young J.A.T. Varmus H.E. A receptor for subgroup A Rous sarcoma virus is related to the low density lipoprotein receptor.Cell. 1993; 74: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We conditionally expressed TVA in mitotic cells of the MGE by crossing an MGE-specific transgenic Cre driver line (Nkx2.1-Cre; Xu et al., 2008Xu Q. Tam M. Anderson S.A. Fate mapping Nkx2.1-lineage cells in the mouse telencephalon.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) with R26-TVAiLacZ (Seidler et al., 2008Seidler B. Schmidt A. Mayr U. Nakhai H. Schmid R.M. Schneider G. Saur D. A Cre-loxP-based mouse model for conditional somatic gene expression and knockdown in vivo by using avian retroviral vectors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 10137-10142Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) mice. As predicted, 2 to 3 days after the injection of the retroviral library, isolated radially oriented clusters of GFP-expressing cells were observed in the VZ of the MGE, but not in other progenitor zones of the subpallium or neocortex (Figure 1C). No GFP labeling was observed in the brains of animals that did not encode TVA (Nkx2.1+/+;R26LSL-TVAiLacZ/+ littermates; data not shown). To study the distribution and fate of cells derived from Nkx2.1-Cre expressing cells, Nkx2.1Cre/+;R26LSL-TVAiLacZ/+ embryos were injected with the retroviral library at E10.5 and sacrificed at P16, by which time migration of interneurons is largely complete (Corbin et al., 2001Corbin J.G. Nery S. Fishell G. Telencephalic cells take a tangent: non-radial migration in the mammalian forebrain.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). At P16, GFP-positive neurons were found in a variety of regions throughout the telencephalon (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1), including the neocortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, globus pallidus, hypothalamus, and septum, as well as in oligodendrocytes of subcortical structures, consistent with the findings from Nkx2.1 genetic fate-mapping studies (Kessaris et al., 2006Kessaris N. Fogarty M. Iannarelli P. Grist M. Wegner M. Richardson W.D. Competing waves of oligodendrocytes in the forebrain and postnatal elimination of an embryonic lineage.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2008Xu Q. Tam M. Anderson S.A. Fate mapping Nkx2.1-lineage cells in the mouse telencephalon.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The barcodes from 47–90 (61 ± 14; n = 3; Figure 2A) GFP-positive neurons were sequenced per brain. 44% (±16%; n = 3) of the analyzed neurons carried a unique barcode, indicating that they were either single-cell clones or that we failed to sample a sibling cell. 56% (±16%, n = 3; Figure 2A) of the barcodes, however, were members of multi-cell clones, ranging in size from two sibling cells (by far the majority; 52% ± 14%; n = 3), up to six sibling cells (12% ± 12%; n = 3; Figure 2B). To systematically examine the distribution of clonally related interneurons (i.e., neurons with identical barcodes), the Cartesian coordinates of neurons with recovered barcodes were determined for the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and globus pallidus. More than 50% of GFP-labeled multi-cellular clones were located in the cortex (61% ± 20% cortex; Figure S2; 7% ± 6% hippocampus, 3% ± 6% striatum; n = 3; Figure 2C). Strikingly, a number of clonally related neurons were not restricted to only one structure; rather, they were distributed across anatomically and functionally distinct regions of the forebrain. For example, some clones populated the cortex and hippocampus (20% ± 3%, n = 3), the cortex and striatum (6% ± 6%, n = 3) or the cortex and globus pallidus (2% ± 3%, n = 3; Figure 2C). By contrast, clones of the telencephalon did not share barcodes with clones in the hypothalamus or contralateral hemisphere, indicating that MGE-derived neurons are restricted to the ipsilateral telencephalon (data not shown). Moreover, identical barcodes were very rarely recovered within different retrovirally infected brains, indicating that the complexity of the library is sufficient to unambiguously resolve lineage relationships. In an attempt to assess the subtype identity of infected neurons, we did immunocytochemical analysis in a subset of clones analyzed. In accordance with previous findings (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.-H. Tan X. Zhang X.-J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D. Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Ciceri et al., 2013Ciceri G. Dehorter N. Sols I. Huang Z.J. Maravall M. Marín O. Lineage-specific laminar organization of cortical GABAergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the existence of clones consisting of entirely parvalbumin-positive clones, as well as of mixed parvalbumin-positive and parvalbumin-negative clones (presumably the majority of the later were somatostatin neurons [Miyoshi et al., 2007Miyoshi G. Butt S.J.B. Takebayashi H. Fishell G. Physiologically distinct temporal cohorts of cortical interneurons arise from telencephalic Olig2-expressing precursors.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 7786-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]), were observed (Figure S3). If the lineage relationship contributed to the functional organization of inhibitory interneurons within the mammalian neocortex, one would expect that interneuron clones would reside in close proximity and within similar functional units of the cortex (Yu et al., 2009Yu Y.-C. Bultje R.S. Wang X. Shi S.-H. Specific synapses develop preferentially among sister excitatory neurons in the neocortex.Nature. 2009; 458: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To test whether clonally related interneurons settle within focal areas, we calculated the Euclidean distances between pairs of sibling cells within brain structures (Figure 3A) and analyzed their distribution (Figure 3B). Pairs of clonally related neurons were on average almost 2,000 μm apart (1,947 ± 1,274 μm; n = 49 pairs of neurons), and only 8% of the pairs were located within 500 μm of each other. The average distance between clonally related cells was 1,885 μm (± 1,132 μm; n = 20 clones) in the cortex, 1,517 μm (± 554 μm; n = 5 clones) in the hippocampus, and 982 μm (± 495 μm; n = 3 clones; Figure 3C) in the striatum. This analysis shows that sibling interneurons reside in a volume that exceeds functional cortical units, such as whisker barrels of the somatosensory cortex (400 μm; Bruno et al., 2003Bruno R.M. Khatri V. Land P.W. Simons D.J. Thalamocortical angular tuning domains within individual barrels of rat somatosensory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9565-9574PubMed Google Scholar, Mountcastle, 2003Mountcastle V.B. Introduction. Computation in cortical columns.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 2-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we asked whether lineal relationship predicts the position of sibling cells within the cortex, hippocampus, or striatum. We reasoned that if this was the case, then clonally related neurons should preferentially be clustered compared to members of unrelated interneuron lineages. To test this, we examined the lineage relationship of localized clusters. We first grouped GFP-labeled neurons, regardless of their lineage by their proximity and displayed the results in dendrograms (Figures 3D and S4). We then labeled the neurons according to their lineage relationship (i.e., barcode identity). Fourteen out of 27 clones did not form isolated clusters. The isolated clonal clusters that we did observe (Figures 3D and 3E; #2, #7, #8, #11, #16, #21, #22, #24, #25, #26, #28, and #30) were mainly two-cell clusters, of which five (clone #2, #11, #25, #26, and #31) had additional sister cells outside the isolated cluster (splitting). The average distance between isolated clonally related cells (splitting cells not included) was 869 μm (± 593 μm; n = 13 cluster; Figure 3E). Next, we included single-cell barcodes (i.e., neurons with unique barcodes) into the analysis to increase the pool of interneurons and calculated the nearest-neighbor distance (NND) and the average distance (AD) between pairs of neurons. As expected, the NND of unrelated neurons was significantly smaller (560 ± 337 μm; n = 185 interneuron pairs) than that of sibling neurons (1,550 ± 965 μm; n = 84; p < 0.0001; Figure 2E). Strikingly, there was no significant difference in the AD between pairs of sibling neurons and pairs of unrelated neurons (1,498 ± 617.5 μm; n = 17; versus 1,723 ± 1,027 μm; n = 28; p = 0.8; Figure 3F). Furthermore, no significant difference was detected between the NND and the AD of clones (Figure 3F), indicating that splitting of clonal clusters into two or more clusters is not a common mode of organization. Grouping members of clones according to their proximity into dendrograms resulted in only five isolated clusters when single-cell barcodes were included in the analysis (Figure S4). In interpreting the significance of our findings, it is essential to determine the mode of cell division that progenitors undergo after retroviral labeling. We examined the lineages of newly post-mitotic interneurons within selected samples of GFP-positive cells in the VZ and SVZ, 2 to 3 days post-infection with the retroviral library. Because individual cells within dense clusters of GFP-positive cells could not be separated using LCM, cells were captured as groups. PCR fragments harboring the barcodes were subcloned into plasmids and transformed into competent bacterial cells. Sequencing the barcodes of multiple bacterial colonies allowed an estimation of the number of barcodes per cluster and the identification of their sequence. Figure 4B shows representative images illustrating the clonal organization within the MGE. Similar to published observations (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.-H. Tan X. Zhang X.-J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D. Anderson S.A. et al.Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.Science. 2011; 334: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), we found evidence for radially aligned clones, with one cell touching the ventricular surface and additional cells being symmetrically aligned in close vicinity (Figures 4B1 and 4B2; n = 6), likely demonstrating asymmetrical progenitor divisions (Figure 4A; Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N.

We also found monoclonal clusters in the SVZ that were often attached to radial glia fibers (Figures 4B3 and 4B4; n = 9), suggesting that symmetrical terminal divisions occur in the SVZ (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N. Chen S. Han Z. Lu C.-H. Tan X. Zhang X.-J. Ding L. Lopez-Cruz A. Saur D.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). With increasing distance from the ventricular surface, clonal boundaries became indistinct and were impossible to predict. Patches of laser-captured tissue from these samples contained multiple cells with multiple barcodes (Figure 4B5; n = 9). At this stage, cells were not attached to radial glia fibers, likely indicating the mixing of distinct lineages as a result of the migration of neuronal precursor cells. We did not find evidence for shared barcodes between radial glia, and we also did not observe symmetric radial glial divisions. Taken together, our results suggest that clonal dispersion throughout the forebrain arises from asymmetrical progenitor divisions, accompanied by symmetrical terminal divisions within the SVZ. To independently assess the mode of divisions within MGE progenitors at this developmental stage, we analyzed clones at different time points using the MADM method (Zong et al., 2005Zong H.

Mosaic analysis with double markers in mice.Cell. 2005; 121: 479-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), which provides single-cell resolution of progenitor division pattern. A key MADM feature is the ability to induce clones of distinctly labeled neurons originating from a single dividing progenitor cell in a temporally defined fashion using tamoxifen (TM)-inducible CreER driver lines (Bonaguidi et al., 2011Bonaguidi M.A. Wheeler M.A. Shapiro J.S.

To achieve selective labeling of interneuron progenitors and their progeny, we used MADM-11 in combination with Nestin-CreERT2 (Hippenmeyer et al., 2010Hippenmeyer S. Youn Y.H. Moon H.M. Miyamichi K. Zong H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Luo L. Genetic mosaic dissection of Lis1 and Ndel1 in neuronal migration.Neuron. 2010; 68: 695-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A single TM dose was administered to timed pregnant Nestin-CreERT2/MADM-11 dams at E10 via intraperitoneal injection. Embryonic brains were recovered 2 or 3 days post-TM injection, processed for serial cryosectioning and immunostained to visualize all MADM-labeled cells in the VZ/SVZ of the MGE. The MADM-labeling efficiency of MGE progenitors was very low (less than one clone per brain on average) and in the absence of TM treatment, we found no labeled cells. MADM clones in the MGE displayed radially arrayed clusters of cells in the VZ (Figure 4C) and clumpy clusters of cells in the SVZ, both found in close proximity to a radial glia process. Consistent with our retroviral findings, individual clusters contained either a combination of green and red fluorescent neurons (G-X clone; Figure 4C) or yellow fluorescent neurons only (G2-Z or G1 events; data not shown). The majority of MADM clones (15/17) displayed labeling consistent with asymmetric neurogenic divisions, as indicated by the presence of an unequal amount of red and green cells within a cluster. In addition, a much smaller number (2/17) of MGE progenitors produced symmetric lineage trees within the 2- to 3-day developmental time window (Figure 4C, upper right). Within the distinctly labeled MADM subclones, we frequently observed clusters of labeled cells in the SVZ similar to the above clones labeled with retrovirus. Upon exiting the MGE SVZ, MADM-labeled cells dispersed widely and migrated toward the dorsal telecephalon. This corroborates our interpretation that MGE progenitors undergoing active neurogenesis produce a widely dispersed progeny that contributes to a variety of telencephalic structures in a seemingly unconstrained manner. Our data suggest that (1) retrovirally labeled clones of future neocortical and hippocampal interneurons in the MGE are initially organized into radial arrays, similar to clones of excitatory neurons (Brown et al., 2011Brown K.N.

The number of cells per clone was surprisingly large in short-term analysis (Figure 4C) compared with clones examined after migration (Figure 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2114586459,"The mammalian neocortex is composed of two major neuronal cell types with distinct origins: excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons, generated in dorsal and ventral progenitor zones of the embryonic telencephalon, respectively. Thus, inhibitory neurons migrate relatively long distances to reach their destination in the developing forebrain. The role of lineage in the organization and circuitry of interneurons is still not well understood. Utilizing a combination of genetics, retroviral fate mapping, and lineage-specific retroviral barcode labeling, we find that clonally related interneurons can be widely dispersed while unrelated interneurons can be closely clustered. These data suggest that migratory mechanisms related to the clustering of interneurons occur largely independent of their clonal origin."

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are recognized as ideal seed cells for tissue engineering because they can stimulate osteogenesis during bone regeneration. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the osteogenic potential of BMSCs derived from type 2 diabetic rats and the pathogenic characteristics of dysfunctional BMSCs that affect osteogenesis. BMSCs were isolated from normal and high-fat diet+streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats. Cell metabolic activity, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, mineralization and osteogenic gene expression were reduced in the type 2 diabetic rat BMSCs. The expression levels of Wnt signaling genes, such as β-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-myc, were also significantly decreased in the type 2 diabetic rat BMSCs, but the expression of GSK3β remained unchanged. The derived BMSCs were cultured on calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds and placed subcutaneously into nude mice for eight weeks; they were detected at a low level in newly formed bone. The osteogenic potential of the type 2 diabetic rat BMSCs was not impaired by the culture environment, but it was impaired by inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway, likely due to an insufficient accumulation of β-catenin rather than because of GSK3β stimulation. Using BMSCs derived from diabetic subjects could offer an alternative method of regenerating bone together with the use of supplementary growth factors to stimulate the Wnt signaling pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2339645174,"Background Total sedentary time varies across population groups with important health consequences. Patterns of sedentary time accumulation may vary and have differential health risks. The purpose of this study is to describe sedentary patterns of older adults living in retirement communities and illustrate gender and age differences in those patterns. Methods Baseline accelerometer data from 307 men and women (mean age = 84±6 years) who wore ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers for ≥ 4 days as part of a physical activity intervention were classified into bouts of sedentary time (<100 counts per minute). Linear mixed models were used to account for intra-person and site-level clustering. Daily and hourly summaries were examined in mutually non-exclusive bouts of sedentary time that were 1+, 5+, 10+, 20+, 30+, 40+, 50+, 60+, 90+ and 120+ minutes in duration. Variations by time of day, age and gender were explored. Results Men accumulated more sedentary time than women in 1+, 5+, 10+, 20+, 30+, 40+, 50+ and 60+ minute bouts; the largest gender-differences were observed in 10+ and 20+ minute bouts. Age was positively associated with sedentary time, but only in bouts of 10+, 20+, 30+, and 40+ minutes. Women had more daily 1+ minute sedentary bouts than men (71.8 vs. 65.2), indicating they break up sedentary time more often. For men and women, a greater proportion of time was spent being sedentary during later hours of the day than earlier. Gender differences in intra-day sedentary time were observed during morning hours with women accumulating less sedentary time overall and having more 1+ minute bouts. Conclusions Patterns identified using bouts of sedentary time revealed gender and age differences in the way in which sedentary time was accumulated by older adults in retirement communities. Awareness of these patterns can help interventionists better target sedentary time and may aid in the identification of health risks associated with sedentary behavior. Future studies should investigate the impact of patterns of sedentary time on healthy aging, disease, and mortality."

In part 1 of this two-part study, a 7-day CC-486 dosing schedule showed clinical activity, was generally well tolerated, and reduced DNA methylation. Extending dosing of CC-486 beyond 7 days would increase duration of azacitidine exposure. We hypothesized that extended dosing would therefore provide more sustained epigenetic activity. Reported here are the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of CC-486 extended dosing schedules in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from part 2 of this study. PK and/or PD data were available for 59 patients who were sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 extended CC-486 dosing schedules: 300mg once-daily or 200mg twice-daily for 14 or 21 days per 28-day cycle. Both 300mg once-daily schedules and the 200mg twice-daily 21-day schedule significantly (all P < .05) reduced global DNA methylation in whole blood at all measured time points (days 15, 22, and 28 of the treatment cycle), with sustained hypomethylation at cycle end compared with baseline. CC-486 exposures and reduced DNA methylation were significantly correlated. Patients who had a hematologic response had significantly greater methylation reductions than non-responding patients.

https://openalex.org/W1865326375,"Cluster of differentiation (CD)69 is a leukocyte activation receptor involved in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and is positively selected in activated regulatory T (Treg) cells, implicating its role during Treg-cell differentiation. By RNA interference, we show that CD69 is not sufficient to support the conversion of CD4(+) naive T cells into Treg cells, whereas it does that of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) (P < 0.01), suggesting that a ligand-receptor interaction is required for CD69 function. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified the S100A8/S100A9 complex as the natural ligand of CD69 in hPBMCs. CD69 specifically associates with S100A8/S100A9 complex as confirmed by in vitro binding and competition assay, and the treatment of CD69 with peptide-N-glycosidase significantly abolishes such association. In agreement, the glycomics analysis determines the glycosylation site and the N-glycan composition of CD69, and terminal removal of sialic acid from that N-linked glycans reverses the generation of forkhead box P3-positive Treg cells (23.21%; P < 0.05). More specifically, we showed that CD69-S100A8/S100A9 association is required for the up-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 resulting in inhibited signaling of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (36.54% increase upon CD69 silencing; P < 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W1946326324,"Background A variety of options and techniques for causing implicit and explicit motor learning have been described in the literature. The aim of the current paper was to provide clearer guidance for practitioners on how to apply motor learning in practice by exploring experts’ opinions and experiences, using the distinction between implicit and explicit motor learning as a conceptual departure point. Methods A survey was designed to collect and aggregate informed opinions and experiences from 40 international respondents who had demonstrable expertise related to motor learning in practice and/or research. The survey was administered through an online survey tool and addressed potential options and learning strategies for applying implicit and explicit motor learning. Responses were analysed in terms of consensus (≥ 70%) and trends (≥ 50%). A summary figure was developed to illustrate a taxonomy of the different learning strategies and options indicated by the experts in the survey. Results Answers of experts were widely distributed. No consensus was found regarding the application of implicit and explicit motor learning. Some trends were identified: Explicit motor learning can be promoted by using instructions and various types of feedback, but when promoting implicit motor learning, instructions and feedback should be restricted. Further, for implicit motor learning, an external focus of attention should be considered, as well as practicing the entire skill. Experts agreed on three factors that influence motor learning choices: the learner’s abilities, the type of task, and the stage of motor learning (94.5%; n = 34/36). Most experts agreed with the summary figure (64.7%; n = 22/34). Conclusion The results provide an overview of possible ways to cause implicit or explicit motor learning, signposting examples from practice and factors that influence day-to-day motor learning decisions."
https://openalex.org/W1846279292,"Quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxides (QdNOs) are widely known as potent antibacterial agents, but their antibacterial mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this study, the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of Escherichia coli exposed to QdNOs were integratively investigated, and the results demonstrated that QdNOs mainly induced an SOS response and oxidative stress. Moreover, genes and proteins involved in the bacterial metabolism, cellular structure maintenance, resistance and virulence were also found to be changed, conferring bacterial survival strategies. Biochemical assays showed that reactive oxygen species were induced in the QdNO-treated bacteria and that free radical scavengers attenuated the antibacterial action of QdNOs and DNA damage, suggesting an oxidative-DNA-damage action of QdNOs. The QdNO radical intermediates, likely carbon-centered and aryl-type radicals, as identified by electron paramagnetic resonance, were the major radicals induced by QdNOs, and xanthine oxidase was one of the QdNO-activating enzymes. This study provides new insights into the action of QdNOs in a systematic manner and increases the current knowledge of bacterial physiology under antibiotic stresses, which may be of great value in the development of new antibiotic-potentiating strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1842935417,"It is often thought that judgments about what we ought to do are limited by judgments about what we can do, or that “ought implies can.” We conducted eight experiments to test the link between a range of moral requirements and abilities in ordinary moral evaluations. Moral obligations were repeatedly attributed in tandem with inability, regardless of the type (Experiments 1–3), temporal duration (Experiment 5), or scope (Experiment 6) of inability. This pattern was consistently observed using a variety of moral vocabulary to probe moral judgments and was insensitive to different levels of seriousness for the consequences of inaction (Experiment 4). Judgments about moral obligation were no different for individuals who can or cannot perform physical actions, and these judgments differed from evaluations of a non-moral obligation (Experiment 7). Together these results demonstrate that commonsense morality rejects the “ought implies can” principle for moral requirements, and that judgments about moral obligation are made independently of considerations about ability. By contrast, judgments of blame were highly sensitive to considerations about ability (Experiment 8), which suggests that commonsense morality might accept a “blame implies can” principle."
https://openalex.org/W1525061057,"The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG1 has an essential role in cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and dysregulation has been associated with a number of high burden diseases. Previous studies reported that ABCG1 is ubiquitinated and degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome system. However, so far the molecular mechanism, including the identity of any of the rate-limiting ubiquitination enzymes, or E3 ligases, is unknown. Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, we identified two HECT domain E3 ligases associated with ABCG1, named HUWE1 (HECT, UBA, and WWE domain containing 1, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) and NEDD4-1 (Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down regulated gene 4), of which the latter is the founding member of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases. Silencing both HUWE1 and NEDD4-1 in cells overexpressing human ABCG1 significantly increased levels of the ABCG1 monomeric and dimeric protein forms, however ABCA1 protein expression was unaffected. In addition, ligase silencing increased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol export to HDL in cells overexpressing the transporter as well as in THP-1 macrophages. Reciprocally, overexpression of both ligases resulted in a significant reduction in protein levels of both the ABCG1 monomeric and dimeric forms. Like ABCG1, ABCG4 protein levels and cholesterol export activity were significantly increased after silencing both HUWE1 and NEDD4-1 in cells overexpressing this closely related ABC half-transporter. In summary, we have identified for the first time two E3 ligases that are fundamental enzymes in the post-translational regulation of ABCG1 and ABCG4 protein levels and cellular cholesterol export activity."

CD2AP and its homologue Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa (CIN85) are composed of three Src homology 3 (SH3) domains in the N-terminal half followed by a proline-rich region (PRR) and a coiled-coil domain at the C terminus, interspersed with apparently intrinsically disordered regions. CD2AP differs from CIN85 by the presence of additional actin binding sites before the coiled-coil domain (Fig. 1A). SH3 domains are globular protein interaction modules, typically binding to proline-rich linear recognition motifs. A large subset of CD2AP interactions involves one or more of its SH3 domains. However, the protein sequences of human CD2AP SH3 domains are only moderately conserved: SH3-2 and SH3-3 share the highest pairwise global sequence identity of only 45%; SH3-1 and SH3-2 have 40% identity; and SH3-1 and SH3-3 have 38% (Fig. 1B). Different biological processes regulated by CD2AP require specific binding partners, illustrating the versatility of CD2AP as an adaptor and hinting that each SH3 may have unique properties and requirements for binding. The key to understanding how specificity and selectivity are achieved to regulate multiple, heterogeneous binding events thus lies in combined knowledge of each molecular interaction. Most in vitro studies on the relationships between CD2AP SH3 domains and protein partners have tended to focus on a single domain or partner. None have systematically compared the binding modes of all three SH3 domains in comparative analyses with multiple interactors. Therefore, we investigated the similarities and differences in the preferences governing protein interactions of each CD2AP SH3 domain with known and novel partners. Based on the PxPxPR motif, which is characteristic for CBL peptide binding to SH3 domains, we used an in vitro peptide array screen to confirm interaction candidates, many with previously uncharacterized sequence requirements. Among 40 binders reported, including ALIX, BLNK, and zona occludens protein 2 (ZO-2), we followed up on the newly identified RIN3, a RAB5 and RAB31 guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in endocytosis (21Kajiho H.

The sequences encoding the three human CD2AP SH3 domains, herein referred to as SH3-1, SH3-2, and SH3-3, were generated as follows: SH3-2, SH3-3, and SH3-3L (a longerform of SH3-3) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase; CD2AP SH3-2, -3, or -3L BamHI forward primer; CD2AP SH3-2, -3, or -3L EcoRI reverse primer; and full-length CD2AP cDNA (23Kirsch K.H.

A thrombin site was inserted 5′ of the SH3-3L sequence using the QuikChangeTM XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). SH3-1 was synthesized with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites and cloned into pUC57 by GenScript Corp. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-6P-1 vector. The sequence encoding human RIN3 spanning aa 378–467 encompassing motif-bearing epitopes 1 and 2 (RIN3e1 and -e2) was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase with RIN3-AA378F-BamHI forward (5′-ATA GGATCC GCG AAG AAG AAC CTT CC-3′) and RIN3-AA467R-EcoRI reverse primer (5′-ATA GAATTC CTA AGA GAT CCG TTT TTT CCT GG-3′) using full-length Myc-tagged RIN3 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. T.

Myc- and RFP-tagged RIN3 single and/or double epitope PxxxxR → AxxxxA mutants were generated using wild-type RIN3 cDNA and the QuikChangeTM XL kit. All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. A Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit was used to prepare DNA. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified essentially as described (25Harkiolaki M. Tsirka T. Lewitzky M.

Eluted GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against the final buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and their integrity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining; protein concentrations were assayed by the Bradford method. Purified proteins were snap-frozen in aliquots and stored at −80 °C until further use in peptide arrays or GST pull-downs. For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and crystallization, proteins were purified as described above, and the GST tags were cleaved by incubation with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The GST tag and cleaved protein were separated by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl for CD2AP SH3-1 or supplemented with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol for CD2AP SH3-2 and -3). Purified protein was dialyzed against the final buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for SH3-1; 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol for SH3-2 and SH3-3). Proteins were concentrated and quantified by UV absorption at 280 nm, and their integrity was checked by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue staining. Apart from the RIN3 peptide permutation arrays, all arrays and soluble peptides were synthesized as described (25Harkiolaki M. Tsirka T. Lewitzky M. Simister P.C. Joshi D. Bird L.E. Jones E.Y.

The entire human CBL protein sequence was spot-synthesized as 21-aa partially overlapping peptides, sliding 3 aa with each step. Membranes were prepared as described (28Simister P.C. Schaper F.

Self-organization and regulation of intrinsically disordered proteins with folded N-termini.PLoS Biol. 2011; 9e1000591Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), briefly prewetted in ethanol, and then washed with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) three times for 10 min and blocked in TBST with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 4 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated with 0.56 μm (14 μg/ml) purified GST in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C to detect any background signals elicited by the GST tag. After washing three times in TBST for 10 min, membranes were probed with an anti-GST mAb, washed again, and incubated with HRP-coupled secondary (anti-Ig) antibody. Membranes were then reblocked for 1 h after washing and reprobed with 0.56 μm (20 μg/ml) GST-CD2AP SH3 domain overnight at 4 °C. Bound GST-CD2AP SH3 was detected as described for GST; signals were apparent after several seconds. N- and C-terminally truncated peptides containing the 21-aa CBL epitope (GSQVPERPPKPFPRRINSERK) were spot-synthesized in duplicate and probed as described above. 21-aa peptides encompassing the CBL epitope GSQVPERPPKPFPRRINSERK were permutated in single positions (underlined) to all 20 common amino acid residues, in duplicate rows, and probed as described above. Spot-synthesized 21-aa peptides containing the ALIX epitope AGGHAPTPPTPAPRTMPPTKP were permutated in single positions (underlined) to all 20 other residues, in duplicate rows. Membranes were probed as above for the CBL permutation array. The PxPxPR motif in CBL was used as a search sequence for scanning the human proteome, disregarding splice variants, with ScanProsite (29de Castro E. Sigrist C.J.A. Gattiker A. Bulliard V.

From 695 hits, a subset of 74 potential binding sites in 62 proteins with known or possible roles in signaling was selected; preference was given to proteins involved in membrane trafficking and/or signaling. Selected sequences were spot-synthesized on a microarray as 21-aa peptides, in duplicate. The arrays were probed as described for the CBL scanning array. The entire human RIN3 protein sequence was spot-synthesized as partially overlapping 27-aa peptides, sliding 3 aa with each step. Three array copies were probed as described above for the CBL arrays, except 0.1 μm (2.6 μg/ml) GST or 0.1 μm (3.6 μg/ml) GST-SH3 was used in the same blocking buffer (TBST, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk). Two 17-aa sequences from RIN3 (AKKNLPTAPPRRRVSER and TAKQPPVPPPRKKRISR) that bind to CD2AP SH3 domains were permutated at 15 single positions (underlined) to 20 aa and spot-synthesized in single rows. Arrays were probed as for the RIN3 scanning arrays, except with a modified blocking buffer (2% (w/v) ovalbumin in RIPA-100, for GST-SH3-1 and -SH3-2, or supplemented with 2 mm DTT, for GST-SH3-3) partly due to the different membrane type. No background GST signal was detected after 2 min, whereas GST-SH3 signals appeared after 1 s. ITC was performed at 25 °C with a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal/Malvern Instruments) essentially as described (30Simister P.C. Luccarelli J. Thompson S. Appella D.H. Feller S.M. Hamilton A.D. Novel inhibitors of a Grb2 SH3C domain interaction identified by a virtual screen.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2013; 21: 4027-4033Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), but peptides were dissolved at 0.75–1.5 mm, and protein solutions of CD2AP SH3-1, SH3-2, or SH3-3 domains were used at 0.05–0.1 mm in ITC buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate). An initial injection of 4 μl of peptide solution was followed by 18 15-μl injections into the sample cell containing protein solution. Background heats from injection of peptide into buffer solution without protein were subtracted from experimental heats and then analyzed in ORIGIN (version 5.0) software by fitting to a model for a single set of binding sites using χ2 minimization. The SH3-1 domain was mixed in a 1:3.5 ratio with a 16-mer RIN3e1 peptide (AKKNLPTAPPRRRVSE). Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in a sitting nanodrop (total volume of 150 nl) at 20 °C from a 1:1 ratio of mother liquor (0.1 m calcium acetate, pH 4.2, 0.2 m Li2SO4, and 25% PEG 10,000) to CD2AP SH3-1 protein solution (19 mg/ml). A cluster of needles (∼160 μm long), which grew after 2 weeks, was transferred to cryoprotectant (mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol) before being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected to 1.6 Å on beamline I04 at Diamond Light Source synchrotron (Harwell, UK). Data were reduced with the XDS package (31Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11288) Google Scholar), converted to CCP4 mtz format, and scaled with SCALA (32Evans P. Scaling and assessment of data quality.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3754) Google Scholar); data to 1.65 Å were kept for refinement. Molecular replacement was done in PHASER (33McCoy A.J.

Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14504) Google Scholar) using as a search model the SH3 domain alone from a reported binary complex of CD2AP SH3-1 and CBL-b peptide (PDB code 2J6F). The single, correct solution in space group C2 was refined with REFMAC5 (34Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr.

Features and development of Coot.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17187) Google Scholar). TLS (torsion, libration, screw) restraints were included for six groups (i.e. each chain in the asymmetric unit) (three SH3-1 domains and three RIN3 peptides). The final model was generated by optimizing experimental data/geometry restraint weighting and refining the water structure in PHENIX (36Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16496) Google Scholar) before deposition in the PDB under accession code 4WCI. The SH3-2 domain was mixed with a 16-mer RIN3e2 peptide (TAKQPPVPPPRKKRIS) in a 1:3 ratio. Crystallizations were set up as for the SH3-1·RIN3e1 complex. After 3 weeks, a single, thin, square plate (∼180 μm in length/width) grew from a 2:1 ratio of mother liquor (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.4 m trisodium citrate dehydrate) to CD2AP SH3-2 protein solution (16.7 mg/ml). This crystal was transferred to cryoprotectant (mother liquor supplemented with 10% glycerol) and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected to 1.11 Å on beamline I03 at the Diamond synchrotron. Data were reduced with the XDS package, proving incomplete in most resolution shells (space group C2), so an additional data set was later collected using the same crystal but reoriented in the beam (Diamond beamline I04-1). The two data sets were merged with XSCALE before conversion to CCP4 mtz format. Molecular replacement with PHASER used an ensemble of SH3 models homologous to CD2AP SH3-2 (PDB codes 2G6F, 1OEB, 2AK5, 2FEI, and 3IQL). The single, correct solution was subjected to automatic model building with AutoBuild in the PHENIX suite and later REFMAC5 refinement. Additional manual model building was done with COOT. Anisotropic B-factors and several alternative conformations were included. The final model was deposited in the PDB with accession code 3U23. Conditionally immortalized human kidney podocytes were a kind gift from Prof. Moin A. Saleem (University of Bristol). Podocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% ITS (insulin-transferrin-selenium) and incubated at 33 °C with 5% CO2. Differentiation was triggered by thermo-switching to 37 °C as described (37N"

NPC2 is a 16-kDa soluble protein that binds cholesterol in a 1:1 stoichiometry and can transfer cholesterol between membranes by a mechanism that involves protein-membrane interactions. To examine the structural basis of NPC2 function in cholesterol trafficking, a series of point mutations were generated across the surface of the protein. Several NPC2 mutants exhibited deficient sterol transport properties in a set of fluorescence-based assays. Notably, these mutants were also unable to promote egress of accumulated intracellular cholesterol from npc2−/− fibroblasts. The mutations mapped to several regions on the protein surface, suggesting that NPC2 can bind to more than one membrane simultaneously. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that WT NPC2 promotes vesicle-vesicle interactions. These interactions were abrogated, however, by mutations causing defective sterol transfer properties. Molecular modeling shows that NPC2 is highly plastic, with several intense positively charged regions across the surface that could interact favorably with negatively charged membrane phospholipids. The point mutations generated in this study caused changes in NPC2 surface charge distribution with minimal conformational changes. The plasticity, coupled with membrane flexibility, probably allows for multiple cholesterol transfer routes. Thus, we hypothesize that, in part, NPC2 rapidly traffics cholesterol between closely appositioned membranes within the multilamellar interior of late endosomal/lysosomal proteins, ultimately effecting cholesterol egress from this compartment.

We report here the x-ray structure of three tandemly linked domains of MHV nsp3, including the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) catalytic domain, the ubiquitin-like domain 2 (Ubl2), and a third domain that we call the DPUP (domain preceding Ubl2 and PLP2) domain. DPUP has close structural similarity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus unique domain C (SUD-C), suggesting that this domain may not be unique to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The PLP2 catalytic domain was found to have both deubiquitinating and deISGylating isopeptidase activities in addition to proteolytic activity. A computationally derived model of MHV PLP2 bound to ubiquitin was generated, and the potential interactions between ubiquitin and PLP2 were probed by site-directed mutagenesis. These studies extend substantially our structural knowledge of MHV nsp3, providing a platform for further investigation of the role of nsp3 domains in MHV viral replication.

https://openalex.org/W2209465104,"Mitophagy is an evolutionarily conserved autophagy pathway that selectively degrades mitochondria. Although it is well established that this degradation system contributes to mitochondrial quality and quantity control, mechanisms underlying mitophagy remain largely unknown. Here, we report that protein N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA), an enzymatic complex composed of the catalytic subunit Ard1 and the adaptor subunit Nat1, is crucial for mitophagy in yeast. NatA is associated with the ribosome via Nat1 and acetylates the second amino acid residues of nascent polypeptides. Mitophagy, but not bulk autophagy, is strongly suppressed in cells lacking Ard1, Nat1, or both proteins. In addition, loss of NatA enzymatic activity causes impairment of mitochondrial degradation, suggesting that protein N-terminal acetylation by NatA is important for mitophagy. Ard1 and Nat1 mutants exhibited defects in induction of Atg32, a protein essential for mitophagy, and formation of mitochondria-specific autophagosomes. Notably, overexpression of Atg32 partially recovered mitophagy in NatA-null cells, implying that this acetyltransferase participates in mitophagy at least in part via Atg32 induction. Together, our data implicate NatA-mediated protein modification as an early regulatory step crucial for efficient mitophagy."

SCD is a frequently inherited blood disorder, and sickle cell anemia is a common type of hemoglobinopathy. During anemia, the hypoxic response via the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α is highly activated in the intestine and is essential in iron absorption. Intestinal disruption of HIF-2α protects against tissue iron accumulation in iron overload anemias. However, the role of intestinal HIF-2α in regulating anemia in SCD is currently not known. Here we show that in mouse models of SCD, disruption of intestinal HIF-2α significantly decreased tissue iron accumulation. This was attributed to a decrease in intestinal iron absorptive genes, which were highly induced in a mouse model of SCD. Interestingly, disruption of intestinal HIF-2α led to a robust improvement in anemia with an increase in RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. This was attributed to improvement in RBC survival, hemolysis, and insufficient erythropoiesis, which is evident from a significant decrease in serum bilirubin, reticulocyte counts, and serum erythropoietin following intestinal HIF-2α disruption.

However, the downstream effectors of mTOR remain largely elusive. Here we report that brain-expressed X-linked 2 (BEX2) is a novel downstream effector of mTOR. Elevated BEX2 in Tsc2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Pten−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Tsc2-deficient rat uterine leiomyoma cells, and brains of neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out mice were abolished by mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, BEX2 was also increased in the liver of a hepatic specific Pten knock-out mouse and the kidneys of Tsc2 heterozygous deletion mice, and a patient with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). mTOR up-regulation of BEX2 was mediated in parallel by both STAT3 and NF-κB. BEX2 was involved in mTOR up-regulation of VEGF production and angiogenesis. Depletion of BEX2 blunted the tumorigenesis of cells with activated mTOR. Therefore, enhanced STAT3/NF-κB-BEX2-VEGF signaling pathway contributes to hyperactive mTOR-induced tumorigenesis.

A variety of angiogenesis activating factors have been elucidated, such as basic FGF (bFGF), TGF-α, TGF-β, PDGF, and VEGF. The VEGF serum levels in some cancer patients are elevated (14Kondo S.

Brain-expressed X-linked 2 (BEX2), one of the BEX family members, is abundantly expressed in the central nervous system (19Alvarez E. Zhou W. Witta S.E. Freed C.R. Characterization of the Bex gene family in humans, mice, and rats.Gene. 2005; 357: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

Conversely, BEX2 has been found as a tumor suppressor in human glioma because overexpression of BEX2 in glioma cells results in suppression of tumor growth in vitro and in vivo (24Foltz G. Ryu G.Y.

Hence, the precise function, as well as the regulatory mechanisms, of BEX2 in the development of malignant diseases is still not clear. In this study, we show that mTOR stimulated BEX2 expression. Hyperactive mTOR promoted carcinogenesis through up-regulation of STAT3/NF-κB-BEX2-VEGF signaling cascade. This study not only unveils an effector in the mTOR signaling pathway, but also reveals a novel mechanism for augmented VEGF expression induced by hyperactive mTOR signaling.

The kidney cystadenoma tissues and paratumor tissues from four mice with heterozygous deletion of Tsc2 (34Onda H. Lueck A. Marks P.W. Warren H.B. Kwiatkowski D.J.

WT mice, neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out (Tsc1f/f Syn1Cre) mice, and neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out mice treated with rapamycin were sacrificed on postnatal day 21, and brain tissues were extracted with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (35Meikle L.

Total RNA was extracted from the whole brain tissues of WT, and neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out mice were sacrificed on postnatal day 13 for qRT-PCR analysis. Mice with hepatocyte-specific deficiency of Pten were generated by crossing Ptenf/f mice with AlbCre transgenic mice (36Horie Y. Suzuki A. Kataoka E. Sasaki T. Hamada K. Sasaki J. Mizuno K.

All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Center of the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, and were in accordance with the regulation of the Beijing Administration Office of Laboratory Animal on the care of experimental animals. Mouse tumor development and survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test, and the two-tailed Student's t test was used to conduct the comparison between the groups. It was of statistical significance when p < 0.05. To identify novel targets of TSC2, we extracted mRNA from WT and Tsc2−/− MEFs and conducted the gene expression profiling analysis (supplemental Table 1). We found that the abundance of BEX2 was higher in Tsc2−/− MEFs than in WT MEFs (Table 1). Quantitative real time PCR revealed that the mRNA level of BEX2 in Tsc2−/− MEFs was significantly higher than that of WT MEFs (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the protein level of BEX2 in Tsc2−/− MEFs was also increased (Fig. 1B). To examine whether the negative regulation of TSC2 on BEX2 exists in human cells, we knocked down TSC2 in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Reduction of TSC2 resulted in an increase of BEX2 expression in A549 cells (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the ectopically expressed human TSC2 in rat uterine leiomyoma cell line ELT3 (Tsc2-deficient cells) inhibited BEX2 expression (Fig. 1D). Similarly, BEX2 protein was much higher in Pten−/− MEFs than in WT MEFs (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, the protein level of BEX2 was increased in the mouse liver tissue with hepatocyte-specific Pten deletion (Fig. 1F). BEX2 was much higher in renal tumor tissues than in adjacent normal renal tissues from Tsc2+/− mice (Fig. 1G). Moreover, the protein level of BEX2 in renal tumor tissues from a 16-year-old female patient with TSC was higher when compared with adjacent normal renal tissues (Fig. 1H).TABLE 1Increased BEX2 in Tsc2−/− MEFsGeneTsc2−/− vs. WT-Fold changeDescriptionBex28.51992Up Open table in a new tab Because deletion of either TSC2 or PTEN leads to mTOR activation (7Hay N. Sonenberg N. Upstream and downstream of mTOR.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) and BEX2 overexpression, we explored whether there is a regulatory relationship between mTOR and BEX2. We treated WT and Tsc2−/− MEFs with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Rapamycin inhibited BEX2 expression in WT and Tsc2−/− MEFs (Fig. 2, A and B). A similar change was presented in WT and Pten−/− MEFs with rapamycin treatment (Fig. 2C). To test the in vivo relevance of this finding, we examined the expression of BEX2 in the brain tissues dissected from WT mice and the neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out mice (Tsc1f/f Syn1Cre). The level of BEX2 mRNA was elevated in the brain tissues derived from the neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out mice over WT mice (Fig. 2D). Moreover, the BEX2 protein level was also increased in the neuronal specific Tsc1 knock-out mice, and the augmented BEX2 was suppressed by rapamycin administration (Fig. 2E). BEX2 expression declined after treatment with rapamycin in human liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Bel-7402, SK-HEP-1), lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, and rat uterine leiomyoma cell line ELT3 (Tsc2-deficient cells) (Fig. 2F). To validate mTORC1 in the regulation of BEX2, we knocked down mTOR, Raptor, and Rictor expression in Tsc2−/− MEFs, respectively. Cells transfected with mTOR and Raptor siRNAs had a remarkable decrease in the expression of phospho-S6 and BEX2 (Fig. 2G). However, there was no dramatic change in both phospho-S6 and BEX2 expression after knockdown of Rictor, suggesting that BEX2 expression is controlled by mTORC1 instead of mTORC2. Taken together, these data show that mTORC1 is a positive regulator of BEX2 expression. To investigate the role of BEX2 in the tumorigenesis of cells with active mTOR, we evaluated the tumorigenicity of Tsc2−/− MEFs expressing shBEX2 or scramble shRNA (shV) in a nude mouse model. Depletion of BEX2 significantly attenuated tumor initiation and progression of Tsc2−/− MEFs in nude mice (Fig. 3A). Similarly, knockdown of BEX2 significantly compromised the tumorigenesis of Pten−/− MEFs in nude mice (Fig. 3B). STAT3 is a transcription factor. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue (Tyr-705) is required for activation of STAT3 (38Johnston P.A. Grandis J.R. STAT3 signaling: anticancer strategies and challenges.Mol. Interv. 2011; 11: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Activation of STAT3 is detectable in many types of tumors (39Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G.

Overexpression of the constitutively activated STAT3 enhanced BEX2 expression (Fig. 4A). To verify this finding, we treated Tsc2−/− MEFs, Pten−/− MEFs, and SK-HEP-1 cells with the STAT3 inhibitor, JSI-124. Inhibition of STAT3 dramatically reduced BEX2 expression in all cell lines examined (Fig. 4B). Moreover, suppression of STAT3 with siRNA impaired BEX2 expression in Tsc2−/− MEFs, Pten−/− MEFs, and SK-HEP-1 cells (Fig. 4C). In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed that STAT3C up-regulated BEX2 mRNA expression (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the mRNA levels of BEX"

Several mouse models of skeletal muscle wasting are associated with lipin1 mutation or altered expression. Recent human studies have suggested that children with homozygous null mutations in the LPIN1 gene suffer from rhabdomyolysis. However, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is still poorly understood. In the present study we examined whether lipin1 contributes to regulating muscle regeneration. We characterized the time course of skeletal muscle regeneration in lipin1-deficient fld mice after injury. We found that fld mice exhibited smaller regenerated muscle fiber cross-sectional areas compared with wild-type mice in response to injury. Our results from a series of in vitro experiments suggest that lipin1 is up-regulated and translocated to the nucleus during myoblast differentiation and plays a key role in myogenesis by regulating the cytosolic activation of ERK1/2 to form a complex and a downstream effector cyclin D3-mediated cell cycle withdrawal.

Despite well known roles of lipin1 in lipid biosynthesis and transcriptional regulation, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to impaired muscle repair are still unknown. It remains to be determined whether lipin1 plays a role in postnatal skeletal muscle regeneration. Muscle regeneration is a rapid and extensive self-renewal process relying on the presence of satellite cells. These cells are activated and then proliferate to provide a myoblast population that either fuses to each other to create new myofibers or fuses to existing damaged myofibers for repair (15Ciciliot S.

Rudnicki M.A. Cellular and molecular regulation of muscle regeneration.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 209-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). This process of myogenesis is regulated by the myogenic regulatory factors including Myf5, MyoD, and MyoG. Mononucleated myoblast proliferation is driven by Myf5 expression (19Ustanina S. Carvajal J. Rigby P. Braun T. The myogenic factor Myf5 supports efficient skeletal muscle regeneration by enabling transient myoblast amplification.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 2006-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). MyoG is a master regulator of myoblast differentiation and fusion into myofibers (17Bentzinger C.F. Wang Y.X. Rudnicki M.A. Building muscle: molecular regulation of myogenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4a008342 Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the MyoG gene die at birth due to severe skeletal muscle deficiency, as myoblasts are unable to fuse into multinucleated myofibers (20Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G.

Age and gender matched lipin1-deficient fld mice and their littermates (around 4 months of age) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Protocols and procedures conformed to current United States Public Health Service policies and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Kentucky. Induction of BaCl2-induced muscle injury was undertaken by injecting around 50 μl (adjusted by their body weight) of 1.2% BaCl2 solution intramuscularly into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of adult mice using a Hamilton syringe and 27-gauge needle. Contralateral TA muscles injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) only served as uninjured controls. Injured and uninjured muscles were then harvested at day 0 and post mortem at 3, 5, 7, or 14 days after injury (n = 4–8 mice) and processed for immunohistochemistry, mRNA, or protein analysis. TA muscles were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, immediately frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Sections of 10 mm were cut and collected from the mid-belly muscles and stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E, Sigma) using standard procedures (27Richter T. Nährig J. Komminoth P. Kowolik J. Werner M. Protocol for ultrarapid immunostaining of frozen sections.J. Clin. Pathol. 1999; 52: 461-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry of muscle cryosections was performed with the following antibodies: anti-MyHC (myosin heavy chain, F1.652), anti-mf20 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and laminin (Abcam). Labeling of cryosections with mouse monoclonal primary antibodies was performed using the peroxidase or fluorescein M.O.M kit staining (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double immunostaining was performed by sequential addition of each primary and secondary antibody using appropriate positive and negative controls. Sections were air-dried, fixed on 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions after blocking for 1 h at room temperature with 1% BSA. Subsequently, the slides were washed by PBS and incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 (Invitrogen), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). After washing, tissue sections were mounted. Bright-field images were acquired with a microscope (Nikon eclipse 80i) coupled with a camera (Nikon DXM 1200F) using Nikon ACT1 (Version 2.63) or Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). The objectives used were Plan Fluor 20 × 0.50 or Plan Fluor 40 × 1.30 oil (Nikon). Fluorescent micrographs were taken with a confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E) using Nikon NIS Elements software (Carl Zeiss). Lenses used with the confocal microscope were either CFI Plan Fluor 40× Oil or CFI Plan Fluor DLL 20× (Nikon). All digital microscopic images were acquired at room temperature. Myofiber cross-sectional areas in injured TA muscle were quantified via manual masking using Nikon NIS Elements software based on laminin staining in 40× fields. A minimum of 400 myofibers and three sections were analyzed per biological replica. To examine the efficiency of myoblast differentiation, a fusion index (FI) was calculated as the number of nuclei present in myotubes over the total number of nuclei present in the observed field. Data were selected from 10 different randomly chosen microscopic fields. C2C12 mouse myoblasts were grown to confluency under 5% CO2 at 37 °C in growth medium, DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), and penicillin-streptomycin (100 mg/ml, 100 units/ml) (Gibco). To differentiate the myoblasts, they were then switched to differentiation medium containing DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum (v/v) (Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 mg/ml, 100 units/ml) for 4 days. Adenoviruses expressing short hairpin RNA to knockdown lipin1 (shLpin1) and control shLacZ were generous gifts from Dr. Thurl Harris (University of Virginia). For knockdown of lipin1 expression, C2C12 myoblasts were infected with shLpin1 and shLacZ control in growth medium containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The myoblasts were incubated for an additional 24 h until they were just confluent. Primary myoblasts were isolated from fld and WT mice (4 weeks of age) according to Yaffe and Saxel (28Yaffe D. Saxel O. Serial passaging and differentiation of myogenic cells isolated from dystrophic mouse muscle.Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, hind limb muscles were dissected and minced into pieces. Cells were dissociated in 20 ml of 0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 2 h and filtered through an 85-mm nylon mesh filter (Spectrum, Houston, TX). Dissociated single cells were washed in PBS (Gibco/Invitrogen) and plated in collagen-coated culture plates with F-10-based primary myoblast growth medium (Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture containing 20% fetal calf serum, 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Promega Corp.)), streptomycin, and penicillin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes was initiated at ∼90% confluence by cultivation in differentiation medium (DMEM, 5% horse serum) for up to 6 days. When required, ERK phosphorylation inhibitor (100 μm U0126) was added in the differentiation medium. To analyze whether cyclin D acts as a downstream target of ERK, C2C12 myoblasts were incubated with the differentiation medium in the presence of an inhibitor for 4 days. To induce endogenous lipin1 nuclear accumulation, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with 150 nm Torin-1 for 24 h. Cells were lysed using a protein lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and protease inhibitor mixture. The protein expression levels were examined by incubation with Myf5 (1/500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), MyoG (1/200; BD Biosciences), MyoD (1/300; Santa Cruz), ERK, P-ERK, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4, CDK6 (1/1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and α-tubulin (1/1000; Sigma) primary antibodies followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG IR Dye 680 or 800 (LI-COR) secondary antibodies. C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with HA-lipin1 together with EGFP-ERK2. 24 h after transfection, cells were immunoprecipitated with either mouse anti-GFP or rabbit anti-HA antibody. The interaction between lipin1 and ERK was determined by Western blot using rabbit an-HA or mouse anti-GFP antibody. EGFP-ERK2 plasmid was obtained from Addgene (plasmid #40777). All data are presented as the means ± S.E. Student's t test (unpaired and two tailed) or one-way analysis of variance was used to determine the statistical significance of individual datasets. Differences were considered significant for p < 0.05 and very significant for p < 0.01. We employed a BaCl2 injury model with the lipin1deficient (fld) mice to investigate the role of lipin1 in skeletal muscle regeneration. In both wild-type and fld groups, 50 μl (adjusted by body weight) of 1.2% BaCl2 in PBS was injected into one TA muscle, and PBS only was injected into the contralateral TA muscle as a control (Fig. 1A). H&E staining and immunostaining with antibodies against laminin and embryonic myosin heavy chain were employed to examine the effect of lipin1 deficiency on muscle regeneration in the TA muscle at days 0, 3, 5, 7, and 14 after injury. Before injury, no significant histological defects were observed in the TA muscle of fld mice (Fig. 1B). Extensive myofiber damage in both WT and lipin1-deficient TA muscle was observed at day 3. Five days after injury, regeneration was evident in both WT and lipin1-deficient muscles with the presence of newly formed myotubes containing central nuclei, which is a hallmark of regeneration. By day 14 after injury, the overall tissue architecture was restored in wild-type mice indicating a complete regeneration. In contrast, although the muscle in fld mice did initiate regeneration, the persistence of small myofibers expressing embryonic myosin heavy chain at day 14 after injury suggested that regeneration of new myofibers was still under way (Fig. 1B). Lipin1-deficient fld mice showed significantly reduced mean myofiber cross-sectional area of 1254 μm2 compared with 1790 μm2 in wild-type TA muscles injected with BaCl2. In contrast, PBS injection alone into TA muscles had no effect on myofiber cross-sectional area (Fig. 1C). Myogenic regulatory factors including myoD and myoG are master regulators for the commitment of myogenic precursor cells and the terminal differentiation of myoblasts (17Bentzinger C.F. Wang Y.X. Rudnicki M.A. Building muscle: molecular regulation of myogenesis.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4a008342 Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Shi X. Garry D.J. Muscle stem cells in development, regeneration, and disease.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1692-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed up-regulated levels of myoD and myoG at day 3 after injury in both WT and lipin1-deficient muscle (Fig. 2). Their expression levels then rapidly decreased and by day 7 had returned back to the baseline. Compared with WT mice, however, myoD and myoG expression levels were suppressed by 60 and 86%, respectively, in the TA muscles of fld mice at day 3. To examine the mechanisms underlying defective regeneration in lipin1-deficient skeletal muscle, we also analyzed the protein expression levels of MAPK and cyclin D complexes. These proteins have been shown to be important regulators for myoblast differentiation and myoblast cell cycle withdrawal (30Li J. Johnson S.E. ERK2 is required for efficient terminal differentiation of skeletal myoblasts.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31De Luca G. Ferretti R.

Kothary R. The myogenic kinome: protein kinases critical to mammalian skeletal myogenesis.Skelet Muscle. 2011; 1: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, although total ERK1/2 expression was not altered between fld and WT mice, a lower phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected in the TA muscles of fld mice. Densitometric analysis indicated a respective reduction of 55 and 48% ERK1/2 phosphorylation at days 3 and 5 after injury. As indicated in Fig. 3, cyclin D1, D3, CDK4, and CDK6 expression levels were markedly increased at day 3 after injury and rapidly decreased to almost baseline levels at day 14. However, compared with the control group, cyclin D1, D3, CDK4, and CDK6 levels were reduced by 71, 59, 54, and 78%, respectively, in fld muscle at day 3. These data suggest that lipin1 regulates skeletal muscle regeneration by mediating ERK phosphorylation and cyclin D·CDK complex-mediated cell cycle withdrawal. To examine the role of lipin1 in myoblast differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were used to measure lipin1 expression. Compared with day 0, lipin1 mRNA (data not shown) and protein expression levels (Fig. 3A) were significantly enhanced at day 4 after differentiation treatment, suggesting that lipin1 is required for myoblast differentiation. This is consistent with a previous study showing increased lipin1 mRNA expression in primary human myoblasts from skeletal muscle biopsies after differentiation treatment (33Sterrenburg E. Turk R. 't Hoen P.A. van Deutekom J.C. Boer J.M. van Ommen G.J. den Dunnen J.T. Large-scale gene expression analysis of human skeletal myoblast differentiation.Neuromuscul. Disord. 2004; 14: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also observed that lipin1 exhibited enhanced nuclear redistribution at day 4 after differentiation treatment (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that lipin1 is required for myoblast differentiation, and lipin1 nuclear function could be critical for myoblast differentiation. To test whether lipin1 deficiency could affect myogenic differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts were infected with adenovirus for knockdown of lipin1 expression (shLpin1). Differentiation was examined at days 0, 2, and 4 after differentiation treatment, and the myoblasts were shifted from growth medium to differentiation medium when reaching confluence. A severe lack of multinucleated myotube formation and enhanced mononucleated myoblasts were evident in shLpin1-treated myoblasts compared with shLacZ control-treated myoblasts, suggesting that lipin1 plays a critical role in myoblast differentiation (Fig. 4A). A calculation of the FI (i.e. percentage of nuclei found in myosin heavy chain-positive cells) revealed that the lipin1 siRNA-treated myotubes had a significantly reduced FI of 23% compared with 52% of the control siRNA-treated myotubes (Fig. 4B). ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D3 signaling pathways were suppressed at day 4 after differentiation treatment in lipin1-depleted C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 4, C and D). Because the C2C12 cell line may behave differently, we prepared primary myoblasts from the hind limb muscles of fld and WT mice and induced differentiation. The protein expression levels of myogenic factors and cell cycle regulators were examined by Western blot at days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after differentiation treatment. Compared with wild-type controls, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D3 expression levels were suppressed at day 6 after differentiation treatment in differentiated fld myotubes, which is consistent with what we observed in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 4E). Moreover, these results match those found in vivo and confirm that lipin1 is essential for effective differentiation during the early stages of myogenesis. Our dat"

https://openalex.org/W1821902148,"Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a linear polysaccharide naturally found in the eye and therefore is one of the most promising biomaterials for corneal endothelial regenerative medicine. This study reports, for the first time, the development of overrun-processed porous HA hydrogels for corneal endothelial cell (CEC) sheet transplantation and tissue engineering applications. The hydrogel carriers were characterized to examine their structures and functions. Evaluations of carbodiimide cross-linked air-dried and freeze-dried HA samples were conducted simultaneously for comparison. The results indicated that during the fabrication of freeze-dried HA discs, a technique of introducing gas bubbles in the aqueous biopolymer solutions can be used to enlarge pore structure and prevent dense surface skin formation. Among all the groups studied, the overrun-processed porous HA carriers show the greatest biological stability, the highest freezable water content and glucose permeability, and the minimized adverse effects on ionic pump function of rabbit CECs. After transfer and attachment of bioengineered CEC sheets to the overrun-processed HA hydrogel carriers, the therapeutic efficacy of cell/biopolymer constructs was tested using a rabbit model with corneal endothelial dysfunction. Clinical observations including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, specular microscopy, and corneal thickness measurements showed that the construct implants can regenerate corneal endothelium and restore corneal transparency at 4 weeks postoperatively. Our findings suggest that cell sheet transplantation using overrun-processed porous HA hydrogels offers a new way to reconstruct the posterior corneal surface and improve endothelial tissue function."

Seventy one post-treatment glioblastoma patients who showed enlarged contrast-enhancing lesions on follow-up MR images after concurrent chemoradiotherapy and uninterpretable DSC images for corresponding enhancing lesions, underwent additional DWI and DCE MR imaging. The primary outcome was the frequency of interpretable DWI and DCE MR cases in these 71 patients. The secondary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of DWI and DCE imaging parameters for distinguishing tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images. The imaging parameters were quantified as 10% cumulative histogram cutoff of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC10) and 90% cumulative histogram cutoff of initial area under the time signal intensity curve (IAUC90). The AUCs were cross-validated by using leave-one-out method.Of the 71 patients, the uninterpretable DSC images were associated with treatment-related hemorrhage within the corresponding enhancing lesions (n = 54, 76.1%) and a near skull base location (n = 17, 23.9%). The frequencies of interpretable DWI and DCE image were 51 (71.8%) and 59 (83.1%) of the 71 cases with uninterpretable DSC images, respectively. Of the 45 selected patients with interpretable DWI and DCE images, the combination of DWI with DCE imaging showed a superior diagnostic performance than DWI or DCE imaging alone for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect (cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.55 and 0.73 for reader 1; cross-validated AUC: 0.78 versus 0.53 and 0.75 for reader 2, respectively). Cross-validated accuracy of the single and combined imaging parameters also showed the highest for the combination of DWI with DCE MR imaging (72.9% for reader 1; 72.5% for reader 2) and the lowest for DWI alone (54.0% for reader 1; 56.4% for reader 2). Inter-reader agreement for DCE imaging was higher than that for DWI (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.95 versus 0.87).DCE MR imaging could be a superior and more reproducible imaging biomarker than DWI for differentiating tumor recurrence from post-treatment effect in patients with post-treatment glioblastoma when DSC MR images are not interpretable."
https://openalex.org/W2202265650,"BRCA1 is a tumor-suppressor gene associated with, but not restricted to, breast and ovarian cancer and implicated in various biological functions. During mitosis, BRCA1 and its positive regulator Chk2 are localized at centrosomes and are required for the regulation of microtubule plus end assembly, thereby ensuring faithful mitosis and numerical chromosome stability. However, the function of BRCA1 during mitosis has not been defined mechanistically. To gain insights into the mitotic role of BRCA1 in regulating microtubule assembly, we systematically identified proteins interacting with BRCA1 during mitosis and found the centrosomal protein Cep72 as a novel BRCA1-interacting protein. CEP72 is frequently upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues and overexpression of CEP72 mirrors the consequences of BRCA1 loss during mitosis. In detail, the overexpression of CEP72 causes an increase in microtubule plus end assembly, abnormal mitotic spindle formation and the induction of chromosomal instability. Moreover, we show that high levels of Cep72 counteract Chk2 as a positive regulator of BRCA1 to ensure proper mitotic microtubule assembly. Thus, CEP72 represents a putative oncogene in colorectal cancer that might negatively regulate the mitotic function of BRCA1 to ensure chromosomal stability."

We examined variants of two sets of residues involved in PPT coordination: (i) those interacting directly or indirectly with the pyran oxygen of the bicyclic distal PPT (NarG-Ser719, NarG-His1163, and NarG-His1184); and (ii) those involved in bridging the two PPTs and stabilizing the oxidation state of the proximal PPT (NarG-His1092 and NarG-His1098). A S719A variant has essentially no effect on the overall Mo(VI/IV) reduction potential, whereas the H1163A and H1184A variants elicit large effects (ΔEm values of −88 and −36 mV, respectively). Ala variants of His1092 and His1098 also elicit large ΔEm values of −143 and −101 mV, respectively. An Arg variant of His1092 elicits a small ΔEm of +18 mV on the Mo(VI/IV) reduction potential.

https://openalex.org/W2134833770,"How humans react to threats is a topic of broad theoretical importance, and also relevant for understanding anxiety disorders. Many animal threat reactions exhibit a common structure, a finding supported by human evaluations of written threat scenarios that parallel patterns of rodent defensive behavior to actual threats. Yet the factors that underlie these shared behavioral patterns remain unclear. Dimensional accounts rooted in Darwin’s conception of antithesis explain many defensive behaviors. Across species, it is also clear that defensive reactions depend on specific situational factors, a feature long emphasized by psychological appraisal theories. Our study sought to extend prior investigations of human judgments of threat to a broader set of threats, including natural disasters, threats from animals, and psychological (as opposed to physical) threats. Our goal was to test whether dimensional and specific patterns of threat evaluation replicate across different threat classes. 85 healthy adult subjects selected descriptions of defensive behaviors that indicated how they would react to 29 threatening scenarios. Scenarios differed with respect to ten factors, e.g., perceived dangerousness or escapability. Across scenarios, we correlated these factor ratings with the pattern of defensive behaviors subjects endorsed. A decision tree hierarchically organized these correlation patterns to successfully predict each scenario’s most common reaction, both for the original sample of subjects and a separate replication group (n = 22). At the top of the decision tree, degree of dangerousness interacted with threat type (physical or psychological) to predict dimensional approach/avoidance behavior. Subordinate nodes represented specific defensive responses evoked by particular contexts. Our ecological approach emphasizes the interplay of situational factors in evoking a broad range of threat reactions. Future studies could test predictions made by our results to help understand pathological threat processing, such as seen in anxiety disorders, and could begin to test underlying neural mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1191295727,"Patients who have survived malignant melanoma for more than five years may lack the opportunity to talk about their burden. As a consequence their psychosocial care needs remain undetected and available supportive interventions may not be utilised. Therefore, the psychosocial burden of this patient group needs to be assessed using specific screening instruments. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of long-term melanoma survivors, their psychosocial care needs and the determinants of these needs. We wanted to find out if the use of professional support corresponds to the care needs defined by experts. Using the cancer registry of Rhineland-Palatinate, melanoma patients diagnosed at least 5 years before the survey were contacted by physicians. N = 689 former patients completed the Hornheide Questionnaire (short form HQ-S) to identify psychosocial support need (scale cut off ≥ 16 or item-based cut-off score) and the potential psychosocial determinants of these needs. Additionally, they were asked about their utilisation of the professional support system. More than one third (36%) of them was in need for professional psychosocial support. The highest burden scores concerned worry about tumour progression. Younger age (< 50), higher general fatigue, higher symptom burden, lower general health, negative social interactions and unfulfilled information needs were significant predictors of the need for psychosocial intervention. Related to the percentage of survivors identified as 'in need', the professional support system was underused. Further studies should investigate whether using the HQ-S to routinely identify burdened melanoma patients could lead to better fulfilment of their intervention needs, ultimately enhancing health-related quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W1757410595,"Cucurbitacin I is a naturally occurring triterpenoid derived from Cucurbitaceae family plants that exhibits a number of potentially useful pharmacological and biological activities. However, the therapeutic impact of cucurbitacin I on the heart has not heretofore been reported. To evaluate the functional role of cucurbitacin I in an in vitro model of cardiac hypertrophy, phenylephrine (PE)-stimulated cardiomyocytes were treated with a sub-cytotoxic concentration of the compound, and the effects on cell size and mRNA expression levels of ANF and β-MHC were investigated. Consequently, PE-induced cell enlargement and upregulation of ANF and β-MHC were significantly suppressed by pretreatment of the cardiomyocytes with cucurbitacin I. Notably, cucurbitacin I also impaired connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and MAPK signaling, pro-hypertrophic factors, as well as TGF-β/Smad signaling, the important contributing factors to fibrosis. The protective impact of cucurbitacin I was significantly blunted in CTGF-silenced or TGF-β1-silenced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, indicating that the compound exerts its beneficial actions through CTGF. Taken together, these findings signify that cucurbitacin I protects the heart against cardiac hypertrophy via inhibition of CTGF/MAPK, and TGF- β/Smad-facilitated events. Accordingly, the present study provides new insights into the defensive capacity of cucurbitacin I against cardiac hypertrophy, and further suggesting cucurbitacin I’s utility as a novel therapeutic agent for the management of heart diseases."

The aim of this study is to map the HIV prevalence among asylum seekers who gave birth in The Netherlands.We used a nationwide electronic medical records database from the community health services for asylum seekers (MOA). The study population consisted of 4,854 women and girls who delivered in asylum reception between 2000 and 2008. A unique electronic health data base was used and case allocation was based on ICPC-codes.The number of women and girls that was HIV positive during their last pregnancy was 80, of which 79 originated from sub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence for women from this region of origin (3.4%) was high compared to women from all other regions of origin (0.04%; OR = 90.2; 95%CI 12.5-648.8). The highest HIV prevalence rates were found for women from Rwanda (17.0%) and Cameroon (13.2%). HIV prevalence rates were higher among women who arrived in reception without partner (OR = 1.82; 95%CI 0.75-4.44) and unaccompanied minors (OR = 2.59; 95%CI 0.79-8.49), compared to women who arrived in reception with partner.We conclude that, among asylum-seeking women from sub-Saharan Africa giving birth in The Netherlands, the HIV prevalence is high compared to the host population. For women from other regions of origin, the prevalence is at the same level as in the host population. The high HIV prevalence underlines the importance of preventive interventions and voluntary HIV testing for sub-Saharan African asylum seekers as from shortly after arrival."

Significantly, inhibition of Erk1/2 signaling in these cells favored neutrophil over monocyte development in response to M-CSF.

https://openalex.org/W2264983832,"Citrulline formation by both human neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) and mouse macrophage inducible NOS was inhibited by the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor Na2S with IC50 values of ∼2.4·10−5 and ∼7.9·10−5 m, respectively, whereas human endothelial NOS was hardly affected at all. Inhibition of nNOS was not affected by the concentrations of l-arginine (Arg), NADPH, FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and calmodulin, indicating that H2S does not interfere with substrate or cofactor binding. The IC50 decreased to ∼1.5·10−5 m at pH 6.0 and increased to ∼8.3·10−5 m at pH 8.0. Preincubation of concentrated nNOS with H2S under turnover conditions decreased activity after dilution by ∼70%, suggesting irreversible inhibition. However, when calmodulin was omitted during preincubation, activity was not affected, suggesting that irreversible inhibition requires both H2S and NO. Likewise, NADPH oxidation was inhibited with an IC50 of ∼1.9·10−5 m in the presence of Arg and BH4 but exhibited much higher IC50 values (∼1.0–6.1·10−4 m) when Arg and/or BH4 was omitted. Moreover, the relatively weak inhibition of nNOS by Na2S in the absence of Arg and/or BH4 was markedly potentiated by the NO donor 1-(hydroxy-NNO-azoxy)-l-proline, disodium salt (IC50 ∼ 1.3–2.0·10−5 m). These results suggest that nNOS and inducible NOS but not endothelial NOS are irreversibly inhibited by H2S/NO at modest concentrations of H2S in a reaction that may allow feedback inhibition of NO production under conditions of excessive NO/H2S formation. Citrulline formation by both human neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) and mouse macrophage inducible NOS was inhibited by the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor Na2S with IC50 values of ∼2.4·10−5 and ∼7.9·10−5 m, respectively, whereas human endothelial NOS was hardly affected at all. Inhibition of nNOS was not affected by the concentrations of l-arginine (Arg), NADPH, FAD, FMN, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), and calmodulin, indicating that H2S does not interfere with substrate or cofactor binding. The IC50 decreased to ∼1.5·10−5 m at pH 6.0 and increased to ∼8.3·10−5 m at pH 8.0. Preincubation of concentrated nNOS with H2S under turnover conditions decreased activity after dilution by ∼70%, suggesting irreversible inhibition. However, when calmodulin was omitted during preincubation, activity was not affected, suggesting that irreversible inhibition requires both H2S and NO. Likewise, NADPH oxidation was inhibited with an IC50 of ∼1.9·10−5 m in the presence of Arg and BH4 but exhibited much higher IC50 values (∼1.0–6.1·10−4 m) when Arg and/or BH4 was omitted.

https://openalex.org/W2151922991,"Killing of virally infected cells or tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires targeting of lytic granules to the junction between the CTL and its target. We used whole-cell patch clamp to measure the cell capacitance at fixed intracellular [Ca2+] to study fusion of lytic granules in human CTLs. Expression of a fluorescently labeled human granzyme B construct allowed identification of lytic granule fusion using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. In this way capacitance steps due to lytic granule fusion were identified. Our goal was to determine the size of fusing lytic granules and to describe their behavior at the plasma membrane. On average, 5.02 ± 3.09 (mean ± s.d.) lytic granules were released per CTL. The amplitude of lytic granule fusion events was ~ 3.3 fF consistent with a diameter of about 325 nm. Fusion latency was biphasic with time constants of 15.9 and 106 seconds. The dwell time of fusing lytic granules was exponentially distributed with a mean dwell time of 28.5 seconds. Fusion ended in spite of the continued presence of granules at the immune synapse. The mobility of fusing granules at the membrane was indistinguishable from that of lytic granules which failed to fuse. While dwelling at the plasma membrane lytic granules exhibit mobility consistent with docking interspersed with short periods of greater mobility. The failure of lytic granules to fuse when visible in TIRF at the membrane may indicate that a membrane-confined reaction is rate limiting."
https://openalex.org/W1918119310,"Neurophysiological studies of cognitive mechanisms such as visual attention typically ignore trial-by-trial variability and instead report mean differences averaged across many trials. Advances in electrophysiology allow for the simultaneous recording of small populations of neurons, which may obviate the need for averaging activity over trials. We recently introduced a method called the attention axis that uses multi-electrode recordings to provide estimates of attentional state of behaving monkeys on individual trials. Here, we refine this method to eliminate problems that can cause bias in estimates of attentional state in certain scenarios. We demonstrate the sources of these problems using simulations and propose an amendment to the previous formulation that provides superior performance in trial-by-trial assessments of attentional state."
https://openalex.org/W1935545234,"The emergence of malaria pathogens having resistance against antimalarials implies the necessity for the development of new drugs. Recently, we have demonstrated a resistance against malaria infection of α-tocopherol transfer protein knockout mice showing undetectable plasma levels of α-tocopherol, a lipid-soluble antioxidant. However, dietary restriction induced α-tocopherol deficiency is difficult to be applied as a clinical antimalarial therapy. Here, we report on a new strategy to potentially treat malaria by using probucol, a drug that can reduce the plasma α-tocopherol concentration. Probucol pre-treatment for 2 weeks and treatment throughout the infection rescued from death of mice infected with Plasmodium yoelii XL-17 or P. berghei ANKA. In addition, survival was extended when the treatment started immediately after parasite inoculation. The ratio of lipid peroxidation products to parent lipids increased in plasma after 2 weeks treatment of probucol. This indicates that the protective effect of probucol might be mediated by the oxidative stressful environment induced by α-tocopherol deficiency. Probucol in combination with dihydroartemisin suppressed the proliferation of P. yoelii XL-17. These results indicated that probucol might be a candidate for a drug against malaria infection by inducing α-tocopherol deficiency without dietary α-tocopherol restriction."
https://openalex.org/W1828919263,"Decision-making capacity to provide informed consent regarding treatment is essential among cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of decision-making incapacity among newly diagnosed older patients with hematological malignancy receiving first-line chemotherapy, to examine factors associated with incapacity and assess physicians' perceptions of patients' decision-making incapacity.Consecutive patients aged 65 years or over with a primary diagnosis of malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma were recruited. Decision-making capacity was assessed using the Structured Interview for Competency and Incompetency Assessment Testing and Ranking Inventory-Revised (SICIATRI-R). Cognitive impairment, depressive condition and other possible associated factors were also evaluated.Among 139 eligible patients registered for this study, 114 completed the survey. Of these, 28 (25%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17%-32%) were judged as having some extent of decision-making incompetency according to SICIATRI-R. Higher levels of cognitive impairment and increasing age were significantly associated with decision-making incapacity. Physicians experienced difficulty performing competency assessment (Cohen's kappa -0.54).Decision-making incapacity was found to be a common and under-recognized problem in older patients with cancer. Age and assessment of cognitive impairment may provide the opportunity to find patients that are at a high risk of showing decision-making incapacity."
https://openalex.org/W1859734733,"Substantial evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be causally linked to the occurrence and progression of human diseases. Herein, we conducted an enrichment analysis to identify potential functional miRNA-disease associations (MDAs) in humans by integrating currently known biological data: miRNA-target interactions (MTIs), protein-protein interactions, and gene-disease associations. Two contributing factors to functional miRNA-disease associations were quantitatively considered: the direct effects of miRNA that target disease-related genes, and indirect effects triggered by protein-protein interactions. Ninety-nine miRNAs were scanned for possible functional association with 2223 MeSH-defined human diseases. Each miRNA was experimentally validated to target ≥ 10 mRNA genes. Putative MDAs were identified when at least one MTI was confidently validated for a disease. Overall, 19648 putative MDAs were found, of which 10.0% was experimentally validated. Further results suggest that filtering for miRNAs that target a greater number of disease-related genes (n ≥ 8) can significantly enrich for true MDAs from the set of putative associations (enrichment rate = 60.7%, adjusted hypergeometric p = 2.41×10−91). Considering the indirect effects of miRNAs further elevated the enrichment rate to 72.6%. By using this method, a novel MDA between miR-24 and ovarian cancer was found. Compared with scramble miRNA overexpression of miR-24 was validated to remarkably induce ovarian cancer cells apoptosis. Our study provides novel insight into factors contributing to functional MDAs by integrating large quantities of previously generated biological data, and establishes a feasible method to identify plausible associations with high confidence."
https://openalex.org/W1882890617,"Natural killer cells play a crucial role in the initial defense against bacterial pathogens. The crosstalk between host cells infected with intracellular pathogens and NK cells has been studied intensively, but not much attention has been given to characterize the role of NK cells in the response to extracellular bacterial pathogens such as yersiniae. In this study we used antibody-mediated NK cell depletion to address the importance of this immune cell type in controlling a Y. pseudotuberculosis infection. Analysis of the bacterial counts was used to follow the infection and flow cytometry was performed to characterize the composition and dynamic of immune cells. Depletion of NK cells led to higher bacterial loads within the mesenteric lymph nodes. We further show that in particular CD11b+ CD27+ NK cells which express higher levels of the activation marker CD69 increase within the mesenteric lymph nodes during a Y. pseudotuberculosis infection. Moreover, in response to the activation NK cells secrete higher levels of IFNy, which in turn triggers the production of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFα. These results suggest, that NK cells aid in the clearance of Y. pseudotuberculosis infections mainly by triggering the expression of proinflammatory cytokines manipulating the host immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1163874211,"Bluetongue virus (BTV), a nonenveloped double-stranded RNA virus, is a potent inducer of type Ι interferons in multiple cell systems. In this study, we report that BTV16 treatment of primary human macrophages induced both type I and III IFN expression, resulting in the production of multiple antiviral factors, including myxovirus resistance protein A, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, and the IFN-stimulated gene 56. Additionally, BTV-treated macrophages expressed increased HIV restriction factors (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3 G/F/H) and CC chemokines (macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-β, regulated on activation of normal T cell expressed and secreted), the ligands for HIV entry coreceptor CC chemokine receptor type 5. BTV16 also induced the expression of tetherin, which restricts HIV release from infected cells. Furthermore, TLR3 signaling of macrophages by BTV16 resulted in the induction of several anti-HIV microRNAs (miRNA-28, -29a, -125b, -150, -223, and -382). More importantly, the induction of antiviral responses by BTV resulted in significant suppression of HIV in macrophages. These findings demonstrate the potential of BTV-mediated TLR3 activation in macrophage innate immunity against HIV."
https://openalex.org/W1861968939,"The diversity of plant species and their distribution in space are both thought to have important effects on the function of wetland ecosystems. However, knowledge of the relationships between plant species and spatial diversity remains incomplete. In this study, we investigated relationships between spatial pattern and plant species diversity over a five year period following the initial restoration of experimental wetland ecosystems. In 2003, six identical and hydrologically-isolated 0.18 ha wetland ""cells"" were constructed in former farmland in northeast Ohio. The systems were subjected to planting treatments that resulted in different levels of vascular plant species diversity among cells. Plant species diversity was assessed through annual inventories. Plant spatial pattern was assessed by digitizing low-altitude aerial photographs taken at the same time as the inventories. Diversity metrics derived from the inventories were significantly related to certain spatial metrics derived from the photographs, including cover type diversity and contagion. We found that wetlands with high cover type diversity harbor higher plant species diversity than wetlands with fewer types of patches. We also found significant relationships between plant species diversity and spatial patterning of patch types, but the direction of the effect differed depending on the diversity metric used. Links between diversity and spatial pattern observed in this study suggest that high-resolution aerial imagery may provide wetland scientists with a useful tool for assessing plant diversity."
https://openalex.org/W1962918695,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, members of the Kre2/Mnt1 protein family have been shown to be α-1,2-mannosyltransferases or α-1,2-mannosylphosphate transferases, utilising an Mn2+-coordinated GDP-mannose as the sugar donor and a variety of mannose derivatives as acceptors. Enzymes in this family are localised to the Golgi apparatus, and have been shown to be involved in both N- and O-linked glycosylation of newly-synthesised proteins, including cell wall glycoproteins. Our knowledge of the nine proteins in this family is however very incomplete at present. Only one family member, Kre2p/Mnt1p, has been studied by structural methods, and three (Ktr4p, Ktr5p, Ktr7p) are completely uncharacterised and remain classified only as putative glycosyltransferases. Here we use in vitro enzyme activity assays to provide experimental confirmation of the predicted glycosyltransferase activity of Ktr4p. Using GDP-mannose as the donor, we observe activity towards the acceptor methyl-α-mannoside, but little or no activity towards mannose or α-1,2-mannobiose. We also present the structure of the lumenal catalytic domain of S. cerevisiae Ktr4p, determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.2 Å, and the complex of the enzyme with GDP to 1.9 Å resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1884520562,"A recombinant Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV), Ar1b-HearNPV, was constructed and identified as an improved bio-control agent of Helicoverpa armigera larvae. The HearNPV polyhedrin promoter was used to express the insect-specific neurotoxin gene, ar1b, which was originally isolated from the Australian funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus). RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that both the ar1b transcript and protein were produced successfully in Ar1b-HearNPV-infected HzAM1 cells. In order to investigate the influence of foreign gene insertion in HearNPV, including the ar1b gene, chloramphenicol resistance gene, lacZ, kanamycin resistance gene, and the gentamicin resistance gene, two virus strains (HZ8-HearNPV and wt-HearNPV) were used as controls in the cell transfection analysis. As expected, foreign gene insertion had no impact on budded virus production and viral DNA replication. Both optical microscopy and electron microscopy observations indicated that the formation of the occlusion bodies of recombinant virus was similar to wild type virus. The Ar1b-HearNPV-infected H. armigera larvae exhibited paralysis and weight loss before dying. This recombinant virus also showed a 32.87% decrease in LT50 assays compared with the wild type virus. Besides, Ar1b-HearNPV also inhibited host larval growth and diet consumption. This inhibition was still significant in the older instar larvae treated with the recombinant virus. All of these positive properties of this novel recombinant HearNPV provide a further opportunity to develop this virus strain into a commercial product to control the cotton bollworm."
https://openalex.org/W2118401835,"The casitas b-lineage lymphoma (c-Cbl) is an important adaptor protein with an intrinsic E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that interacts with E2 proteins such as UbCH7. c-Cbl plays a vital role in regulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. c-Cbl involves in whole-body energy homeostasis, which makes it a potential target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. In the present study, we have designed two parental peptides and 55 modified peptides based on the structure of UbCH7 loop L1 and L2. Thirteen of the modified peptides showed increased inhibitory activity in a fluorescence polarization-based assay. In the in vivo proof of study principle, mice treated with peptides 10, 34, 49 and 51 were protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistant. These inhibitors may potentially lead to new therapeutic alternatives for obesity and type 2 diabetes."
