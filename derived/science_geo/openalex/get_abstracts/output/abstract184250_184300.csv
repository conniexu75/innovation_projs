The connections between known insulin signaling pathways and the protein machinery of this membrane-trafficking process have not been fully defined. Recently, we identified a 160-kDa protein in adipocytes, designated AS160, that is phosphorylated by the insulin-activated kinase Akt. This protein contains a GTPase-activating domain (GAP) for Rabs, which are small G proteins required for membrane trafficking. In the present study we have identified six sites of in vivo phosphorylation on AS160. These sites lie in the motif characteristic of Akt phosphorylation, and insulin treatment increased phosphorylation at five of the sites. Expression of AS160 with two or more of these sites mutated to alanine markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Moreover, this inhibition did not occur when the GAP function in the phosphorylation site mutant was inactivated by a point mutation. These findings strongly indicate that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AS160 is required for GLUT4 translocation and that this phosphorylation signals translocation through inactivation of the Rab GAP function.

GTPase-activating protein green fluorescence protein tandem mass spectrometry phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin Insulin rapidly stimulates glucose transport into fat and muscle cells by causing the insertion of additional glucose transporters of the GLUT4 isotype into the plasma membrane, in a process referred to as GLUT4 translocation. The overall process consists of generation of the specialized vesicles containing GLUT4 from the endosomal system, the movement of these vesicles from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane, and the fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane (1Zeigerer A.

The steps in this process that insulin accelerates, and the complete signaling pathways from the insulin receptor that lead to their acceleration, have not yet been fully defined. One partial insulin signaling pathway that has been established to be required for GLUT4 translocation is the pathway that proceeds from the receptor through tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrates to activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. The latter leads to the activation of the protein kinase Akt and also protein kinase C λ/ζ, and there is evidence that GLUT4 translocation requires the activation of one or both of these kinases (reviewed in Refs. 2Czech M.P.

Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, although a substrate linking either kinase to GLUT4 translocation has been sought for several years, hitherto none has been clearly identified. Recently, we reported the discovery of a new substrate for insulin-activated Akt in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which was designated AS160 for Akt subtrate of 160 kDa (4Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C.H. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22115-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The most prominent feature of AS160 is the presence of a GTPase activating domain for a Rab. Since Rabs are small G proteins that play critical roles in vesicle formation, movement, and fusion (5Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of AS160 in GLUT4 translocation. Our present results strongly indicate that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AS160 is required for GLUT4 translocation and also that an active GAP1 domain in AS160 is required for AS160 control of GLUT4 translocation. This study thus identifies AS160 as a new and likely key connection between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase insulin signaling pathway and the vesicle trafficking machinery in GLUT4 translocation. The plasmid encoding GLUT4 with an HA tag in an extracellular domain and GFP fused to the carboxyl terminus was as described in Ref. 6Dawson K. Aviles-Hernandez A. Cushman S.W. Malide D. Biochem.

Mutations in AS160 in this vector were made with the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

AS160 was purified from five 10-cm plates of unstimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from five plates treated with 160 nm insulin for 10 min. As described in detail in Ref. 4Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C.H.

Approximately 100 ng of AS160 were obtained in each case. The AS160 was digested in gel with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by microcapillary liquid chromatography MS/MS on an ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan LCQ DECA XP Plus), as described in Ref. 7Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neill T.B. Crick K.E. Pierce K.A. Lane W.S. Rathbun G. Livingston D.M. Weaver D.T. Nature. 2000; 405: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar. To detect a specific site of phosphorylation, targeted ion MS/MS was conducted for each putative phosphopeptide and the corresponding nonphosphorylated form. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts from the American Type Culture Collection were carried as fibroblasts and differentiated as described previously (4Kane S.

For transfections, cells at day 4 of differentiation were detached with 0.25 mg/ml trypsin, 0.5 mg/ml collagenase, washed with PBS, and electroporated in a 0.5-ml cuvette (cells from approximately one 10-cm plate) at 0.18 kV and 975 microfarads in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II with 75 μg HA-GLUT4-GFP and 100 μg FLAG-tagged AS160 plasmid. After electroporation the cells were plated in four wells of a six-well plate containing glass cover slips. After 24 h the cells were put into serum-free medium for 2 h, treated with 160 nm insulin or not for 30 min, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Approximately 20% of the cells were transfected, as assessed by the GFP fluorescence. For each AS160 plasmid co-transfected with the HA-GLUT4-GFP, the extent of co-transfection was assessed by permeablizing fixed cells with 0.2% saponin, staining with anti-FLAG followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin, and determining whether cells with GFP fluorescence also exhibited Cy3 fluorescence. Under these conditions, each cell expressing the HA-GLUT4-GFP also expressed FLAG-tagged AS160. In some experiments transfected, unfixed cells were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and immunoblotted for AS160, as described in Ref. 4Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C.H. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W.

The appearance of HA-GLUT4-GFP in the plasma membrane was detected by reaction of its extracellular HA tag with anti-HA and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin, according to the method described in Ref. 1Zeigerer A.

The fixed, nonpermeablized cells on coverslips were reacted with 5 μg/ml anti-HA in PBS, 2% fetal calf serum, washed, reacted with 1/800 dilution of the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody, washed, and mounted on slides. Fluorescence images on the GFP and Cy3 settings were acquired on a BX 51 Olympus microscope with a Sensicam QED CCD camera and analyzed with the IPLab software (Scanalytics). Ref. 8Wang L. Merz A.J. Collins K.M. Wicker W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1-12Google Scholar provides details of the microscopic equipment. Each transfected cell in a field was outlined, and its average Cy3 and GFP fluorescence intensities measured. The background intensities, measured from the same analysis of an untransfected cell in the same field, were subtracted. To normalize for differences in the expression of HA-GLUT4-GFP between cells, the Cy3 fluorescence intensity was then divided by the GFP fluorescence intensity for the same cell. A typical experiment consisted of transfecting aliquots from one preparation of cells with HA-GLUT4-GFP plus separately the 3×FLAG-CMV-10 vector, wild-type AS160 in this vector, and several mutants of AS160 in this vector. Cells from each combination were treated with insulin or left in the basal state, and the normalized Cy3 intensity was measured for at least 50 transfected cells from each condition on coded slides to obviate investigator bias. The -fold GLUT4 translocation was then calculated as the ratio of the average value of the normalized Cy3 intensity for the insulin state to that for the basal state, less 1.0. We have reported previously that AS160 isolated from insulin-treated cells was phosphorylated on Ser588 and Thr642 (4Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C.H. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22115-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To characterize the phosphorylation of AS160 more completely, we purified AS160 from basal and insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by immunoprecipitation with antibody against the carboxyl terminus, digested it with trypsin, and searched for predicted phosphopeptides by targeted ion MS/MS. We used the program Scansite to predict the likely sites of Akt phosphorylation (9Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and searched for the seven phosphopeptides corresponding to the sites with the best scores. Six of these phosphopeptides, as well as the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptides, were identified in both the basal and insulin samples, and the sites of phosphorylation were deduced (Fig. 1). The sequences surrounding the six sites in mouse AS160 are: RSRCSS318V, RRRHAS341A, RSLTSS570L, RGRLGS588M, RRRAHT642F, and RKRTSS751T. Thus, with the exception of Ser570, these sites are all in the RXRXXS/T motif preferred by Akt (9Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptide corresponding to a seventh possible Akt site at Ser597 was not detected, although the nonphosphorylated peptide was detected. To estimate the effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of each site, we measured the total ion intensities of each phosphorylated peptide and of the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide in the basal and insulin samples. For each sample, the total ion intensity of each phosphorylated peptide and that of the corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide were expressed as percentages of their combined total ion intensities. The ratio of these percentages for each phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated pair in the basal sample was then compared with the ratio in the insulin sample, to assess the effect of insulin on the extent of phosphorylation (7Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neill T.B. Crick K.E. Pierce K.A. Lane W.S. Rathbun G. Livingston D.M. Weaver D.T. Nature. 2000; 405: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These ratios were as follows (listed as phosphorylation site, ratio of percentage for phosphorylated form to that for nonphosphorylated form in the basal sample, corresponding ratio in the insulin sample): Ser318, 27/73, 76/24; Ser341, 80/20, 96/4; Ser570, 16/84, 46/54; Ser588, 14/86, 83/17; Thr642, 27/73, 74/26; and Thr751, 10/90, 75/25. Since the factor relating the total ion intensity of each peptide to its actual amount in the sample varies from peptide to peptide, these values do not give the actual molar ratios of phosphopeptide to nonphosphopeptide. Nevertheless, the large increase in this ratio in the insulin sample compared with that in the basal sample for the peptides encompassing Ser318, Ser570, Ser588, Thr642, and Thr751 demonstrates that insulin caused a marked increase in phosphorylation at these sites. Insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface was followed by immunofluorescence in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing HA-GLUT4-GFP. The extracellularly oriented HA epitope tag on the surface of fixed nonpermeablized cells was detected by labeling with anti-HA antibody followed by Cy3-labeled secondary antibody. The effects of wild-type AS160 and various mutants thereof on GLUT4 translocation were examined by cotransfecting the adipocytes with the AS160 plasmid and the HA-GLUT4-GFP plasmid. Fig. 2,top, shows representative images for cells transfected with vector, wild-type AS160, or AS160 in which four of the phosphorylation sites have been mutated to alanine (4P mutant). In the vector control, intracellular GLUT4, given by the GFP signal, was concentrated in the perinuclear region, and insulin treatment caused a marked increase in the GLUT4 at the cell surface, given by the Cy3 signal. The cells expressing wild-type AS160 appeared similar to the vector control. However, the cells expressing the 4P mutant exhibited a pronounced inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 appearance at the cell surface. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” images of the type in Fig. 2 were quantitated, and the -fold translocation of GLUT4 in response to insulin was calculated. Fig.3 summarizes the data from a number of experiments. In each experiment, the vector control was included, and the -fold translocation for it was determined. In 12 separate experiments the values for the control ranged from 3.1 to 13.6, with the median value at 6.7. Thus, in each experiment there was substantial translocation, but the -fold effect varied. The variation may be due to differences between passages of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To compare all the data, we have normalized the values for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to a value of 1.0 for the vector. Fig. 3 shows that expression of wild-type AS160 had no significant effect on translocation. However, expression of the 4P mutant markedly reduced translocation, to 21% of value for the vector control. Rab GAP domains contain an arginine residue that is critical for activity, and mutation of this residue to lysine abolishes activity (10Will E. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alignment of the GAP domain of AS160 with other Rab GAP domains (11Rak A. Fedorov R. Alexandrov K. Albert S. Goody R.S. Gallwitz D. Scheidig A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5105-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) showed that this key arginine is Arg973 of AS160. Consequently, we examined the effect of the expression of the R973K mutant (R/K) on GLUT4 translocation. In addition, the effect of mutations in both the phosphorylation sites and the GAP domain (4P, R/K) was examined. The mutation in the GAP domain by itself very slightly reduced translocation to 83% of the control value (Figs. 2and 3). However, this mutation in the context of the phosphorylation site mutations largely relieved the inhibition by the phosphorylation site mutations alone (Figs. 2 and 3). To be sure that differences in expression levels could not account for the effects of the various mutants, we immunoblotted SDS samples of the transfected cells for AS160, both with an antibody against the FLAG tag (Fig. 4, upper panel) and with an antibody against the carboxyl terminus of mouse AS160 (Fig. 4,lower panel). Approximately equal amounts of the wild-type and mutant forms of FLAG-tagged human AS160 were expressed. The blot with the antibody against the carboxyl terminus also showed the endogenous mouse AS160, which is of slightly greater mobility since it lacks the FLAG tag. From the relative signals in the lower panel of Fig. 4 and the ∼20% transfection efficiency, we estimate that the transfected cells express about 15 times more FLAG-tagged human AS160 than endogeneous mouse AS160. This estimate may be low if the antibody against the mouse AS160 carboxyl terminus does not react as well with the human AS160, which differs from mouse AS160 by four out of 12 amino acids in the carboxyl terminus. We also examined the effect of cumulative mutations to alanine of the six phosphorylation sites in AS160 on GLUT4 translocation. Most of the inhibition was achieved with the combined T588A and S642A mutations (Fig. 5). Our results show that AS160 undergoes a marked increase in phosphorylation at five sites in response to insulin. Since each site lies within the consensus sequence for Akt phosphorylation, and since we have shown previously that Akt phosphorylates the Thr642site (4Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C.H. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22115-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), it seems likely that activated Akt is responsible for phosphorylation at these sites, although it remains possible that one or more other insulin-activated kinases, such as protein kinase C λ/ζ, also participates. Expression of AS160 mutated at two or more of its phosphorylation sites markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, whereas equivalent expression of wild type AS160 had no effect. This result strongly indicates that phosphorylation of AS160 is necessary for GLUT4 translocation to occur. Expression of AS160 with combined mutations in the phosphorylation sites and the Rab GAP domain largely reversed the inhibition given by AS160 mutated at the phosphorylation sites alone. This result demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of AS160 mutated at its phosphorylation sites requires a functional Rab GAP domain. A hypothesis that explains these findings is the following: insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 requires a Rab in its active GTP form; in the unstimulated state this Rab is maintained in its inactive GDP form by the GAP domain of AS160; phosphorylation of AS160 inhibits its GAP activity toward this Rab, through an effect either on GAP function and/or on localization of the protein; as a consequence the GTP form of the Rab increases, and the Rab-dependent step(s) in GLUT4 translocation proceed. If the above hypothesis is correct, it might be thought that AS160 with an inactive GAP domain would trigger translocation in the absence of insulin, whereas in fact expression of the GAP mutant of AS160 did not have this effect. One possibility is that extent of expression of the GAP mutant was not sufficient for it to block the action of the endogenous AS160. A second possible explanation is that generation of the GTP form of a Rab is only one of several signals required for GLUT4 translocation. There is considerable evidence that a second signaling pathway involving activation of the Rho-type G protein TC10 and the rearrangement of cortical actin is required for GLUT4 translocation (3Khan A.H. Pessin J.E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This pathway is independent of Akt activation. In addition, there is suggestive evidence that Akt phosphorylation of the syntaxin 4-interacting protein Synip may be required for GLUT4 translocation (12Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elemendorf J.S.

Ohshima K. Pessin J.E. Mori M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: A44Google Scholar). This study indicates that AS160 is a key component linking the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase insulin signaling pathway to the vesicle trafficking machinery in GLUT4 translocation. In the future it will be important to identify the Rab(s) on which AS160 acts and to determine whether phosphorylation of AS160 directly inhibits its GAP activity. Rab4 and Rab11 are present in the intracellular vesicles that contain GLUT4 (reviewed in Ref. 14Cormont M. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consequently these two Rabs are candidates to be substrates for the GAP function of AS160. We are currently attempting to determine whether AS160 exhibits GAP activity toward either of these Rabs or toward another one of the ∼60 Rabs present in mammals (5Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar).

In humans, mucosa covers a vast surface area (∼400 m3), and the body produces more SIgA each day than all other antibodies combined (66 mg kg-1 day-1) (1Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). SIgA occurs mainly as a dimer in which the two IgA molecules are joined together via a small (16 kDa) J chain (joining chain) (2Johansen F.E. Braathen R. Brandtzaeg P. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), which is linked to the terminal cysteine of one heavy (H) chain on each IgA. The dimeric IgA with attached J chain is produced in plasma cells close to the epithelium. The epithelial cells express the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) that binds to dimeric IgA; this complex is then translocated across the epithelial cell. During translocation disulfide bonding occurs between the pIgR and one H chain. On reaching the mucosal surface, the (50-90-kDa) secretory component (SC) is cleaved from the pIgR transmembrane tail, and the whole IgA/J chain/SC (SIgA) complex is secreted (3Norderhaug I.N. Johansen F.E. Schjerven H. Brandtzaeg P. Crit. Rev. Immumol. 1999; 19: 481-508PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SIgA is a multi-polypeptide complex originating from two cell types (3Norderhaug I.N. Johansen F.E. Schjerven H. Brandtzaeg P. Crit. Rev. Immumol. 1999; 19: 481-508PubMed Google Scholar). This is in contrast to serum IgA, which is predominantly monomeric and lacks the J chain and SC.There are two isotypic forms of IgA: IgA1 and IgA2. Both forms contain two conserved N-glycan sites per H chain, one at Asn263 in the Cα2 domain and one on the terminal amino acid (Asn459) of its 18-amino acid tail piece (compared with IgG, IgA has an extra 18 amino acids on the C-terminal of the H chain). There are two allotypes of IgA2, IgA2m(1) and IgA2m(2), that contain further conserved N-glycan sites: one on the Cα2 domain and one or two on the Cα1 domain respectively (1Kerr M.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). SC is highly glycosylated, it has seven N-glycan sites, and sugars contribute up to 25% of its molecular mass, whereas the J chain has only one N-glycan site (3Norderhaug I.N. Johansen F.E. Schjerven H. Brandtzaeg P. Crit. Rev. Immumol. 1999; 19: 481-508PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, IgA1 has a 23-amino acid, proline-rich hinge region with nine potential O-glycosylation sites (serine and threonine residues) of which three to five sites have been shown to be occupied in serum IgA1 (4Baenziger J.

IgA2 lacks this 13-amino acid hinge region and is not O-glycosylated.A newborn child relies on passive immunity from the SIgA in its mother's milk until its own immune system has matured. The SIgA in colostrum and milk binds to microorganisms, their metabolic products and toxins, preventing their attachment to the gut epithelium and facilitating their expulsion in the feces, a process known as immune exclusion (8Lamm M.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 311-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The adhesion of many pathogenic organisms to mucosal membrane cells is mediated by adhesins on their surface. These are lectin-like receptors that can bind to complementary carbohydrate constituents expressed by the host tissues (9Sharon N. Ofek I. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For example, S-fimbriated Escherichia coli, which causes sepsis and meningitis in newborns, can be prevented from binding to epithelial cells, independently of the antigen-binding sites, by sialylated glycans on SIgA that bind to the pathogen (10Schroten H. Stapper C. Plogmann R. Kohler H. Hacker J. Hanisch F.G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3971-3973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fucose, linked α1-2 to galactose as in Lewisb and Lewisy epitopes, on SC N-glycans compete with Helicobacter pylori for binding to gastric receptors (11Falk P. Roth K.A. Boren T. Westblom T.U.

Tomana M. Kobata A. Ohbayashi H. Endo T. Eden C.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3073-3077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to an increased interest in the use of orally administered recombinant SIgA for passive immunization against virulent pathogens such as C. difficile and Neisseria meningitis (18Corthesy B. Trends. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Corthesy B. Spertini F. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, accurately defining glycan structures is a prerequisite to understanding their binding properties, particularly because proteins made in different cell types are differently glycosylated, and this can have major implications when producing engineered antibodies (20Wright A. Morrison S.L. Trends. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 26-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).In this paper we present the first total N-and O-glycan analysis of each of the different peptide chains (H, J, and SC) from the same sample of normal pooled human SIgA. Sensitive analytical procedures have enabled us to identify minor components of the glycan pool in addition to confirming the major glycan structures found by previous investigators (21Pierce-Cretel A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4063-4071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The O-glycans on the H chain and the N-glycans on SC presented a wide range of epitopes for adhesin binding. Over 75% of the N-glycans on the J chain were sialylated, whereas over 66% of the N-glycans on the H chain were truncated complex structures with free terminal GlcNAcs.On the basis of these data we have constructed a molecular model of SIgA1 with its glycans attached, in which the Fab arms form a T shape and the SC is wrapped around the H chains. This model shows that glycans cover most of the SIgA1 complex with the exception of the Fab regions. Each SIgA1 molecule has several sites for binding to pathogens. In addition to the four Fab antigen-binding sites (adaptive immunity), there are two O-glycosylated regions containing up to 10 glycans per region and SC with seven N-glycans, which present a wide range of sugar epitopes capable of binding to adhesins (innate immunity).Our model of SIgA1 shows the SC wrapped around the H chains, masking the H chain N-glycans, which are truncated complex structures with free terminal GlcNAc residues. These GlcNAc residues are potential ligands for lectins such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL). MBL is a calcium-dependent serum lectin that is able to bind to d-mannose, l-fucose, GlcNAc, and N-acetylmannoseamine, recognizing two common equatorial hydroxyl groups (29Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Binding of MBL to microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, and yeast species, can induce activation of the complement system via the lectin pathway, thus leading to target opsonization. MBL represents a key component of the innate immune system, as illustrated by the increased susceptibility to infections occurring in MBL-deficient individuals (30Petersen S.V. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Mol. Immunol. 2001; 38: 133-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recently, binding of the lectin domain of MBL to polymeric serum IgA has been reported (31Roos A. Bouwman L.H. van Gijlswijk-Janssen D.J. Faber-Krol M.C. Stahl G.L. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2861-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We show that MBL does not bind to SIgA at neutral pH, supporting the proposal that SC is masking the H chain N glycans, and that disruption the SC-IgA noncovalent interactions, by preincubation at pH 3, unmasks the H chain N-glycans, allowing MBL to bind.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSecretory IgA—;Pooled human SIgA, purified from colostrum, was obtained from Sigma. The secretory IgA complex was reduced, alkylated, and then separated into SC, J chain, H chain, and light chain by reducing SDS-PAGE (80 × 80 × 1 mm, 10% BisTris NuPAGE gel, MES SDS running buffer (Invitrogen)). The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. MultiMark molecular mass standards were used (Invitrogen). Relative amounts of IgA1 and IgA2 were determined by ELISA according to Ref. 32de Fijter J.W. van den Wall Bake A.W. Braam C.A. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. J. Immunol.

LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS spectra were recorded from a Waters CapLC interfaced with a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer fitted with a Z-spray electrospray ion source (Waters-Micromass) and operated in positive ion mode. A 1 × 150-mm microbore NP HPLC column was packed with stationary phase material from a GlycoSep N column (Oxford GlycoSciences). The same solvents and gradient were used as for standard NP HPLC but with a flow rate of 40 μl/min (37Royle L. Mattu T.S. Hart E. Langridge J.I. Merry A.H. Murphy N. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 70-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).MBL Binding Experiments—;MBL and polymeric serum IgA were purified from human donor plasma exactly as described previously (31Roos A. Bouwman L.H. van Gijlswijk-Janssen D.J. Faber-Krol M.C. Stahl G.L. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2861-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Binding of MBL to immobilized IgA was performed by ELISA, as described (31Roos A. Bouwman L.H. van Gijlswijk-Janssen D.J. Faber-Krol M.C. Stahl G.L. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2861-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In brief, IgA was coated on ELISA plates using a carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). As a negative control, the plates were coated with purified human serum albumin (Central Laboratory of Bloodtransfusion (Sanquin), Amsterdam, the Netherlands). After each step, the plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. MBL was diluted in BVB++ (1.8 mm sodium 5,5-diethylbarbital, 0.2 mm 5,5-diethylbarbituric acid, 145 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) and incubated in the plates for 1 h at 37 °. In some experiments, coated wells were pretreated with buffers of different pH (0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0-5.0, containing 0.15 m NaCl) for 5-60 min at 37 °, followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween and the addition of MBL as indicated above. Furthermore, inhibition experiments were performed using 10 mm EDTA or 50 mm d-mannose, which were preincubated with MBL for 40 min at room temperature before the addition of MBL to the plate. Binding of MBL was examined using monoclonal antibody 3E7 directed against MBL (mouse IgG1, kindly provided by Dr. T. Fujita, Fukushima, Japan), conjugated to digoxygenin (Roche Applied Science), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-digoxygenin antibodies (Fab fragments; Roche Applied Science). Enzyme activity of horseradish peroxidase was detected using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (from Sigma), and the A values at 415 nm were measured.Molecular Modeling—;Molecular modeling was performed on a Silicon Graphics Fuel work station using InsightII and Discover software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The figures were produced using the program Molscript (43Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar). Crystal structures used as the basis for modeling were obtained from the Brookhaven data base (44Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26684) Google Scholar). N- and O-glycan structures were generated using the data base of glycosidic linkage conformations (45Petrescu A.J. Petrescu S.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and in vacuo energy minimization to relieve unfavorable steric interactions. The Asn-GlcNAc linkage conformations were based on the observed range of crystallographic values (46Imberty A. Perez S. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the torsion angles around the Asn Cα-Cβ and Cβ-Cγ bonds then being adjusted to eliminate unfavorable steric interactions between the glycans and the protein surface.RESULTSDetermination of the Relative Amounts of IgA1 and IgA2 in SIgA—;The percentages of IgA1 (39%) and IgA2 (61%) in the total SIgA from pooled human colostrum were determined by ELISA (data not shown).Separation and Identification of SIgA Component Proteins—; Pooled normal human SIgA from colostrum was resolved into SC, H, L, and J chains by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Tryptic peptides were sequenced to confirm the identity of the proteins in the gel bands (Table I). The J chain migrated with a higher apparent molecular mass than 16 kDa, in agreement with results by Chuang and Morrison (47Chuang P.D. Morrison S.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 724-732PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2SIgA (7 μg/lane) was reduced, alkylated, and then run on a 10% BisTris gel. The N-glycans were released by in-gel N-glycosidase F digestion, 2AB-labeled, and run on NP HPLC. The HPLC traces are all on the same scale, so the relative size (GU) and abundance of N-glycans can be compared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIdentification of gel bands (shown inFig. 1) by nanospray-quadrupole time-of-flight-MS/MS of tryptic peptides followed by MASCOT search of NCBI data baseGel bandIdentificationAccession numberProtein covered%aPolymeric immunoglobulin receptor1363832010bIgA H chain constant regionAAC8252839cIg λ chainS2573634dImmunoglobulin J chainP015916 Open table in a new tab N-Glycan Analysis—;Fig. 2 shows the NP HPLC profiles of the pools of glycans released from the different gel bands. The glucose unit (GU) scale indicates the relative size of the glycans (the larger the GU, the larger the glycan). The N-glycans from the H chains ranged between GU 5 and 7; SC had the largest glycans (GU 6-12), whereas the J chain glycans were GU 6-9. Because there is only one glycosylation site per J chain and one J chain per SIgA, the abundance of glycans is lower; the light chain had negligible levels of N-glycosylation.The preliminary assignment of structures was made by comparing GU values with standards and confirmed by following the elution positions (measured in GU) of peaks through the different exoglycosidase arrays and by mass spectrometry (37Royle L.

In Tables II, III, IV, V, VI, the relative amounts of glycans in the pool released from each peptide can be found in the column headed “Undig.” To detect the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc residue, both Jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and S. pneumonia β-N-acetylhexosaminidase digestions were performed. Jack bean β-N-acetylhexosaminidase does not digest glycans with bisecting GlcNAc, whereas S. pneumonia β-N-acetylhexosaminidase does digest bisected biantennary glycans but is inefficient at digesting tri- or tetra-antennary structures with GlcNAc β1-4 or 1-6 linked to mannose under the conditions used in this paper (data not shown). The presence of bisecting GlcNAc was also confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).Table IIAnalysis of the N-glycans from H chainView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table IIIAnalysis of the N-glycans from J chainView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table IVAnalysis of the N-glycans from SCView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table VAnalysis of the O-glycans from SIgA1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Table VIAnalysis of the O-glycans from SIgA1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab H Chain N-Glycans—;Over 75% of the H chain N-glycans contain a bisecting GlcNAc, 66% contain a free terminal GlcNAc on one antenna, less than 20% of structures were fully galactosylated, less than 15% were sialylated (only α2-6 sialic acids detected), no glycans contained outer arm fucose residues, all galactose residues were β1-4-linked, about half the structures contained core fucose, and there were about 12% of oligomannose structures (Figs. 3 and 4 and Table II).

Crystallization of phosphorylated β-phosphoglucomutase in the presence of the Mg(II) cofactor and either of the substrates glucose 1-phosphate or glucose 6-phosphate produced crystals of the enzyme–Mg(II)–glucose 1,6-(bis)phosphate complex, which diffracted x-rays to 1.2 and 1.4 angstroms, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2061106825,"12-Hydroxyjasmonate, also known as tuberonic acid, was first isolated from Solanum tuberosum and was shown to have tuber-inducing properties. It is derived from the ubiquitously occurring jasmonic acid, an important signaling molecule mediating diverse developmental processes and plant defense responses. We report here that the gene AtST2a from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a hydroxyjasmonate sulfotransferase. The recombinant AtST2a protein was found to exhibit strict specificity for 11- and 12-hydroxyjasmonate with Km values of 50 and 10 μm, respectively. Furthermore, 12-hydroxyjasmonate and its sulfonated derivative are shown to be naturally occurring inA. thaliana. The exogenous application of methyljasmonate to A. thaliana plants led to increased levels of both metabolites, whereas treatment with 12-hydroxyjasmonate led to increased level of 12-hydroxyjasmonate sulfate without affecting the endogenous level of jasmonic acid. AtST2a expression was found to be induced following treatment with methyljasmonate and 12-hydroxyjasmonate. In contrast, the expression of the methyljasmonate-responsive gene Thi2.1, a marker gene in plant defense responses, is not induced upon treatment with 12-hydroxyjasmonate indicating the existence of independent signaling pathways responding to jasmonic acid and 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid. Taken together, the results suggest that the hydroxylation and sulfonation reactions might be components of a pathway that inactivates excess jasmonic acid in plants. Alternatively, the function of AtST2a might be to control the biological activity of 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid. 12-Hydroxyjasmonate, also known as tuberonic acid, was first isolated from Solanum tuberosum and was shown to have tuber-inducing properties. It is derived from the ubiquitously occurring jasmonic acid, an important signaling molecule mediating diverse developmental processes and plant defense responses. We report here that the gene AtST2a from Arabidopsis thaliana encodes a hydroxyjasmonate sulfotransferase. The recombinant AtST2a protein was found to exhibit strict specificity for 11- and 12-hydroxyjasmonate with Km values of 50 and 10 μm, respectively. Furthermore, 12-hydroxyjasmonate and its sulfonated derivative are shown to be naturally occurring inA. thaliana.

Hause B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 165-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plants respond to the exogenous application of JA or methyljasmonate (MeJA) by the development of senescence-like symptoms and by the up-regulation of a large number of genes including genes coding for plant defense proteins such as thionins and proteinase inhibitors or enzymes involved in phytoalexin synthesis (2Wasternack C. Parthier B. Trends Plant Sci. 1997; 2: 302-307Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of JA occurs through the octadecanoid pathway and starts with the oxidation of α-linolenic acid to yield 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid (3Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 458-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hydroperoxide is then dehydrated and cyclized to the cyclopentanone 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA). Reduction of OPDA by OPDA reductase 3 followed by three cycles of β-oxidation yield JA. JA can undergo several modification reactions, the best studied being methylation at carbon 1 to yield MeJA (4Seo H.S. Song J.T. Cheong J.-J. Lee Y.-H. Lee Y.-W. Hwang I. Lee J.S. Choi Y.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4788-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In addition to the formation of the methyl ester, the biotransformation of JA involves five major reactions (5Sembdner G. Atzorn R. Schneider G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1459-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar): (i) hydroxylation at carbon 11 or carbon 12 to form 11-hydroxyjasmonic acid (11-OHJA) or 12-hydroxyjasmonic acid (12-OHJA); (ii) reduction of the keto group at carbon 6 to form cucurbic acid (CA), which can also be hydroxylated on the side chain; (iii) O-glycosylation of the above hydroxylated compounds; (iv) conjugation of JA or its hydroxylated derivatives with amino acids (5Sembdner G. Atzorn R. Schneider G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1459-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), tyramine (6Miersch O. Knofel H.D. Schmidt J. Kramell R. Parthier B. Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 327-329Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), or adenylate (7Staswick P.E. Tiryaki I. Rowe M.L. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar); and (v) degradation of the carboxylic acid side chain to form cis-jasmone (8Koch T. Bandemer K. Boland W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1997; 80: 838-850Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Some of these reactions might lead to the irreversible inactivation of JA, whereas others might be reversible and used for transport and/or storage. Alternatively, the metabolism of JA might generate molecules with new properties. For instance, the 12-O-β-d-glucopyranoside of 12-OHJA was shown to induce tuber formation in vitro (9Yoshihara T. Omer E.-S.A. Koshino H. Sakamura S. Kikuta Y. Koda Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2835-2837Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and the degradation of JA to cis-jasmone was found to affect the plant defense response to herbivores by stimulating the activity of parasitic insects (10Birkett M.A. Campbell C.A. Chamberlain K. Guerrieri E. Hick A.J. Martin J.L. Matthes M. Napier J.A. Pettersson J. Pickett J.A. Poppy G.M. Pow E.M. Pye B.J. Smart L.E. Wadhams G.H. Wadhams L.J. Woodcock C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9329-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a distinct ratio of several octadecanoid-derived compounds, the so-called “oxylipin signature” may have a biological significance. For instance, such a signature was found to be different among various plant species (11Weber H. Vick B.A. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and attributed to distinct defense status (12Stintzi A. Weber H. Reymond P. Browse J. Farmer E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12837-12842Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and varied also in the same species during development (13Hause B. Stenzel I. Miersch O. Maucher H. Kramell R. Ziegler J. Wasternack C. Plant J. 2000; 24: 113-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A sulfated conjugate of 12-OHJA was found to accumulate in the plant species Tribulus cistoides, a member of the Zygophylaceae family (14Achenbach H. Hübner H. Brandt W. Reiter M. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 1527-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is the only report on the occurrence of a conjugate of 12-OHJA in a plant species that does not produce tubers. Furthermore, it is the only report of the occurrence of a jasmonate conjugated with a sulfonate group. In mammals, it is well recognized that the sulfonation reaction plays an important role in the modulation of the biological activity of a number of compounds, such as steroids and thyroid hormones, and catecholamine neurotransmitters (15Hobkirk R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Strott C.A. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 17: 670-697Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Visser T.J. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1994; 92: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Roth J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1986; 7: 404-407Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Sulfonate conjugation not only facilitates transport and excretion of hydrophobic molecules by increasing their water solubility, it abolishes the biological activity of hormones such as estrogens. Recently, the characterization of a brassinosteroid sulfotransferase (ST) from Brassica napus demonstrated that plants like animals use the sulfonation reaction to control the biological activity of hormones (19Rouleau M. Marsolais F. Richard M. Nicolle L. Voigt B. Adam G. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20925-20930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The sulfonation reaction can also lead to the production of biologically active molecules. For example, the sulfonation of gallic acid glucoside generates the periodic leaf movement factor 1 involved in the seismonastic response in Mimosa pudica (20Varin L. Chamberland H. Lafontaine J.G. Richard M. Plant J. 1997; 4: 831-837Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, we initiated a systematic investigation of the biochemical functions of the 18 ST-coding genes from Arabidopsis thaliana. We report here the characterization of a ST (AtST2a) from this plant exhibiting strict specificity for hydroxyjasmonates. This is the first report of a ST involved in jasmonate metabolism. We also demonstrate that 12-OHJA and its sulfate derivative are natural constituents in A. thaliana. We propose a role for the hydroxyjasmonate ST in the regulation of the levels of JA and/or 12-OHJA in plants. 12-OHJA, JA isoleucine conjugate, CA, 7-iso-CA, 6-epi-CA, 6-epi-7-iso-CA, and their methyl esters, were from our laboratory collection. MeJA and JA were purchased from Bedoukian Research Inc. and Sigma, respectively. Wild type A. thaliana seeds, ecotype Col-0, were obtained from Lehle Seeds. The enzymes used for cloning were from New England Biolabs and used under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. All reagents were of analytical or molecular biology grade. cDNA clone of AtST2a (GenBankTMaccession number T43254) was obtained from the ArabidopsisBiological Resource Center. Oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCTACCTCAAGCATGAAG-3′ was designed to introduce aBamHI site at the 5′-end of the coding sequence.AtST2a was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the above primer and M13-20 primer. The amplified product was digested with BamHI and ligated into the BamHI site of the bacterial expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen). Clones containing AtST2a in the proper orientation were determined by restriction enzyme analysis and by sequencing the 5′ junction. DNA and protein sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW program 2dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu:/multialign/multi-align.html. and the similarity/identity values determined from the pairwise comparisons of all the ST genes. Boxshade was used to shade identical residues in the alignments. 3www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html. A culture of E. coli, strain XL1-blue harboringAtST2a (A600 = 0.7) was induced with 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 10 h at 22 °C. Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl and 14 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The cells were lysed by sonication and the recombinant proteins were recovered in the soluble fraction by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The soluble recombinant AtST2a protein was purified by affinity chromatography onto nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose matrix as recommended (Qiagen). The Ni-agarose-purified protein was desalted on a PD-10 (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated in 25 mm bis-Tris (pH 6.5) (buffer A). The desalted protein was chromatographed on a PAP-agarose column (0.5 × 10 cm) previously equilibrated in buffer A. The bound protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Affinity chromatography was performed on a Waters 625 LC HPLC system and protein absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. AtST2a eluted at ∼450 mm NaCl. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as reference protein. 15-Day-old plants grown on MS medium in magenta boxes were treated with 100 μm 12-OHJA or MeJA for a period of 8 h. At the end of the treatment, rosette leaves (about 2 g) were harvested, ground in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in 10 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m bis-Tris (pH 6.5). The homogenate was filtered through nylon mesh and the filtrate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was gently stirred for 10 min with 0.5 ml of PAP-agarose pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 ×g on a benchtop microcentrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and replaced with 1 ml of 0.5 m bis-Tris (pH 6.5) containing 1.0 m NaCl. The solution was gently stirred for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was used for enzyme activity. Analysis of substrate specificity was performed by testing enzymatic activity with three different concentrations of acceptor substrates: 1, 10, and 100 μm. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 pmol of [35S]PAPS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and ∼0.25 μg of PAP-agarose-purified recombinant AtST2a in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). For substrate interaction kinetic experiments, concentrations of PAPS were 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 μm. Concentrations of 11-OHJA were 10, 30, 50, 80, and 150 μm and 12-OHJA were 2, 6, 10, 15, and 50 μm. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 25 °C. Under the assay conditions, the reaction was linear with time from 0 to 40 min and with protein concentrations ranging from 0 to 2.0 μg/assay. The AtST2a-sulfated reaction product was extracted with 1-butanol saturated with water and an aliquot was counted for radioactivity in scintillation fluid. Rosette leaves from fresh plant material (1 g) were homogenized with 10 ml of methanol containing 100 ng of [2H6]JA and 12-[2H3]OAc-JA as internal standards. The filtrate was evaporated and acetylated with pyridine/acetic acid anhydride (2:1) at 20 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was evaporated, resuspended in ethyl acetate, and loaded on a silica (SiOH) column (500 mg; Machery-Nagel). The flow-through containing JA and the acetylated form of 12-OHJA was collected and evaporated. The evaporated mixture was resuspended in 5 ml of methanol and loaded on a 3-ml DEAE-Sephadex A25 column (acetylated-form in methanol). The column was washed with 3 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of 0.1 macetic acid in methanol. The jasmonates were eluted with 5 ml of 1m acetic acid in methanol (Fraction A), evaporated, and separated on preparative HPLC for GC-MS analysis. The SiOH column was washed with methanol and the flow-through (Fraction B) was collected for analysis of 12-OHJA sulfate. Fraction B was evaporated, resuspended in 10% acetonitrile, and chromatographed by reverse phase HPLC (method gradient, 10–90% acetonitrile in 15 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min). Fractions were collected from 4.5 to 7 min, evaporated, and resuspended in 50 μl of methanol and analyzed by LC-MS. Fraction A eluted from the DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column was subjected to preparative HPLC column, Eurospher 100-C18 (5 μm, 250 × 4 mm). Jasmonates were eluted with methanol, 0.2% acetic acid in H2O (1:1) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and UV detection at 210 nm. Fractions betweenRt 9.15 and 11 min containing 12-OAc-JA and between 12 and 13.30 min containing JA were collected and evaporated. The samples were dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform/N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1:1) and derivatized with 10 μl of pentafluorobenzylbromide at 20 °C overnight. The evaporated derivatized samples were dissolved in 5 ml ofn-hexane and passed through a SiOH column (500 mg; Machery-Nagel). The pentafluorobenzyl esters were eluted with 7 ml ofn-hexane/diethyl ether (2:1), evaporated, dissolved in 100 μl of acetonitrile, and analyzed by GC-MS. The following parameters were used for GC-MS: GCQ Finnigan, 70 eV, NCI, ionization gas NH3, source temperature 140 °C, column Rtx-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness), injection temperature was 250 °C, interface temperature was 275 °C; helium 40 cm s−1; splitless injection; column temperature program: 1 min 60 °C, 25° min−1 to 180 °C, 5° min−1 to 270 °C, 1 min 270 °C, 10° min−1 to 300 °C, 25 min 300 °C. The retention time of 12-[2H3]OAc-JA-pentafluorobenzyl ester was 20.61 min and 12-OAc-JA-pentafluorobenzyl ester was 20.66 min, using fragments m/z 270 (standard) andm/z 267 for quantitation. The retention time of [2H6]JA-pentafluorobenzyl ester was 14.66 min, and JA-pentafluorobenzyl ester was 14.72 min, using fragmentsm/z 215 (standard) andm/z 210 for quantitation. The negative ion electrospray (ES) mass spectra were obtained from a Finnigan MAT TSQ 7000 instrument (electrospray voltage, 4 kV; heated capillary temperature, 220 °C; sheath gas, nitrogen) coupled with a Micro-Tech Ultra-Plus MicroLC system equipped with a RP18 column (4 μm, 1 × 100 mm, Ultrasep). For HPLC, a gradient was used starting from H2O:acetonitrile (90:10; containing 0.2% acetic acid) to 10:90 in 15 min followed by a 10-min isocratic period at a flow rate of 70 μl/min. The collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra during the HPLC run were performed with a collision energy of 30 eV (collision gas, argon; collision pressure, 1.8 × 10−3 torr). All mass spectra are averaged and background subtracted. The following results were obtained: 12-OHJA sulfate,Rt (LC-MS), 12.32 min, negative electrospray MSm/z (relative intensity), 305 ([M − H]−, 100); CID spectrum, 225 (93), 147 (9Yoshihara T. Omer E.-S.A. Koshino H. Sakamura S. Kikuta Y. Koda Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 2835-2837Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), 97 (100), 59 (58). For the determination of 12-OHJA sulfate in plant material, the daughter ions at m/z 225, 97, and 59 were measured in the selected ion monitoring mode. The CID spectrum of 12-OHJA sulfate displays significant ions at m/z225, 97, and 59 reflecting the typical structural features of the compound. The ion at m/z 97 represents a key ion in the negative CID mass spectra of sulfated compounds (21Boss B. Richling E. Herderich M. Schreier P. Phytochemistry. 1999; 50: 219-225Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rosette leaves of A. thaliana plants were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted in buffer/phenol/chloroform as described (22Cashmore A.R. Edelman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, New York1982: 387-392Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was used for agarose gel electrophoresis after denaturing with glyoxal and Me2SO (23McMaster G.K. Carmicheal G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4835-4839Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total RNA was achieved under high stringency conditions according to standard procedures (24Sambrook J.F. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using the 32P-labeled coding sequence of AtST2a as a probe. To verify the solubility and evaluate the level of purity of the recombinant protein after chromatography on nickel-agarose and PAP-agarose, aliquots of the recombinant enzyme were subjected to 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. 2.5 μg of total RNA was treated with 20 units of DNase I (Roche Diagnostics) in 50 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, 5 mm MgSO4 (pH 5.0) for 10 min at 37 °C. DNase I was heat inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min and RNA was ethanol precipitated. cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) in a 25-μl reaction volume as recommended by the manufacturer. 1 μl of room temperature reaction product was used for PCR with Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Biochemicals). Oligonucleotides (119G6) 5′-GGAGAGAGGATGGAGAAC-3′ and (119–800) 5′-CGTCTTTGAGATCCTCGTACC-3′ were used to amplify AtST2a in reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments. Oligonucleotides (Thi2.1 5′) 5′-GGTGTATGCAAGTGAGTGGATG-3′ and (Thi2.1 3′) 5′-GACACATGCACACACACACAC-3′ were used to amplify the Thi2.1(GenBankTM accession number L41244) gene from A. thaliana. The AtST2a cDNA (GenBankTM accession number T43254) was obtained from theArabidopsis Biological Resource Center. AtST2a is localized on chromosome V and can be retrieved from the GenBankTM data base under accession number AB010697 from nucleotides 53,936 to 55,015. It is flanked by an open reading frame encoding another putative ST, AtST2b from nucleotides 50,627 to 51,670. AtST2a and AtST2b encode proteins of 359 and 347 amino acids corresponding to molecular masses of 41.3 and 39.6 kDa, respectively. The AtST2a and AtST2bdeduced protein sequences contain all the domains known to be involved in the binding of the sulfonate donor PAPS and in catalysis (Fig.1) (26Marsolais F. Gidda S.K. Boyd J. Varin L. Rec. Adv. Phytochem. 2000; 34: 433-456Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment indicates that they share 85% amino acid sequence identity and 92% similarity, suggesting that they might be isozymes with similar substrate specificities. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the amino acids known to interact with the sulfonate acceptor substrate are identical between the two sequences (26Marsolais F. Gidda S.K. Boyd J. Varin L. Rec. Adv. Phytochem. 2000; 34: 433-456Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The AtST2a and -b proteins share 45% sequence identity with the A. thaliana and B. napus 24-epibrassinosteroid STs, 40% sequence identity with the flavonol STs of Flaveria species, and ∼25% sequence identity with the mammalian STs. To characterize the biochemical function of AtST2a, we studied the activity of purified recombinant AtST2a expressed in E. coli. The histidine-tagged AtST2a enzyme could be purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of nickel- and PAP-agarose chromatography (Fig.2) (27Marsolais F. Varin L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30458-30463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant AtST2a enzyme was used to test a variety of acceptor molecules of plant and mammalian origin. The substrate library comprises more than 100 compounds and includes phenolic acids, desulfoglucosinolates, flavonoids, steroids, gibberellic acids, phenylpropanoids, hydroxyjasmonates, and coumarins, to mention a few. AtST2a was found to exhibit strict specificity for 11- and 12-OHJA (Fig.3). No activity could be detected with the remaining compounds of the library. The enzyme did not accept structurally related jasmonates such as 12-OHJA methyl ester, CA, 7-iso-CA, 6-epi-CA, 6-epi-7-iso-CA, and their methyl esters. Furthermore, the AtST2a enzyme did not sulfonate the structurally related mammalian prostaglandin E2, arachidonyl alcohol, and 11-eicosenol. AtST2b was also expressed in E. coli and could be recovered in a soluble form. No activity was observed with all the substrates tested including 11- and 12-OHJA. This result is surprising when we consider the high level of sequence identity with AtST2a and the presence of all the amino acids known to be required for cosubstrate binding and catalysis (28Marsolais F. Laviolette M. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Auger M. Varin L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4066-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Other substrates related in structure to 11- and 12-OHJA will have to be tested to determine the biochemical function of this enzyme.Figure 3Mass spectrum of 12-OHJA sulfate obtained byCID with 30 eV energy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the pH optimum of AtST2a enzyme activity, the sulfonation of 12-OHJA was carried out at fixed substrate (50 μm) and PAPS (5 μm) concentrations in buffers ranging from pH 6 to 10. Highest enzyme activity was observed at pH 7.5 in Tris buffer. However, the enzyme is active in a broad pH range and retains ∼80% activity at pH 9.5. The kinetic parameters of AtST2a were determined from the results of substrate interaction kinetic experiments. AtST2a exhibited preference for 12-OHJA over 11-OHJA with Km values of 10 and 50 μm, respectively. Double reciprocal plots with 12-OHJA as the variable substrate at several fixed concentrations of PAPS resulted in an intersecting pattern (data not shown). A similar pattern was obtained with PAPS as the variable substrate and the secondary slope, and intercept replots were linear. As calculated from the replots, theVmax for the conversion of 12-OHJA to 12-OHJA sulfate was 37.5 pkatal/mg of protein. The Km value for PAPS was found to be 1 μm. Because JA is structurally similar to 12-OHJA, we tested if it could act as a competitive inhibitor in enzyme assays. The assays were performed with a fixed concentration of 12-OHJA (50 μm) and variable concentrations of JA (0.1–100 μm). Addition of JA had no effect on the amount of product formed (data not shown), indicating that JA does not interfere with the binding of 12-OHJA at the enzyme active site. To date, the presence of 12-OHJA has been reported to occur only in tuber-producing plant species (29Yoshihara T. Amanuma M. Tsutsumi T. Okumura Y. Matsura H. Ichihara A. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 586-590Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in the fungusBotryodiplodia theobromae (30Miersch O. Schneider G. Sembdner G. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 4049-4051Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To validate the results of the in vitro studies, GC-MS was used to analyze A. thaliana extracts for the presence of 12-OHJA. To minimize the effects of biological variability, pools consisting of 30–50 plants were used for metabolite extraction.

Since mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in stress signaling we investigated the role of arsenite and MAPKs for HO-1 gene regulation in primary rat hepatocytes. The Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 decreased sodium arsenite-mediated induction of HO-1 mRNA expression. HO-1 protein and luciferase activity of reporter gene constructs with −754 bp of the HO-1 promoter were induced by overexpression of kinases of the JNK pathway and MKK3. By contrast, overexpression of Raf-1 and ERK2 did not affect expression whereas overexpression of p38α, β, and δ decreased and p38γ increased HO-1 expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) revealed that a CRE/AP-1 element (−668/−654) bound c-Jun, a target of the JNK pathway. Deletion or mutation of the CRE/AP-1 obliterated the JNK- and c-Jun-dependent up-regulation of luciferase activity. EMSA also showed that an E-box (−47/−42) was bound by a putative p38 target c-Max. Mutation of the E-box strongly reduced MKK3, p38 isoform-, and c-Max-dependent effects on luciferase activity. Thus, the HO-1 CRE/AP-1 element mediatesHO-1 gene induction via activation of JNK/c-Jun whereas p38 isoforms act through a different mechanism via the E-box.

HO-1 is the inducible isoform of HO and is identical to heat shock protein 32 (HSP32) (2Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar), whereas HO-2 and HO-3 are constitutive isoforms (3McCoubrey-WK J.

The up-regulation of HO-1 expression by these stimuli and their observed toxic effects in various organs of HO-1-deficient mice (12Poss K.D. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The transcriptional activation of HO-1 and other genes is mediated by a network of signaling pathways, mostly by modulation of the activities of transcription factors and target gene expression. A central position in the signaling cascades regulating a number of cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, stress responses, and apoptosis occupy mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Three major subfamilies of MAPKs have been described: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) (14Gomez N. Cohen P. Nature. 1991; 353: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) (15Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar), and p38 (16Han J.

Sci. 2000; 25: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In general, the ERK pathway mediates cellular responses to growth and differentiation factors including platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and IL-5, whereas JNK and p38 kinases are activated by stress-related stimuli, such as heat shock, inflammation, hyperosmolarity, ultraviolet, and γ irradiation (18Kyriakis J. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2864) Google Scholar). Arsenic in the form of sodium arsenite, like other heavy metals, is also a potent inducer of heme oxygenase (19Sardana M.K. Drummond G.S. Sassa S. Kappas A. Pharmacology. 1981; 23: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); the mechanism of this induction seems to be cell- and species-dependent (20Masuya Y. Hioki K. Tokunaga R. Taketani S. J.

Arsenite is known to react with thiol groups of different proteins (e.g. receptors) and to be one of the inducers of ERK, JNK, and p38 cascades (23Ludwig S. Hoffmeyer A. Goebeler M. Kilian K.

Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5178-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex which can activate the p21 small GTPases of the Rho family Ras and Rac. Ras, in turn, activates either the ERK pathway or via action on PAK the JNK or p38 pathway. Rac activation can lead again to PAK activation and subsequently to the activation of JNK and p38 (26Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar). In liver cells the only detailed report so far regarding the role of MAPKs in HO-1 gene regulation had demonstrated that in the LMH chicken hepatoma cell line sodium arsenite-dependent induction of HO-1 gene expression was mediated by the ERK and p38 pathways (21Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Bonkovsky H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8922-8931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive characterization of the MAPK signal transduction pathways and the nearly universal induction of HO-1 expression by stress-related stimuli, conflicting data have been reported as to the involvement of MAPKs pathways in HO-1 gene activation in various tumor cell lines (20Masuya Y.

Moreover, little is known about HO-1gene expression in response to the activation by arsenite and MAPKs in primary cultured cells. Thus, it was the goal of the present study to investigate the regulation of rat HO-1 gene expression by MAPKs using primary rat hepatocyte cultures as a model system. In our study basal levels of HO-1 mRNA expression as well as sodium arsenite-induced HO-1 mRNA levels were down-regulated in the presence of JNK inhibitor SP600125. It was demonstrated that the Ras pathway via JNK induced HO-1 gene expression while the Raf pathway via ERK was not involved in the regulation of HO-1gene expression. The promoter sequence −668/−654 of the ratHO-1 gene was shown to be responsible for HO-1 activation by JNK and Jun. The E-box element (−47/−42) was involved in the inhibition of HO-1 gene expression via an MKK3-independent mechanism by p38 and Max. All biochemicals and enzymes were of analytical grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers. Cells from male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were used for culture experiments. Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion (30Immenschuh S. Iwahara S. Satoh H. Nell C. Katz N. Muller E.U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13407-13411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). About 1 × 106 cells were cultured at 37 °C on 6-cm Falcon culture dishes under air/CO2 (19:5) in medium 199 with Earle's salts containing bovine serum albumin (2 g/liter), NaHCO3 (20 mm), Hepes (10 mm), streptomycin sulfate (117 mg/liter), penicillin (60 mg/liter), insulin (1 nm), and dexamethasone (10 nm). Fetal calf serum (5%) was present in the initial 5 h after which cultures were incubated in serum-free medium for another 18 h. Then, medium was changed again, and the cells were further cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. Hepatocytes were treated with 5 μm sodium arsenite 8 h before harvesting. The specific inhibitors of MEK PD98059 (New England BioLabs) (5 μm) and U0126 (Cell Signaling) (10 μm), of JNK SP600125 (Biomol) (25 μm) and of p38 SB203580 (Calbiochem) (20 μm) were added to the culture medium also 8 h before harvesting. The luciferase reporter gene constructs pHO-754 and pHO-754ΔA were previously described (5Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn K.S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter gene construct pHO-347 was generated by deletion of the −754/−347 fragment of HO-754 by ApaI and KpnI followed by blunting of the remaining vector with Klenow enzyme and ligation. The luciferase construct pHO-754Em was generated with the QuickChangeTM XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the oligonucleotide 5′-GGCTCAGCTGGGCGGCCACctctagACTCGAGTAC-3′. The luciferase constructs p(CRE/AP-1)3-SV40Luc and p(CRE/AP-1)6-SV40Luc were generated by ligation of the oligonucleotide 5′-GATCCTGACTTCAGTCTGAATTCCTGACTTCAGTCTGACTTCAGTC-3′ containing 3 CRE/AP-1 elements into the BglII site of pGl3 prom (pSV40Luc) (Promega).

Hybridizations and detections were carried out essentially as described before (42Kietzmann T. Roth U. Freimann S. Jungermann K. Biochem.

In brief, total protein from primary cultured hepatocytes was prepared and the protein content was determined using the Bradford method. 50 μg of protein were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and after electrophoresis blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibodies against rat HO-1 (Stressgen), rat HO-2 (Stressgen), phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) (Cell Signaling), phospho-HSP27 (Ser82) (Cell Signaling), phospho-p38 (Cell Signaling), H-Ras (Santa Cruz), and c-Fos (Santa Cruz) were rabbit and used at 1:1000 dilution. The primary monoclonal mouse antibody against β-actin (Sigma) was used at 1:5000 dilution, the primary mouse antibody against phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (Cell Signaling) was used at 1:2000 dilution, the primary mouse antibody against c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the primary monoclonal mouse antibody against HA tag (Cell Signaling) and primary monoclonal mouse antibody against FLAG M2 (Sigma) were used at 1:1000 dilution. The secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) and used at 1:2000 dilution. The ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. HO-1 was visible as a 32-kDa band, HO-2 as a 36-kDa band, β-actin as a 42-kDa band, H-Ras as a 21-kDa band, c-Fos as a 55-kDa band, c-Jun as a 39-kDa band, phospho-HSP27 as a 27-kDa band, phospho-ERK was seen as a double band of 42 and 44 kDa. HA-MEKK1 was seen as 186-kDa band, HA-ERK as a 42-kDa band, FLAG-Raf as a 68-kDa band, FLAG-MKK3 as a 40-kDa band, FLAG-JNK1 as a 56-kDa band, and FLAG-p38 as a 38-kDa band. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (about 1 × 106 cells per dish) were transfected as described (5Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn K.S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In brief, rat hepatocyte cultures (about 1 × 106 cells per dish) were transiently transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA containing 500 ng of theRenilla luciferase construct pRL-SV40 (Promega) to control transfection efficiency and 2 μg of the appropriate HO-1promoter Firefly luciferase (FL) construct. In every culture experiment two cultures were transfected per point. The DNA was transfected as a calcium phosphate precipitate (5Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn K.S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) for 5 h. After removal of the medium cells were cultured under standard conditions without serum. 24 h later cells were treated with fresh medium and were cultured for another 12 h. 12 h before harvesting the cells were treated with PD98059 (5 μm), U0126 (10 μm), SP600125 (25 μm), SB203580 (20 μm), or LY294002 (Cell Signaling) (10 μm), as indicated. The Luc activity of 20 μl of cell lysate was recorded in a luminometer (Berthold) using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (44Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K. Blood. 1999; 94: 4177-4185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of the HO-1 oligonucleotides used for the EMSA are 5′-TGTGTCAGAGCCATGTGTCCTGACTTCAGTCT-3′ (spanning the CRE/AP-1 (−664/−657), Fig. 4) and 5′-GGCTCAGCTGGGCGGCCACCACGTGACTCGAGTAC-3′ (spanning the E-box (−47/−42), Fig. 6). Equal amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled by 5′ end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI). They were purified with the Nucleotide Removal kit (Qiagen). Binding reactions were carried out in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 μg of nuclear extract, 250 ng of poly(d(I-C)), and 5 mm DTE. For competition analyses a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled AP1 consensus oligonucleotide (Promega) was added. After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, 1 μl of the labeled probe (104 cpm) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. For supershift analysis 1 μl of the ATF/CREB-1 (24H4B), c-JunC (epitope corresponding to DNA binding domain), c-JunN (epitope mapping within the N-terminal domain), c-Fos (K-25), Myc (C33), Max (C17) or SP-1 (PEP2-G) antibody (all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as well as a rabbit preimmune serum was added to the EMSA reaction, which was then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The electrophoresis was then performed with a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 5 mmEDTA) at 200 V. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and exposed to a phosphorimager screen.Figure 6Overexpression of c-Jun induced luciferase expression controlled by either 754 bp of the HO-1promoter or by 6 and 3 copies of the HO-1 CRE/AP1 element.A, hepatocytes were transiently cotransfected with either c-Jun, c-Fos, or both expression plasmids and Luc gene constructs driven by the rat HO-1 promoter (pHO-754 and pHO-754ΔA) or by the SV40 promoter regulated by 6 or 3 copies of the HO-1 CRE/AP1 elements (p(CRE/AP-1)6-SV40Luc and p(CRE/AP-1)3-SV40Luc). In control experiments Luc constructs were cotransfected with pCMV plasmid and pSV40Luc construct was cotransfected with c-Jun, c-Fos, or both expression vectors. In each experiment the fold induction of Luc activity was determined relative to the pHO-754, pHO-754ΔA, p(CRE/AP-1)6-SV40Luc, p(CRE/AP-1)3-SV40Luc, or pSV40Luc controls, which were set equal to 1. In pHO-754ΔA the wild-type HO-1 sequence is shown on the upper strand, deleted bases are indicated by −, and mutated bases are shown in lowercase letters and are indicated by *. The values represent means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Statistics, Student's t test for paired values: *, significant difference pHO-754+c-Fos versus pHO-754 control, pHO-754+c-Jun+c-Fos versus pHO-754 control, p(CRE/AP-1)6-SV40Luc+c-Jun versusp(CRE/AP-1)6-SV40Luc control, p(CRE/AP-1)6-SV40Luc+c-Jun+c-Fos versusp(CRE/AP-1)6-SV40Luc control, p(CRE/AP-1)3-SV40Luc+c-Jun versusp(CRE/AP-1)3-SV40Luc control, p ≤ 0.05.B, overexpression of Jun and Fos proteins was detected by Western blotting (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether the sodium arsenite-dependent HO-1 induction occurs via the activation of various MAPK signaling pathways primary hepatocytes were treated with sodium arsenite in the presence of specific inhibitors of the ERK, JNK, or p38 pathways. 5 μm sodium arsenite induced HO-1 mRNA expression in primary rat hepatocytes after 8 h of treatment by about 8-fold (Fig. 1, A andB), in line with a previous study (45Jacobs J.M. Nichols C.E. Andrew A.S. Marek D.E. Wood S.G. Sinclair P.R. Wrighton S.A. Kostrubsky V.E. Sinclair J.F. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 157: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The inhibitors of the ERK pathway PD98059 and U0126 as well as the p38 pathway inhibitor SB203580 did not change either basal or arsenite-enhanced HO-1 mRNA levels. In contrast, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated the sodium arsenite-dependent HO-1 mRNA induction. Interestingly, combination of the JNK and p38 inhibitors led to a more pronounced inhibition of the arsenite-dependent HO-1 mRNA induction pointing to the involvement of p38, which was overridden by the JNK pathway. The effectiveness of the kinase inhibitors at the concentrations used was demonstrated by Western blot analysis with antibodies against phospho-ERK (for ERK pathway), phospho-Jun63 (for JNK pathway), and phospho-HSP27 (for p38 pathway) (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that kinases of the JNK and p38 pathways were involved in the regulation of HO-1 expression by sodium arsenite. Since the JNK and p38 pathways can be activated by MEKK1, the question of whether overexpression of MEKK1 activates these pathways in hepatocytes was examined. Indeed, MEKK1 overexpression led to the activation of the JNK and p38 pathway as demonstrated by the phosphorylation of cJun and p38 (Fig. 1D). To further investigate the regulatory role of MAP kinases forHO-1 gene expression primary cultured rat hepatocytes were transfected with expression vectors for human H-Ras, Raf-1, MEKK1, MKK3, ERK2, JNK1, and p38. Overexpression of these proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Hepatocytes transfected with H-Ras, MEKK1, JNK1, or MKK3 expression vectors showed enhanced HO-1 protein levels. By contrast, transfection with Raf-1 as well as ERK2 had no effect on the HO-1 expression while transfection with p38 led to a significant decrease of HO-1 protein levels (Fig.2). The observed pattern appeared to be specific for HO-1 since neither construct changed expression of HO-2 or actin. To examine the molecular mechanism of HO-1 gene regulation by MAPKs luciferase reporter gene constructs from the ratHO-1 promoter (46Muller R.M. Taguchi H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6795-6802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (pHO-754, pHO-750ΔA (5Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn K.S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and pHO-347) were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding various components of the MAPK signaling pathways (Fig. 3). Luciferase expression of pHO-754 was up-regulated by constitutive active H-Ras, MEKK1, and MKK3 but not by Raf-1 or dominant-negative Ras (dnRas). After cotransfection of both H-Ras and dnRas expression vectors the stimulatory effect of H-Ras was attenuated by dnRas (Fig.3). Cotransfection of MEKK1 and dominant-negative mutants of MKK3 and MKK4 down-regulated HO-1 promoter activity. The up-regulation of Luc activity of pHO-754ΔA and pHO-347, both of which lack the previously described HO-1 CRE/AP-1 element (5Immenschuh S. Hinke V. Ohlmann A. Gifhorn K.S. Katz N. Jungermann K. Kietzmann T. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), by overexpressed MEKK1 was reduced compared with pHO-754 (Fig.3A). Furthermore, the dominant-negative MKK3 still abolished Luc activity whereas the dominant-negative MKK4 did not. The same pattern was seen with pHO-347. This indicated that the JNK pathway acted primarily through the CRE/AP-1 element, and the p38 pathway via an element inside the first −347 bases of the HO-1promoter. However, the remaining induction of pHO-347 by MEKK1 was not attenuated by the inhibitors of either ERK, JNK, p38, or PI3K/PKB because neither PD98059, U0126, SP600125, SB203580, nor the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 down-regulated MEKK1-dependent enhancement of Luc activity. By contrast, the inhibitor of the p38 pathway SB203580 led to an induction of Luc activity. Because MEKK1 activates the JNK pathway, which is known to have the transcription factor AP-1 as a nuclear target (47Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 48Vuong H. Patterson T. Shapiro P. Kalvakolanu D.V. Wu R. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Kleeberger S.R. Reddy S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 32250-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (43) Google Scholar) the regulation of HO-1 gene promoter constructs was investigated in the presence of overexpressed JNK1, and for comparison also ERK2. JNK1 enhanced Luc activity of pHO-754, which was abolished in the presence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125. A JNK-dependent induction was not observed with pHO-754ΔA or pHO-347. By contrast, ERK2 did not affect Luc expression of the transfected HO-1 reporter gene constructs (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results indicate that activation of the JNK pathway may induce HO-1 gene expression through the HO-1 CRE/AP-1 site. Since the transcription factor Jun is a substrate of JNK it was investigated whether c-Jun can bind directly to the CRE/AP-1 element of the HO-1 promoter. EMSA studies with nuclear extracts of cultured rat hepatocytes and an oligonucleotide containing the HO-1 CRE/AP-1 site formed a strong protein-DNA complex. The intensity of this complex was reduced by an unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide added in a 50-fold molar excess to the binding reaction (Fig.5). To investigate the presence of AP-1 and members of the ATF/CREB family in this complex antibodies against c-Jun, c-Fos, and ATF/CREB were included in the binding reactions. In the presence of the ATF/CREB antibody a slightly supershifted complex was observed (Fig. 5). In addition, the binding of the protein complex to the CRE/AP-1 nucleotide was enhanced. Addition of antibodies against c-Fos, as well as against the GC-box binding factor SP-1 or a rabbit preimmune serum, did not result in a supershift or inhibition of complex formation. The Jun antibody, which was raised against the highly conserved DNA binding domain of c-Jun (c-JunC) abolished DNA-protein complex formation. Addition of the c-JunN antibody generated against the N-terminal domain formed a strong supershifted complex, indicating that the CRE/AP-1 site was bound mostly by c-Jun. To verify the functional relevance of c-Jun binding to the HO-1 CRE/AP-1 element the pHO-754 and pHO-754ΔA luciferase constructs were cotransfected with expression vectors for c-Jun and c-Fos. Overexpression of both c-Jun and c-Fos was confirmed by Western blot ana"

In addition to the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs to block cylooxygenase, it has been shown recently that a subset of NSAIDs selectively inhibits the secretion of highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 from cultured cells, although the molecular target(s) of NSAIDs in reducing the activity of γ-secretase for Aβ42 generation (γ42-secretase) still remain unknown. Here we show that sulindac sulfide (SSide) directly acts on γ-secretase and preferentially inhibits the γ42-secretase activity derived from the 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate-solubilized membrane fractions of HeLa cells, in an in vitroγ-secretase assay using recombinant amyloid β precursor protein C100 as a substrate. SSide also inhibits activities for the generation of Aβ40 as well as for Notch intracellular domain at higher concentrations. Notably, SSide displayed linear noncompetitive inhibition profiles for γ42-secretase in vitro.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Aβ is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavages of the amyloid β precursor protein (βAPP) by a set of membrane-bound proteases termed β- and γ-secretases. The C-terminal length of Aβ generated by γ-secretase is heterogeneous; Aβ42 is a relatively minor molecular species of the Aβ secreted from cells, but it has a much higher propensity to aggregate and form amyloid compared with other Aβ species. These findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that the deposition of Aβ42 is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD, implicating γ-secretase as an important therapeutic target. Mutations in PS1 or PS2 genes account for the majority of early onset familial AD, and these mutations cause an increase in the ratio or levels of production of Aβ42 (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). It is known that PS is essential for the γ-secretase-mediated intramembranous cleavage not only for βAPP but for other type I transmembrane proteins (e.g. Notch, ErbB4, E-cadherin, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, and CD44) (2Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). PS proteins undergo endoproteolysis to generate N- and C-terminal fragments and interact with other proteins (i.e. nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2) to form a high molecular weight (HMW) protein complex (3Haass C. Steiner H. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 556-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The functional role of PS complex in γ-secretase activity still remains unknown. However, aspartyl protease transition state analogue inhibitors of γ-secretase, which harbors a hydroxyl ethylene isostere or a difluoro alcohol moiety, directly label PS fragments (4Li Y.M. Xu M.

In addition, a systematic analysis using a variety of PS mutants revealed that HMW complex formation of PS as well as conserved aspartyl residues within the transmembrane domain are essential for γ-secretase activity (7Tomita T.

These data suggest that HMW PS complex corresponds to the γ-secretase, an atypical membrane-embedded aspartyl protease, and that PS proteins harbor the catalytic center for γ-secretase complex (3Haass C.

Epidemiological studies have shown that long term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prevents the development of AD (reviewed in Refs. 14Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S.

Aging. 2001; 22: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, a prospective, population-based cohort study provided strong evidence that the long term use of NSAIDs significantly reduced the risk of AD (16in't Veld B.A. Ruitenberg A. Hofman A. Launer L.J. van Duijn C.M. Stijnen T. Breteler M.M. Stricker B.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). NSAIDs affect the inflammatory response by direct inhibition of cyclooxgenase (COX) enzymes. Moreover, recent studies indicate that NSAIDs are involved in transcriptional regulation by the modulation of IκB kinase β or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) (reviewed in Ref. 17Tegeder I. Pfeilschifter J. Geisslinger G. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2057-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It has been believed that NSAIDs might influence the AD pathology by inhibiting the inflammation response (e.g. activation of microglia and astroglia) in brains (14Akiyama H. Barger S. Barnum S. Bradt B. Bauer J. Cole G.M. Cooper N.R. Eikelenboom P. Emmerling M. Fiebich B.L. Finch C.E. Frautschy S. Griffin W.S. Hampel H. Hull M. Landreth G. Lue L. Mrak R. Mackenzie I.R. McGeer P.L.

Wyss-Coray T. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 383-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). In fact, administration of NSAIDs affects the inflammatory profile and inhibits the progression of amyloid deposition in the brains of βAPP transgenic mice (18Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2246-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to these traditional views, however, it has recently been shown that a subset of NSAIDs (ibuprofen, sulindac sulfide (SSide), indomethacin, and R-flurbiprofen) selectively decrease the secretion of Aβ42 from cultured cells independently of COX activity and lowers the amount of soluble Aβ42 in the brains of transgenic mice (21Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H.

In cultured cells, the decrease in Aβ42 secretion caused by SSide was accompanied by an increase in Aβ38 generation, whereas the Notch site-3 cleavage activity to generate Notch intracellular domain (NICD) was not significantly affected. In contrast, other NSAIDs including sulindac sulfone (SSone), which is a metabolite of SSide and inactive for COX, had no significant effect on γ-secretase activity. These data suggest that some of the NSAIDs may affect the pathogenetic process of AD by directly inhibiting the γ-secretase activity, causing a shift in the cleavage site. Furthermore, in contrast to the previously developed γ-secretase inhibitors, the treatment with NSAIDs may be free from side effects caused by inhibiting the intramembranous cleavage of other substrates. However, the molecular mechanism whereby NSAIDs inhibit Aβ42 generation, as well as the target protein of NSAIDs to modulate γ-secretase activity, still remains unclear. Here we analyzed the enzymatic property of γ-secretase by an in vitroγ-secretase assay using recombinant substrates and CHAPSO-solubilized membrane as an enzyme source, with special reference to the effect of NSAIDs on intramembranous cleavage of βAPP and Notch.

The membrane pellets were resuspended in HEPES buffer to yield a protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml and were stored at −70 °C. The membranes were solubilized by 1% CHAPSO (Wako, Osaka, Japan) combined with 1 m NDSB-256 (Calbiochem) for 60 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. We defined the supernatant (∼5 mg of protein/ml) as the solubilized γ-secretase fraction, which was stored at −80 °C until use. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. In vitroγ-secretase assay was performed as described previously (26Takasugi N. Tomita T. Hayashi I. Tsuruoka M. Niimura M. Takahashi Y. Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T.

Each recombinant substrate at defined concentrations was incubated together with the solubilized γ-secretase fraction (250 μg/ml) in 1× γ buffer (HEPES buffer containing 0.25% CHAPSO, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm1,10-phenanthroline, 10 mg/ml phosphoramidon, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) with or without γ-secretase inhibitors (including NSAIDs) at 4 or 37 °C for 3 h. Control reactions were performed in the presence of 1% Me2SO. The reaction was stopped by boiling the reaction mixtures for 2 min. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were analyzed by BAN50/BA27, BAN50/BC05, BNT77/BA27, or BNT77/BC05 ELISAs for de novo generation of Aβ (25Tomita T. Maruyama K. Saido T.C. Kume H.

For the immunoblot analyses of de novo generated peptides, the total proteins in the supernatants were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by immunoblotting with BAN50 (anti-Aβ), anti-c-Myc (Roche Applied Science), or anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). Tris/Bicine/urea high resolution Aβ immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (30Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhuber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We first characterized the biochemical and enzymatic properties of the γ-secretase activity as detected by our in vitroγ-secretase assay. For this purpose, we generated a recombinant protein substrate C100-FmH, based on the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal fragment of βAPP fused to FLAG-myc-His6 tag sequences at the C terminus (Fig. 1).De novo generation of Aβ peptides from recombinant C100-FmH incubated with membranes of HeLa cells as an enzyme source required the presence of 0.25% CHAPSO, whereas Triton X-100 or SDS abolished the γ-secretase activity (data not shown), which was consistent with the previous observations (12Li Y.M Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Incubation of HeLa cell membranes with wild-type (wt) C100-FmH predominantly generated Aβ40, in addition to Aβ42 as a minor species (Fig.2A). However, the relatively low levels of de novo generation of Aβ42 hampered detailed pharmacological and enzymatic analyses of Aβ42-generating activity from wt C100-FmH. Thus, we introduced the I716F mutation into the recombinant substrate, which had been described to cause a dramatic increase in Aβ42 generation in intact cell-based assays (27Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).De novo Aβ42 generation from I716F mutant (mt) C100-FmH was significantly increased, whereas the production of Aβ40 was almost totally abolished, suggesting that mt C100-FmH served as an optimal substrate for γ42-secretase (Fig. 2A). These proteolytic activities were recovered from the solubilized membrane fraction by 1% CHAPSO containing 1 m NDSB-256. We next examined the effects of the two well characterized γ-secretase inhibitors, L-685,458 and DAPT, on Aβ generation in our in vitro assay (12Li Y.M Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J.

We then studied the Aβ-generating activities in membranes of various cell lines including embryonic fibroblasts derived from PS1/2 double knockout mice (9Tomita T. Watabiki T. Takikawa R.

Consistent with the results of intact cell-based assays, de novo production of Aβ peptides was almost totally abolished in membrane fractions from PS1/2 double knockout cells, and these activities can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies against PS1 (Fig. 2C and data not shown). These data suggest that recombinant wt and mt C100-FmHs were processed by the endogenous, PS-dependent γ40- and γ42-secretase activities that enzymatically generate Aβ40 and -42 polypeptides, respectively. We further analyzed the enzymatic properties of γ-secretase activities of intact or solubilized membrane fractions from HeLa cells in vitro. The apparent Km value for the processing of either wt or mt substrate to generate Aβ40 or Aβ42, respectively, by γ-secretase activities was ∼0.5 μm (Fig.2D). The progress curve was linear during the 6-h reaction time, and the pH dependence of γ-secretase activity was broad, ranging from pH 5 to 9 (data not shown). Furthermore, we observed a γ-secretase-dependent in vitro generation of the C-terminally tagged APP intracellular domain fragments (AICD-FmH) that is produced as the C-terminal counterpart of Aβ, by incubation of either wt or mt C100-FmH with solubilized HeLa membranes (Fig.2E). These data are consistent with the previous reports (12Li Y.M Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Notably, a proteolytic generation of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by PS-dependent γ-secretase is the most well known example, and potential side effects caused by the blockade of Notch pathway by γ-secretase inhibitors are emerging problems (35Hadland B.K. Manley N.R. Su D. Longmore G.D. Moore C.L. Wolfe M.S. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7487-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 36Doerfler P. Shearman M.S. Perlmutter R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9312-9317Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To analyze the γ-secretase activity to generate NICD in vitro, we generated a recombinant N102-FmH substrate composed of a 101-residue fragment of murine Notch1 beginning close to the S2 cleavage site and containing transmembrane domain fused to a FLAG-myc-His C-terminal tag (Fig. 1). After incubation of N102-FmH with the membrane fraction, we observed the appearance of an NICD-like polypeptide migrating slightly faster than N102-FmH, which was diminished by treatment with DAPT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2F and data not shown). Thus, the recombinant N102-FmH polypeptide is also cleaved by γ-secretase to generate C-terminally tagged NICD (NICD-FmH) in vitro, which was consistent with the recent report by Wolfe and colleagues (37Micchelli C.A.

To gain more insights into the effect of NSAIDs on APP and Notch processing, we have chosen three NSAIDs, i.e. sulindac sulfide (SSide), sulindac sulfone (SSone), and naproxen, to treat N2a NL/N cells stably coexpressing βAPPNL and NotchΔE (24Tomita T. Katayama R. Takikawa R. Iwatsubo T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We confirmed a specific decrease in Aβ42 secretion by treatment with 10–30 μm SSide, whereas the secretion of Aβ40 as well as Notch processing was not affected (Fig.3). Treatment with 100 μmof SSide caused cell death presumably by inducing apoptosis, resulting in marked decrease in Aβ generation as well as in total protein expression (17Tegeder I. Pfeilschifter J.

The present study tested this hypothesis. Analysis of Fe59-loaded HMs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), revealed a previously unreported, transient rise in intracellular low molecular weight (LMW)·Fe59complex ([LMW·Fe]i) at ≤2 min returning to the basal level within 15 min. The [LMW·Fe]i response preceded IκB kinase (IKK) (≥15 min) and NF-κB (≥30 min) activation. Iron chelators (1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one andN,N′-bis-2-hydroxybenzylethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid) abrogated the [LMW·Fe]i response and IKK and NF-κB activation. The [LMW·Fe]i response was also observed in tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated HMs and RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS and interferon-γ but not in primary rat hepatocytes or myofibroblastic cells exposed to LPS or TNFα. Both [LMW·Fe]i response and IKK activation in LPS-stimulated HMs were inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (nonspecific inhibitor for flavin-containing oxidases),l-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (selective iNOS inhibitor), and adenoviral-mediated expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 or Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, suggesting the role of ⋅NO and O2⨪ in mediating the iron signaling. In fact, this inhibition was recapitulated by a cell-permeable scavenger of ONOO−, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrinato iron (III) chloride. Conversely, ONOO− alone induced both [LMW·Fe]i response and IKK activation. Finally, direct addition of ferrous iron to cultured HMs activated IKK and NF-κB.

Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar, for review). At least two levels of redox regulation of NF-κB appear to exist: one in the nucleus and another in the cytoplasm. The former involves direct redox modification of specific cysteine residues in the DNA binding domain of NF-κB. In particular, oxidation of cysteine at the position 62 in p50 inhibits DNA binding activity (2Toledano M.B. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Conversely, reduction of NF-κB by thioredoxin and Ref-1 appear to increase its activity (3Mitomo K. Nakayama K. Fujimoto K. Sun X. Seki S. Yamamoto K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol.

For the cytosolic regulation, upstream signaling that is yet to be determined, leads to activation of IKK,1 resulting in phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser-32 and Ser-36) on IκBα, its polyubiquitination, and degradation by 26 S proteasome. Treatment of the cells with the antioxidant,N-acetyl-l-cysteine or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate prevents activation of NF-κB (5Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 6Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Anderson M.T.

TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB is abrogated by inhibition of ROS production by the electron transport chain in mitochondria suggesting oxidant stress from this organelle as a signal for this mode of activation (9Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NADPH oxidase blocks or attenuates activation of NF-κB in monocytic cells (10Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kurose I. Saito H. Miura S. Ebinuma H. Higuchi H. Watanabe N. Zeki S. Nakamura T. Takaishi M. Ishii H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas inhibitors for 5-lipoxygenase reduce both ROS generation and NF-κB activation in lymphoid cells (10Bonizzi G. Piette J. Schoonbroodt S. Greimers R. Havard L. Merville M.P. Bours V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1950-1960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the possible cell type-dependent differences in the source of ROS signals for activation of this transcription factor. It is also important to note that intracellular ROS generation may not be necessary for NF-κB activation in all cell types. Indeed, in epithelial cell lines, no detectable increase in ROS generation is observed in association with activation of NF-κB (12Bonizzi G. Dejardin E. Piret B. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, anti-oxidants and metal chelators are often ineffective in inhibiting NF-κB activation in these cells (13Bonizzi G. Piette J. Merville M.P. Bours V. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5264-5272PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that a tighter association exists between oxidant stress and NF- κB activation in monocytic or lymphoid cells. Hepatic macrophages (HMs), i.e. Kupffer cells, represent the largest population of macrophages, accounting for as much as 70–80% to total body macrophages. In addition to their crucial role in the first line of defense against invading microorganisms or bacterial products via splanchnic circulation, HMs represent the major site for both regulation of inflammatory and immune responses and metabolism of iron. For the former, HMs release a wide array of soluble factors, including cytokines and chemokines, that are mostly encoded by NF-κB-responsive genes as well as growth factors, lipid metabolites, and gaseous mediators (O2⨪, H2O2, and⋅NO). For the latter function, hepatic and splenic macrophages are largely responsible for removal of senescent red blood cells, breakdown of hemoglobin, and re-cycling of iron for synthesis of new heme or non-heme iron proteins. These two disparate functions of inflammation/immunity and iron metabolism appear mutually related based on several lines of evidence. First, iron is known to affect cell-mediated immune response (14Weiss G. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 32 Suppl. 1: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Excessive iron load in macrophages reduces their functions, including phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and cytokine expression (15Loegering D.J. Raley M.J. Reho T.A. Eaton J.W. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1996; 59: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Olynyk J.K. Clarke S.L. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2001; 16: 438-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17van Asbeck B.S. Marx J.J. Struyvenberg A. Verhoef J. J. Infect. 1984; 8: 232-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the effects likely mediated by iron-mediated toxicity (18Kondo H. Saito K. Grasso J.P. Aisen P. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, at non-toxic concentrations, iron promotes macrophage differentiation (19Boldt D.H. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and functions, including anti-microbial effects (20Jiang X. Baldwin C.L. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 148: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and TNF-mediated cytotoxicity (21Warren S. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1993; 12: 75-80PubMed Google Scholar). Iron also increases interleukin-1 secretion by macrophages stimulated by interferon-γ and LPS (22Fuhrman B. Oiknine J. Aviram M. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 111: 65-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the treatment with iron chelators inhibits LPS-mediated NF-κB activation and expression of TNFα and interleukin-6 by cultured peritoneal macrophages (23Chaudhri G. Clark I.A. J.

The finding that iron chelators inhibit activation of NF-κB in macrophages suggests a role for a chelatable pool of iron in the signal transduction for this molecular event. In testing this hypothesis, the present study disclosed a novel and transient rise in the intracellular level of low molecular weight·iron complex ([LMW·Fe]i) in macrophages stimulated with LPS or TNFα. This response appears specific to macrophages and precedes IKK activation and increased NF-κB binding. The [LMW·Fe]i response is tightly correlated with NF-κB activation and abrogated by inhibition of iNOS and NADPH oxidase or overexpression of SOD. Our results support the notion that ONOO− is the effector molecule for inducing [LMW·Fe]i release. Last, addition of ionic iron to HMs caused activation of IKK, establishing that iron can serve as an independent agonist and as a potential signaling molecule for IKK activation. Cell lines employed in this study included RAW264.7 cells obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), R37 cells, stably Nramp1G169 expressing RAW264.7, and R21 cells stably transfected RAW264.7 with a vector encoding the gene in an antisense orientation, both provided by Dr. C.

(St. Louis, MO). Iron chelators, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (L1) andN,N′-bis-2-hydrobenzylethlenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid (HBED) were generous gifts from Dr. Gary Brittenham (College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, NY). HMs were isolated from male Wistar rats by the Non-parenchymal Liver Cell Core of the Research Center for Alcoholic Liver and Pancreatic Diseases as previously published (24Lin M. Rippe R.A. Niemela O. Brittenham G. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1355-G1364PubMed Google Scholar,25Tsukamoto H. Lin M. Ohata M. Giulivi C. French S.W. Brittenham G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1240-G1250PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the liver was digested in situ by sequential perfusion with Pronase and collagenase, and non-parenchymal liver cells were fractionated by discontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation using arabinogalactan. An HM-enriched fraction was further purified by the adherence method to achieve the final purity exceeding 95%. After 3 days of culture, the cells were treated with LPS (100 or 500 ng/ml) or TNFα (10 ng/ml) in serum-free DMEM in the presence or absence of various inhibitors as described below for subsequent collection of cell lysate for IKK assay and nuclear protein extraction for NF-κB electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Hepatocytes were isolated using the standard collagenase digestion technique (26Lu S.C. Ge J.L. Huang H.Y. Kuhlenkamp J. Kaplowitz N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1188-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) by the Cell Culture Core of the USC Research Center for Liver Diseases. The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS and used immediately after overnight culture for the experiments described below. RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM with 25 mm glucose and 10% FCS. Rat hepatic myofibroblastic cells were isolated from a rat with biliary liver fibrosis by the method described for HMs and by collecting a fraction from the gradient interface between the medium and 1.035. They became spontaneously immortalized, and subsequently cell cones were established by the limiting dilution method. They are cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS. Freshly isolated HMs, hepatocytes, liver myofibroblastic cells, or RAW264.7 cells were plated onto a 60-mm dish. The cells were cultured with 5 μCi/ml FeCl3 for 14–16 h in 5 ml of DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Labeled cells were sequentially washed with 5 ml of warm PBS once, PBS containing 100 μm bathophenanthroline sulfate once, and PBS twice. The washed cells were treated with LPS (500 ng/ml) or TNFα (10 ng/ml) in 5 ml of warm PBS for 2, 5, 10, or 20 min in the presence or absence of iron chelators (L1, 100 μm; HBED, 100 μm), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 500 μm), a nonspecific inhibitor for flavin-containing oxidases, including NADPH oxidase and iNOS (DPI, 1 μm), a selective iNOS inhibitor (l-NIL, 20 μm), and a cell-permeable decomposition catalyst for ONOO− (FeTTPS, 200 μm). These inhibitors were added 0.5∼4 h prior to addition of LPS. For adenoviral-mediated expression of a dominant negative mutant Rac1 (Ad.N17Rac1), Cu,Zn-SOD (Ad.CuZn-SOD), or β-galactosidase (Ad.LacZ) as a control, the cultured HMs were infected with the vectors at the multiplicity of infection of 50 ∼24 h before addition of LPS. The cells were also treated with a spontaneous nitric oxide donor (SNAP) to examine their effects on [LMW·Fe]i. The incubation was stopped at the respective time point by removing PBS completely and adding 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 1.4 m NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A low molecular mass fraction (<5000 Da) was prepared by a centrifugation of the lysate in a size-exclusion column (Millipore, MA) at 8600 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Radioactivity of ultrafiltrate or total lysate was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. The chelatable pool of iron in HMs was measured as previously described (27Yegorov D.Y. Kozlov A.V. Azizova O.A. Vladimirov Y.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 15: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary cultures of rat HMs were washed with PBS twice, scraped gently, and incubated in PBS (5 × 106/3 ml) to which an iron chelator, desferrioxamine or 1,10-phenanthroline, was added to form a stable complex with iron. The formed complexes were spectrophotometrically detected by their absorption at 430 and 510 nm, respectively. The kinetic of complex formation was assessed with a Beckman spectrophotometer equipped with a flow cuvette connected with a vessel with constant stirring. The blank absorption was obtained by using the mixture of all reagents except chelators. To assay the activity of IKK, HMs cultured in a 100-mm dish were treated with LPS (500 ng/ml) for 15–30 min in the presence and absence of the iron chelators, L-NIL, or FeTTPS, washed once with PBS, and lysed with a lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaF, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 2.5 mm metabisulfite, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitors, 300 mm NaCl, and 1.5% Triton X-100). The lysates were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until assayed. IKK activity was determined as previously described (28Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). HMs were also treated with SNAP, ONOO−, and FeSO4 at the indicated concentrations to test their direct effects on IKK. Briefly, IKK was immunoprecipitated by IKKα antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. The assay was performed at 30 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 2 μg of GST-IκBα, and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 μCi). The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer and was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by a transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphate incorporated into GST-IκBα was visualized by analyzing the membrane with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblot analysis of IKK and nitrated IκBα, cytosolic extracts were prepared as previously reported (29Matata B.M. Galinanes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2330-2335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with anti-IKKα antibodies, and detected by chemiluminescence. For immunoblot analysis of nitrated IκBα, IκBα was first immunoprecipitated with anti- IκBα antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and the immune complex was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane for immunoblot analysis using anti-nitrotyrosine antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). To examine DNA binding by NF-κB, nuclear proteins were extracted using the method of Schreiber et al. (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar) from cultured HMs, RAW264.7 cells, hepatic myofibroblastic cells, or hepatocytes exposed to LPS or TNFα in the presence or absence of the iron chelators. The extracts (5 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 200 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) on ice with the double-strand κB consensus sequence (31Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) or the κB site from TNFα promoter (32Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) labeled with32P. After a 20-min incubation, the reaction mixture was resolved on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was dried for subsequent autoradiography. For the supershift assays, antibodies against p50 and p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the reaction mixture for an additional 30 min. A recent study (33Atkinson P.G. Barton C.H. Immunology. 1999; 96: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) demonstrates that RAW264.7 cells stably transfected with a vector expressing a wild type Nramp1G169 (a transformant designated as R37) have lower cellular iron load and a reduced chelatable iron pool as compared with those stably transfected with a vector encoding the gene in an antisense orientation (designated as R21). We have obtained these two stable transformants from Dr. C. H. Barton's laboratory (University of Southampton, UK) and tested whether the altered chelatable pool of iron in R37 affects the [LMW·Fe]i signaling, IKK activation, NF-κB binding, and TNFα release following LPS stimulation. TNFα immunoassay was performed with a commercially available mouse TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For the measurement of total non-heme iron content, R37 or R21 cells (3 × 107) were washed with ice-cold PBS twice. The cells were treated with 1 ml of solution of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid dissolved in 3% (v/v) thioglycolic acid and 1.94 m HCl, vortexed, and put on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, 100 μl of supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the equal volume of 0.42 mm bathophenanthroline sulfonate in 2 msodium acetate. The reaction mixture was then measured for the absorbance at 550 nm on a microtiter plate scanning spectrophotometer (Power Wave 200TM, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). An iron atomic absorption standard solution (Aldrich) was used as iron standard. The labeling with Fe59 was performed as described for HMs, the specific activity of Fe59 in the cells was determined by dividing the radioactivity by iron content, and the chelatable pool of iron was determined by measuring the mobilization of Fe59 radioactivity into the low molecular weight fraction following the treatment of the cell lysate with L1 (100 μm) for 5 min at room temperature. We previously showed that the treatment of cultured HMs with an iron chelator, L1, prevents LPS-induced NF-κB activation (24Lin M. Rippe R.A. Niemela O. Brittenham G. Tsukamoto H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1355-G1364PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the role of the chelatable pool of iron in activation of this transcription factor. To examine this possibility, HMs were loaded with Fe59, washed stringently, and stimulated with LPS to determine time-dependent changes in the Fe59radioactivity in the low molecular weight cytosolic fraction ([LMW·Fe]i). Addition of LPS (500 ng/ml) resulted in a transient rise in [LMW·Fe]i at ≤2 min, followed by a decline to its basal level by 10–15 min (Fig.1A). The radioactivity of [LMW·Fe]i, separated by a size exclusion column with the molecular mass cutoff of 5000 Da, was 1∼2% of total cell-associated radioactivity and increased 2-fold by LPS stimulation. Because the earliest time point we were able to process the cells for this analysis was 2 min, this response might have taken place earlier than 2 min. Kinetic analysis of this event in relation to IKK and NF-κB activation revealed that the [LMW·Fe]i response preceded the beginning of increased IKK activity at 15 min and that of NF-κB binding at 30 min (Fig. 1, B and C). Addition of an iron chelators, L1 (100 μm, Fig.2A) or HBED (100 μm, data not shown), prior to LPS stimulation completely abrogated the response as well as IKK (Fig. 2B) and NF-κB (Fig. 2C) activation. Because the assessment of a cytosolic labile pool of iron after detergent lysis of the cells may cause the release of iron from solubilized vesicles, organelles, or proteins, we have also employed another approach to determine changes in the chelatable pool of iron in intact cells. This method involved chelation of iron with desferrioxamine or 1,10-phenanthroline and spectrophotometric determination of the iron·chelator complexes in cell suspension. Using this method, we confirmed a transient rise in the chelatable iron level with either chelator following LPS stimulation (Fig. 3). However, the response curve shifted to right with a peak occurring between 5 and 7 min, instead of 2 min or earlier when detected by the Fe59method. This delay probably reflected the fact that the chelators were not reaching liberated iron immediately and that this spectrophotometric method has a higher detection threshold than the radioactive method. Nevertheless, the early, transient iron response in LPS-stimulated HMs was confirmed by this method in the intact cells.Figure 2Iron chelators block the [LMW·Fe]i response, IKK activity, and NF- κB binding in LPS-stimulated HMs. A, note the pretreatment of cultured HMs with L1 abrogates LPS-induced increase in the [LMW·Fe]i. B, the treatment of HMs with L1 or HBED completely prevents LPS-induced IKK activity.C, similarly, L1 and HBED prevent increased binding of the p50/p65 heterodimer to the probe. The data presented in Arepresent means ± S.D. from four experiments. IKK and NF-κB binding assays were performed on samples from at least four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3The release of iron is confirmed in the intact HMs. To confirm the intracellular release of iron in the intact HMs without detergent lysis of the cells, the cells were stimulated with LPS, and the formation of complexes between iron and added chelators (desferrioxamine (top) and 1–10 phenanthroline (bottom)) was monitored spectrophotometrically in cell suspension. Note the similar transient rise in the formation of the iron·chelator complex using either chelator. The peak is slightly shifted right between 5 and 7 min as compared with the response detected with the Fe59 method. The data represent means ± S.D. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next tested whether TNFα, another agonist for NF-κB activation, causes the [LMW·Fe]i response in HMs. After addition of TNFα, the identical, transient response to that seen after LPS treatment was reproduced at 2 min (data not shown). We then tested whether the [LMW·Fe]i response is observed in other cell types when NF-κB is activated. The [LMW·Fe]iwas examined in cultured hepatocytes treated with LPS or TNFα. Despite the fact that these treatments caused robust NF-κB activation, no [LMW·Fe]i response was observed (data not shown). Next, we examined rat liver myofibroblastic cells stimulated with TNFα and RAW264.7 cells, the murine macrophage cell line, treated with interferon γ (10 units/ml) and LPS (100 ng/ml). Again, no significant changes occurred in the [LMW·Fe]i in myofibroblastic cells, although NF-κB binding was increased (data not shown). On the other hand, RAW264.7 cells showed a conspicuous [LMW·Fe]i peak at 2 min after the treatment preceding activation of NF-κB (data not shown). Therefore, these results suggest that the [LMW·Fe]i response is unique to macrophages. To further examine the association between the [LMW·Fe]i response and NF-κB activation and to explore potential mechanisms underlying induction of the [LMW·Fe]i response, we tested whether the known inhibitors of NF-κB activation could regulate the [LMW·Fe]iincrease. Cultured HMs were stimulated with LPS in the presence ofN-acetylcysteine (NAC, 500 μm), diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 1 μm), a nonspecific inhibitor for flavin-containing oxidases such as NADPH oxidase and iNOS, andl-NIL (20 μm), a selective iNOS inhibitor. DPI and l-NIL effectively blocked the [LMW·Fe]irise, whereas NAC or Me2SO as"

Bile acids are produced in liver and excreted into bile through canalicular bile acid transporters such as Bsep1and Mrp2 (1Kullak-Ublick G.A. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Mieer P.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 273-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The primary bile acids excreted are deconjugated and deoxygenated by enterobacteria and are reabsorbed at intestine as secondary bile acids such as LCA and deoxycholic acid. The liver has sufficient capacity to transport bile acids into the bile duct mainly after transformation into conjugates. Thus, limited amounts of bile acids are detected in sera under normal conditions. Serum and liver bile acid levels are, however, increased dramatically after hepatic failure or bile duct obstruction. Accumulation of bile acids, particularly secondary bile acids, is believed to be a risk factor for liver toxicity.Administration of LCA and its conjugates, which are hydrophobic secondary bile acids, causes intrahepatic cholestasis (2Yousef I.M.

These facts suggest the involvement of several nuclear receptors in LCA-induced toxicity.LCA is mainly transformed to tauroconjugates and glycoconjugates in liver and pumped out to the bile duct by the Bsep. Conjugated LCA is also transformed to 3-sulfate and 3-glucuronides by sulfotransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, respectively (6Stiehl A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 4: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Dionne S. Tuchweber B. Plaa G.L. Yousef I.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).

FXR-null mice, in which cholesterol-bile acid regulation is disrupted, show an increase in serum total bile acid levels. Reduction of bile acid pools and fecal bile acid excretion was also shown to occur because of decreased expression of Bsep. Cholic acid feeding resulted in severe liver damage in FXR-null mice, although no apparent toxicity was detected in FXR-null mice fed control diet. Recently, CYP3A forms were reported to be elevated in FXR-null mice (27Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J.

These data suggest a possible occurrence of alterations in the metabolic pathway leading to bile acids in the FXR-null mice.In our preliminary experiments, FXR-null male mice were more susceptible to cholic acid- (26Sinal C.J. Tohkin M Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar) and LCA-induced liver damage than wild-type male mice, whereas FXR-null female mice were less susceptible to LCA-induced damage than wild-type female mice. These results suggested a specific mechanism for the protection against LCA-induced liver damage in FXR-null female mice. Thus, in the present study, the metabolic shift in bile acid metabolism was investigated with FXR-null female mice in relation to the liver toxicity of LCA. A clear increase in female-specific St2a form (5.8-fold) catalyzing LCA sulfation was detected in livers of FXR-null female mice as compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, the hepatic level was inversely correlated with serum ALP activity a marker of liver cholestasis, indicating a critical role for St2a in protection against LCA-induced liver damage.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, female FXR-null mice were found to be resistant to the toxic effects of LCA as compared with wild-type mice despite the decreased expression of Bsep. In LCA-fed mice, liver tauroLCA concentration correlated with a marker for liver damage, ALP activity. Furthermore, female FXR-null mice had higher LCA sulfating activity than wild-type mice. Hepatic level of St2a catalyzing LCA sulfation inversely correlated with the ALP activity, indicating that St2a plays a role in the protection against LCA-induced liver damage.Recent studies (3Xei W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Waxman D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 4Staudinger J.L.

A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) suggested a protective role of activation of PXR against severe liver damage induced by LCA. Cyp3a11 mRNA detected by RT-PCR and Cyp3a proteins by Western blotting (data not shown) were higher in the liver of FXR-null mice than wild-type mice in this study consistent with what was found in an earlier report (27Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J. Venkataramanan R. Cai H. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39411-39418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) showing that Cyp3a11 levels were higher in FXR-null mice. Although the catalytic activities of mouse Cyp3a forms remain unknown, human CYP3A4 is reported to catalyze LCA 6α- and 6β-hydroxylations in vitro (3Xei W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Waxman D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 33Araya Z. Wikvall K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data suggested the possible involvement of mouse Cyp3a in microsomal 6α- and 6β-hydroxylations of LCA as a detoxification pathway of LCA-induced toxicity. However, microsomal LCA 6β-hydroxylation activity was higher for wild-type mice than for FXR-null mice (Fig. 1). Microsomal LCA 6α-hydroxylation activity was very low in both mouse livers. These data, as well as in vivo profiles, indicate that CYP3A metabolism is not rate-limiting in LCA detoxification. In contrast, cytosolic sulfation of LCA and the amounts of St2a were markedly elevated in FXR-null mice. Indeed, an inverse relationship was observed between liver content of St2a and ALP activity in mice treated with LCA. These data suggest a protective role for St2a in catalyzing LCA sulfation rather than CYP3A catalyzing LCA hydroxylation in the LCA-induced liver damage, at least in female mice.It was reported that in human, intravenously injected radiolabeled LCA were excreted rapidly and predominantly in bile, and 60% of excreted radioactivity were derived from sulfated forms (34Cowen A.E. Korman M.G. Hofmann A.F. Cass O.W. Gastroenterology. 1975; 69: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in LCA sulfate that is poorly reabsorbed from intestine results in rapid fecal excretion of LCA (35Hofmann A.F. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1994: 677-718Google Scholar). In bile of female FXR-null mice, sulfated bile acid concentration was 7.4-fold higher compared with that of wild-type mice, whereas 3α-sulfated bile acid in livers of both mice was not detectable (<0.06 μmol/g liver) (Table II). These data also support the idea that hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase-mediated LCA sulfate is rapidly excreted from liver resulting in the decrease of LCA level in liver of female FXR-null mice. Because of the efficient LCA-sulfating activity in female mice, as well as humans, female mice rather than male mice lacking the activity might represent a feasible model for human LCA-induced toxicity. Despite lacking bile acid sulfating activity, male wild-type mice are resistant to LCA-induced toxicity, indicating the presence of the protective mechanisms that are different from bile acid sulfation.In contrast to 1% LCA feeding, no significant increase in AST and ALP activities was found in wild-type mice fed a diet supplemented with 0.25% LCA for 5 days (data not shown). Under these conditions, a rise in liver 3α-hydroxy bile acid levels is likely to be prevented through enhanced excretions of tauro conjugate of bile acids by Bsep and of sulfated bile acids by Mrp2, Mrp3, and Mrp4 (36Gerloff T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Further the increase in LCA intake might overwhelm the LCA excretion capacity resulting in an accumulation of hepatic bile acids in wild-type mice having lower LCA sulfating activity. Bsep expression level was not increased in mice fed with a high LCA-containing diet. Furthermore, Bsep-mediated bile acid transports were inhibited by LCA sulfate (41Akita H. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kinoshita S. Sato N. Takikawa H. Sugiyama Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1511: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The excretion pathway of LCA sulfate thus might become relatively important in the protection system of LCA-induced damage observed with mice fed high LCA diet. Because the apparent Kmvalue of LCA sulfating activity in female mouse liver cytosol was very low (0.14 μm), hepatic LCA should be efficiently sulfated. These results support the contention that LCA sulfation is a critical determinant for regulation of hepatic LCA concentrations.Liver St2a mRNA level is strikingly elevated in FXR-null, PXR-null, and FXR-PXR double-null mice. The expression of FXR and PXR is thus likely to be directly or indirectly involved in the repression of basal St2a expression. Liver total bile acid concentration was 2.8-fold higher for FXR-null mice than for wild-type mice. Furthermore, hepatic St2a level in FXR-null and wild-type mice increased after LCA (0.5%) feeding. These results suggest the possibility that the intracellular accumulation of hepatic bile acids results in the hepatic St2a induction through nuclear receptors such as PXR and vitamin D receptor. Makishima et al. (5Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xei W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) have shown recently that vitamin D receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid LCA. Runge-Morris et al. (42Runge-Morris M. Wu W. Kocarek T.A. Mol. Pharmcol. 1999; 56: 1198-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have proposed, using an in vitro reporter assay, that the expression of rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase is stimulated by a dual mechanism in which both PXR and the glucocorticoid receptor are involved. A reporter construct carrying an FXR binding element from the rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase promoter is stimulated in Caco-2 cells upon CDCA treatment (43Song C.S. Echchgadda I. Baek B.-S. Ahn S.C. Oh T. Roy A.K. Chatterjee B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42549-42556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently, the element was shown to mediate PXR-dependent transcriptional activation of the rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (44Sonoda J. Xie W. Rosenfeld J.M. Barwick J.L. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13801-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our in vivo results with mice lacking PXR and/or FXR showing elevated mRNA encoding St2a were contradictory with these reports. Although we can not explain the conflicting results, our in vivo results suggest a complicated mechanism for regulating St2a expression.The level of Bsep mRNA in control FXR-null mice was less than that of wild-type mice. Increased expression of Bsep mRNA was not observed in LCA-fed mice. This result is consistent with the recent report that LCA decreases expression of Bsep through FXR antagonist activity (45Yu J. Lo J.-L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mrp2, Mrp3, and Mrp4, which mediate export of anionic chemicals, showed no clear changes at their mRNA levels. Relative mRNAs of transporters working for entry of anionic chemicals in liver such as Ntcp, Oatp1, and Lst-1 were all decreased under conditions of LCA supplement, which may suggest an adaptive response to high levels of LCA. The results of RT-PCR indicate that liver transporters function to lower liver bile acid levels. Bile acid sulfates are known to undergo excretion by canalicular and basolateral transporters such as Mrp2, Mrp3, and Mrp4 (37Konig J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 38Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39Hirohashi T. Suzuki H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2905-2910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). No clear changes in levels of transporters working for LCA disposition were observed in the present experiments. Thus, sulfating activity of LCA, not transporting activity of LCA sulfate, might be a rate-limiting step for excreting LCA. In fact, 3α-sulfated bile acid level in bile correlated with hepatic St2a level and LCA sulfating activity.There are reports showing high excretion of sulfated bile acids in liver disorders (46Takikawa H. Beppu T. Seyama Y. Gastroenterol. Jpn. 1984; 19: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 47Makino I. Shinozaki K. Nakagawa S. Mashimo K. J. Lipid Res. 1974; 15: 132-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urinary excretion of sulfated bile acid was shown to be high in bile-duct ligation in experimental animals and in liver failure in humans. These data also suggest the possibility that liver St2a induction is a general adaptive response to extranormal levels of bile acids, particularly of LCA in liver of mammals. The present result also implies hepatic levels of St2a sulfotransferase to be a diagnostic marker for LCA-associated liver disorder. Bile acids produced from cholesterol are associated with various biological functions, including absorption of fatty acids and retinoids and excretion of lipids and cholesterol. Bile acids are produced in liver and excreted into bile through canalicular bile acid transporters such as Bsep1and Mrp2 (1Kullak-Ublick G.A. Stieger B. Hagenbuch B. Mieer P.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 273-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The primary bile acids excreted are deconjugated and deoxygenated by enterobacteria and are reabsorbed at intestine as secondary bile acids such as LCA and deoxycholic acid. The liver has sufficient capacity to transport bile acids into the bile duct mainly after transformation into conjugates. Thus, limited amounts of bile acids are detected in sera under normal conditions. Serum and liver bile acid levels are, however, increased dramatically after hepatic failure or bile duct obstruction. Accumulation of bile acids, particularly secondary bile acids, is believed to be a risk factor for liver toxicity. Administration of LCA and its conjugates, which are hydrophobic secondary bile acids, causes intrahepatic cholestasis (2Yousef I.M. Bouchard G. Tuchweber B. Plaa G.L. Drug Metab. Rev. 1997; 29: 167-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Xei et al. (3Xei W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Waxman D.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) independently reported that the pregnane X receptor (PXR) is involved in protection against LCA-induced liver toxicity. Recently, Makishima et al. (5Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xei W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) reported that the vitamin D receptor functions as a receptor for LCA, as well as 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (5Makishima M.

These facts suggest the involvement of several nuclear receptors in LCA-induced toxicity. LCA is mainly transformed to tauroconjugates and glycoconjugates in liver and pumped out to the bile duct by the Bsep. Conjugated LCA is also transformed to 3-sulfate and 3-glucuronides by sulfotransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, respectively (6Stiehl A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 4: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Dionne S. Tuchweber B. Plaa G.L. Yousef I.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). LCA sulfate and LCA glucuronide were less toxic than LCA (8Takikawa H. Tomita J. Takemura T. Yamanaka M. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 1991; 1091: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These conjugations make the bile acid more hydrophilic and facilitate their elimination in the feces and urine (9Stiehl A. Earnest D.L. Admirant W.H.

Egr-1 gene expression is rapidly induced by mitogens, hypoxia, shear stress, or mechanical injury in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and other cell types via mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases (see Ref. 11Silverman E.S.

These protein kinases, including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, may also modulate the phosphorylation state of Egr-1 and its ability to bind DNA and other transcription factors. Egr-1 contains both transactivation and repression domains and regulates gene transcription either positively or negatively depending upon other DNA binding sites near the Egr-1 site (12Gashler A.L.

Sox9, the first transcription factor to specify the chondrogenic lineage, activates type II collagen gene transcription by binding to the first intron enhancer through its high mobility group (HMG) DNA binding domain and acts cooperatively with L-Sox5 and Sox6 to regulate chondrogenesisin vivo (44Lefebvre V.

It has been proposed that down-regulation of Sox9 expression by IL-1 or up-regulation by fibroblast growth factors or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) determines the regulation of type II collagen gene transcription by these cytokines (44Lefebvre V.

The homeobox protein, Dlx-2, which is stimulated by BMP-2, also acts via the intronic enhancer to increase Col2a1 expression (48Xu S.C. Harris M.A. Rubenstein J.L.R. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).In our previous studies, we showed that IL-1β decreases the levels of type II collagen mRNA by inhibiting COL2A1 gene transcription in chondrocytes in a manner that did not require the intronic enhancer (49Goldring M.B. Fukuo K. Birkhead J.R. Dudek E. Sandell L.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We also showed that IL-1β induces the expression of immediate early gene mRNAs encoding c-Fos, c-Jun, Jun B, and Egr-1 preceding down-regulation of COL2A1 mRNA levels and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase mRNAs in human chondrocytes (20Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.-F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that the COL2A1core promoter, which is highly GC-rich and contains a TATA box, expresses constitutively in chondrocytes and responds to negative regulation by IFN-γ (50Osaki M. Tan L. Choy B.K. Yoshida Y. Auron P.E. Cheah K.S.E. Goldring M.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified two potential Egr-1 sites within the proximal COL2A1promoter spanning −131 to +125 bp that overlap with functional Sp1 binding sites. Since Egr-1 has been shown to regulate the activities of certain promoters by displacing Sp1 from overlapping binding motifs (11Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 15Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether Egr-1 could interact functionally with the COL2A1 promoter and account partially for the inhibitory effect of IL-1β. Our results indicate that Egr-1, when activated by IL-1β, functions as a transcriptional repressor ofCOL2A1 promoter activity in cells that constitutively express this chondrocyte-specific gene and acts through displacement of Sp1 family members from at least one of the overlapping binding sites in the proximal promoter.DISCUSSIONWe showed previously that IL-1β inhibits COL2A1mRNA expression and synthesis of type II collagen, resulting in accelerated dedifferentiation and loss of phenotype in primary cultures of human chondrocytes (4Goldring M.B. Birkhead J. Sandell L.J. Kimura T. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 2026-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Treatment of chondrocytes with IL-1β also increases the levels of the immediate early gene mRNAs, including c-Fos, c-Jun, and Jun B, as well as Egr-1, preceding down-regulation ofCOL2A1 mRNA (20Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.-F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, binding sites directly responsive to nuclear protein complexes containing Fos/Jun proteins or other IL-1β-induced transcription factors have not been identified previously in the COL2A1 promoter. Our present results show that Egr-1 mediates, in part, the inhibition by IL-1β of expression of the proximal COL2A1 promoter by interacting with an overlapping binding site for Sp1 family members and thereby interfering with constitutive gene transcription. Egr-1 is coregulated with c-Fos during skeletal development in the perichondrial interface and interstitial cells of opposing cartilaginous elements and at sites destined for endochondral ossification (61McMahon A.P. Champion J.E. McMahon J.A. Sukhatme V.P. Development. 1990; 108: 281-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the absence of skeletal phenotype in Egr-1 knockout mice indicates that this transcription factor is not essential for normal cartilage and bone development (62Lee S.L. Tourtellotte L.C. Wesselschmidt R.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9971-9977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings are relevant primarily to chondrocyte function in adult cartilage. Similar to other immediate early genes, Egr-1 is induced by serum and acts primarily as a transcriptional inducer of gene expression. Certain growth factors present in serum may suppress the expression ofCOL2A1-reporter gene activity (49Goldring M.B. Fukuo K. Birkhead J.R. Dudek E. Sandell L.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of Egr-1 to repress transcription in the context of the strongly expressedCOL2A1 promoter may reflect decreased expression of this matrix gene observed in proliferating chondrocytes that are undergoing dedifferentiation in vitro.The COL2A1 proximal promoter region studied here is particularly GC-rich and contains binding sites for zinc finger factors, such as Sp1, E box/bHLH proteins, and cKrox, which may positively or negatively regulate constitutive expression in a cell-type specific manner (39Dharmavaram R.M.

In this study, we identified two binding sites for another zinc finger protein, Egr-1, one at −119/−112 bp and the other at −81/−74 bp, both of which also contain the previously identified Sp1 core motifs (29Ryan M.C. Sieraski M. Sandell L.J. Genomics. 1990; 8: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Dharmavaram R.M. Liu G. Mowers S.D. Jimenez S.A. J. Biol.

Many previous studies have shown that Egr-1 can activate gene transcription by displacing Sp1 in promoters where Sp1 serves as a weaker activator. However, interaction of Egr-1 with an Ets-like site was shown to serve a negative regulatory function in the TGFβRII promoter (17Du B. Fu C. Kent K.C. Bush Jr., H. Schulick A.H. Kreiger K. Collins T. McCaffrey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39039-39047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mechanisms by which Egr-1 could suppress transcription include direct repression of promoter activity via DNA binding (12Gashler A.L. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 17Du B. Fu C. Kent K.C. Bush Jr., H. Schulick A.H. Kreiger K. Collins T. McCaffrey T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39039-39047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or “squelching” transcription through interactions with Sp1, independent of Sp1 binding to DNA (63Srivastava S. Weitzmann M.N. Kimble R.B. Rizzo M. Zahner M. Milbrandt J. Ross F.P. Pacifici R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1850-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar).Our experiments indicate that a reduction in COL2A1transcription is associated with increased binding of Egr-1 to the −119/−112 bp site and displacement of Sp1, rather than binding of these factors to adjacent sites in a noncompetitive manner. The extent of binding depends upon the balance of Egr-1 and Sp1 family members in the nuclear extracts. The results of the mutation analyses indicate that the Egr-1 and Sp1 binding sites overlap and encompass the core Sp1-binding site, GGGGCG. Egr-1 binding requires the sequence,GGGGGCG, with the critical G at the 5′-end. Both 5′ and 3′ nucleotides are critical for Sp1 binding, since mutation to GGGGGCGat (m5) or to GaGGGCGGG (m7) prevents competition for binding to the Sp1 consensus. The interaction of Egr-1 with the overlapping Sp1 site is consistent with known binding activities of these zinc finger transcription factors (11Silverman E.S. Collins T. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 665-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 64Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar).Our functional analysis of the −131/+125 bp promoter supports the findings of the binding studies, which indicate that Egr-1 binding to the overlapping site at −119/−112 bp mediates IL-1β-induced suppression of promoter activity and that Sp1 binding is important for constitutive expression. In fact, all mutations except m4 and m6 decrease constitutive activity, corresponding with the loss of Sp1 binding activity. The results of experiments using m4 and m5 as competitors, where the binding activities of Sp1 and Egr-1 are dissociated, also correlate with the functional data. The constitutive activity of −131/+125-bp promoter is sensitive to the m5 mutation, which does not permit Sp1 binding, whereas the IL-1β response is sensitive to the m4 mutation that blocks Egr-1 binding. Furthermore, the m7 reporter construct is less responsive to IL-1β possibly because it binds Egr-1 less strongly. Thus, in the absence of elements upstream of −131 bp, binding of Egr-1 to the −119/−112-bp site is required for the IL-1β response. However, both the m8 and m9 mutations in the downstream site at −81/−74 bp, although they are analogous to m4 and m5, respectively, decrease both Egr-1 and Sp-1 binding and their functional activities are similar. Thus, the binding of Sp1 to the downstream site at −81/−74 bp is required for full constitutive activity of the proximal promoter, but the upstream site at −119/−112 is required for the full response to IL-1β, as also suggested by the relative nonresponsiveness of the m4 promoter to Egr-1 overexpression (Fig. 8E). The different responses of the mutant promoters to Sp3 overexpression indicate that this Sp1 family member may act as a repressor, especially in the absence of Egr-1 binding to the upstream site.The cotransfection data further indicate that IL-1β-induced Egr-1 can suppress COL2A1 transcription when overexpressed in chondrocytes. This effect requires activation of the overexpressed Egr-1, since suppression of −131/+125 bp promoter activity is not observed in the absence of IL-1β. Additional support for the involvement of Egr-1 as a transcriptional suppressor is provided by the results showing reversal of the IL-1β-induced suppression by overexpression of pCMV-WT1-Egr1. This fusion protein, which contains the Egr-1 zinc finger DBD, has been shown to act in a dominant-negative manner in other systems (55Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 65Wang D. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2291-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Egr1Δmt, with deletion of 1.5 of the zinc fingers, also acts in a dominant-negative manner, possibly due to its ability to interfere with activation of the endogenous Egr-1. Neither construct, however, has any effect on constitutive activity. Further support for the DNA-binding requirement for the Egr-1-mediated IL-1β response is provided by the results showing reversal of IL-1β-induced inhibition by overexpression of Egr1ZnR1 and Egr1ZnR2.Since residual Sp3 binding activity persists in IL-1β-treated nuclear extracts and overexpression of Sp3 decreases expression of the −131 bp promoter, Sp3 may play a negative role among the Sp1 family members in chondrocytes. In contrast, overexpression of Sp1 increasesCOL2A1 promoter activity. However, overexpression of either Sp3 or Sp1 blocks the inhibition by IL-1β. These results suggest that the Sp1/Sp3 ratio determines the level of constitutive activity of theCOL2A1 promoter, but that increasing the ratio of either Sp1 or Sp3 to Egr-1 may prevent Egr-1 binding. Our results contrast somewhat with those from previous studies in which Sp1 binding activities to the COL2A1 promoter either decreased (43Ghayor C. Herrouin J.-F. Chadjichristos C. Ala-Kokko L.

However, our findings agree with those of Ghayor et al. (40Ghayor C. Chadjichristos C. Herrouin J.-F. Ala-Kokko L. Suske G. Pujol J.-P. Galéra P. J. Biol.

Thus, increasing the ratio of Sp3 to Sp1 may promote chondrocyte dedifferentiation manifested by decreasedCOL2A1 promoter expression. Although the presence of endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 proteins may obscure the interpretation of the cotransfection experiments, the lack of any effect after a 6-h expression time following transfection (data not shown) compared with the significant changes observed when the expression time is extended to 24 h prior to IL-1β treatment indicates that the observed changes are specific. Our findings are consistent with the general concept that, in mammalian cells, Sp3 is a DNA binding-dependent repressor that may abrogate Sp1-driven transcription from promoters containing GC boxes by displacing Sp1 and preventing its interaction with the general transcription machinery (57Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Similarly, Sp1 acts as a transcriptional activator of the type I collagen gene, COL1A2, whereas Sp3 overexpression blocks the promoter activity induced by TGF-β (66Inagaki Y. Nemoto T. Nakao A.

Formerly known as PKCμ, PKD contains protein domains not found in conventional PKC isoforms. A functional pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is critical for the regulation of PKD activity. Here we report that PKD is tyrosine-phosphorylated within the PH domain, leading to activation. This phosphorylation is mediated by a pathway that consists of the Src and Abl tyrosine kinases and occurs in response to stimulation with pervanadate and oxidative stress. Mutational analysis revealed three tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr432, Tyr463, and Tyr502), which are regulated by the Src-Abl pathway, and phosphorylation of only one of these (Tyr463) leads to PKD activation. By using a phospho-specific antibody, we show that Abl directly phosphorylates PKD at Tyr463in vitro, and in cells phosphorylation of this site is sufficient to mediate full activation of PKD. Mutation of the other two sites, Tyr432 and Tyr502, had no significant influence on PKD activity. These data reveal a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism for PKD and suggest that this event contributes to the release of the autoinhibitory PKD PH domain leading to kinase activation and downstream responses.

In addition, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as well as the serum-response element have been shown to be targets of PKD-dependent signaling (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 23Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PKD-mediated activation of serum-response element-driven genes was shown to occur via a Raf-1 kinase-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (23Hausser A. Storz P. Hubner S. Braendlin I. Martinez-Moya M. Link G. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the activation of PKD by mitogens suggests a role for PKD in cellular proliferation (24Van Lint J.V. Rykx A. Vantus T. Vandenheede J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of NF-κB by PKD indicates an essential role for this kinase in promoting cellular survival in response to oxidative stress (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). As with other members of the AGC kinase superfamily, PKD activity and function are tightly regulated by phosphorylation. Two serine residues, Ser203 and Ser916 (in murine PKD), have been mapped as autophosphorylation sites (11Matthews S.A. Rozengurt E. Cantrell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Vertommen D. Rider M. Ni Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, two serine residues (Ser744 and Ser748 in murine PKD), located within the activation loop, are trans-phosphorylated in cells, and this is necessary for full catalytic activity (26Iglesias T. Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27662-27667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Toker A. Front.

Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) have shown that PKCs are upstream kinases for PKD and can directly phosphorylate the activation loop serine residues. Unlike members of the PKC family, PKD lacks an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence (5Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, deletion analysis of the PKD regulatory domain revealed that the amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain has an autoinhibitory function, such that PH domain deletion mutants are constitutively active in cells (3Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKCs including PKCη, have been shown to bind to PKD, more specifically to the PH domain (29Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, direct phosphorylation of the PKD activation loop serines by PKCε has been shown to release PH domain autoinhibition (28Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which the PH domain exerts negative regulation on PKD activity, and how this is relieved, has not been elucidated. Here we report that tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD occurs within the PH domain, leading to activation. This phosphorylation is mediated by the Src/Abl signaling pathway in response to oxidative stress as well as pervanadate treatment of cells. We show that three tyrosine phosphorylation sites within the PKD PH domain are regulated by Src/Abl signaling, and phosphorylation of one of these (Tyr463) is responsible for PKD activation. These results provide evidence for a tyrosine phosphorylationdependent activation mechanism for PKD.

Pervanadate was prepared by mixing 1 ml of a 20 mm sodium orthovanadate with 330 μl of 30% H2O2 (Fisher) for 10 min at room temperature, yielding a 15 mm solution of pervanadate and H2O2. Residual H2O2 was inactivated by a 15-min incubation with 10 μl of catalase (8 units/mg, Sigma). Pervanadate solutions were freshly prepared for each experiment. The PKD-specific substrate peptide used was AALVRQMSVAFFFK. Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used for transient transfections.

All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. v-Abl p120, Src wild-type, Src*, and Src.Y527F constructs have been described (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Recombinant His6- and HA-tagged PKD and PKD.K612W were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. Infection, harvesting, cell lysis, and purification of proteins by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate chromatography has been described (32Cenni V. Doppler H. Sonnenburg E.D. Maraldi N. Newton A.C. Toker A. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) plus protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were used either for immunoblot analysis or proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated by a 1-h incubation with the respective antibody (2 μg) followed by a 30-min incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were washed three times with TBS (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and resolved by SDS-PAGE or subjected to in vitro kinase assays. Mixed lipid vesicles were prepared by drying lipids (diacylglycerol in a PtdSer background; DOG/PtdSer, 4:140 μm) stored in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) under a stream of nitrogen. Lipids were reconstituted by sonication into PKD kinase buffer in an ice bath sonicator at 4 °C for 10 min at 50% output. Fresh preparations were made for each experiment. Purified PKD (500 ng) and Abl kinase (25 ng) and lipids (PS/DOG) were mixed in a total volume of 40 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was carried out for 20 min at 37 °C after addition of 10 μl of ATP solution (75 μm ATP in kinase buffer). The reaction was stopped with sample buffer, or PKD was immunoprecipitated, and PKD kinase assays were performed. Samples were applied to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. After immunoprecipitation (anti-PKD for endogenous and anti-HA for transfected PKD) and washing, 20 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) was added to the precipitates. The kinase reaction was carried out for 20 min at room temperature after addition of 10 μl of kinase substrate mixture (150 μm PKD-specific substrate peptide, 50 μmATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer). To terminate, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman). The papers were washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone and dried, and activity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For autophosphorylation assays, the reaction was performed in the absence of substrate peptide and was stopped by the addition of sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. H2O2 stimulation of cells has been shown to stimulate PKD activity (13Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17114-17121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In order to investigate a potential role for tyrosine phosphorylation in the activation of PKD, HeLa cells were treated in a time- and dose-dependent manner with the phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. Activation of PKD was monitored by phosphorylation of a PKD-specific synthetic peptide substrate (33Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), as well as by autophosphorylation. Substrate phosphorylation increased by 4–5-fold and autophosphorylation by 4-fold following a 10-min treatment of cells with 75 μm pervanadate (Fig.1A). Pervanadate-induced activation of PKD peaked by 30 min of stimulation and with a quantitatively identical response to control PMA treatment of HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). The production of pervanadate requires the inactivation of H2O2 with catalase (see “Experimental Procedures”). In control experiments using catalase, we demonstrated that there is no residual H2O2in the pervanadate preparations such that the observed PKD activation is due to pervanadate treatment alone (Fig. 1C). Overexpression of either wild-type PKD or a kinase-inactive PKD allele containing a mutation in the ATP-binding site (K612W) revealed that phosphorylation of PKD in response to pervanadate is due to PKD autophosphorylation and not due to co-immunoprecipitating kinase (Fig.1D). Since PKD can be activated by pervanadate and H2O2, agents that elevate intracellular phosphotyrosine levels, we determined the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD in response to these stimuli. Pervanadate treatment increased tyrosine phosphorylation of either endogenous (Fig.2A) or overexpressed PKD (Fig.2B). The control phorbol ester PMA did not induce PKD tyrosine phosphorylation, despite the fact that it is a potent activator of PKD. Moreover, there was a good correlation between the kinetics of PKD activation and tyrosine phosphorylation in pervanadate-treated HeLa cells (compare Figs. 1B to2A). Interestingly, PKD kinase activity was not necessary for pervanadate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation occurs prior to PKD autophosphorylation (Fig.2B). To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation directly contributes to the activation of PKD, we stimulated HeLa cells with pervanadate and immunoprecipitated PKD. The precipitates were treated with either purified recombinant catalytic subunit γ-isoform of human protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1γ) or the phosphotyrosine phosphatase (CD45). Dephosphorylation of PKD recovered from pervanadate (or H2O2, data not shown)-treated cells resulted in a significant decrease in kinase activity (Fig. 2C). PKD activity could not be completely reduced by CD45 treatment, despite its ability to reduce PKD tyrosine phosphorylation by ∼80%. This indicates that either tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD is involved in the initial activation step, which is then followed by autophosphorylation, or that the upstream tyrosine kinase is co-immunoprecipitated with PKD, leading to a steady state between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the in vitroreaction. By using overexpression of dominant negative alleles of Src and Abl, we recently showed that these tyrosine kinases contribute to PKD activation in cells (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether pervanadate- and H2O2-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD are mediated by Src and/or Abl, HeLa cells were treated with the Src kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2 prior to stimulation. Both PP1 and PP2 blunted the activation of PKD in response to pervanadate by 50%, concomitant with a reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.3A). The control inactive PP3 compound had no effect on PKD activity or tyrosine phosphorylation. This underscores the requirement of Src in the activation and phosphorylation of PKD. Moreover, co-expression of constitutively active Src (Src.Y527F) or Abl (v-Abl p120) together with wild-type PKD demonstrated that both kinases mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD in transfected cells (Fig. 3B). It is known that a functional PH domain is required for PKD regulation in cells (3Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To determine whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD occurs within this domain, we first assessed PKD phosphorylation in pervanadate-treated cells expressing either wild-type PKD or a PKD.ΔPH mutant. Deletion of the PH domain resulted in a near complete loss of PKD tyrosine phosphorylation when compared with the control wild-type protein (Fig.4A). Similar results were obtained in cells expressing either active Abl (v-Abl p120) or active Src (Src.Y527F), whereby tyrosine phosphorylation of the PKD.ΔPH mutant was significantly blunted compared with wild-type PKD (Fig. 4B). Thus, the PH domain of PKD is the major target of pervanadate/Src/Abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. We next used a mutational approach to determine which tyrosine residues within the PKD PH-domain are targets of Src and Abl. We mutated six candidate tyrosine residues (Tyr432, Tyr443, Tyr462, Tyr463, Tyr501, and Tyr502) into phenylalanine (Fig. 5A). Each of these single mutants as well as a triple mutant (PKD*; Y432F/Y463F/Y502F) were co-expressed with active Src (Src.Y527F) in HeLa cells, and the level of PKD tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed. The PKD Y432F, Y463F, and Y502F mutants showed an appreciable loss of phosphotyrosine signal compared with wild-type PKD or the other three mutants (Fig. 5B). Thus, Tyr432, Tyr463, and Tyr502 are likely targets of Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, upon co-expression of these PKD mutants with active Abl (v-Abl p120), only the Y463F mutant showed any appreciable loss of phosphotyrosine signal (Fig. 5C). These data indicate both overlap as well as specificity in the Src- and Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD. Because both Src and Abl are able to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD in cells, we tested whether these tyrosine kinases exist in a complex with PKD. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with both endogenous and transfected PKD. Endogenous Src was found in a complex with PKD immunoprecipitates following pervanadate stimulation of HeLa cells (Fig. 6A). Under these co-immunoprecipitation conditions, we failed to detect co-immunoprecipitation between endogenous Abl and endogenous PKD (Fig.6A). Similar results were obtained when PKD and Src were co-transfected in HeLa cells, where overexpressed Src was co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed PKD (Fig. 6B). A constitutive association between PKD and Src was observed when the two proteins were overexpressed, and this could not be increased further with pervanadate treatment. Interestingly, mutation of Y463F had no effect on this association. Again, overexpressed Abl could not be detected on PKD immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the kinase activity of Src was not required for this association because the kinase-inactive Src* allele was still able to co-immunoprecipitate with transfected PKD (Fig. 6C). Thus, in response to pervanadate stimulation of cells, Src translocates to a complex that contains PKD, which likely facilitates the phosphorylation event. Conversely, the phosphorylation of PKD by Abl is likely mediated by a transient association between the two kinases that cannot be recovered under these co- immunoprecipitation conditions. Tyr463 in human PKD lies in a motif highly conserved between mammalian PKD isoforms, as well as PKD orthologues (Fig. 7A). We next tested whether Abl can directly phosphorylate PKD in vitrousing a phospho-specific antibody raised against a phosphopeptide based on the Tyr463 motif. This antibody only detected PKD when phosphorylated at Tyr463 in cells but not the Y463F mutant, demonstrating that it is specific for phospho-Tyr463 (data not shown and Ref. 14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Incubation of purified PKD with purified Abl revealed that Tyr463 can be phosphorylated directly by Ablin vitro (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, PKD phosphorylated by Abl showed a 2-fold increase in protein kinase activity compared with PKD incubated alone, suggesting that Tyr463 phosphorylation partially contributes to PKD activation (Fig. 7C). This activation was on the same order of magnitude as the control activators PS/DOG. Finally, we evaluated whether cellular stimuli, which are known to activate PKD in cells, also induce PKD tyrosine phosphorylation. Stimulation of cells with pervanadate or oxidative stress (H2O2) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD at Tyr463 (Fig.7D). However, stimulation of HeLa cells with either epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or insulin-like growth factor-1 did not induce any appreciable tyrosine phosphorylation of PKD, indicating that Tyr463phosphorylation is limited to oxidative stress signaling. We next evaluated the contribution of Tyr463phosphorylation to PKD activation in pervanadate- and Src/Abl-stimulated cells. First, pervanadate-stimulated PKD activation was partially blunted in cells expressing a Y463F mutant, when compared with wild-type PKD. Second, the triple mutant PKD* (PKD.Y432F/Y463F/Y502F) showed a quantitatively similar activity compared with Y463F (Fig. 8A). This suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr432 and Tyr502 does not contribute to PKD activation. In addition, overexpression of the Y432F or Y502F mutants did not significantly alter PKD activity in response to pervanadate treatment of HeLa cells (data not shown). In order to test whether mutation of these three tyrosine residues to glutamate would lead to constitutive PKD activity, by effectively mimicking the negative charge induced by phosphorylation, we constructed Y432E, Y463E, and Y502E mutants. As a control, glutamine mutations were also created. Interestingly, only the PKD.Y463E mutant showed constitutive PKD activity when expressed in cells (Fig.8B), whereas the other two glutamate mutants were essentially unchanged from wild-type PKD. There was no significant alteration of PKD kinase activity in all of the glutamine mutants (the slight increase in the Y463Q mutant was not reproducible over the course of several experiments). Moreover, the constitutive kinase activity of PKD.Y463E could not be further augmented by pervanadate stimulation of cells (Fig. 8C). Finally, to reveal a potential negative regulatory function of Tyr432 or Tyr502 phosphorylation, we also compared the kinase activity of two double mutants, PKD.Y463E/Y432F and PKD.Y463E/Y502F. In response to pervanadate-stimulation of cells, however, neither of these two mutants showed any appreciable decrease in kinase activity compared with PKD.Y463E (Fig. 8C). Again the implication is that these two tyrosine residues do not significantly contribute to PKD activation. PKD is a member of a protein kinase family that is distinct from PKC isoenzymes and that is subject to diverse regulatory mechanisms that are required for its activation (8Van Lint J. Rykx A. Maeda Y. Vantus T. Sturany S. Malhotra V. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 193-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report an activation mechanism for PKD that is mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of residues within the PH domain. Treatment of HeLa cells with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate, or with H2O2, as well as by overexpression of active alleles of Src and Abl leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PKD. By using a mutational approach, we mapped three candidate tyrosines within the PH domain that serve as targets of Src and/or Abl. These are Tyr432, Tyr463, and Tyr502 (Fig. 5). Although mutation of these single sites to non-phosphorylatable Phe residues reduced PKD tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5), only mutation of Tyr463 showed an appreciable loss of protein kinase activity in transfected cells (Fig. 8). Because mutation of this residue to a Glu induced constitutive protein kinase activity, we deduced that phosphorylation of this site is both necessary and sufficient to stimulate PKD activity in cells, both in response to pervanadate and downstream of the Src/Abl pathway (Fig. 8). Thus, phosphorylation of PKD at Tyr463 represents an alternative mechanism for PKD activation and is particularly interesting in light of the fact that this residue lies within the PH domain. Unlike PKCs, PKD lacks a classical pseudosubstrate sequence necessary for autoregulation (5Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, PKD is negatively regulated by an autoinhibitory PH domain, and deletion of this domain results in a protein with elevated constitutive protein kinase activity (24Van Lint J.V. Rykx A. Vantus T. Vandenheede J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similar increases in PKD activity were reported by mutation of critical residues in this domain such as Trp538 (3Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 410-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that serine phosphorylation at Ser738 and Ser742 in the activation loop mediates the release of the PH domain (28Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of the activation loop can be mediated directly by PKCε, as demonstrated by in vitroexperiments (34Brandlin I. Eiseler T. Salowsky R. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45451-45457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this suggests a hierarchical PKC-PKD pathway that leads to PKD activation and release of the PH domain. In addition, because PKCs are also able to bind to the PKD PH domain, this may also contribute to a conformational change leading to release of the PH domain, thus exposing the activation loop (29Brandlin I. Hubner S. Eiseler T. Martinez-Moya M. Horschinek A. Hausser A. Link G. Rupp S. Storz P. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6490-6496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30Waldron R.T. Iglesias T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9224-9230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus far, structural evidence for such a model has not been presented. Our data reveal an alternative regulatory mechanism for PKD activation that may also result in the release of PH domain autoinhibition. Phosphorylation of Tyr463, either by pervanadate stimulation of cells or downstream of the Src/Abl pathway, leads to PKD activation, and this can be achieved both in vitro using purified proteins or in transfected cells. Thus, Tyr463represents a critical feature of this activation process, because mutation to phenylalanine compromises PKD activity, and mutation to glutamate results in a constitutively active kinase. It is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of Tyr463 leads to release of the PH domain, thus exposing the activation loop which would now be accessible to PKC for phosphorylation. This model is supported by the fact that the Y463E mutant is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser738/Ser742 when expressed in cells. 2P. Storz and A. Toker, unpublished observations. Future studies will address the precise interplay between Tyr463 and activation loop phosphorylation. Both in vitro and in cells, Abl appears to be a direct upstream kinase for Tyr463. Src, on the other hand, may also have a function in phosphorylating two additional sites in the PKD PH domain, Tyr432 and Tyr502. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Src translocates to a complex containing PKD in response to pervanadate stimulation of cells, whereas we have failed to detect any appreciable association of Abl with PKD under the same conditions (Fig. 6). This suggests that the phosphorylation of PKD at Tyr463 by Abl occurs transiently, and any complex between the two proteins cannot be recovered under detergent lysis conditions. Mutation of Tyr432 and Tyr502 to non-phosphorylatable residues results in a decrease in overall tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5). It is worth noting that we have not directly demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of these sites. However, because mutation of these residues to phenylalanine does not significantly alter PKD activity, and also mutation to glutamate does not result in increased kinase activity, it appears that phosphorylation of Tyr432 or Tyr502 would not contribute to PKD activity. Similarly, mutation of Tyr432 or Tyr502 does not compromise Tyr463phosphorylation. It is also worth noting that the loss of phosphotyrosine signal observed in the phenylalanine mutations is not due to a loss of Tyr463 phosphorylation (data not shown). A role for phosphorylation of Tyr432 and Tyr502may be to serve as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, adding another level of complexity to the regulation of PKD in cells. Finally, it is important to note that although the Y463F PKD mutant is significantly compromised in protein kinase activity in stimulated cells, some residual activity remains (Fig. 8A). Coupled with the finding that PKD tyrosine phosphorylation is also not completely eliminated in either PKD.ΔPH (Fig. 4B) or PKD.Y463F (Fig. 8A), it is reasonable to speculate that pervanadate stimulation of cells may lead to the phosphorylation of additional tyrosine residues outside of the PH domain, and which may contribute to PKD kinase activity. Moreover, the constitutive protein kinase activity of the PKD.ΔPH mutant is only modestly increased in cells exposed to either oxidative stress, pervanadate, or upon co-transfection with active Src or Abl (data not shown). Again this modest increase may be due to additional phosphorylations outside of the PH domain or by increased activation loop phosphorylation mediated by unknown mechanism(s). Future studies will address these possibilities. Phosphorylation of Tyr463 may also provide a docking site for SH2-containing molecules. However, we speculate that this is unlikely because the PKD.Y463E mutant is active per se in immune complex kinase assays. Instead, we postulate that the negative charge at this site induces conformational changes within the PH domain, leading to release of autoinhibition, as discussed above. This hypothesis does not exclude other models of PKD activation, such as release mediated by activation loop phosphorylation. Indeed, the precise mechanism by which the PH domain is released may depend on the upstream pathways that converge to regulate PKD. For example, in response to mitogens as well as bradykinin stimulation of cells, we have failed to detect Tyr463 phosphorylation (Fig.7D) (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), despite the fact that these stimuli fully activate PKD by inducing activation loop phosphorylation. Conversely, both pervanadate and H2O2 stimulation of a variety of cell types leads to Tyr463 phosphorylation as well as activation loop phosphorylation (14Storz P. Toker A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that in response to growth factor signaling, diacylglycerol binding and activation loop phosphorylation primarily control PKD activation, whereas in response to pervanadate and oxidative stress signaling, Tyr463 and activation loop phosphorylation are the primary determinants. Taken together, our results point to an important function of Tyr463 in the PKD PH domain controlling its activity. By using both loss of function and gain of function approaches, we show that tyrosine phosphorylation at this residue results in increased PKD activity. We cannot fully rule out that the other two tyrosine residues Tyr432 and/or Tyr502 are also important for some aspect of PKD activity or function. The fact that both Src/Abl and PKCs may converge on PKD to tightly regulate its activation presents an attractive model that we are currently testing. The outcome of these and future studies will likely impact the diverse array of physiological responses that have been attributed to PKD. We thank B. Schaffhausen and A. Hausser for generously providing expression plasmids. We also thank members of the Toker laboratory for insightful discussions."

All of these diseases are characterized by the accumulation of PrPSc, the abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPc), which represents the major component of infectious prions (1Prusiner S.B.

PrPc, which is rich in α-helical regions, is converted into a molecule with mainly β-sheeted structure. PrPScbecomes highly insoluble and partially resistant to proteolytic digestion (1Prusiner S.B.

During biogenesis PrPc transits through the secretory pathway and is modified by the attachment of twoN-linked carbohydrate chains and a glycolipid anchor. The conversion of PrPc into PrPSc is thought to occur after PrPc has reached the plasma membrane, either at the plasma membrane or shortly after internalization in rafts (5Borchelt D.R. Taraboulos A.

It is known that PrPc biosynthesis is a prerequisite for PrPSc formation, and studies in transgenic animals favor a model in which PrPc and PrPSc interact directly, possibly in combination with auxiliary factors (1Prusiner S.B.

Taken together, these data strongly suggest that a prophylactic vaccination strategy against prion infections might be a reasonable approach. In fact, anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies and recombinant Fab fragments have shown pronounced anti-prion activities in prion-infected cultured cells (14Enari M. Flechsig E. Weissmann C. Proc. Natl.

Generation of a transgenic mouse model where PrP was expressed in the presence of a defined anti-PrP antibody showed that these mice had no obvious side effects and that they were partly protected against prion infection from peripheral sites (16Heppner F.L.

A major obstacle for an active vaccination strategy in prion diseases is the apparent autotolerance against PrP existing within a given species, which prohibits for example the production of antibodies against murine PrP epitopes within the mouse (17Prusiner S.B.

Here we show that it is possible to overcome the autotolerance to PrP of the own species by application of an improved immunogen, without inducing side effects that would indicate an autoimmune reaction. Recombinantly expressed dimeric mouse PrP induces highly effective polyclonal anti-PrP antibodies in rabbits and auto-antibodies in mice, which are superior to antibodies induced by monomeric PrP in anti-prion effects in prion-infected cultured cells. We provide evidence that full IgG molecules are much more efficient in anti-prion activity than corresponding Fab fragments, possibly by inducing a cross-linking of PrP molecules. Finally, we show that only the auto-antibodies are directed against a PrP epitope, which is usually not recognized and which is postulated to represent an interaction site involved in the conversion process of PrP (15Peretz D.

Ten days after the last immunization blood was taken for testing of antibody reactivity. Prebleed samples were taken 7 days before starting the immunizations. Rabbits were immunized three times in the classical way using 500 μg of dimeric or monomeric recombinant PrP, respectively, and Freund′s adjuvants. Antibody titers were determined by an ELISA in 96-well format. Wells were coated with 1 μg of monomer or dimer, respectively, in 150 μl of carbonate buffer (0.1m, pH 9.5) overnight at room temperature. Wells were washed with PBST (PBS, 1% Tween) and blocked with 150 μl of blocking buffer (PBST, 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v)) for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were incubated with 100 μl of prediluted polyclonal sera for 1 h at 37 °C. After thorough washing, incubation with the appropriate mouse or rabbit conjugate (dilution 1:4,000) was performed for 1 h at 37 °C. The last washing step was followed by incubation with 100 μl of ABTS (2,2′-azido-bis[3-ethylbenzthiazidine-6-sulfonic acid]). Reaction was stopped with 1 n H2SO4, and optical density measured at 405 nm wavelength. Preimmune sera served as negative controls at a dilution of 1:100, and the cutoff for positive sera was calculated with 2.5 times the average extinction of preimmune sera. Titers were evaluated by end-point dilution approach (highest dilution of the sera that was still positive). The mouse neuroblastoma cell lines N2a and ScN2a have been described (expressing wild-type murine PrP and 3F4-tagged mouse PrP; both Prnpgenotype a/a) (23Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H.

Cells were maintained in Opti-MEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Polyclonal auto-antibodies were added at a 1:50 dilution, if not otherwise stated. This dilution was determined by serial dilution studies as most appropriate for discriminating effective and non-effective antisera. Fabs were applied at a concentration of 20 μg/ml (400 nm) for overnight incubation in short term experiments. For long term treatment, medium changes were done every other day, and antibodies were added fresh with each medium change. Confluent cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated 1 h in RPMI 1640 without methionine/cysteine containing 1% fetal calf serum. The medium was supplemented with 800 μCi ofl-[35S]Met/Cys for 16 h (± antisera) without a chase period. For competition assay, the antibody (1:40 in labeling medium) was preabsorbed with increasing amounts of recombinant dimeric prion protein (0–20 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C and then added to the cells. After incubation, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate); insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. For PK treatment samples were divided in half. One-half was incubated with PK (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and digestion was stopped by addition of proteinase inhibitors. Then lysates with and without PK treatment were subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Beckmann TL-100 ultracentrifuge (1 h at 100,000 × g; TLA-45 rotor) in the presence of 1% sarcosyl. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, in PBS) with 1% SDS, boiled for 10 min, and diluted with 900 μl of RIPA buffer (supplemented with 1% sarcosyl). The primary antibody (1:300) was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added for 60 min at 4 °C. The immunoadsorbed proteins were washed in RIPA buffer supplemented with 1% SDS, subjected to a deglycosylation step with PNGaseF, and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Confluent cell cultures were lysed in cold lysis buffer. Postnuclear lysates were subjected to PK digestion or ultracentrifugation as described above or supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mm Pefabloc) and directly precipitated with ethanol. After centrifugation for 30 min at 3,500 rpm, the pellets were redissolved in TNE buffer, and gel-loading buffer was added. After boiling for 5 min an aliquot was analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot as described (23Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schatzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For preparation of Fab fragments monomer-induced and dimer-induced polyclonal rabbit antisera were desalted and total IgGs purified using the Econo Pac Serum IgG purification kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Concentration of total IgG was determined (1.5 mg/ml). For comparison of inhibitory effects between IgG and derived Fabs, this fraction was added to the cells at a dilution of 1:25 (∼400 nm). This is equivalent to the concentration of Fab fragments of 20 μg/ml (400 nm). Buffer was exchanged to 20 mmNa3PO4, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.0) and volume concentrated to 0.5-ml final volume by using Vivaspin 20 columns (10,000 MWCO, Vivascience). The Fab fragments were generated by papain digestion using the ImmoPure Fab preparation kit (Perbio) following the manufacturer's instructions. The Fab fragments were collected in a final volume of 3 ml, dialyzed against ultrafiltrated water, and concentrated to a final concentration of 0.5 (dimer-induced) and 1.0 μg/μl (monomer-induced) using Vivaspin columns. We have designed a peptide bank consisting of 14 peptides of 20 amino acids and 1 peptide of 15 amino acids in length, respectively, with 5 amino acids overlapping to adjacent peptides, encompassing full-length mature murine PrP (23–231, shown in Fig. 5A). For coating, wells (CovaLink NH modules, Nunc) were activated with the bifunctional linker DSS in carbonate buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6) and incubated with 100 μg of each peptide or 2 μg of recombinant dimer (control), respectively, overnight at room temperature. Wells were blocked (200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature, washed (200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, in PBS), and incubated with prediluted sera for 2 h at room temperature. After another washing step wells were incubated with the corresponding conjugate (diluted 1:4,000 with blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. Upon washing and incubation with ABTS, the reaction was stopped with 1 nH2SO4 and documented by optical density measurement and photography with a digital camera. In order to overcome autotolerance against murine PrP in mice we used a covalently linked recombinant tandem duplication of murine PrP (designated as PrP dimer) as an immunogen (Fig.1A). Linkage was done using a seven-residue linker (22Kräusslich H.-G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), resulting in a dimer consisting of two mature PrP moieties (PrP 23–231 = 23–231). This protein and a monomeric version (PrP-(23–231)) were expressed in E. colias polyhistidine fusion proteins. Upon purification on Ni2+-columns and refolding we typically obtained proteins with a purity of more than 94% (Fig. 1B). CD analysis showed that the secondary structure of both monomeric and dimeric PrP was in an α-helical conformation (data not shown). We immunized PrP wild-type mice and rabbits with the recombinant monomeric and dimeric murine PrP, using initially a classical scheme with Freund's adjuvants (FA) and 50 μg (mice) or 500 μg (rabbits) of antigen in 3 subcutaneous (s.c.) injections. More than 90% of wild-type mice and all rabbits showed clearly detectable anti-PrP antibodies/auto-antibodies in ELISA. There was no significant difference in titers between dimeric and monomeric PrP immunogens. Of note, no obvious systemic side effects or auto-immune phenomena were observed in immunized wild-type mice. Also, when testinge.g. peripheral blood counts, no difference between immunized and non-immunized mice was detectable (data not shown). To optimize the antibody response we compared different types of adjuvants for the immunization with dimeric PrP. In Fig. 1C ELISA end-point titers of a representative study in 40 mice are summarized, induced with 4 different adjuvant types (10 mice each). FA and TiterMax gave comparable results, whereas the combination of CpG-rich oligonucleotides (CpG) and incomplete FA is not applicable despite induction of very high titers because of severe local abscess formation in some animals. Studies on immunization with CpG alone will be intensified in the future because no local side effects of the immunization were observed. The anti-PrP titers were determined in ELISA by end-point dilution (x-axis). The auto-antisera generated in PrP wild-type mice showed reactivity up to dilutions of 1:20,000. The antisera generated in rabbits showed reactivity up to dilutions of >1:50,000 (data not shown). In summary, we show that the immunogen used by this group is able to effectively induce auto-antibodies against PrP in wild-type mice without inducing obvious systemic side effects. Having found that it was possible to generate polyclonal anti-PrP auto-antibodies in PrP-expressing mice, we asked whether the induced antibodies can interfere with endogenous PrPSc synthesis in prion-infected mouse cells. This should also prove the integrity and functionality of the induced polyclonal antibodies under physiological and native conditions. We added polyclonal mouse and rabbit antibodies (pAb) to the culture medium of persistently prion-infected ScN2a cells. As readout we initially measured effects on the de novosynthesis of PrPSc. Cells were metabolically labeled and either rabbit (rab) or murine (mo) dimer-induced anti-PrP antibodies were added to the medium overnight at a dilution of 1:25 (Fig. 2A). Cells were lysed (± PK digestion), subjected to ultracentrifugation, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed in SDS-PAGE upon deglycosylation with PNGaseF (only pellet fractions shown). Antibodies induced in rabbits by dimeric PrP completely blocked PrPSc biogenesis (lanes 9 and 10), and auto-antibodies generated in mice also significantly inhibited the de novo synthesis (lanes 11 and 12). Interestingly, a full-length insoluble PrP population was induced by the antibody treatment that was PK-sensitive, apparently representing insoluble PrPc (−PK panel, lanes 3–6). We then compared effects exerted by auto-antibodies generated either with monomeric or dimeric PrP. Fig.2B shows a representative analysis of 4 dimer- and 4 monomer-induced auto-antisera generated in PrP wild-type mice (diluted 1:50). In total, sera from 26 individual mice immunized with dimeric PrP and from 19 mice immunized with monomeric PrP were analyzed for their ability to interfere with PrPSc biogenesis in cell culture. Only sera that completely blocked PrPScde novo synthesis, resulting in no detectable signal for PrPSc (see lanes 8 and 9), were considered positive. We found pAb induced with dimeric PrP to be far superior in their inhibitory effect, as 12 of 26 (46.2%) were positive under these experimental conditions, in contrast to only 1 of 19 (5.3%) raised against monomeric PrP. To further verify the impact of dimer-induced auto-antibodies on the propagation of PrPScwe performed long term studies with mouse auto-antisera (Fig.2C, left panel; dilution 1:25). ScN2a cells were treated with pAb (mouse) for 7 days, and the amount of PrPSc in the pellet fraction of the lysates (−/+ PK;lanes 3 and 4) was analyzed in immunoblot in comparison to mock-treated control cells (lanes 1 and2). In auto-antibody treated cells, PrPSc was completely abolished, indicating that pre-existing PrPSccould be cleared by the cells when the de novo synthesis of PrPSc was blocked. Even after further cultivation of treated cells for 7 days without antibody no PrPSc was detectable (lanes 7 and 8; lanes 5 and6, mock-treated control cells), arguing that the cells were eventually cured from PrPSc propagation by the antibody treatment. Interestingly, when we analyzed PrPc present in the soluble fraction, the signal was decreased by the auto-antibody treatment (lane 10 versus lane 9). After another 7 days without antibody, soluble PrPc was again expressed at the same level as in the control cells (lane 12 versus lane 11). Taken together, our data indicate that auto-antibodies induced by dimeric PrP are able to effectively interfere with endogenous PrPSc biogenesis in prion-infected cells. After long term treatment with auto-antibodies, the amount of soluble PrPcis significantly reduced, and the cells seem to be cured from prion infection. Treatment of prion-infected cells with pAb/auto-antibodies resulted in a pronounced reduction of PrPSc. Assuming that this effect was mediated by a direct interaction of specific antibodies with surface PrPc we performed competition assays (Fig.3A). Dimer-induced pAbs were preabsorbed (1 h at 37 °C in culture medium) with increasing amounts of recombinant PrP dimer and then added to ScN2a cells simultaneously with the metabolic labeling mixture. As readout we compared the amounts of PrPSc and of insoluble full-length PrP in untreated, pAb-treated cells, and cells treated with preabsorbed pAbs. Treatment with pAb (non-preabsorbed) or with pAb after preincubation with only 1 μg of recombinant protein (lanes 8 and 9) completely abolished de novo synthesis of PrPScand induced insoluble PrP (lanes 2 and 3). Preabsorption of pAb with concentrations between 5 and 20 μg recombinant dimer was sufficient to prevent the antibody-induced inhibition of PrPScde novo synthesis, indicated by the synthesis of PrPSc in almost equal amounts compared with the untreated control cells (lanes 10–12 versus lane 7) and the absence of insoluble PrP (lanes 4–6). From this data we conclude that both the inhibition of PrPScgeneration and the induction of insoluble full-length PrP were due to a specific binding of antibodies to surface PrPc. Given the bivalent and polyclonal character of IgG molecules and the strong binding of antibodies to PrP we speculated whether the observed induction of PrP aggregates might be the result of cross-linking of PrPc by IgGs. To verify this hypothesis we generated Fab fragments of both monomer- and dimer-induced antisera. Due to the high amount of serum needed for the preparation this was done from rabbit sera only. The papain cleavage of IgGs was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of the Fab fragments followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3B). Only Fab molecules of about 29 kDa were visible; heavy chains (∼50 kDa) were completely absent. The efficiency of the polyclonal Fab fragments in terms of PrP cross-linking and inhibition of PrPSc synthesis compared with full IgG molecules was tested by metabolic labeling of ScN2a cells and immunoprecipitation of insoluble PrP after treatment (400 nm each, Fig. 3C). Without PK digestion, IgG molecules induced full-length insoluble PrP (lanes 2 and3) as observed before (Figs. 2A and3A). Interestingly, after treatment with Fab fragments no insoluble full-length PrP was detectable, which can be explained by the inability of Fabs to cross-link PrP molecules. In PK-treated lysates, only the dimer-induced antisera completely blocked PrPScgeneration (lane 8). The corresponding Fab fragment exhibited a less pronounced effect on PrPSc synthesis (lane 10). The monomer-induced antisera, although producing almost equal amounts of insoluble PrPc compared with dimer-induced antibodies (lane 2), had no effect on PrPSc synthesis (lane 7). The latter was also true for the corresponding Fab fragments (lane 9). We then investigated the effect of IgG antisera and derived Fab fragments on the total PrPSc content of ScN2a cells in a long term treatment for up to 7 days. At various time points cells were lysed, treated or not treated with PK, and all lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation. Both detergent insoluble (Fig.4A) and soluble (Fig.4B) PrP fractions were analyzed in immunoblot. Only upon incubation with dimer-induced full IgG molecules the cells completely eliminated PrPSc after 5 days of treatment (lanes 5–8), with the signal significantly decreased after 3 days (lanes 3 and 4).

Recently, a link between insulin signaling and caveolae has been suggested; nevertheless, adipocyte caveolae have been the subject of relatively few studies, and their contents have been minimally characterized. With the aid of a new monoclonal antibody, we developed a rapid procedure for the immunoisolation of caveolae derived from the plasma membrane of adipocytes, and we characterized their protein content. We find that immunopurified adipocyte caveolae have a relatively limited protein composition, and they lack the raft protein, flotillin, and insulin receptors. Immunogold labeling and electron microscopy of the adipocyte plasma membrane confirmed the lack of insulin receptors in caveolae. In addition to caveolins, the structural components of caveolae, their major protein constituents, are the semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase and the scavenger lipoprotein receptor CD36.

Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The membrane lipid composition of caveolae is enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, and caveolae represent a subtype of membrane lipid rafts, that is, subdomains of the PM with specific lipid and protein compositions (2Brown D.A.

Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), but they have been suggested to participate in a large number of important cellular functions. These include the formation of transcytotic/endocytic vesicles in endothelial cells (4Henley J.R. Krueger E.W. Oswald B.J. McNiven M.A. J.

Given all of the important roles for caveolae postulated above, it is somewhat surprising that caveolin-1 knockout animals survive and are relatively normal (13Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B.

On the other hand, these animals do have vascular abnormalities, particularly in the lung, and consequently, they have a reduced ability to exercise. Interestingly, with age they show abnormalities in lipid metabolism as a result of apparent adipocyte pathology (15Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russell R.G. Li M. Tang B.

Indeed, normal adipocytes have perhaps the highest content of caveolae in any cell type. Estimates have been made that from 15 to 30% of the adipocyte PM are caveolae (15Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russell R.G. Li M. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 136: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although why these structures are so abundant in adipocytes is unknown. It is now recognized that adipocytes play a complex and pivotal role in organismal fuel metabolism as both recipients and generators of endocrine/cytokine signals (18Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 3116S-3121SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fruhbeck G. Gomez-Ambrosi J. Muruzabal F.J. Burrell M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E827-E847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, Bergman (20Bergman R.N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 359-385PubMed Google Scholar) has postulated that the actions of insulin on adipocytes are rate-limiting for the regulation of overall fuel homeostasis by this hormone. For this and other reasons, the possible role of lipid rafts and caveolae on insulin signaling and regulated GLUT4 trafficking has been studied extensively (for a recent review, see Ref. 21Bickel P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1-E10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As summarized by Bickel (22Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), the published data are contradictory in that insulin receptors and GLUT4 are reported to be localized in adipocyte caveolae by some investigators and to be absent by others. Moreover and regardless of the presence of insulin receptors there, lipid rafts that may include caveolae have been suggested to be the locus of an important signaling complex downstream from the insulin receptor, linking it to GLUT4 translocation (22Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 23Watson R.T. Shigematsu S.

Thus, the possible physiological role of caveolae in insulin action has generated considerable interest and activity. As with the study of caveolae in any cell, technical issues of isolation and purity may lie at the heart of the uncertainty regarding the composition and physiological function of adipocyte caveolae. Because caveolae are integral structures of the PM, methods needed to be devised to separate them from the bulk PM. As reviewed in Ref. 6Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, these methods include mechanical disruption (sonication/shearing) and/or physicochemical treatment (brief extraction in Triton X-100 at 4 °C) followed by flotation in density gradients. Typically, these protocols are lengthy, and their specificity and effectiveness are questionable. Noncaveolar, detergent-resistant membrane rafts and cytoskeleton aggregates may copurify with caveolae under some of these conditions. An alternative approach is to coat the cell surface (of endothelial cells) with cationized silica to stabilize the PM and facilitate the detachment of caveolae (25Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This procedure was improved further with the introduction of an immunoisolation step using anti-caveolin antibody (26Stan R.V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23144-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As noted in the latter paper, the speed of caveolae isolation can be a critical parameter, and preparations obtained by immunoisolation show a more limited protein composition for caveolae than those involving detergent resistance. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody specific to caveolin-1 (7C8) which can be immobilized on acrylic beads and used to immunoisolate caveolae rapidly. We find that homogenization of adipocytes results in a certain amount of caveolae being pinched off from the PM, and these caveolae can be immunoisolated and characterized rapidly. We find caveolae purified by this method to be devoid of GLUT4, the insulin receptor, and flotillin. Indeed, and in agreement with previous freeze fracture studies (28Westermann M. Leutbecher H. Meyer H.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), adipocyte caveolae have a relatively limited protein composition. In addition to the caveolins only two major protein components of caveolae were identified: (a) the semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), a very abundant adipocyte protein (29Morris N.J.

Monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (clone 7C8) was raised in our laboratory following our published procedures used to obtain monoclonal antibodies against intracellular membrane proteins (33James D.E.

The specificity of this reagent was confirmed by its recognition in Western blots of proteins corresponding in mass to caveolin-1α and -1β (see Fig.1A) and by immunoprecipitation of caveolin with a commercial antibody followed by Western blotting with 7C8 and by the reciprocal experiment of reversing the roles of the two antibodies.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-peptide antibodies against the insulin receptor were prepared as in Ref. 35Lee J. Pilch P.F. Shoelson S.E. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2701-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar. The following antibodies were commercially acquired: anti-caveolin-1 (C13630), anti-caveolin-2, anti-flotillin, and anti-TGN38 (from Transduction Laboratories); anti-VAMP2 (from Synaptic Systems); anti-actin (from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa); anti-transferrin receptor (from Zymed Laboratories); anti-CD36 (Cascade Bioscience). Various researchers kindly provided sera against other proteins: SSAO (Dr. Antonio Zorzano, University of Barcelona, Spain); VAMP3 (Dr. Ronald Corley, Boston University School of Medicine); insulin receptor (Dr. Ken Siddle, Cambridge University, UK). Primary antibodies were detected in Western blots using secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) diluted 1:3,000 and chemiluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The protocol was adapted from Simpson et al. (36Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) as described previously (37Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, epididymal fat pads were removed from male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–175 g) and transferred to KRP (12.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mmglucose, and 2% BSA (pH 7.4)) at 37 °C. Isolated adipocytes were obtained by collagenase B (Roche Applied Science) treatment at 37 °C for 45 min (38Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After recovery from digestion for 45 min, cells were stimulated or not with 20 nm insulin for 15 min. Hormonal action was stopped with 2 mm KCN. Cells were then transferred to HES (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose (pH 7.4)) and homogenized with a Teflon-glass tissue grinder. Subcellular fractions (PM, mitochondria and nuclei, heavy microsomes (HM), and light microsomes (LM)) were obtained by differential centrifugation and resuspended in HES. LM could be fractionated further (see Fig. 9) by sucrose velocity gradient (37Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Microsomes (0.3 mg of total protein) were loaded over 4.6 ml of a 10–35% (w/v) sucrose gradient in 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA and spun for 55 min at 280,000 ×gmax. After centrifugation, fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. All buffers used with subcellular fractions in this work contained a mixture of protease inhibitors consisting of 1 μm aprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin (American Bioanalytical), and 5 mm benzamidine (Sigma). The procedure described in Souzaet al. (39Souza S.C. de Vargas L.M. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) was followed. Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 8 or 9 of differentiation were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C, washed, and treated with primary antibody (2–8 μg/ml) and respective secondary antibody labeled with Cy-3 or Cy-5 (Jackson Immunoresearch) diluted 1:250. Staining of lipid droplets was achieved with 1 μm Nile Red (Sigma). Fluorescence of dyes was assessed by confocal microscopy. The PM fraction (50–100 μg of total protein) suspended in PBS was solubilized with 60 mm octyl glucoside for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. Insoluble material was removed by pelleting for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Monoclonal and polyclonal anti-caveolin antibodies or nonspecific mouse and rabbit IgGs (5 μg) were incubated with the supernatant overnight at 4 °C, then 20 μl of protein A beads (Pierce) was added for 4 h. The supernatant with unbound proteins was collected, and the beads were washed four times with octyl glucoside in PBS buffer, rinsed once PBS, and eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 2% SDS. Protein A-purified 7C8 antibody as well as nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma) were immobilized to acrylic beads (Reacti-gel GF 2000, Pierce) at ∼1 mg of antibody/ml of resin, according to instructions from the manufacturer. Beads were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h and washed with PBS. Microsomes resuspended in PBS (containing 0.1% BSA for biotinylated samples) were added at 5–20 μg of total protein/μl of resin for 16 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered, and beads were washed with PBS. Bound vesicular proteins were eluted sequentially with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and sample buffer for PAGE containing 2% SDS. LM were precleared with nonspecific IgG beads for 16 h at 4 °C. The unbound fraction was mixed with 7C8 beads for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed extensively with PBS, and immunoadsorbed material was eluted with 100 μl of 0.2m NaHCO3 (pH 11.0) in the presence of 0.1% BSA for 30 min on ice. The supernatant was collected and the pH adjusted to 7.0 with 6 m HCl. The sample was fixed with 0.4% OsO4 for 1 h on ice, applied to carbon-coated 300 mesh copper grid, and incubated 30 min at room temperature for adsorption. The grid was rinsed sequentially with water and 1% sodium phosphotungstate (pH 7.4). Samples were analyzed on a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope. Immunogold electron microscopy was performed in the following fashion. Adipocyte PM, adsorbed to EM grids with their cytoplasmic face exposed, were prepared and labeled as described previously (17Voldstedlund M. Tranum-Jensen J. Vinten J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primary monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of the insulin receptor β-subunit (CT-1) was kindly provided by Dr. K. Siddle, Cambridge, UK. The primary antibody against caveolin has been described earlier (40Vinten J. Voldstedlund M. Clausen H. Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Tranum-Jensen J. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins, DAKO, Denmark) was conjugated with 5-nm gold particles according to the protocol of Slot and Geuze (41Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide used for control of the specificity of insulin receptor labeling was comprised of the 15 C-terminal amino acids of the human insulin receptor and was obtained from a commercial source. For cell surface labeling, some modifications of the procedure described in Ref.42Kandror K. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar were made. Primary amines of BSA from KRP buffer were blocked with acetic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C and the reagent removed by dialysis at 4 °C. Isolation of adipocytes proceeded using KRP with blocked BSA until just before biotinylation, when cells were washed with KRP without BSA. Sulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin, Pierce) was added to adipocytes at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and incubated for 2–15 min in the presence or absence of insulin, according to specific experimental design. After labeling, cells were treated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) to quench unreacted biotin and 2 mm KCN, then the fractionation followed the regular protocol. For biotinylation of isolated vesicles (either total LM or vesicles enriched by velocity gradient (43Kandror K.V. Coderre L. Pushkin A.V. Pilch P.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), samples were treated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and vesicles recovered by centrifugation (230,000 × gmax, 120 min). Detection of biotinylated proteins transferred to Immun-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) was performed with 100 ng/ml streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pierce) prepared in PBS-Tween with 2% BSA and chemiluminescent substrate. Sequence analysis was performed under the supervision of Dr. William Lane at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility by microcapillary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Fig.1A shows that caveolin-1α and -1β are detected by Western blotting with 7C8, whereas a commercial polyclonal antibody (no longer available) recognizes only the α-form. These caveolin isoforms differ in the N terminus because of alternate initiation sites for translation, methionines 1 and 32, respectively, for α and β (44Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16395-16401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and thus 7C8 must recognize an epitope between residue 32 and the C terminus of caveolin. Fig.1B shows by immunofluorescence that caveolin detected by 7C8 is almost exclusively localized in the cell surface, as expected. Fig.1C shows the labeling pattern in fractionated rat adipocytes of caveolin (by 7C8), as well as that for various other proteins of interest from resting and insulin-treated cells. As expected, insulin causes a redistribution of intracellular (LM and HM) GLUT4 to the cell surface (PM) (33James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). As we demonstrated previously by Western blotting (45Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the insulin receptor undergoes ligand-dependent endocytosis, whereas caveolin shows a small insulin-dependent decrease in the LM as a result of apparent redistribution to the PM (37Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The change in PM caveolin cannot be accurately measured because of the large amount of caveolin already at the cell surface. Interestingly, flotillin, reported to be associated with caveolin by coimmunoprecipitation (46Volonte D. Galbiati F. Li S. Nishiyama K. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12702-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), has a different distribution than caveolin in the LM and HM membrane fractions (Fig.1C), does not coimmunoprecipitate with anti-caveolin antibodies (Fig. 2), and has a different sedimentation pattern than caveolin (see Fig. 9). Given that several groups have shown association of the insulin receptor with caveolin both in cell-free pulldowns (47Yamamoto M. Toya Y. Schwencke C. Lisanti M.P. Myers Jr., M.G. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26962-26968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and by biochemical and morphological methods in adipocytes (48Nystrom F.H. Chen H. Cong L.N. Li Y. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 30153-30158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we wished to determine whether this was the case in rat adipocyte PM. We used monoclonal 7C8 and polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibodies as shown in Fig. 2 to immunoprecipitate proteins from the rat adipocyte PM and then Western blotted with the indicated antibodies. As has been shown in other cells (51Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), caveolins-1 and -2 form a stable complex that can be immunoprecipitated with both antibodies. None of these antibodies coimmunoprecipitate the insulin receptor under the described conditions. We verified this result with 7C8 using similar immunoprecipitation conditions except that Triton X-100 was the detergent used (data not shown). Interestingly, the caveolin complex immunoprecipitated with 7C8 or caveolin-1 antibodies excluded flotillin (also, see Figs. 7 and 9). Note that the lanes designated 7C8,IP, show nonspecific bands that bracket the location of flotillin. Although most of caveolin is in the PM fraction, ∼10% of the protein is found in internal membrane fractions (Fig.1C and Refs. 37Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 52Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Baldini G. Sargiacomo M. Mastick C.C. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Our original assumption was that this represented caveolin-rich vesicles, perhaps Golgi-derived (53Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and we decided to immunoisolate and characterize these membranes. Antibody 7C8 was immobilized on acrylic beads and was used to immunoadsorb membranes from the LM fraction as shown in Fig.3. After binding of membranes, proteins were eluted sequentially in nondenaturing (1% Triton X-100) and denaturing (2% SDS) conditions. Surprisingly, of the panel of eight proteins tested that are postulated to be involved in aspects of endocytosis/exocytosis, only caveolins-1 and -2 were immunoadsorbed under these conditions. Proteins known to be markers of vesicular trafficking in adipocytes such as SCAMPs and VAMPs (54Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E1-E14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were absent as was GLUT4. The reciprocal experiment of adsorbing GLUT4 was repeated and confirmed earlier results (37Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 999-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that caveolin is absent from GLUT4 vesicles (data not shown). A trans-Golgi network marker (TGN38) and a recycling endosomal marker (transferrin receptor) also did not colocalize with immunoadsorbed caveolin-rich membranes. In more than 10 experiments, an average of 60% of caveolin-1 could be immunoadsorbed, and increasing the amount of immobilized antibody resulted in a maximum of 75% adsorption, presumably because of the topography of the caveolin complexes which prevented their complete immunoisolation. In any case, these results and those of the next two figures support the notion that caveolin-rich vesicles found in fractions enriched in intracellular vesicles represent caveolae pinched off from the PM. The immunoadsorbed material obtained as in the previous figure was treated with high pH buffer (0.2 m sodium bicarbonate (pH 11)) for elution of intact membranes. Analysis by electron microscopy of the structures recovered from 7C8 beads showed them to be vesicular (Fig. 4) and identical to caveolae isolated by other investigators using independent methodology (28Westermann M. Leutbecher H. Meyer H.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These structures have a thickening of the membrane which may correspond to caveolae coat, although the characteristic striations of caveolae which can be revealed by rapid freeze etching studies (55Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) were absent. Moreover, it is possible to identify regions that might correspond to sealed openings of caveolae which would occur upon homogenization/disruption of cells (Fig. 4). The range"

Recent work from our laboratory supports the concept that insulin also stimulates the intrinsic activity of GLUT4 through a signaling pathway that includes p38 MAPK. Here we show that regulation of GLUT4 activity by insulin develops during maturation of skeletal muscle cells into myotubes in concert with the ability of insulin to stimulate p38 MAPK. In L6 myotubes expressing GLUT4 that carries an exofacial myc-epitope (L6-GLUT4myc), insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation equals in magnitude the glucose uptake response. Inhibition of p38 MAPK with SB203580 reduces insulin-stimulated glucose uptake without affecting GLUT4myc translocation. In contrast, in myoblasts, the magnitude of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is significantly lower than that of GLUT4myc translocation and is insensitive to SB203580. Activation of p38 MAPK by insulin is considerably higher in myotubes than in myoblasts, as is the activation of upstream kinases MKK3/MKK6. In contrast, the activation of all three Akt isoforms and GLUT4 translocation are similar in myoblasts and myotubes. Furthermore, GLUT4myc translocation and phosphorylation of regulatory sites on Akt in L6-GLUT4myc myotubes are equally sensitive to insulin, whereas glucose uptake and phosphorylation of regulatory sites on p38 MAPK show lower sensitivity to the hormone. These observations draw additional parallels between Akt and GLUT4 translocation and between p38 MAPK and GLUT4 activation.

However, the two widely used methods to measure GLUT4 translocation, subcellular fractionation and photoaffinity labeling of surface GLUT4, have drawbacks that compromise their ability to measure GLUT4 translocation accurately (see “Discussion”).

Thus, the possibility exists that the intrinsic activity of glucose transporters could be regulated in response to the hormone, and new approaches to measure GLUT4 translocation in intact cells are required (without cellular homogenization or protein immunoprecipitation). To this end, we have used L6 muscle cells that stably overexpress GLUT4 encoding a myc epitope in its large exofacial loop (L6-GLUT4myc cells (20Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)). GLUT4myc can be readily detected at the cell surface of intact cells by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent-like assay (21Wang Q. Khayat Z. Kishi K. Ebina Y. Klip A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In these cells, GLUT4myc shows insulin-regulated behavior consistent with that of GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (22Clark A.E.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, 90% of GLUT4myc is sequestered intracellularly in the basal state, and a significant portion translocates to the cell surface in response to insulin (24Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All GLUT4myc molecules are available for recycling to the cell surface (25Foster L.J.

The Km of glucose uptake is similar in L6GLUT4myc to that in the parental L6 cells (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,29Klip A. Li G. Logan W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 247: E494-E499Google Scholar). Most significantly, the 10% of total GLUT4myc present at the cell surface is still higher than the endogenous levels of GLUT1 or GLUT3 (by almost 100-fold (30Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), and is responsible for both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. This functional preponderance was established by the nearly complete inhibition of both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake rates by the drug indinavir (30Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W.

Hence, L6-GLUT4myc cells are uniquely suitable to make direct comparisons between glucose uptake through GLUT4 and GLUT4 translocation. The molar expression of GLUT4myc in L6-GLUT4myc cells is 5–10 fold higher than that of endogenous GLUT4 in skeletal muscle (30Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Using these cells we have observed that insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation and stimulation of glucose uptake can be segregated in time (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), by their temperature sensitivity (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46079-46087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and most strikingly, by specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK. The latter (pyridinylimidazoles SB203580 and SB202190 and chemically distinct aza-azulenes A291077 and A304000) reduced the insulin response of glucose uptake without interfering with GLUT4 translocation in L6-GLUT4myc myotubes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes without directly inhibiting glucose transporters (28Somwar R.

L6-GLUT4myc muscle cells undergo differentiation from myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes through multiple cell fusions (37Yaffe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In search for information on the mechanisms responsible for the segregation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in myotubes, we examined the maturation of the insulin response of GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake during myogenesis. We report that, in the myoblast stage, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is lower than in myotubes and is not sensitive to inhibition of p38 MAPK. Yet, translocation of GLUT4myc is similar in both stages of cellular differentiation. Moreover, insulin stimulates p38 MAPK and its upstream activators MKK3/6 in myotubes but slightly if at all in myoblasts. These results further correlate the p38 MAPK pathway to GLUT4 activation, because both events mature during L6 cell differentiation from myoblasts into myotubes. SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cytochalasin B, O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and 2-deoxyglucose were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 2-Deoxy-d-[3H]glucose was purchased from ICN (Irvine, CA). Monoclonal anti-myc (9E10) antibody and antibodies to p38 α (C-20), p38 β MAPK (K-16), Akt1, and Akt2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Akt3 and Crosstide (Akt peptide substrate) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). ATF2 recombinant protein, specific antibodies to phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Thr-180 and Tyr-182), phosphorylated MKK3/6 (Ser189/207) and phospho-Akt (S473), and anti-pan p38 MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). All other reagents were purchased at reagent grade quality. For selective experiments, wild-type L6 myoblasts grown and differentiated into myotubes as previously reported (39Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29934-29942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used where indicated. Otherwise, L6 myoblasts stably expressing GLUT4myc, created (20Kishi K. Muromoto N. Nakaya Y. Miyata I. Hagi A. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 550-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and characterized (40Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J.

Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously, were used throughout the study. L6-GLUT4myc cells were maintained in minimal essential medium-α supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified atmosphere of air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For experiments with myoblasts only, L6 cells were seeded in medium containing 10% FBS and used at confluence, 2 days after seeding. L6 cells were differentiated in medium supplemented with 2% FBS into myotubes within 7 days after seeding. Cells were serum-depleted for 3–4.5 h prior to all experimental manipulations. Inhibitors were administered in Me2SO, and the maximum concentration of the vehicle did not exceed 0.05% (v/v). This concentration of vehicle was without effect on any of the parameters measured. Following serum depletion, cells were treated with 10 μm SB203580 for 20 min before the addition of insulin at the indicated concentrations and times as described in the figure legends. Following treatments, cells were rinsed and immediately used for measurement of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the absence of inhibitors as described previously (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For the insulin-stimulated time-course analysis, cells were grown in six-well plates and treated as indicated, and then 2-deoxyglucose uptake was measured for 30 s. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B, and this value was subtracted from all other values. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by lysing the cells with 0.05 n NaOH, followed by liquid scintillation counting. Total cellular protein was determined by the Bradford method. GLUT4myc levels at the cell surface of intact myoblasts or myotubes were measured by an antibody-coupled colorimetric assay as described (24Li D. Randhawa V.K. Patel N. Hayashi M. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22883-22891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the anti-myc monoclonal 9E10 as the primary antibody and a donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody. Briefly, cells in six-well plates were incubated as indicated, lysed on ice with 300 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer per well supplemented with 7.5% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v), protease, and phosphatase inhibitors (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Lysates were passed 5 times through a 27-gauge syringe and heated for 15 min at 65 °C. 50-μg aliquots of total protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE to detect phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, MKK3/6, or Akt by immunoblotting using the corresponding phospho-specific antibodies at 1:500 dilutions. Anti-p38 α and anti-p38 β MAPK antibodies were used at 1:1000 and 1:200 dilutions, respectively. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was used as secondary antibody at a 1:7000 dilution. Proteins were detected by the Enhanced Chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Immunoblots were exposed to x-ray film to produce bands within the linear range, then quantified using National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image software. Immunoprecipitation of p38 MAPKα or β from 500 μg (total protein) of TX-100 detergent cell lysates containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors was performed overnight at 4 °C was performed as described (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of the lysates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. p38 MAPK immunocomplexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 2 μg of ATF2 recombinant protein and 200 μm ATP per condition. Reactions were continuously mixed on a platform shaker and were stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heating for 30 min at 65 °C. Samples were sedimented (12,000× g), and then 50 μl of the supernatant was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes to detect phosphorylation of ATF2, using phospho-specific ATF-2 antibody. Immunoprecipitation of Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 from 200 μg (total protein) of TX-100 detergent cell lysates containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors overnight at 4 °C was performed as described (40Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Akt immunocomplexes were incubated in 30 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with Crosstide (150 μg/condition), 5 μmATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per condition. Reactions were sedimented by centrifugation for 30 s. 25 μl of the supernatants from each reaction were transferred to a Whatman P81 phosphocellulose filters and washed four times for 5 min each with 1% phosphoric acid (v/v) and once with double-distilled water. Filters were allowed to air dry before liquid scintillation counting (40Wang Q. Somwar R. Bilan P.J. Liu Z. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Klip A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4008-4018Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using either unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance test (Fischer, multiple comparisons) as indicated in the figure legends. L6 myoblasts and myotubes were treated in parallel with 100 nm insulin for 2–15 min at 37 °C, followed by determination of 2-deoxyglucose uptake or GLUT4myc translocation. In these experiments, insulin continued to be present during the 30-s uptake of [3H]2-deoxyglucose (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this way, the time courses of insulin-stimulated GLUT4myc translocation and glucose uptake could be effectively compared at each time of insulin incubation. In myoblasts, the maximal -fold stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin (15-min time point) was lower than the -fold stimulation in GLUT4myc translocation (1.6 ± 0.1-fold compared with 2.4 ± 0.1, respectively, Fig.1A). On the other hand, in myotubes insulin-stimulated both responses more than 2-fold by 15 min (2.2 ± 0.1-fold for glucose uptake compared with 2.4 ± 0.1, for translocation, Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the magnitude of the GLUT4myc translocation response was comparable in myoblasts and myotubes, but the full response of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was not realized in the myoblasts. In myoblasts, there was no difference in the rate of stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin and GLUT4myc translocation at the early times of insulin addition. The estimated t1/2 of glucose uptake was 3.3 min and that of the arrival of GLUT4myc at the plasma membrane also was 3.3 min. In myotubes, GLUT4myc rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane with a t1/2 of 2.0 min. In contrast, the stimulation of glucose uptake in L6 myotubes was delayed by a lag of about 2 min before a significant response could be measured. Thus, maximal stimulation of glucose uptake is reached only between 10 and 15 min in the myotubes and is significantly delayed (t1/2 of 5 min) with respect to the response in myoblasts. L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts or myotubes were preincubated with the pyridinylimidazole SB203580 (10 μm) or Me2SO vehicle only for 20 min. This was followed by treatment with insulin (100 nm) for an additional 20 min in the presence of SB203580. Uptake of 2-deoxyglucose was then measured in the absence of the inhibitor. Insulin caused a significant increase in glucose uptake in myoblasts (1.7 ± 0.1-fold above basal,p < 0.001; Fig.2A) and myotubes (2.2 ± 0.2-fold above basal, p < 0.001, Fig. 2B). Preincubation with SB203580 did not have a significant effect on either basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myoblasts (Fig.2A). Similarly, preincubation with SB203580 did not affect the basal rate of glucose uptake in myotubes. However, it reduced the stimulation of glucose uptake by 65% (insulin: 2.2 ± 0.2-fold, insulin plus SB203580: 1.4 ± 0.1-fold,p < 0.001, Fig. 2B). It is unlikely that pyridinylimidazoles act by directly binding and inhibiting GLUT4myc, because both basal and insulin-stimulated rates of glucose uptake are mediated by GLUT4myc in these cells (30Huang C. Somwar R. Patel N. Niu W. Torok D. Klip A. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2090-2098Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Rudich A. Konrad D. Torok D. Ben-Romano R. Huang C. Niu W. Garg R.R. Wijesekara N. Germinario R.J. Bilan P.J. Kilp A. Diabetologia. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar), but only the stimulated uptake was reduced by the drug. Moreover, SB203580 was not present during the transport assay. Furthermore, SB203580 did not inhibit glucose uptake when added only to the glucose transport solution in glucose uptake assays lasting up to 30 min (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), confirming that the inhibition is due to an event different from direct inhibition of GLUT4. Nonetheless, to ascertain that the myc epitope is not related to the sensitivity to SB203580, the selective inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by SB203580 in myotubes visà vis was confirmed in wild-type L6 muscle cells (TableI). This result conforms to our previous observation that SB203580 reduces the insulin-dependent portion of glucose uptake in wild-type L6 myotubes (35Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and further establishes that maturation into myotubes is required for this susceptibility to SB203580 to manifest. Hence, glucose uptake in L6-GLUT4myc cells obeys similar regulation as in parental, untransfected cells.Table IDifferential effect of SB203580 on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in wild-type L6 myoblasts and myotubesMyoblastsMyotubesBasalInsulinBasalInsulinpmol/min/mg protein(−) SB20358012.46 ± 1.3619.91 ± 2.002.8 ± 0.375.60 ± 0.17(+) SB20358013.57 ± 2.2619.43 ± 2.513.0 ± 0.164.20 ± 0.201-ap ≤ 0.05 compared to the corresponding insulin-stimulated sample in the absence of SB203580.Wild-type L6 muscle cells at the stage of myoblasts or myotubes were pretreated without or with 10 μm SB203580 for 20 min, followed by treatment without or with 100 nm insulin for 20 min in the corresponding absence or presence of SB203580.

Results are in pmol/min/mg of protein. Insulin increased GLUT4myc at the cell surface by 2.3 ± 0.2-fold in myoblasts and 2.5 ± 0.2-fold in myotubes (Fig. 2, Cand D). In contrast to the stimulation of glucose uptake, SB203580 did not affect GLUT4myc density at the cell surface of basal or insulin-stimulated myotubes (Fig. 2D). This suggests that pretreatment with SB203580 reduces the glucose transport activity of GLUT4myc molecules that had been fully inserted into the plasma membrane, consistent with previous observations (28Somwar R. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Huang C. Niu W. Lador C. Ramlal T. Klip A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Sweeney G. Somwar R. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Ueyama A. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10071-10078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 above, the time course and maximal response to insulin of glucose uptake in myotubes differs from that in myoblasts. The myotubes responded with an initial delay but then achieved a higher stimulation of glucose uptake than the myoblasts. Given that SB203580 lowered the maximal glucose uptake response in myotubes (see Fig. 2), we examined how inhibition of p38 MAPK may affect the time course of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes. Preincubation of L6-GLUT4myc myotubes with SB203580 prior to determination of the insulin-stimulated time course of glucose uptake reduced the maximal stimulation of glucose uptake to the same levels as in insulin-stimulated myoblasts (Fig. 3). This observation is in keeping with the lack of inhibition of insulin action by SB203580 in myoblasts. However, the lag in stimulation was not prevented (Fig. 3). These tantalizing results raise the possibility that an event downstream of p38 MAPK is responsible for the maximal stimulation of glucose uptake and that other factors upstream or parallel to p38 MAPK contribute to the delay in stimulation of glucose uptake observed in myotubes relative to myoblasts (see “Discussion”). Activation of p38 MAPK by diverse stimuli leads to its phosphorylation by upstream kinases on tyrosine and threonine residues in the TGY motif of its regulatory doma"

To resolve this question, we have used direct in vitro assays to observe the effects of phosphorylation on Bfa1 activity. We show that when Bfa1 is phosphorylated by Cdc5, its GAP activity with Bub2 is inhibited although its ability to interact with Tem1 is unaffected. Thus,in vivo inactivation of Bfa1-Bub2 by Cdc5 would have a positive regulatory effect by increasing levels of Tem1-GTP so stimulating exit from mitosis.

The positive regulation of Tem1, and thus the MEN, has been linked to the activity of Lte1 (9Pereira G. Hofken T. Grindlay J. Manson C. Schiebel E. Mol.

Yeast. 1994; 10: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Following Tem1 activation, the functional sequence of the MEN involves activities of Cdc15 kinase followed by Dbf2 kinase with its associated binding protein, Mob1 (12Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the MEN triggers the long term release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, which, through a series of dephosphorylation events, reduces mitotic kinase activity (13Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Recently, the Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR) pathway has been described which controls an initial release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus, which may contribute to optimal activity of the MEN although the precise role of the FEAR remains unclear (14Stegmeier F. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2002; 108: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 15Pereira G. Manson C. Grindlay J. Schiebel E. J.

Cdc5 has several essential roles in mitosis (12Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Alexandru G. Uhlmann F. Mechtler K. Poupart M.A. Nasmyth K.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 451-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) as well as regulation of the MEN and FEAR pathways. Even in the MEN there is evidence for more than one role for Cdc5. Net1, the protein that sequesters Cdc14 to the nucleolus, is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by Cdc5 so facilitating release of Cdc14 during anaphase (20Shou W. Azzam R. Chen S.L. Huddleston M.J.

Commun. 2002; 294: 687-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cdc5 also has a positive but unidentified role at some stage between Tem1 and activation of Dbf2 (12Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cdc5 phosphorylates Bfa1 both in vitro and in vivo during mitosis in normally growing cells (15Pereira G. Manson C. Grindlay J. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 22Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J.

Two opposite interpretations have been made on the role of this Bfa1 phosphorylation. Hu and co-workers (23Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) observed that Bfa1 was unphosphorylated in a nocodazole arrest, a condition where the MEN is kept inactive. For this and several other reasons, they equated phosphorylation of Bfa1 with an active MEN and hence proposed that phosphorylation inhibited Bfa1 GAP activity. However, Lee et al. (12Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar) reached the opposite conclusion. They observed that Bfa1 was highly phosphorylated in a nocodazole arrest and that overexpression of Cdc5 inhibited the Dbf2 activity that normally signifies an active MEN (12Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,22Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar). 2L. H. Johnston, unpublished observation. By linking phosphorylation of Bfa1 with arrest of the MEN, they concluded that phosphorylation of Bfa1 increased GAP activity to negatively control mitotic exit. It is important to note that these opposite conclusions on the effects of phosphorylation on Bfa1 GAP activity were based on downstream assays of the MEN and not on direct biochemical analyses of Bfa1 behavior. To resolve this important question of how Cdc5 and Bfa1 regulate the MEN, we have directly examined how phosphorylation affects the in vitro properties of Bfa1 in combination with Tem1 and Bub2. This purely in vitro approach was possible as the sites of phosphorylation in Bfa1 by Cdc5 in vivo are largely equivalent to those produced in vitro (23Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In vitro, Bfa1 binds to Tem1 but has different activities depending on whether or not Bub2 is also present. Without Bub2, Bfa1 inhibits GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation from Tem, while Bfa1 acts as a two-component GAP in the presence of Bub2 (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we show that in the absence of Bub2, phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 does not affect dissociation and hydrolysis of GTP bound to Tem1. However, in the presence of Bub2, phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 reduces GAP activity. We therefore conclude that one role of Cdc5 in the MEN is to reduce the hydrolysis of GTP by Bfa1/Bub2, so increasing Tem1-GTP levels and promoting exit from mitosis. However, Bfa1 phosphorylation cannot account for the complete control of GAP activity and so other regulatory mechanisms for the MEN are also discussed. Δ70N-CDC5 was amplified by PCR using as template a plasmid containing aCDC5 allele harboring two point mutations, S165D and T238D (kindly provided by F. Uhlmann and M. Sullivan). The amplified sequence starting at codon 71 of CDC5 was cloned in-frame with GST in a URA3-based plasmid under the control of theGAL1 promoter. The URA3 was then replaced by aTRP1 marker, and the plasmid was introduced into a strain deleted for CDC5 and harboring a CDC5-URA3plasmid (KKY902–2BTa). The CDC5-URA3 plasmid was eliminated by growth on 5-fluoro-orotic acid to generate strain MGY29. A Δ70N-CDC5 kinase-dead plasmid expressing GST-Cdc5KD was constructed using a similar strategy but the template was aCDC5 allele harboring an N209A point mutation that inactivates the kinase (23Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Tem1, MBP-Bfa1, and GST-Bub2 were prepared as described earlier (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Yeast harboring plasmids encoding GST-Cdc5 and GST-Cdc5KD were grown to a cell density of 107/ml in medium supplemented with 2% sucrose as carbon source. After addition of 2% galactose, the cultures were grown for 6 h at 30 °C and harvested. For GST-Cdc5, growth medium was YEP (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone), while cells expressing GST-Cdc5KD were in YNB selective minimal medium. Frozen pellets of cells were thawed, resuspended in cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmNaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics Ltd.)), and passed twice through a French pressure cell. Crude protein extract was centrifuged twice at 18,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was gently mixed with glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C. After 1 h, the beads were packed in a column and washed with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). GST-Cdc5 protein was eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm reduced glutathione. Elution of protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol. Aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. Phosphorylation reactions using radiolabeled ATP were carried out in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1–10 μg of substrate. 10–50 ng of kinase were added followed by 50 μm ATP and 0.1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, 370 MBq/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemli buffer and heating at 100 °C for 2 min. After SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, radiolabeling was visualized by autoradiography. For preparative reactions of phosphorylated Bfa1, the protein was incubated in the same reaction mixture with 10 mm non-radioactive ATP instead of [γ-32P]ATP. Reaction volumes were increased to accommodate up to 100 μg of Bfa1. Incubation was for 4 h. After dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, the phosphorylated Bfa1 (1 μg/μl) was stored at −80 °C. An identical reaction on Bfa1 was carried out using kinase dead GST-Cdc5KD to provide non-phosphorylated control material. Conditions for [γ-32P]GTP exchange and hydrolysis assays were as described elsewhere (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to characterize the effects of Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation on Bfa1. A major technical requirement was to produce Cdc5 in sufficient quantities and with sufficient activity to fully phosphorylate Bfa1 so that any effects of phosphorylation would be reproducible and have their maximal impact. Cdc5 was initially prepared from Escherichia coli and Baculovirus expression systems but was unable to convert Bfa1 completely to an electrophoretically slower, phosphorylated form (data not shown). Eventually, we developed a yeast-based expression system for a GST-Cdc5 derivative, which is activated by S165D and T238D mutations and stabilized by deletion of 70 N-terminal residues (24Shirayama M. Zachariae W. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1336-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 25Lee K.S. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3408-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In vivo, the activity of this GST-Cdc5 fusion protein was indicated by complementation of acdc5 deletion mutant under low expression conditions (use of glucose with a GAL promoter) (data not shown). GST-Cdc5KD provided a kinase-dead control and has a N209A mutation (23Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and an equivalent 70-residue N-terminal deletion. GST-Cdc5 and GST-Cdc5KD were readily purified (Fig. 1A). The differential activities of affinity-purified GST-Cdc5 and GST-Cdc5KD were confirmed using myelin basic protein as a substrate (Fig.1B). Conditions for efficient phosphorylation of Bfa1 were established using increasing amounts of GST-Cdc5 (Fig. 1C). With suboptimal levels of Cdc5, multiple isoforms of Bfa1 were visible by protein staining in agreement with the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites in the molecule. However, with 5 ng or more GST-Cdc5 per assay, a single slower migrating form of phosphorylated Bfa1 was detected. No change in the mobility of Bfa1 was produced by treatment with equivalent amounts of GST-Cdc5KD. The efficient and specific phosphorylation of Bfa1 GST-Cdc5 was further confirmed by the differential radiolabeling produced by GST-Cdc5 or GST-Cdc5KD (Fig.1C). Note that in the following examination of the effects of phosphorylation on Bfa1, optimally phosphorylated Bfa1 was prepared with GST-Cdc5 as described above, while non-phosphorylated Bfa1 was prepared by mock-treatment with catalytically inactive GST-Cdc5KD. Thus, our data are specific to Cdc5 kinase and cannot be attributed to a passive Cdc5-Bfa1 interaction or to unspecified contaminating material in the kinase preparation. The effects of phosphorylation of Bfa1 on Tem1 activity were first examined in the absence of Bub2. Under these conditions unphosphorylated Bfa1 inhibits both the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation activities of Tem1 (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of Bfa1 on GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation were monitored by loading Tem1 with [γ-32P]GTP in the presence of varying amounts of non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated Bfa1. Amounts of [γ-32P]GTP bound to Tem1 were assayed before and after 5-min incubation at 30 °C. In the absence of any Bfa1, 50–55% of bound [γ-32P]GTP was lost from Tem1 in 5 min (Fig. 2). This reflects the loss of [γ-32P]GTP by the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation activities of Tem1 (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the presence of non-phosphorylated Bfa1 there was a progressive increase in the amount of [γ-32P]GTP remaining bound to Tem1 resulting from the inhibition of GTP hydrolysis and GTP dissociation as seen previously (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated Bfa1 was used, there was a similar inhibition of GTP loss from Tem1 (Fig. 2). Thus, phosphorylation by Cdc5 does not impair the ability of Bfa1 to interact with Tem1 and inhibit GTP dissociation and hydrolysis. The effect of phosphorylation of Bfa1 was next examined in assays of GAP activity where Bub2 is also present. These assays were performed by loading Tem1 with [γ-32P]GTP in the presence of phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated Bfa1. Reactions were then incubated with or without Bub2. In a kinetics experiment, Tem-[γ-32P]GTP and Bfa1 were incubated with a single amount of Bub2, and the amount of radioactive GTP bound to Tem1 was assayed at frequent intervals during incubation at 30 °C. The addition of Bub2 with non-phosphorylated Bfa1 caused the expected loss of radioactivity (Fig. 3A), which is due to stimulation of Tem1 GTP hydrolysis by Bfa1/Bub2 GAP activity (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated Bfa1 was used in parallel assays with Bub2, the kinetics of the GAP activity were clearly reduced by ∼50%. This level of inhibition was repeatedly detected in multiple assays of GAP activity where levels of filter binding were highly reproducible and varied by no more than 5%. The possibility that the phosphorylation status of Bfa1 was affected by the GAP assay itself was excluded by the observation that there was no change in the level of Bfa1 phosphorylation during the GAP reaction (data not shown). In the absence of any Bub2, ∼85–90% of the radioactive [γ-32P]GTP remained bound to Tem1 throughout (Fig.3A). This high level of Tem-[γ-32P]GTP results from the inhibition of the intrinsic GTP dissociation and GTPase activities of Tem1 by Bfa1 as described above (Fig. 2). To further characterize the influence of Cdc5 phosphorylation on Bfa1, GAP activity was assayed after a fixed time with increasing amounts of Bub2 (Fig. 3B). As seen above, no loss of [γ-32P]GTP from Tem1 occurred from control reactions incubated with no Bub2, whether or not Bfa1 was phosphorylated. However, addition of Bub2 resulted in the expected GAP activity as judged by the progressive loss of [γ-32P]GTP from Tem1 as Bub2 concentrations increased. Significantly, when Bfa1 had been phosphorylated by Cdc5 approximately twice the amount of Bub2 was required to produce the same GAP activity compared with non-phosphorylated Bfa1. Thus, both kinetic and a concentration dependence assays demonstrate that phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 reduces the ability of Bfa1 to function as a GAP in association with Bub2. We have used an in vitro approach to understand the effects of Cdc5 kinase on the regulation of Tem1 and the MEN. We demonstrate that when Bfa1 is phosphorylated by Cdc5, its GAP activity with Bub2 for Tem1 is reduced. The equivalent result of this activityin vivo would be for Cdc5 to increase Tem1-GTP levels so bringing about positive regulation of the MEN. Our in vitroobservation that phosphorylation reduces the GAP activity of Bfa1 is consistent with in vivo results showing that cells with a non-phosphorylatable form of Bfa1 have reduced ability to activate the MEN (23Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still somewhat unclear why Hu et al. (23Hu F. Wang Y. Liu D. Li Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 655-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and Lee et al. (12Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Lee S.E. Jensen S. Frenz L.M. Johnson A.L. Fesquet D. Johnston L.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2345-2354PubMed Google Scholar) reached opposite conclusions on the in vivo effects of phosphorylation on Bfa1 activity. One possibility is that the two groups observed different extents of phosphorylation and only complete phosphorylation was inhibitory. This idea stems from more recent observations of Pereira and co-workers (15Pereira G. Manson C. Grindlay J. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) who showed that a phosphorylated form of Bfa1 is already present in a metaphase arrest. Upon progression into anaphase, Bfa1 is then further phosphorylated. Although it is not clear whether both changes are caused by Cdc5, there does appear to be two phosphorylation events on Bfa1: one before metaphase that does not inhibit the Bfa1/Bub2 GAP activity and a second during anaphase that could participate in activation of MEN by inhibiting its GAP activity. In considering how phosphorylation affects Bfa1 and GAP activity, Huet al. (23)proposed that phosphorylated Bfa1 has a lower affinity for Tem1 as judged by co-immune precipitation. However, ourin vitro results show that phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of Bfa1 have equal affinities for Tem1 as judged by their similar abilities to inhibit GTP hydrolysis and dissociation. An alternative mechanism may involve interference in the interaction of phosphorylated Bfa1with Bub2 rather than with Tem1. It is notable that a C-terminal deletion form of Bfa1 lacking the domain responsible for Bub2 interaction still has partial in vitroGAP activity in combination with Bub2 even though the two proteins can no longer interact (4Geymonat M. Spanos A. Smith S.J. Wheatley E. Rittinger K. Johnston L.H. Sedgwick S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28439-28445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This might explain why we observe only a partial inhibition of Bfa1/Bub2 GAP activity after Bfa1 phosphorylation. Moreover, it has been recently shown that Bub2 is also phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and it was proposed that this modification could affect GAP activity (26Hu F. Elledge S.J. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Since GAP activity is reduced after phosphorylation of the mammalian GAPs, RGS16 and p120-GAP (27Chen C. Wang H. Fong C.W. Lin S.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Giglione C. Gonfloni S. Parmeggiani A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3275-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the complete inhibition of Bfa1/Bub2 GAP activity might only be achieved by phosphorylation of both components. The partial inhibitory effect of Bfa1 phosphorylation on GAP activity might also reflect the multiple levels of regulatory mechanisms controlling mitotic exit. Indeed, cell cycle progression is apparently normal in Δbfa1 mutants, at least without spindle perturbations. Therefore, timely MEN activity is not only provided by inhibition of Bfa1 as Δbfa1 cells have a permanent rather than a temporal loss of GAP activity. Further regulatory input comes from Lte1, which is a putative positive regulator for Tem1 (11Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although activity of Lte1 is dispensable under normal growth conditions (11Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Yeast. 1994; 10: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Adames N.R. Oberle J.R. Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), disruptions elsewhere in the overall activation of the MEN can make Lte1 activity essential (14Stegmeier F. Visintin R. Amon A. Cell. 2002; 108: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data also implicate PAK (p21-activated kinase)-like kinases in the positive regulation of mitotic exit (30Hofken T. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4851-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, there seems to be a high degree of redundancy in the overall control of mitotic exit which is governed by the antagonistic and opposing effects of a number of regulatory events, of which phosphorylation of Bfa1 is just one example. There are numerous indications that MEN-like regulatory pathways are evolutionarily conserved. The MEN is closely related to the SIN (septation initiation network) pathway of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where the Tem1-like small GTPase, Spg1, is again regulated by a two component GAP comprising Cdc16 and Byr4, which are homologous to Bub2 and Bfa1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Bardin A.J. Amon A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar and 2McCollum D. Gould K.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As with the MEN of budding yeast, the activity of the SIN depends on a polo kinase, Plo1, which is the S. pombe homologue of Cdc5. It is not yet known whether Byr4 is phosphorylated by Plo1, although considerable genetic evidence points to Cdc16/Byr4 being affected by Plo1 (31Tanaka K. Petersen J. MacIver F. Mulvihill D.P. Glover D.M. Hagan I.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1259-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In fission and budding yeasts the polo-like kinases may also stimulate SIN/MEN activity downstream of their respective two-component GAPs, although in neither species is it clear how this stimulation occurs (12Lee S.E. Frenz L.M. Wells N.J. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 784-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 32Fournier N. Cerutti L. Beltraminelli N.

Effort has been focused on identifying substrates of BMP-1, but little is known about its activation and in particular where, in relation to the cell, it cleaves its substrates. BMP-1 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme (for review see Ref. 12Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and the site of removal of the prodomain is expected to determine the site of action of BMP-1. The active proteinase can be isolated from the medium of cultured human cells and tendon organ cultures. However, this does not exclude the possibility that the prodomain of BMP-1 can be cleaved within the cell, with secretion of the active molecule. Pro-BMP-1 comprises a signal peptide, a prodomain, a catalytic domain, three CUB domains, and an epidermal growth factor-like domain (12Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 1247-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The function of the prodomain is unknown, although latency is a likely role. Expression of recombinant BMP-1 lacking a prodomain showed that its absence does not abrogate secretion (13Sieron A.L. Tretiakova A. Jameson B.A. Segall M.L. Lund-Katz S. Tari Qkhan M. Li S.-W. Stöcker W. Biochem. 2000; 39: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but this does not rule out a function for the prodomain in the secretion of BMP-1 and the regulation of its site of action. A major question is whether the prodomain maintains BMP-1 in an inactive form until it is transported to its site of action, whereupon removal of the prodomain leads to the release of active BMP-1. Evidence from expression studies in bacteria suggests that cleavage of the prodomain is required for BMP-1 activity (5Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 6Li S.-W. Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Hojima Y. Arnold W.V. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), which is a consensus sequence for proprotein convertases (PCs). Furin, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7 are the four members that recognize the general RX(K/R)R motif (15Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 16Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The cellular site where this maturation occurs is not well defined, despite extensive studies of the localization of PCs. For example, furin has a transmembrane domain that targets the protein to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is known to cycle between the TGN and the plasma membrane (PM) via the endosome retrieval pathway (17Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). There is also evidence to suggest that furin can be cleaved at the PM and released as a secreted form into the ECM (18Denault J.-B. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furin is involved in the processing of a wide variety of molecules, for example, notch (19Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C.

Furin also autoactivates with cleavage of its prodomain being required for exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After cleavage, the prodomain remains associated with the mature molecule and inhibits the furin. Upon reaching the acidic environment of the TGN, the prodomain dissociates and furin becomes active (24Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T. Duguay S.J. Van de Ven W.J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26565-26569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). BMP-1 antibody (N-ter antibody) was from Oncogene, and the anti-FLAG M2 antibody was from Sigma. All PCR products and plasmid purifications were carried out using Qiagen kits. Prestained protein markers were obtained from Bio-Rad. Decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone was obtained from Bachem. A full-length cDNA for BMP-1 (P13497) was cloned from a human placental cDNA library and inserted at theKpnI/XbaI of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (ATCC CCL-121) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 100 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (complete DMEM), at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The mutant BMP-1 proteins were stably expressed in HT-1080 cells. Transfections were carried out using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) with 10 μg of plasmid/100-mm tissue culture dish, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pools were selected and maintained with 250 μg/ml Geneticin. The culture media was collected and cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 10 min and concentrated using Centriprep-30 (Amicon, Inc.). The samples were used immediately or stored at −80 °C. The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was added to the C terminus of the BMP-1 construct (5′ of the stop codon) by PCR modification of the wild-type construct. A forward primer (5′-TCGTGAGAACATCCAGCCAGGGCA-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CCCCCCTCGAGTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCTGGGGGGTCCGGTTTCTTTTCTGCACTCGGAATTTGAGC-3′) with a XhoI site (boldface) and the FLAG epitope (underlined) were used to amplify a fragment of ∼1500 bp. An internalBamHI site and the XhoI were used to generate a fragment that was introduced in place of the wild-type fragment. The117RSRR120 to117RSAA120 (pro-BMP-1AA) mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of theKpnI/XcmI fragment of the BMP-1 FLAG construct. KpnI is located prior to the start codon, andXcmI is located at nucleotide 383. The mutations were made by standard procedures using strand overlap PCR (25Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) usingPwo polymerase (Roche Applied Science). A forward primer containing a KpnI site (boldface) (5′-GCGGTACCCGGGGATCCGATAT-3′, KpnII), a reverse primer (5′-AGGGTCTCTCCACAGGCTGGGCAC-3′, seq8), and oligonucleotides in both directions containing the desired mutation (underlined) (5′-ACGTCGCCGCTGCTGCGCTACGGGATC-3′, furR; 5′-GATCCCGTAGCGCAGCAGCGGCGACGT-3′, furF) were used.Pwo DNA polymerase was used to minimize base misincorporation during the polymerase chain reactions. Briefly, a DNA fragment was amplified using the KpnII primer and the antisense mutant primer (furR), and an overlapping fragment was amplified using the sense mutant primer (furF) and the downstream seq8 primer. Both fragments were gel-purified (Qiagen), mixed, and re-amplified with the KpnII and seq8 primers. The product was digested using appropriate restriction enzymes (KpnI andXcmI), gel-purified, and introduced in place of the corresponding wild-type fragment in BMP-1 FLAG. DNA sequencing (Big Dye, ABI Biosystems) was used to verify the mutations and to ensure that the cDNA clones were error-free. Nonidet P-40 extracts were prepared as follows. Cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice for 15 min with 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6) containing 10 mm EDTA and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells in Nonidet P-40 buffer were scraped on ice, and lysates were subjected to a 5-min centrifugation at 14,000 × gat 4 °C. Supernatants were retained and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Secreted proteins were concentrated on Centriprep-30 membranes and separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE (4/10% or 4/7%). Most samples were grown for 5–24 h prior to harvest in DMEM with 0% FBS. For BFA and MON treatment, cells were grown for 4–5 h in DMEM with 0% FBS in the presence of 3.5 μm inhibitor. FI was used at 20 and 40 μm in 0% DMEM for 4–5 h. Pro-BMP-1 and pro-BMP-1AA were examined by Western blot analysis in which the primary antibody was either the mouse monoclonal FLAG antibody or the rabbit polyclonal N-ter antibody. Secondary antibodies were either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated to anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG and were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration, Pierce). Recombinant BMP-1 was assayed for procollagen C-proteinase activity using human14C-labeled type I procollagen substrate and analysis of the cleavage products on SDS gels as described (38Hojima Y. van der Rest M. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15996-16003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief,14C-labeled type I procollagen was obtained from the medium of human skin fibroblasts that had been cultured in DMEM supplemented with ascorbic acid (25 μg/ml), l-glutamine, and a mixture of uniformly labeled 14C-l-amino acids (1 μCi/ml). The procollagen was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (176 mg/ml) and ion exchange chromatography and was then concentrated by ultrafiltration on Centriprep-100 membranes. The assays were carried out at 37 °C for 4 h. For furin digests, 1–2 μg of protein was incubated overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor, with or without 5 units of recombinant furin (Affinity Bioreagents). PNGase and neuraminidase (New England BioLabs) were used to digest protein samples per the manufacturer's instructions. HT-1080 cells were grown on coverslips in complete DMEM to ∼60% confluency. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol (−20 °C) for 5 min. Fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with either 1210 (rabbit IgG) antibody or anti-TGN46 (sheep IgG) antibody in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After washing, cells were incubated for 20 min with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-sheep IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were washed with PBS, incubated for 1 min with DAPI (4 μg/ml), further washed with PBS, mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem), and observed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The tetrabasic motif at117RSRR120 was the presumed C-terminal end of the prodomain, with activation being carried out by a member of the furin-like proprotein convertase (PC) family. Previous work had established that pro-BMP-1 is cleaved following an Arg-Arg sequence, based on the reactivity of the antiserum raised to the N terminus of the cleaved product (25Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we wanted to know where the prodomain was removed, in particular whether this occurred intracellularly, at the PM or extracellularly. In preliminary experiments we engineered a pro-BMP-1 molecule containing a FLAG epitope at the C terminus. Previous work had established that the FLAG epitope did not interfere with expression or proteolytic activity of BMP-1 (3Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Inamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The potential PC cleavage site in pro-BMP-1 was changing from 117RSRR120 to117RSAA120 by site-directed mutagenesis (pro-BMP-1AA, Fig. 1). HT-1080 cells were transfected separately with cDNAs encoding pro-BMP-1 and pro-BMP-1AA, and the proteins in the cell lysate and culture medium were examined by Western blot analysis using the anti-prodomain antibody (N-ter antibody) and the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. 2). The N-ter antibody recognized a protein of ∼95 kDa in Nonidet P-40 extracts of cells transfected with pro-BMP-1 and pro-BMP-1AA. A protein of ∼105 kDa was detected in the medium of cells transfected with cDNA for pro-BMP-1AA but not pro-BMP-1. The anti-FLAG antibody reacted with the ∼95-kDa protein in the cell extract and a protein of ∼85 kDa in the medium of cells expressing pro-BMP-1 as well as the ∼105-kDa protein in the medium of cells expressing pro-BMP-1AA. Taken together, these results showed that the ∼85-kDa protein in the medium corresponded to BMP-1 (which lacked the prodomain), the ∼95-kDa protein in the Nonidet P-40 extract corresponded to pro-BMP-1 (retaining the prodomain), and the ∼105-kDa pro-BMP-1AA (retaining the prodomain). From these results we drew several conclusions. For example, the processing of pro-BMP-1 occurs only at the tetrabasic motif; removal of the P1 and P2 arginine residues blocked cleavage of the prodomain. Furthermore, no alternate cleavage site was used when the prodomain cleavage site was removed. The results also showed that removal of the prodomain is not required for secretion of BMP-1. The medium of cells expressing pro-BMP-1 contained a protein of ∼15 kDa that was recognized by the N-ter antibody (data not shown). This was most likely to be the cleaved prodomain of pro-BMP-1. However, pro-BMP-1 was only detected in the cell extracts and not in the culture medium. Pro-BMP-1AA migrated slower (∼105 kDa) than intracellular pro-BMP-1 (∼95 kDa). To determine the reason for this, the glycosylation state of the protein in cell extracts and culture medium was examined by treatment with PNGase (which removes allN-linked glycosylation) or neuraminidase (which removes sialic acid residues). As shown in Fig.3, digestion of intracellular pro-BMP-1 with PNGase resulted in a marked decrease in molecular weight, which was consistent with the removal of the five N-linked glycans that occur on pro-BMP-1 (26Garrigue-Antar L. Hartigan N. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43327-43334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Digestion of pro-BMP-1AA with PNGase resulted in the protein migrating to the same position as deglycosylated pro-BMP-1. Digestion of secreted pro-BMP-1AAwith neuraminidase resulted in a decrease in molecular weight, which was indicative of sialylation of the secreted protein. Of particular relevance to this study, the absence of the ∼105-kDa form of pro-BMP-1AA in the cell extracts and the presence of TGN-mediated addition of sialylic acid residues of this protein showed that the rate of transit of pro-BMP-1AA through the TGN was rapid. The deglycosylation studies showed that the secreted and intracellular forms of pro-BMP-1AA differed only in the state of glycosylation. The clearly detectable difference in migration of secreted pro-BMP-1AA before or after treatment with neuraminidase and the identical migration of the intracellular pro-BMP-1AA before and after neuraminidase treatment demonstrated that: (i) the majority of protein detected on Western blots of the Nonidet P-40 extracts had been extracted from the ER or in transit to the Golgi and (ii) cleavage of the prodomain and sialylation of the pro-BMP-1 molecule occurs at a late stage in the secretory pathway. The absence of pro-BMP-1 in the medium, coupled with the rapid transit of pro-BMP-1 through the late secretory pathway, was consistent with complete cleavage of the prodomain in the late secretory pathway. To determine if the prodomain inhibited proteolytic activity of BMP-1, pro-BMP-1AA and BMP-1 were assayed for procollagen C-proteinase activity using type Il-[U-14C]procollagen as substrate (25Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results showed that BMP-1 is an effective C-proteinase, which is consistent with previous observations of the recombinant protein (3Scott I.C. Blitz I.L. Pappano W.N. Inamura Y. Clark T.G. Steiglitz B.M. Thomas C.L. Maas S.A. Takahara K. Cho K.W.Y. Greenspan D.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar,5Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). However, pro-BMP-1AA was inactive (Fig.4). The C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 was inhibited by EDTA. In control experiments, medium from cells transfected with empty vector lacked C-proteinase activity (Fig.4). Of the PC family of proteinases, furin, PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7 cleave target molecules in the constitutive secretory pathway (16Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) utilizing the tetrabasic motif of RX(K/R)R. The arginine residues at P1 and P4 are critical for specific cleavage, whereas additional arginine residues at positions P6 and P8 contribute to enhance cleavage (18Denault J.-B. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), with P6 controlling the pH dependence of the cleavage (17Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). BMP-1 has arginine residues at the potential P1, P2, P4, P6, and P8 positions (113RGRSRSRR120), which strongly suggests that pro-BMP-1 is a substrate for a furin-like PC. Decanoyl-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (FI) is a potent inhibitor of furin-like proprotein convertases (27Denault J.-B. Claing A. D'Orléans-Juste P. Sawamura T. Kido T. Masaki T. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), leading to inhibition of cleavage of PC substrates. To investigate if these specific PCs are responsible for the maturation of pro-BMP-1, FI was added to HT-1080 cells expressing pro-BMP-1 (Fig. 5). In control samples, pro-BMP-1 occurred in the cell lysate and BMP-1 occurred in the medium (see Figs. 2, 5A, and 5B). Pro-BMP-1 was not observed in the culture medium in the absence of FI. However, treatment of the cells with 20 μm FI resulted in the secretion of the ∼105-kDa form of pro-BMP-1 that we had observed in the culture medium of cells expressing pro-BMP-1AA. Of particular interest, the levels of pro-BMP-1 did not appear to be markedly affected by the presence of FI (Fig. 5A), which was indicative that the secretory pathway was functional and the cells were viable. When the experiments were carried out in the presence of 40 μm FI, the ∼105-kDa pro-BMP-1 was efficiently synthesized by the cells (as shown by the presence of the protein in the cell lysate (see Fig. 5, A and B) but was not secreted into the culture medium (see Fig. 5B). Presumably, at this elevated concentration, FI inhibited the secretory machinery. We wanted to know if furin could cleave the prodomain of pro-BMP-1. To investigate this possibility, we treated pro-BMP-1 with recombinant furin in vitro. To obtain pro-BMP-1, we incubated BMP-1-secreting cells with 20 μm FI and concentrated the pro-BMP-1 by ultrafiltration to decrease the ratio of furin inhibitor to pro-BMP-1. Proteins were incubated with recombinant furin, and the products were examined by Western blot analysis using the anti-FLAG antibody. The results showed that furin cleaved pro-BMP-1 in vitro to yield a protein of the expected size of BMP-1 (Fig.6). Recombinant furin did not cleave pro-BMP-1AA (data not shown). Kridel et al. (28Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) carried out substrate hydrolysis on MMP-9 and identified a dibasic motif, RR, as the potential P1 and P2 amino acids of the cleavage site. GM6001 treatment showed no inhibition of maturation or alteration of secretion profiles for either pro-BMP-1 or proBMP1AA (data not shown). The data on the secretion and post-translational modification of pro-BMP-1 and pro-BMP-1AA, together with those on the effects of FI, suggested that the prodomain of pro-BMP-1 could be cleaved by furin (or a similar PC) within the cell or at the cell-ECM boundary. Interestingly, furin contains a transmembrane domain, which localizes the protein to the TGN, although active cycling between the TGN and the PM occurs (17Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Additional evidence suggests that the catalytic region of furin can be cleaved to produce a secreted enzyme (18Denault J.-B. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the next series of experiments, we used brefeldin A (BFA) and monensin (MON) to test the possibility that the prodomain of pro-BMP-1 is cleaved within the ER and Golgi, respectively. BFA depolymerizes the Golgi apparatus and causes it to fuse with the ER. This effectively blocks protein transport from ER to Golgi (29Fujiwara T. Oda K. Yokota S. Takatsuki A. Ikehara Y. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 263: 18545-18552Google Scholar, 30Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). MON is a Na+/H+ ionophore, which interferes with transport to the late Golgi, effectively blocking protein transport from Golgi to TGN (31Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Additionally, MON alters the pH of the TGN, which may inhibit the activity of TGN-resident proteins, for example furin (31Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of cells treated separately with BFA and MON showed that BMP-1 was not secreted (Fig.7A). This confirmed that BFA and MON had stopped protein secretion. The results also showed that neither pro-BMP-1 nor pro-BMP-1AA was secreted (Fig.7A). Analysis of BFA- and MON-treated cells with the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7B) showed identical results. Importantly, treatment of the pro-BMP-1- or pro-BMP-1AA-transfected cells with either BFA or MON showed no accumulation of BMP-1. This indicated that removal of the prodomain occurs post-Golgi. A consistent observation was that pro-BMP-1 was never detected in the culture medium (unless the cells were treated with FI). Furthermore, we had not detected BMP-1 in cell lysates. Therefore, pro-BMP-1 was either cleaved in the medium by a mechanism that was highly efficient so that pro-BMP-1 occurred transiently, or it was cleaved inside the cell in the late secretory pathway or at the plasma membrane. If efficient cleavage occurred in the culture medium, then we would expect to detect small amounts of pro-BMP-1 in highly concentrated solutions. Likewise, if efficient cleavage occurred within cells, then we would expect to see low levels of BMP-1 in concentrated solutions of cell extracts. In the next series of experiments, we examined highly concentrated solutions of the culture medium and Nonidet P-40 cell extracts of cells taken from 90–95% confluent 100-mm dishes. Care was taken to cool the extracts rapidly and prepare them for 4/7% discontinuous SDS-PAGE in the presence of proteinase inhibitors to avoid nonspecific cleavage of the proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). Cells expressing pro-BMP-1AAwere used in additional control experiments. The results showed the absence of pro-BMP-1 in the culture medium, except in medium of cells expressing pro-BMP-1AA (see Fig.8A). In contrast, BMP-1 was detected in the Nonidet P-40 extract and culture medium (see Fig.8B). Intracellular BMP-1 was detected with the anti-FLAG antibody and not with the N-ter antibody, consistent with the protein being BMP-1. We noted that intracellular BMP-1 migrated faster than secreted BMP-1 (see exert panel in Fig. 8B). This suggested to us that a proportion of the intracellular BMP-1 was post-translationally immature. To test this hypothesis, we digested the BMP-1 with PNGase and neuraminidase. Treatment of intracellular pro-BMP-1 with PNGase (Fig.9A) showed that the protein was N-linked glycosylated. Furthermore, treatment of the secreted form of BMP-1 showed that this protein was alsoN-linked glycosylated (see right-hand panel of Fig. 9B). Treatment of the secreted BMP-1 with neuraminidase (see right-hand panel of Fig. 9B) resulted in a marked sharpening and downward shift of BMP-1, which showed that this protein was sialylated. Results from the anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 9, B and C) showed that intracellular pro-BMP-1 had no sialic acid modification (as shown by its insensitivity to treatment, see Fig. 9C), whereas both intracellular and secreted BMP-1 molecules were sialylated. Upon treatment with neuraminidase, secreted BMP-1 and intracellular mature BMP-1 migrated to the same position in SDS gels. The presence of sialic acid modification on intracellular BMP-1, whereas intracellular pro-BMP-1 lacks sialic acid, implies that sialic acid modification is required prior to removal of the prodomain. Additionally, the observation that secreted BMP-1 had more sialylation compared with intracellular mature BMP-1FLAG implies that removal of the prodomain and sialylation occurs in the same compartment. These results provide evidence that cleavage of the prodomain occurs in thetrans-Golgi network. In further experiments we carried out temperature drop experiments in which the pro-BMP-1-transfected cells were incubated at 20 °C to stop vesicular transport from the TGN (32Chan M. Bennick A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3423-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and extracts of the cells were examined by Western blotting. The results showed a small amount of mature BMP-1 in the Nonidet P-40 extracts and none in the culture medium of cells treated at 20 °C (data not shown). These results are consistent with the proposal that cleavage of pro-BMP-1 to BMP-1 begins in the TGN. To pinpoint the localization of BMP-1 inside cells, we carried out immunofluorescence studies using a neoepitope antibody (1210) that recognizes the N terminus of mature BMP-1 but not pro-BMP-1 (25Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results showed TGN and plasma membrane localization of BMP-1 (Fig. 10A). For comparison, Fig. 10B shows labeling of TGN46, which is a TGN marker (33Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. James J. Lister J.M. Ponnambalam S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 27: 238-246Google Scholar). Localization of mature BMP-1 to the PM was similar to that obtained with Na+/K+ ATPase (data not shown). In this study we showed that the prodomain of pro-BMP-1 can be removed inside the cell by a furin-like (paired basic) proprotein convertase. This removal is required for procollagen C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 but is not essential for its secretion. Lee et al. (34Lee S. Solow-Cordero D.E. Kessler E. Takahara K. Greenspan D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19059-19066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) examined secretion of BMP-1 in several cell types and showed that TGF-β1 induced the secretion of BMP-1 from fibroblasts. Both pro-BMP-1 and BMP-1 were secreted, supporting the results reported here that removal of the prodomain is not required for secretion. Interestingly, TGF-β1 is activated by furin (15Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 35Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), which implies that secretion of pro-BMP-1 under TGF-β1 inducement involves a complex feedback system between BMP-1, TGF-β1, furin, or a related PC. Decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethyl ketone, the intracellularly active furin inhibitor, blocked the removal of the prodomain of pro-BMP-1. The inhibitor functions by either binding active furin or by inhibiting autoactivation (18Denault J.-B. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To show that furin could remove the prodomain of pro-BMP-1, we incubated pro-BMP-1 with recombinant furin in vitro. The results showed that furin was able to cleave pro-BMP-1. The scissile bond was predicted between P1 Arg120and P1′ Ala121. Site-directed mutagenesis of the P1 and P2 arginine residues resulted in accumulation of pro-BMP-1AAin cell culture medium and failure of recombinant furin to remove the prodomain in vitro. The identity of the PC or PCs responsible for the removal of the prodomain of pro-BMP-1 were not identified, and it is likely that more than one PC is capable of carrying out this function. The fact that FI was an effective inhibitor of the removal of the prodomain indicated that furin is a good candidate for the PC responsible for cleavage of pro-BMP-1. PACE4, PC5/6, and PC7 are additional candidates, because they are resident within the constitutive secretory pathway, although only furin and PC7 (like BMP-1 (14Reynolds S.D. Zhang D. Puzas J.E. O'Keefe R.J. Rosier R.N. Reynolds P.R. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)), have ubiquitous tissue distribution (16Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 18Denault J.-B. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The secretion profile of pro-BMP-1AA was identical to that of the pro-BMP-1 in FI-treated cells. Moreover, the majority of intracellular pro-BMP-1 (∼95 kDa) detected on SDS gels was located in the ER and early Golgi compartments. Furthermore, TGN modifications were identified on the secreted form of pro-BMP-1 (∼105 kDa) but not the intracellular form (compare Figs. 3B and 9B). This showed that secretion rates from the ER were fast, and, that TGN- and post-TGN-located BMP-1 occurred transiently within the cell boundary. The rapid conversion of pro-BMP-1 inside cells presumably maximizes the efficiency of BMP-1 in ECM assembly, which might not be possible if pro-BMP-1 were secreted into the ECM. This explained the practical difficulties of detecting BMP-1 within the cell boundary. The fact that no pro-BMP-1 was identified outside the cell shows that there was efficient removal of the prodomain within the cell boundary. In some experiments we attempted to use immunofluorescence to co-localize BMP-1 and furin within the cell. However, the inherent difficulties associated with detecting extremely low levels of furin in most cultured cell lines precluded this approach (36Shapiro J. Sciaky N. Lee J. Bosshart H. Angeletti R.H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Single immunofluorescence was possible using an antibody raised to a peptide corresponding to the neoepitope of BMP-1 (25Garrigue-Antar L. Barker C. Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26237-26242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The results from these experiments showed that mature BMP-1 (i.e. lacking the prodomain) occurs in the TGN and at the plasma membrane. Numerous ECM molecules, other than BMP-1, require PCs for their maturation. Fibrillin, a major component of microfibrils in the ECM, requires removal of its C terminus by furin for incorporation into the matrix (20Raghunath M. Putman E.A. Ritty T. Hamstra D. Park E.-S. Tschödrich-Rotter M. Peters R. Rehemtulla A. Milewicz D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the cellular site of this maturation was not determined. Type V procollagen is a component of the heterotypic collagen fibrils in the cornea and has been implicated in regulating the size of the narrow-diameter fibrils in the cornea (37Birk D.E Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α1(V) N-propeptides and α2(V) C-propeptides of type V procollagen are removed by BMP-1, whereas the α1(I) C-propeptides are removed by furin (21Unsöld C. Pappano W.N. Imamura Y. Steiglitz B.M. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5596-5602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Collectively, therefore, the concerted actions of furin and related PCs together with BMP-1 initiate the critical steps in the assembly of the extracellular matrix. It is intriguing to speculate why cells evolved to use BMP-1 as a convertase for extracellular matrix macromolecules when furin-like PCs would appear to have all the attributes of effective ECM convertases, including being located in the late secretory pathway. Presumably, the use of two convertases, perhaps in different post-TGN compartments, provides a further level of control with which to assemble an ordered and stable ECM. We thank Nichola Hartigan (University of Manchester) for providing the pro-BMP-1 cDNA for these studies. We also thank Vas Ponnambalam (University of Leeds, UK) for the anti-TGN46 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2053912378,"NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I or NDH-1) was purified from the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli using an improved procedure. The complex was effectively stabilized by addition of divalent cations and lipids, making the preparation suitable for structural studies. The ubiquinone reductase activity of the enzyme was fully restored by addition of native E. coli lipids. Two different two-dimensional crystal forms, with p2 and p3 symmetry, were obtained using lipids containing native E. coli extracts. Analysis of the crystals showed that they are formed by fully intact complex I in an L-shaped conformation. Activity assays and single particle analysis indicated that complex I maintains this structure in detergent solution and does not adopt a different conformation in the active state. Thus, we provide the first experimental evidence that complex I from E. coli has an L-shape in a lipid bilayer and confirm that this is also the case for the active enzyme in solution. This suggests strongly that bacterial complex I exists in an L-shaped conformation in vivo. Our results also indicate that native lipids play an important role in the activation, stabilization and, as a consequence, crystallization of purified complex I from E. coli."

Proteins modified with saturated acyl chain groups, such as GPI-anchored proteins and double acylated proteins, have been found to be preferentially targeted to rafts. However, certain transmembrane proteins can also be enriched in rafts through a mechanism that is still unclear. The involvement of rafts has been implicated in many important cellular processes, which include generation and maintenance of cellular polarity, chemotactic migration, and cell surface receptor signaling. For T cell and B cell antigen receptors, raft domains function as signaling platforms where selective signaling molecules are recruited or segregated away (3Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Antigen- or antibody-mediated cross-linking of the immune cell receptor facilitates its translocation into raft microdomains containing myristate- and palmitate-modified Src family kinases, which initiate signaling cascades by phosphorylating tyrosine residues on the nonenzymatic receptor complexes.Recently, the association with rafts of some members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, including CD40, has been reported (4Bilderback T.R.

The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins are key signaling adaptor molecules utilized by many TNFR family receptors. Among the six mammalian TRAF family proteins, TRAF2 and TRAF3 were shown to be recruited to raft microdomains during CD40 signaling (7Vidalain P.O. Azocar O. Servet-Delprat C. Rabourdin-Combe C.

Similarly, the association of TRAF2 with caveolin-1, a component that along with rafts constitutes caveolae, has been reported (9Feng X. Gaeta M.L. Madge L.A. Yang J.H. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8341-8349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The association of CD40 and TRAF in raft microdomains raises the possibility that rafts may function as a signaling platform for the TNFR group of transmembrane proteins as observed for the immune cell antigen receptors.Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells specialized for bone resorption (10Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). These cells are formed by fusion of committed mononuclear cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage hematopoietic cells. In this context, many studies have documented the importance of the TNF family member receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL; also known as ODF, OPGL, and TRANCE) in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts (11Suda T.

The association of TRAF6 with Src family tyrosine kinases and subsequent stimulation of the Src kinase activity has been suggested to mediate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation (22Wong B.R.

The biological significance of the TRAF6-Src signaling pathway is consistent with the osteopetrotic phenotype of Src-deficient mice that displayed osteopetrosis due to a defect in resorption function of osteoclasts (23Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, 24Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin.

Our findings demonstrate that raft expression increases during the osteoclastogenesis and that TRAF6 is recruited to rafts by RANKL stimulation in osteoclasts. Further, we show that disruption of rafts interfere with a variety of parameters required for osteoclast function and differentiation. These include impeded RANK signaling to Akt, defective actin ring formation, and resorption activity of osteoclasts and the reduced survival of osteoclasts. Overall, our findings demonstrate for the first time a crucial role for membrane lipid rafts in the function, and potentially differentiation, of osteoclasts.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provided important evidence for the role of membrane lipid rafts in responses of osteoclasts to RANK stimulation. Activation of RANK provoked the translocation of TRAF6 into the detergent-insoluble raft fraction where Src was constitutively present (Figs. 3 and 4). Raft disruption with cholesterol sequestering agents selectively impaired the RANKL signaling pathways of Akt but not those of MAPK and NF-κB in osteoclasts (Fig. 5). Furthermore, raft-disrupting agents destroyed the integrity of actin ring structure and hampered the RANKL stimulation of bone-resorbing activity and cell survival of osteoclasts (Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). Overall, we presented data demonstrating that the raft microdomain is essential for the proper signaling by RANK and the cellular function of osteoclasts. To our knowledge, our report is the first to implicate rafts in RANK signaling and osteoclast activation.The role of lipid rafts as a signaling platform has been well recognized for immune cell surface receptors such as TCR, BCR, and FcεR (3Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). More recently, the raft association and its requirement for signaling have been demonstrated for the TNFR family members CD40 and TNFR1 (5Ko Y.G. Lee J.S. Kang Y.S. Ahn J.H. Seo J.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7217-7223PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cottin V. Doan J.E. Riches D.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Vidalain P.O. Azocar O.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Accordingly, TRAF2 and TRAF3 were shown to translocate into rafts in response to CD40 ligation (7Vidalain P.O. Azocar O. Servet-Delprat C. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. Manie S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3304-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, TRAF1 was suggested to play a role in regulating the raft localization of TRAF2 for sustained CD40 signaling (38Arron J.R. Pewzner-Jung Y. Walsh M.C. Kobayashi T. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TRAF6 was found to remain unassociated with rafts in CD40-stimulated B cells (8Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). TRAF6 has been shown to be more essential for osteoclast activation than other TRAF proteins (19Kobayashi N. Kadono Y. Naito A. Matsumoto K. Yamamoto T. Tanaka S. Inoue J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1271-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 39Armstrong A.P. Tometsko M.E. Glaccum M. Sutherland C.L. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44347-44356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In this study, we detected the raft association of endogenous TRAF6 in conditions under which RANK is engaged. Stimulation with RANKL induced TRAF6 recruitment to rafts in osteoclasts differentiated from Raw264.7 cells (Figs. 3B and4). An increase in the amount of TRAF6 protein in the detergent-insoluble fraction also occurred during the RANKL-driven osteoclastogenesis of Raw264.7 cells (Fig. 3A). To the contrary, raft association of TRAF2 was hardly detected in osteoclasts (Fig. 3). The selective recruitment of TRAF6 to rafts in osteoclasts may be in part accountable for the more pronounced role of TRAF6 than that of other TRAFs for RANK signaling in osteoclasts.One intriguing observation of our study was selective dependence of RANK-mediated pathways but not others on the integrity of rafts. Raft disruption impaired the RANKL signaling pathways of Akt/PKB but not those of MAPK and NF-κB in osteoclasts (Fig. 5). The selective involvement of Akt was consistent with the requirement for rafts in protection against apoptosis. Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating proapoptotic molecules and by modulating the transcription of survival and death genes (40Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3703) Google Scholar). Given that Src family kinases can stimulate PI3K activity (41Pleiman C.M. Hertz W.M. Cambier J.C. Science. 1994; 263: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), that PI3K activity is critical for Akt activation (42Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4578) Google Scholar), and that pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K or Src family kinases decrease the Akt activation in and the survival of osteoclasts (22Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 27Lee S.E. Chung W.J. Kwak H.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49343-49349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), it has been postulated that Src mediates, through PI3K, the activation of Akt by RANKL and thereby increases osteoclast survival. Our findings that raft disruption blocked RANKL-induced Akt activation (Fig. 5) and cell survival (Fig.8) underscore the importance of raft microdomains for the RANKL-induced activation of Akt and subsequent antiapoptotic signaling cascades in osteoclasts.Another protein of key importance to osteoclast function is the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase pp60src (23Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar, 24Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 25Lowe C. Yoneda T. Boyce B.F. Chen H. Mundy G.R. Soriano P. Proc..Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The expression of Src greatly increases during osteoclast differentiation (see Ref. 43Horne W.C. Neff L. Chatterjee D. Lomri A. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). As it has been reported in other cell types (33Waheed A.A. Shimada Y. Heijnen H.F. Nakamura M. Inomata M. Hayashi M. Iwashita S. Slot J.W. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4926-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 44Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the raft association of Src was evidently observed in osteoclasts (Fig. 3). RANKL stimulation of the catalytic activity of Src was reported, and the recruitment of TRAF6 to form a trimolecular complex with RANK and Src was suggested to result in the Src activation (22Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). In our study, the constitutive level of Src in the detergent-insoluble raft fraction did not significantly change in response to RANKL (Figs. 3 and 4). Given that RANKL induces TRAF6 translocation into the detergent-insoluble fraction (Figs. 3 and 4), it is possible that Src, resident in rafts, functions as a docking site for the RANK signaling complexes containing TRAF6. Consistent with this notion, the expression of Src251, a truncated Src mutant that functions in a dominant negative manner and reduced the level of endogenous wild-type Src in the detergent-insoluble fraction, was implied to alter the detergent solubility of TRAF6 (45Xing L. Venegas A.M. Chen A. Garrett-Beal L.B. Boyce F. Varmus H.E. Schwartzberg P.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Whereas the question of whether the recruitment of TRAF6 to Src in raft microdomains is a prerequisite for Src activation by RANKL and, if it is, exactly how TRAF6 activates Src remains to be addressed, our preliminary data support a role of lipid rafts for RANKL activation of Src by showing the detrimental effect of raft disruption on the Src activation by RANKL in osteoclasts (data not shown).Osteoclasts activated to resorb bone display a distinct organization of F-actin, a ring or belt-like cytoskeletal architecture called actin ring (10Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). The actin ring structure is required for the formation of the sealing zone and the bone resorption function of osteoclasts. Accumulating evidence indicates that TRAF6 is pivotal for the resorption function of osteoclasts. Mice deficient in TRAF6 displayed an osteopetrotic phenotype resulting from the defective resorption activity of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts in these mice lacked the sealing zone and the ruffled border (18Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G. Kaufman S. van der Heiden A. Itie A. Wakeham A. Khoo W. Sasaki T. Cao Z. Penninger J.M. Paige C.J. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Boyle W.J. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that the retroviral gene transfer of RANK lacking the TRAF6 binding site into hematopoietic progenitor cells resulted in the generation of osteoclasts defective in the actin ring formation and resorption capability (39Armstrong A.P. Tometsko M.E. Glaccum M. Sutherland C.L. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44347-44356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Our finding that disruption of rafts impaired the resorption activity of osteoclasts with the concomitant loss of the actin ring integrity (Figs. 6 and 7) indicates that rafts are required for osteoclast function. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the cholesterol extraction had effects on other aspects of cellular integrity and affected osteoclast function in a way independent of rafts.Rafts in osteoclasts may function as the platform for a network of signaling molecules that start to assemble in response to external stimuli such as RANKL. In the assembly process, RANKL-induced recruitment of TRAF6 to RANK and to rafts may be an early event (Fig.9). The raft recruitment may stimulate the interaction of Src, resident constitutively in rafts in osteoclasts, with the RANK-TRAF6 complexes (22Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), leading to the activation of Src and PI3K. On one hand, the lipid product of PI3K activity, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, mediates recruitment of pleckstrin homology domain proteins PDK1 and Akt and consequent activation of Akt. Activated Akt then operates antiapoptotic machinery for osteoclast survival. On the other hand, Src may provoke tyrosine phosphorylation of other protein-tyrosine kinases and adaptor proteins, such as Pyk2 and p130cas (46Duong L.T. Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Machwate M. Nagy R.M. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 47Lakkakorpi P.T. Nakamura I. Nagy R.M. Parsons J.T. Rodan G.A. Duong L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4900-4907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and perhaps actin-binding proteins like cortactin (48Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). These molecules may work in concert with PI3K downstream targets known to regulate cytoskeletal organization, such as Rho, Rac, and ARF6 (42Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4578) Google Scholar, 49Zhang D. Udagawa N. Nakamura I. Murakami H. Saito S. Yamasaki K. Shibasaki Y. Morii N. Narumiya S. Takahashi N. Suda T. J.

Cell Res. 1997; 237: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), to construct and stabilize the actin ring structure. Overall, the requirement for rafts in the stability of the actin ring, which may be crucial for the maintenance of polarity of osteoclasts, and in the increased cell survival mechanism via Akt/PKB would be critical for proper bone resorption function.Detailed analyses of the components recruited to rafts in response to stimuli of osteoclasts may provide an insight into the mechanism by which osteoclasts are activated. In addition, such analyses may reveal new molecular targets for the development of antiresorptive drugs. Rafts are specialized membrane microdomains enriched in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-anchored proteins (1Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5095) Google Scholar,2Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). Raft microdomains are most abundant at the plasma membrane but may also be present in endocytic and secretory pathways. Proteins modified with saturated acyl chain groups, such as GPI-anchored proteins and double acylated proteins, have been found to be preferentially targeted to rafts. However, certain transmembrane proteins can also be enriched in rafts through a mechanism that is still unclear. The involvement of rafts has been implicated in many important cellular processes, which include generation and maintenance of cellular polarity, chemotactic migration, and cell surface receptor signaling. For T cell and B cell antigen receptors, raft domains function as signaling platforms where selective signaling molecules are recruited or segregated away (3Cherukuri A. Dykstra M. Pierce S.K. Immunity. 2001; 14: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Antigen- or antibody-mediated cross-linking of the immune cell receptor facilitates its translocation into raft microdomains containing myristate- and palmitate-modified Src family kinases, which initiate signaling cascades by phosphorylating tyrosine residues on the nonenzymatic receptor complexes. Recently, the association with rafts of some members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, including CD40, has been reported (4Bilderback T.R. Grigsby R.J. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10922-10927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Ko Y.G. Lee J.S. Kang Y.S. Ahn J.H. Seo J.S. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins are key signaling adaptor molecules utilized by many TNFR family receptors. Among the six mammalian TRAF family proteins, TRAF2 and TRAF3 were shown to be recruited to raft microdomains during CD40 signaling (7Vidalain P.O. Azocar O. Servet-Delprat C. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. Manie S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3304-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, the association of TRAF2 with caveolin-1, a component that along with rafts constitutes caveolae, has been reported (9Feng X. Gaeta M.L. Madge L.A. Yang J.H. Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8341-8349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The association of CD40 and TRAF in raft microdomains raises the possibility that rafts may function as a signaling platform for the TNFR group of transmembrane proteins as observed for the immune cell antigen receptors. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells specialized for bone resorption (10Bilezikian J.P. Raisz L.G. Rodan G.A. Principles of Bone Biology. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2002Google Scholar). These cells are formed by fusion of committed mononuclear cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage hematopoietic cells. In this context, many studies have documented the importance of the TNF family member receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL; also known as ODF, OPGL, and TRANCE) in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts (11Suda T. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Jimi E. Gillespie M.T. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 345-357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar). Its receptor RANK can directly bind several TRAF proteins, which in turn trigger downstream signaling molecules for the activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (13Kim H.-H.

Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family is defined by a highly conserved DNA binding domain referred to as the ETS domain. However, the DNA-binding properties of these factors are similar and cannot entirely account for the specificity required for the precise activation of target genes that occurs during the diverse biological processes mediated by individual family members. Modification of discrete family members by signal transduction pathways provides an additional mechanism to determine specificity (1Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, members of the ETS family of transcription factors are important for mediating both transient and persistent changes in gene expression patterns in response to ras-signaling pathways (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol.

The ETS family member elk-1 and related factors are directly phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK),1 a modification required for the activation of immediate early target genes like c-fos (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphorylation of the ETS family members ets-1 and ets-2 by ras-dependent pathways leads to persistent expression of target genes including extracellular proteases such as urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and stromelysin/MMP-3 (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4Wasylyk C.

Ets-1 and ets-2 are phosphorylated at a conserved residue (threonine 38 and threonine 72, respectively) by the well characterized ras-effector pathway, the Raf/MAPK pathway (4Wasylyk C. Bradford A.P.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 877-881PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the same residue in ets-2 can also be phosphorylated by another major ras-effector pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway (8Smith J.L. Schaffner L.E. Hofmeister J.K.

Understanding at the molecular level how phosphorylation modifies the activity of ets-1 and ets-2 will be critical for defining how these factors selectively regulate target genes. The key phosphorylation event occurs within a region of ets-1 and ets-2 that is conserved through evolution with the Drosophila pointed P2 protein, and has been termed the pointed domain (9O'Neill E.M.

Previous work indicated that phosphorylation of ets-1 or ets-2 did not affect protein turnover, nuclear localization, or intrinsic DNA binding activity of the factors (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 4Wasylyk C. Bradford A.P.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 877-881PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal region of ets-2 fused to the heterologous gal4 DNA binding domain is still regulated by the ras/Erk pathway (11Foos G. Galang C.K. Zheng C.F. Hauser C.A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The pointed domain appears similar to domains in other transcription factors, for example in the cAMP responsive enhancer-binding protein, that are regulated by phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions with transcription co-activators (12Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Ets factors can also act as repressors of gene expression, and the pointed homology domain has been implicated in this activity in some family members (1Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, whereas ets-1 and ets-2 have been considered to be activators of gene expression, it is possible that they also repress target gene expression. Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrate that the products of the SWI/SNF genes, first defined in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as co-activators of gene expression, form a complex with the ability to remodel chromatin (13Sudarsanam P. Winston F. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The SWI/SNF complex is conserved in mammals and can act as a co-activator for steroid hormone receptors (13Sudarsanam P. Winston F.

Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The complex has ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity and can alter the conformation of the nucleosome core in a reversible fashion (13Sudarsanam P. Winston F.

The mammalian ATPase hydrolyzing subunit Brg-1 interacts with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) (17Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J. Begemann M. Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Cell. 1994; 79: 119-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The Brg-1 remodeling complex is required for E2F/Rb-mediated repression of gene expression (18Trouche D. Le Chalony C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11268-11273Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 19Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A. Ma D. Luo R.X. Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Recently, experiments performed inS. cerevisiae have definitively established the ability of the ATPase-hydrolyzing subunit of the complex (SNF2) to act as a co-repressor of gene expression (20Martens J.A. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, SWI/SNF appears to act as both co-activator and co-repressor (20Martens J.A. Winston F. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the present report evidence is presented indicating that ets-2 can repress the BRCA1 promoter, a promoter previously reported to contain functional ets-binding sites (21Xu C.F. Chambers J.A. Solomon E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20994-20997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Thakur S. Croce C.M. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Ets-2 can bind to the BRCA1 proximal promoter, and ets-2 co-expression results in repression of aBRCA1 promoter-luciferase in transient transfection assays. Conditional overexpression of ets-2 in MCF-7 cells resulted in repression of the endogenous BRCA1 promoter, whereas expression of other targets, uPA and MMP3, were stimulated by ets-2 overexpression. Biochemical evidence is presented indicating that ets-2 physically interacted with discrete sets of cellular proteins dependent on the phosphorylation status of the factor. We show that components of the mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex comprised one set of proteins that interacted with unphosphorylated ets-2. The pointed homology region of ets-2 directly interacted with the C-terminal region of Brg-1, the ATP-hydrolyzing component of the mammalian complex, in a phosphorylation-dependent mannerin vitro. Co-expression of Brg-1 with ets-2 resulted in repression of a stably integrated BRCA1 reporter gene in SW13 cells, a Brg-1 null cell line. These results demonstrate that ets-2 can act as a repressor and that a chromatin remodeling complex is necessary for this activity. To generate the tetracycline-controlled inducible ets-2 MCF-7 cells, an influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope tagged version of wild-type ets-2 (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell.

A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar), to generate pUHD10-3/HA-ets-2. The MCF-7/Tet-off cell line (Clontech) was transfected with pUHD10-3/HA-ets-2 to establish stable expression cell lines that can be induced to express HA-ets-2. Transfections were done using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as described previously (26Weng L.P. Smith W.M. Dahia P.L.M. Ziebold U. Gil E. Lees J.A. Eng C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5808-5814PubMed Google Scholar). The tetracycline-controlled inducible ets-2 MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without phenol red with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). To induce ets-2 expression, adherent cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and then re-fed with 10% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum/DMEM without tetracycline. For generating stable cell lines expressing ets-2 Ala-72 protein, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the HA-tagged version of ets-2 Ala-72 by the calcium phosphate method as described (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and hygromycin-resistant clones were selected in 200 units/ml hygromycin (Calbiochem, Inc.) and analyzed by Western blotting. Cells were grown in DMEM with 10% calf serum containing 100 units/ml hygromycin. For metabolic labeling of cellular proteins with [35S]methionine, cells were placed in DMEM that lacked both serum and methionine for 45 min, then incubated with DMEM containing 90 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1200 Ci/mmol; ICN, Irvine, CA) for 2 h. Human carcinoma SW13 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Bethesda, MD) and cultured in DMEM plus 5% bovine calf serum. SW13 cells that contained stably integrated BRCA1promoter-luciferase reporter were generated by the co-transfection of 3 μg of BRCA1-luciferase plasmid and 1 μg of a neomycin-resistance vector using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, cells were selected with G418 (400 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and media was changed every 3 days. 14 days after selection, there were about 100 colonies on the dish. The cells were pooled and cultured with 200 μg/ml G418 and used for subsequent experiments. The vector used for expression of the HA-tagged versions of ets-2 and ets-2 Ala-72 proteins were previously described (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J.

The BRCA1 promoter with the ets-site double-point mutation CGTAAGAGT was constructed by site-directed PCR mutagenesis as previously described (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 538-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The mutation was verified by sequencing. Transient transfections in MCF7 or SW13 cells were performed by the calcium phosphate method as described (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S. Van Beveren C. Stacey K.J. Hume D.A. Maki R.A.

For the transient assays either a Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase (MCF-7 cells) or an expression vector for Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV, Promega, SW13 cells) was included as an internal control for transfection efficiency (0.1 μg/DNA precipitate). Relative luciferase activity is equal to (raw luciferase activity)/(raw activity of the internal control × the protein concentration of the extract) (3Yang B.S. Hauser C.A. Henkel G. Colman M.S.

Fold-repression is the ratio of relative luciferase activity for theBRCA1-luciferase reporter alone (with empty expression vectors) to the activity in the presence of ets-2,Brg-1, or the combination of both ets-2 andBrg-1, as indicated in the figure legends. The SW13 cells containing the stably integrated BRCA1promoter reporter were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Brg-1 and ets-2 expression plasmids (see Fig. 7B) were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of a puromycin-resistant expression vector, pBABE-puromycin (6McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Garcia R.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). 36 h after transfection, cells were selected with 4 μg/ml puromycin and subsequently harvested 36 h after the initial selection. Luciferase activity was adjusted by cell lysate protein concentration. RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting as previously described (5Fowles L.F. Martin M.L. Nelsen L. Stacey K.J. Redd D. Clark Y.M. Nagamine Y. McMahon M. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5148-5156Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Levels of RNA expression were quantified using aAmersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. The antibodies specific for ets-2 and phosphorylated ets-2 (pT72-ets-2) have been previously described (6McCarthy S.A. Chen D. Yang B.S. Garcia R.J. Cherwinski H. Chen X.R. Klagsbrun M. Hauser C.A. Ostrowski M.C. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The anti-HA antibody was purchased from Babco, Inc.(Richmond, CA). Polyclonal anti-rabbit antibodies specific for Brg-1 and Brm-1 were gifts from Said Sif (Ohio State University), BAF57/p50 from Gerry Crabtree (Stanford University), and Ini1 from Anthony Imbalzano (University of Massachusetts). For standard immunoprecipitations, 2.5–3 × 106 cells were placed in 500 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40. For more stringent analysis, the same buffer was used except that it contained 500 mmNaCl and 0.5% deoxycholate in addition to 1% Nonidet P-40. The buffer contained a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors that was previously described (5Fowles L.F. Martin M.L. Nelsen L. Stacey K.J. Redd D. Clark Y.M. Nagamine Y. McMahon M. Hume D.A.

The pre-cleared cell lysates were incubated with specific antibody (2–4 μg) and 20 μl of a 50% slurry of protein-G beads (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed 4 times in lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant ets-2 protein corresponding to the pointed homology region (amino acids 60–167) was prepared as described (5Fowles L.F. Martin M.L. Nelsen L. Stacey K.J. Redd D. Clark Y.M. Nagamine Y.

The ets-2 column was phosphorylated in a reaction that contained 10 μl of ets-2 affinity column, 30 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol), 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (500 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 5 μl of activated recombinant MAPK p42 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Either the unphosphorylated or the phosphorylated ets-2 affinity columns were incubated with cell extracts prepared in lysis buffer as above for 16 h at 4 °C. Washing procedures and analysis were performed as for the immunoprecipitations above. For direct protein interaction assays, a portion of Brg-1 corresponding to amino acids 1108–1686 at the C-terminal of the protein (17Dunaief J.L. Strober B.E. Guha S. Khavari P.A. Alin K. Luban J.

The beads were incubated with 1 μg of the recombinant ets-2 pointed domain that was unphosphorylated, or phosphorylated by recombinant MAPK p42 in a reaction that contained 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP but no cold ATP (see above for details of the kinase reaction). Beads and ets-2 protein were incubated in lysis buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed and the material bound analyzed by Western blotting using the ets-2 specific antibody, or for 32P-labeled protein by autoradiography and phosphorimaging. Western analysis was performed as previously described (5Fowles L.F. Martin M.L. Nelsen L. Stacey K.J. Redd D. Clark Y.M. Nagamine Y. McMahon M. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell.

For estimation of ets-2 concentration, standard curves for both ets-2 antibodies were prepared using recombinant protein corresponding to the ets-2 pointed domain that was phosphorylated with MAPK p42 as described above. Recombinant ets-2 corresponding to the DNA binding domain (amino acids 334–466) was produced using the pGEX expression vector system and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (28Stacey K.J. Fowles L.F. Colman M.S. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Purified protein was used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays using standard conditions as previously described (28Stacey K.J. Fowles L.F. Colman M.S. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3430-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Double stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were (sense strand) (BRCA1 oligos correspond to −208 to −182 relative to the ATG): BRCA1 wild-type, 5′-GGTAGAATTCTTCCTCTTCCGTCTCTTGG; BRCA1 M1, 5′-GGTAGAATTCTTACTCTTCCGTCTCTTGG; BRCA1 M2, 5′-GGTAGAATTCTTCCTCTTACGTCTCTTGG; and BRCA1 M1 + M2, 5′-GGTAGAATTCTTACTCTTACGTCTCTTGG. AAmersham Biosciences PhosphorImager was used to quantify the amount of protein-DNA complex formed. Previous work demonstrated that expression of phosphorylated ets-2 correlates with a more invasive, mesenchymal phenotype in both ovarian and prostate cancer tumor cell lines (29Patton S.E.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2883-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar correlation was detected in breast cancer cell lines, we studied expression of ets-2 and est-2 target genes in MCF-7 cells, an estrogen receptor-positive non-invasive cell line, and in MDA231 cells, representative of invasive breast tumor cell lines (Fig. 1, A andB). Western analysis of these two cell lines indicated that ets-2 was expressed at ∼10-fold higher levels in MDA231 cells than in MCF-7 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the pT72 phosphorylated, activated form of ets-2 could be detected in MDA231 cells but not MCF-7 cells, as assayed using a pT72 ets-2 phospho-specific antibody (5Fowles L.F. Martin M.L.

Similar results were observed if ets-2 were first immunoprecipitated from these two cell lines using the non-phosphodiscriminating antibody, then analyzed by Western analysis using the same antibody or the pT72 ets-2 antibody (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). From these Western blots, we estimated that ∼40–50% of ets-2 was phosphorylated at position Thr-72 in MDA231 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

A constructed ResA-deficient Bacillus subtilis strain was found to lack c-type cytochromes. Cytochrome csynthesis was restored in the mutant by: (i) in transexpression of resA; (ii) deficiency in BdbD, a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase that catalyzes formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond in apocytochrome c after transfer of the polypeptide across the cytoplasmic membrane; or (iii) by addition of the reductant dithiothreitol to the growth medium. In vivo studies of ResA showed that it is membrane-associated with its thioredoxin-like domain on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Analysis of a soluble form of the protein revealed two redox reactive cysteine residues with a midpoint potential of about −340 mV at pH 7. We conclude that ResA, probably together with another thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, CcdA, is required for the reduction of the cysteinyls in the heme binding site of apocytochromec.

In vivo studies of ResA showed that it is membrane-associated with its thioredoxin-like domain on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Analysis of a soluble form of the protein revealed two redox reactive cysteine residues with a midpoint potential of about −340 mV at pH 7. We conclude that ResA, probably together with another thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, CcdA, is required for the reduction of the cysteinyls in the heme binding site of apocytochromec. isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside dithiothreitol electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid nutrient sporulation medium with phosphate N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases contain the active site motif Cys-Xxx-Yyy-Cys in which the two cysteine residues reversibly cycle between oxidized disulfide and reduced dithiol forms, and thus participate in redox reactions. Cytoplasmically located thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, such as thioredoxin, have low redox potentials and are involved in maintaining the reducing environment of the cytoplasm. The more recently discovered thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases located on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria are found to be involved in: oxidation reactions, e.g. Escherichia coli DsbA, which catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds in proteins transported across the membrane (1Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar); disulfide bond isomerization reactions, e.g. E. coli DsbC, which functions in the redistribution of disulfide bonds among the cysteine residues of target proteins (2Sone M. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10349-10352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); and reduction reactions,e.g. Bradyrhizobium japonicum TlpA, which functions in the assembly of cytochrome aa3(3Loferer H. Bott M. Hennecke H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3373-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases play a central role in the assembly ofc-type cytochromes, in which the heme group is covalently attached via (usually) two thioether bonds between the thiol side chains of cysteine residues, occurring in the conserved motif Cys-Xxx-Yyy-Cys-His, and the vinyl side chains of the heme (4Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c: Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag KG, Berlin, Germany1987Crossref Google Scholar). Bacterial c-type cytochromes are localized to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane where they function in electron transport processes. The mechanisms by which cytochromes c assemble are currently of great interest. Assembly takes place on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, involving separate transport of heme and the apocytochrome across the membrane (5Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); the latter occurs via the general protein secretory (Sec) pathway of the cell (6Thöny-Meyer L. Künzler P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Following translocation, assembly proceeds via a pathway involving a number of specific proteins. To date, two distinct systems have been identified in bacteria. System I is found in α- and γ-proteobacteria, including E. coli, Rhodobacter capsulatus,B. japonicum, and Paraccocus denitrificans(7Thöny-Meyer L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 337-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biol.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). System II seems more widespread than system I, occurring in a range of bacteria including cyanobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria such as Mycobacterium species, β-, γ-, and δ-proteobacteria such as Bordetella pertussis, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, and Helicobacter pylori, respectively, and some extremophiles such as Aquifex aeoliticus (10Le Brun N.E. Bengtsson J. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Beckett C.S. Loughman J.A. Karberg K.A. Donato G.M. Goldman W.E. Kranz R.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 465-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Common to both systems is that the apocytochrome cysteine thiols and the heme iron must be in their reduced states for thioether bond formation to occur. Thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases are required for this, and specific proteins have been identified in a number of system I organisms, including E. coli (CcmG), R. capsulatus (HelX), B. japonicum (CycY), and P. denitrificans (CcmG) (12Fabianek R.A.

Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 465-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We are studying cytochromec assembly in the system II Gram-positive bacteriumBacillus subtilis. To date three genes required for this assembly have been identified: ccdA, resB, andresC (10Le Brun N.E. Bengtsson J. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Schiött T. Throne-Holst M. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schiött T. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1962-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CcdA, ResB, and ResC are all polytopic integral membrane proteins. CcdA shows sequence similarity to a domain of E. coli DipZ (DsbD) that functions in the transfer of reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm to the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane (19Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell. 2000; 103: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the B. subtilischromosome the ccdA gene is not located close to other genes that are important for cytochrome c synthesis (20Schiött T. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). TheresBC genes reside in the resABCDE cluster in the chromosome. resD and resE encode a two-component signal transduction system (21Sun G. Sharkova E. Chestnut R. Birkey S. Duggan M.-F. Sorokin A. Pujic P. Ehrlich D. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1374-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nakano M.M. Zhu Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1938-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas resA encodes a putative thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, which has been proposed to be involved in cytochrome c assembly (9Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 10Le Brun N.E. Bengtsson J. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Previous attempts to disrupt resA were unsuccessful, leading to the conclusion that it (along with resB and resC) is an essential gene (21Sun G. Sharkova E. Chestnut R. Birkey S. Duggan M.-F. Sorokin A. Pujic P. Ehrlich D. Hulett F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1374-1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, by generating a resA knockout mutant, we demonstrate that ResA is not essential for cell viability and that it is required for cytochrome c assembly. We show that ResA is located on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane, attached to it via a single transmembrane segment and is shown to be a low potential thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. The specific role of ResA in cytochrome c assembly-associated redox processes has been investigated and is discussed. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in TableI. E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth or on LA plates (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). B. subtilisstrains were cultivated at 37 °C in LB or NSMP (24Fortnagel P. Freese E. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 1431-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or on tryptose blood agar base (Difco) plates. Strains with an insertion mutation inresA were grown in the presence of 1 mmIPTG.1 Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations when appropriate: spectinomycin, 150 mg/liter; erythromycin, 1 mg/liter; chloramphenicol, 5 mg/liter; phleomycin, 1.5 mg/liter (for B. subtilis); and ampicillin, 50–100 mg/liter; chloramphenicol, 20–25 mg/liter (for E. coli).Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this workStrains/plasmidsDescription1-aAmR, CmR, EmR, PmR, and SpR indicate resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, phleomycin, and spectinomycin, respectively.Source/Ref.B. subtilisstrains 1A1trpC2BGSC1-bBacillus Genetic Stock Center. 1A1CtrpC2, spmABΩpBsB22E-3;CmR10Le Brun N.E.

Open table in a new tab Standard molecular genetics techniques were employed (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated using Quantum miniprep (Bio-Rad) or Qiagen midiprep (Qiagen) kits, or by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Chromosomal DNA from B. subtilis was isolated according to Marmur (25Marmur J. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 208-218Crossref Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). E. coli was transformed by electroporation and B. subtilis was grown to natural competence as described by Hoch (26Hoch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 305-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). PCR was carried out using Pfu (Promega) or Taq (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) DNA polymerases, and B. subtilis 1A1 chromosomal DNA used as template. Cloning was carried out using E. coli JM109 as host. All constructs obtained by PCR were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Primers used for DNA amplification by PCR are listed in Table II. pLLE36 was constructed by amplifying an internal fragment of resA using PCR with primers LE032 and LE033. The 0.35-kb PCR product was cut withHindIII and EcoRI and cloned into pMutin2 cut with the same enzymes.Table IIPrimers used in this workNameSequence (restriction site underlined)Restriction siteLE0325′-GTGCAAGCTTTGCGCACTCGGCTATACC-3′HindIIILE0335′-CCGGAATTCCGTCATAGGCATCAAGCAC-3′EcoRILE0405′-CGGGATCCCCTGCGAGGCCTGCACAC-3′BamHILE0415′-GGGGTACCATACTCTCTTTGCCGGC-3′KpnILE0425′-GGGGTACCAGCGGAGATACGTCATAGG-3′KpnIMUT015′-CAGTAACTTCCACAGTAGTTC-3′resA25′-CTTCTCGAGTCCCGAAGTCTCTCCGGG-3′XhoIresA35′-TGAATTCCTTCATCCCGAAGTCTC-3′EcoRIresA45′-TTTAAACCTGCAGGGCCTGCACACGG-3′PstIresA55′-CACAGTCGACTTGCTTCATCCCGAAGTC-3′SalIresA85′-AAAGAGCATATGTCCGAAGGGTCCGACG-3′NdeI Open table in a new tab pRAN1 was constructed by amplifying a DNA fragment containing theresA gene and its natural promoter using PCR with primers resA4 and resA5. The 0.73-kb product was cut with PstI andSalI and ligated into pHPSK cut with the same enzymes. pRAN1Es was obtained by cloning the resA fragment of pRAN1 into pHP13Es. pLLE56 and pLLE57 were constructed by amplifying two DNA fragments, containing the natural resA promoter and a truncatedresA reading frame, using PCR with primer pairs LE040/LE041 and LE040/LE042, respectively. The PCR products were cut withBamHI and KpnI and cloned into pPHO1 digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids were cut withBamHI and HindIII and the appropriate fragments cloned into pHPKS cut with the same enzymes. pRAN11 and pRAN8 were constructed by amplifying DNA fragments using PCR with primer pairs resA8/resA3 (soluble ResA) and resA8/resA2 (His-tagged soluble ResA). The products were ligated intoSmaI-cut pUC18, generating pRAN10 and pRAN6, respectively. These were digested with NdeI and XhoI (pRAN6) orNdeI and EcoRI (pRAN10) and the resultingresA fragments ligated into pET21a(+) cut with the same enzymes. Strain LUL9 was isolated by transforming 1A1 with pLLE36, and selection on plates containing erythromycin and 1 mm IPTG. The pMutin2 insertion inresA was confirmed by PCR amplification of a DNA fragment using primers LE040 and MUT01 (which hybridize upstream ofresA and within pMutin2, respectively); and by gene linkage analysis using strain 1A1C, which carries a chloramphenicol resistance marker within the spmAB locus located just upstream ofresA in the B. subtilis chromosome. >90% of the erythromycin-resistant transformants obtained when strain 1A1C was transformed with limiting amounts of LUL9 chromosomal DNA were found to be chloramphenicol-sensitive. Isolated membranes fromB. subtilis strains were added at a final protein concentration of 40 μg/ml to a 40 μm solution of reduced Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome c in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, in a stirred 3-ml cuvette at 30 °C. Oxidation of the c-type cytochrome was followed at the wavelength pair 540 and 550 nm (27van der Oost J. von Wachenfeld C. Hederstedt L. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2063-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), using Δε550–540 = 19.5 mm−1 cm−1 to calculate activities. TMPD oxidation by colonies on NSMP plates was assayed as described by Le Brun et al. (10Le Brun N.E. Bengtsson J. Hederstedt L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 638-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or by Erlendsson and Hederstedt (28Erlendsson L.S. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) for cells grown on NSMP plates containing DTT. SDS-PAGE was carried out using the Schägger and von Jagow system (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by wet electroblotting using 20 mm Tris, 150 mmglycine, and 20% methanol. Rabbit antiserum raised against His-tagged soluble ResA or E. coli alkaline phosphatase was used as the primary antibody. Peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies were used as secondary antibodies and SuperSignal West pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for visualization of bound primary antibodies. His-tagged soluble ResA (htsResA) and soluble ResA (sResA) were purified from BL21(DE3)/pRAN8 and BL21(DE3)/pRAN11, respectively, after induction ofresA expression with 1 mm IPTG. Harvested cells were washed and resuspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and sonicated while on ice. For htsResA, the soluble fraction obtained after centrifugation was applied to, and eluted from, a HiTrap metal chelation affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified htsResA was exchanged into 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, using an ultrafiltration unit (Amicon). For sResA, the soluble fraction obtained after centrifugation was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The pellet from the 50–80% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 fraction was resuspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, desalted using a HiTrap desalting Sephadex G-25 Superfine column (Amersham Biosciences), and applied to a HiTrap Q-Sepharose HP anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.1–1 m NaCl in 10 column volumes of the same buffer. Fractions containing sResA were pooled, exchanged into 100 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and applied to a XK26/60 Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column equilibrated in the same buffer, giving pure sResA. Concentrations of htsResA and sResA were calculated using extinction coefficients, ε, at 278 nm of 18.25 and 18.15 mm−1 cm−1, respectively, determined as previously described (30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). The number of reactive thiols per protein was determined using iodoacetamide and iodoacetate, as previously described (31Creighton T.E. Nature. 1980; 284: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), except that samples were separated using PAGE according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) with 8 m urea in place of SDS. The reactivities of cysteine residues of ResA as isolated and following reduction were determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent) as previously described (33Riddles P.W. Blakely R.L. Zemer B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). For redox potential determinations, 20 μm ResA (sResA or htsResA) in deoxygenated 100 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was incubated with 5 mm oxidized or reduced DTT for 3 h at 4 °C to generate the fully oxidized or reduced species, respectively. Treatment with diamide was also used to generate the fully oxidized form (14Monika E.M. Goldman B.S. Beckman D.L. Kranz R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). DTT or diamide was removed using a HiTrap desalting Sephadex G-25 Superfine column, and ResA was diluted to a final concentration of 1 μm. Varying ratios of oxidized and reduced DTT, at a total concentration of 2 or 5 mm, were added to generate different potentials and the reaction was allowed to equilibrate for 3 h at 25 °C. The redox state of ResA was followed by measuring fluorescence emission intensity at 350 nm, following excitation at 280 nm, using a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorimeter with excitation and emission slit widths set to 10 nm. Measurements indicated that equilibrium was achieved within 1 h. Similar results were obtained at different total DTT concentrations; when starting with fully oxidized or fully reduced ResA protein; and, when using de-oxygenated buffers in an anaerobic glove box in which oxygen was <2 ppm (Faircrest Engineering). Fluorescence intensities at ratios of 399:1 and 1:399 oxidized to reduced DTT were taken to represent 100% oxidized and reduced ResA, respectively. The data were fitted using the following equation, which is derived from the Nernst expressions for the two redox couples at equilibrium,r=exp((Em−Eh)nF/RT)1+exp((Em−Eh)nF/RT)Equation 1 where r is the fraction of protein in the reduced form, Eh is the potential of the DTT couple,Em is the midpoint redox potential of ResA.n, the number of electrons involved in the reaction, was set to 2, the expected value for a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase. Settingn = 1 gave very poor fits. All Ehcalculations were based on the value of −330 mV for the standard redox potential (Em) of DTT at pH 7.0 (34Hutchinson R.S. Ort D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Em values for DTT at other pH values were calculated using a correction of −59 mV per pH unit increase. Molecular weights/association states of sResA and htsResA were determined using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). sResA or htsResA (3 mg/ml) were applied to the column equilibrated with 100 mmsodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and eluted in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1. Molecular weights were determined by reference to a calibration curve prepared using bovine lung aprotinin (6,500), horse heart cytochrome c (12,400), bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase (29,000), bovine serum albumin (66,000), and blue dextran (∼2,000,000). Sporulation efficiency assays were performed as described previously (28Erlendsson L.S. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of cytochromes using 5-[4-14C]aminolevulinic acid (51 mCi mmol−1) was performed as described by Schiött et al. (18Schiött T. von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1962-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were isolated from bacteria grown in NSMP at 37 °C as described previously (35Hederstedt L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Membrane protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.), with bovine serum albumin as standard. N-terminal sequencing was carried out by Edman degradation (Biomolecular Analysis Facility, University of Leeds, UK) on proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and stained with 0.005% (w/v) sulforhodamine B in 30% (w/v) methanol, 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid. Blots were dried and stored at −20 °C. EI-MS was performed using a VG platform electrospray mass spectrometer. For this, ∼20 pmol of protein was prepared in 20 μl of 1:1:0.005, acetonitrile:water:formic acid. Horse heart myoglobin (16951.48 Da) was used as a calibrant. Alkaline phosphatase activities of cell lysates of E. coliwere measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (36von Wachenfeldt C. Hederstedt L.

To investigate the function of ResA inB. subtilis, a derivative of pMutin2 was constructed (pLLE36), containing bp 55–409 of resA (537 bp). A Campbell-type integration of the entire plasmid into the chromosome resulted in strain LUL9 (Table I), in which resA was disrupted. pMutin2 contains an IPTG-inducible spac promoter that, following integration, can drive the expression of genes located downstream of the insertion (37Vagner V. Dervyn E. Ehrlich S.D. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 3097-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Growth of the resAknockout mutant LUL9 was similar to the parental strain 1A1 in the presence of 1 mm IPTG. However, in the absence of IPTG it grew poorly. This indicates that the pMutin2 insertion intoresA has a polar effect on resBC and/orresDE expression. In subsequent experiments involving strain LUL9 the cells were grown in the presence of 1 mm IPTG. The properties of LUL9 show that the resA gene is not essential for viability of the cell. Colonies of LUL9 on NSMP plates did not oxidize TMPD, indicating a deficiency in cytochrome caa3activity. This was confirmed by analysis of membranes isolated from LUL9 cells grown in NSMP medium, which showed <0.1% activity of wild-type membranes. Plasmid pRAN1Es, containing the resAgene with its natural promoter, in LUL9 complemented the defect in TMPD-oxidation activity. Under denaturing conditions cytochromes lose their heme unless it is covalently bound to the polypeptide. In a wild-type B. subtilis strain, grown in the presence of [14C]aminolevulinic acid (a precursor to heme), the four membrane-bound cytochromes c and QcrB are observed as radioactive bands by SDS-PAGE. QcrB is the b subunit of the cytochrome bc complex and one of its two hemes is probably covalently bound to a cysteine residue in the polypeptide (38Yu J. Le Brun N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8860-8866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows that strain LUL9 lacks all fourc-type cytochromes but contains QcrB. The cytochromec content in LUL9 was restored when resA was expressed in trans from pRAN1Es. These results combined show that ResA is required for cytochrome c synthesis. The tested properties of LUL9 were found to be very similar to those of mutants defective in CcdA, e.g. those of strain LU60A1 (Fig.1). Strain LUL14, defective in both ccdA andresA, showed the same TMPD-oxidation phenotype as LUL9. B. subtilisBdbD and BdbC are thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that catalyze formation of disulfide bonds in proteins on the outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane (28Erlendsson L.S. Hederstedt L. J.

Strain LUL15, deficient in both ResA and BdbD, was found to be TMPD-oxidation positive. The same result was obtained when strain LUL9 was grown on plates in the presence of the reducing thiol reagent DTT (15 mm). Addition of DTT to the medium did not restore TMPD oxidation in strains deficient in ResB and ResC (28Erlendsson L.S. Hederstedt L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1423-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our in vivo findings indicate that ResA is a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase involved in disulfide reduction during biosynthesis of c-type cytochromes. Some proteins in the B. subtilis spore coat are rich in cysteine residues and are heavily cross-linked by disulfide bonds in the final spore (40Aronson A.I. Fitz-James"
https://openalex.org/W2097655931,"The nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1) is involved in the synthesis of the mRNA poly(A) tails in most eukaryotes. We report that the protein contains two RNA binding domains, a ribonucleoprotein-type RNA binding domain (RNP domain) located approximately in the middle of the protein sequence and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain also promotes self-association of PABPN1 and moderately cooperative binding to RNA. Whereas the isolated RNP domain binds specifically to poly(A), the isolated C-terminal domain binds non-specifically to RNA and other polyanions. Despite this nonspecific RNA binding by the C-terminal domain, selection experiments show that adenosine residues throughout the entire minimal binding site of ∼11 nucleotides are recognized specifically. UV-induced cross-links with oligo(A) carrying photoactivatable nucleotides at different positions all map to the RNP domain, suggesting that most or all of the base-specific contacts are made by the RNP domain, whereas the C-terminal domain may contribute nonspecific contacts, conceivably to the same nucleotides. Asymmetric dimethylation of 13 arginine residues in the C-terminal domain has no detectable influence on the interaction of the protein with RNA.

These proteins not only protect the RNA from nucleases and undesirable interactions of its highly charged surface but influence enzymes and other proteins that act upon the RNA at all stages of its maturation, function, and decay (1Varani G. Nagai L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Characteristically, a single RNA-binding protein very often contains more than one RNA binding domain. Different kinds of RNA binding domains have been described (2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Among them, the RNA recognition motif or RNP1-type RNA binding domain is probably the best understood (1Varani G. Nagai L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 3Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Avis J. Evans P. Trends Biochem.

The RNP domain consists of ∼90 amino acids forming a औαऔऔαऔ fold, in which a four-stranded औ-sheet is backed by two α-helices. The two central antiparallel औ-strands carry the highly conserved amino acids of the RNP1 and RNP2 motifs. Different members of the RNP protein family can bind structured or extended RNA molecules in a sequence-specific manner. As seen in several co-crystals, the RNA is bound on the surface of the औ-sheet by hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions between bases and amino acid side chains (5Oubridge C. Ito N. Evans P.R.

Cell. 1999; 98: 835-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Another common RNA binding domain is the so-called RGG domain, characterized by multiple copies of the amino acid sequence arginine-glycine-glycine, interspersed with phenylalanine and tyrosine residues (9Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The structure of the domain is not known, although a spiral of औ-turns has been proposed based on spectroscopic data (10Ghisolfi L. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2955-2959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possibly related arginine-rich domain found at the C termini of several of the spliceosomal Sm core proteins was not ordered in a crystal structure in the absence of RNA (11Kambach C. Walke S. Young R. Avis J.M. de la Fortelle E. Raker V.A. Lührmann R. Li J. Nagai K. Cell. 1999; 96: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The RGG domain usually occurs in proteins in conjunction with one or more other RNA binding domains, e.g. of the RNP or K homology type (2Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar) and is often considered unable to discriminate between different RNA sequences. Instead, it is thought to increase the RNA binding affinity of a protein in a nonspecific manner, the specificity being determined by the other RNA binding domain(s) (12Ghisolfi L. Kharrat A. Joseph G. Amalric F. Erard M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 13Bagni C. Lapeyre B. J. Biol.

RNA. 1999; 5: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, sequence- or structure-specific binding by means of an RGG domain has been proposed for several proteins (9Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 15Vanhamme L. Perez-Morga D. Marchal C. Speijer D. Lambert L. Geusken M. Alexandre S. Ismaili N. Göringer H.U.

Cell. 2001; 107: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of the RGG domain is the asymmetric dimethylation of the arginine side chains within RGG sequences (18Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A possible modulation of RNA binding by arginine methylation has frequently been discussed, but binding of the yeast protein Hrp1p to a specific RNA sequence was not affected by arginine methylation (19Valentini S.R. Weiss V.H. Silver P.A. RNA. 1999; 5: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The affinity of a synthetic RGG domain peptide for nonspecific RNA was also independent of arginine methylation, although CD spectroscopy suggested that the methylated peptide had a different structural effect on the RNA compared with the unmethylated peptide (20Raman B. Guarnaccia C. Nadassy K. Zakhariev S. Pintar A. Zanuttin F. Frigyes D. Acatrinei C. Vindigni A. Pongor G. Pongor S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3377-3384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several RGG domains are involved in protein-protein interactions; RGG domain-dependent self-association of the hnRNP A1 protein leads to moderate cooperativity of RNA binding (21Cobianchi F. Karpel R.L. Williams K.R. Notario V. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Casas-Finet J.R. Smith J.D. Kumar A. Kim J.G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 873-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), but the same domain can also interact with other proteins (23Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Similarly, RGG domains of other proteins serve in protein-protein interactions (24Bouvet P.

Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 2In the designation of poly(A)-binding proteins, we follow the recommendations of the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/).

Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 807-825Google Scholar). PABPC contains four copies of the RNP domain, the first and second being mainly responsible for specific binding to poly(A) (30Burd C.G. Matunis E.L. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Kühn U. Pieler T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 32Deardorff J.A. Sachs A.B. J.

In a co-crystal of these two domains with oligoadenylate, A11, the औ-sheet surfaces of the two RNP domains form an almost continuous platform that binds an extended conformation of the oligonucleotide. The 3′-half of the oligonucleotide is associated with the N-terminal RNP domain (8Deo R.C. Bonanno J.B. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K.

Cell. 1991; 66: 759-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar,35Bienroth S. Keller W. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 36Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, the protein may be involved in mRNA export into the cytoplasm (37Chen Z. Li Y. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2273-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 38Calado A. Kutay U. Kühn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. RNA. 2000; 6: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although PABPN1 is conserved in most organisms, it does not appear to exist in S. cerevisiae, as its closest homolog in yeast is a cytoplasmic protein (Rbp29p) possibly involved in translation (39Winstall E. Sadowski M. Kühn U. Wahle E. Sachs A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21817-21826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In vitro, PABPN1 binds with high affinity and specificity to poly(A) and, almost equally well, to poly(G) (33Wahle E.

In vivo data are consistent with its binding to poly(A) tails in nuclear RNA and support a role in mRNA polyadenylation (37Chen Z. Li Y. Krug R.M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6082-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In binding to long poly(A), PABPN1 can form spherical particles of a defined size that accommodate ∼250 nucleotides (45Keller R.W. Kühn U. Aragon M. Bornikova L. Wahle E. Bear D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These particles appear to be in equilibrium with filamentous complexes. The structure of PABPN1 is also of interest as short expansions of an oligoalanine tract at the N terminus of the protein lead to the human genetic disease oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, which is characterized by the formation of insoluble PABPN1 aggregates in the nuclei of muscle cells (43Calado A.

Genet. 1998; 18: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Upon sequence inspection, an RNP-type RNA binding domain is evident approximately in the middle of the PABPN1 amino acid sequence. Although the C-terminal domain of the protein contains no RGG sequences, it is arginine-rich, and all of its 13 arginines are asymmetrically dimethylated (47Smith J.J. Rücknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Tang J. Nemeth A. Linder M. Herschman H.R. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13229-13234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The contributions of different domains of the protein to RNA binding have not been investigated so far. In this paper we present evidence that both the RNP domain and the C-terminal arginine-rich domain of PABPN1 contribute to RNA binding. The N-terminal domain is essential for the stimulation of poly(A) polymerase. Sequences of DNA oligonucleotides used in the following procedures are available upon request. All constructs were verified by DNA cycle sequencing with a Prism 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The bovine PABPN1 coding sequence (GenBankTMaccession number X89969) (34Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jenö P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) inserted into the NdeI andBamHI sites of pGM10 (48Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) was initially used for the production of His6-tagged PABPN1 and variants inEscherichia coli. Later, a modified pET19b expression vector (Novagen) was used, in which the NcoI/NdeI fragment encoding the tag was replaced by the corresponding fragment from pGM10 encoding the peptide MAH6. The resulting vector, which resulted in higher levels of recombinant proteins compared with pGM10, will be referred to as pUK. Gel-purified PABPN1 cDNA fragments were cloned into pUK according to standard procedures. For silent mutagenesis of the PABPN1 coding sequence with the aim of reducing the GC content, 18 overlapping and phosphorylated oligonucleotides spanning the first 360 bp were synthesized by TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany. The oligonucleotides were designed such that the desired ligation product contained overhangingNdeI/XhoI ends. A mixture of all oligonucleotides (20 nm each in 100 ॖl of ligation buffer without ATP) were melted at 95 °C for 5 min. Annealing took place by slow cooling of the reaction mix to room temperature in a water bath. After addition of 1 mm ATP and 800 units of T4 DNA ligase, aliquots of this mixture were incubated at six different temperatures between 12 and 40 °C for 15 min to 16 h, the incubation time depending on the temperature. After DNA recovery by ethanol precipitation, one-half of each ligation reaction was used for ligation into theNdeI/XhoI-opened and dephosphorylated pGM-PABPN1 plasmid in 20-ॖl standard reactions. The presence of an additional RsaI restriction site in the synthetic gene fragment allowed for the initial identification of clones in which the synthetic sequence had replaced the beginning of the authentic open reading frame. One such clone was then confirmed by DNA sequencing. After subcloning of the synthetic open reading frame into pUK, the resulting plasmid pUK-synPABPN1 was used for the generation of C-terminal deletion constructs, as well as for fusion protein constructs. Deletions mutants of PABPN1 were generated by PCR using PwoDNA polymerase (Hybaid AGS, Heidelberg, Germany) and primers introducing a new start codon as part of an NdeI site or a stop codon followed by a new BamHI site, respectively. Phosphorylated and purified PCR fragments were subcloned intoSmaI-cut pGEM3z (Promega). After double digestion withNdeI or XhoI combined with BamHI, the shortened fragments of the PABPN1 coding region were cloned into the pUK vector or the pUK-synPABPN1 construct opened at the same restriction sites. For GST pull down experiments, theXhoI/BamHI fragments coding for C-terminal truncations were subcloned into the pUK-PABPN1-ΔN113 construct opened at the same sites. The clone expressing the RNP domain of PABPN1 encodes the amino acids 161–257, and the C terminus consists of amino acids 258–306. Single amino acid substitutions were made with the use of a PCR-based method (49Picard V. Ersdal-Bardju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Positive clones were identified with the help of newly created restriction sites and verified by DNA sequencing. For the generation of GST and protein A fusion proteins, the sequences encoding the respective tags were PCR-amplified with Pwo DNA polymerase and primer pairs containing additional 5′-NdeI sites. The plasmid pGEX5 × 1, bp 258–945 (Amersham Biosciences) was used as a template for the GST gene, and the plasmid pBS1761, bp 785–1225 (50Puig O. Caspary F. Rigault G. Rutz B. Bouveret E.

PCR products were inserted into the NdeI site of pUK-synPABPN1. Protein concentrations were determined with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and/or by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining and gel imaging with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Calf thymus PABPN1 was isolated as described (40Wahle E. Lustig A. Jenö P. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2937-2945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The untagged wild-type PABPN1 used in the experiment of Fig. 9 and related assays was produced in E. coli from the authentic cDNA sequence cloned into pT7–7 (34Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jenö P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and purified essentially as described (34Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jenö P.

For expression of His-tagged PABPN1 variants, pUK or pGM10 constructs were transformed into electrocompetent BL21 (DE3) pUBS520. The plasmid pUBS520 facilitates the translation of genes containing rare arginine codons by co-expression of the corresponding tRNAArg (51Brinkmann U. Mattes R.E. Buckel P. Gene. 1989; 85: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Growth conditions, further treatment of cells, and protein purification were according to Benoit et al. (52Benoit B. Nemeth A.

Proteins were eluted with 5 ml of buffer containing 500 mmimidazole and further purified on a 1-ml MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove nucleic acids. The variant PABPN1-ΔN160 was additionally loaded onto a Superdex-200 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column to separate monomeric protein from aggregates. The His-tagged C terminus of PABPN1 was insoluble under the conditions described above. Therefore, Ni-NTA purification was performed in the presence of 8 m urea following the protocol supplied by Qiagen. Elution was done with 2 ml of buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, 8 murea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, adjusted to pH 8.0. The protein concentration of the His-tagged C terminus was measured photometrically (1 A280 = 530 ॖg/ml). Bovine poly(A) polymerase was a kind gift of Georges Martin (Biozentrum, Basel, Switzerland). DNA modifying enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Homopolymers were from Sigma, and E. coliribosomal RNA was from Roche Diagnostics. Chemically synthesized RNA oligonucleotides were from IBA (Göttingen, Germany). Size-fractionated homopolymers were prepared by gel purification (45Keller R.W. Kühn U. Aragon M. Bornikova L. Wahle E. Bear D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or by ion exchange chromatography (40Wahle E. Lustig A. Jenö P. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2937-2945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA concentrations were determined as described (36Wahle E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 2937-2945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-Labeling of RNA was performed using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standard procedures (53Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Incorporated radioactivity and RNA yields were measured using DE81 filter binding (54Stayton M. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13205-13212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Filter binding assays were carried out essentially as described (40Wahle E. Lustig A. Jenö P. Maurer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2937-2945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of the binding constants, 112 fmol (as mononucleotides) of radioactively labeled RNA was incubated with increasing amounts of PABPN1 variants in 40 ॖl of RNA binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 107 glycerol, 0.2 mg/ml methylated bovine serum albumin, 0.017 Nonidet P-50, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl). After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 35 ॖl of each reaction were applied to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) pre-treated with 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) containing 5 ॖg/ml rRNA. After rinsing with 5 ml of ice-cold wash buffer, the filter-bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Apparent KD or K50 values were determined both from direct and double-reciprocal plots. For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 5′-labeled gel-purified RNA was incubated with increasing amounts of PABPN1 variants in 20 ॖl of RNA binding buffer (see above). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 15-ॖl aliquots of the reactions were loaded onto a native agarose/polyacrylamide composite gel (55Rüegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). C-spiked A12 was made by IBA (Göttingen) using 957 A- and 57 C-precursors for each step of synthesis. As the adenosine at the 3′-end was covalently coupled to the support during synthesis, there was no C substitution at this position. Gel-purified C-spiked A12and homogeneous A12 used as a control were 5′-labeled, and about 2.5 nm labeled oligonucleotides (as 5′-ends) were incubated at ambient temperature for 15 min in 100 ॖl of RNA binding buffer containing different concentrations of calf thymus PABPN1. The reaction mixtures were applied to a pre-treated nitrocellulose filter and washed once with 2 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (see above). Each filter was then treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 20 ॖg of proteinase K (Merck) in 300 ॖl of elution buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 17 SDS, and 2 ॖg of rRNA. The eluted RNA was precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol and digested for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 ng of RNase A in 10 ॖl of 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The recovered radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting of 1-ॖl aliquots. Equal amounts of radioactivity were analyzed on a 207 polyacrylamide gel (40-cm-long) containing 8.3 m urea. Autoradiography and quantification of RNA fragments was done with the help of a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Digestion of the C-spiked A12 was complete, and unsubstituted A12 was found to be resistant to RNase A under the conditions used. Desalted 5-iodo-UMP-modified oligonucleotides (A2-5iU-A10 and A10-5iU-A2) were purchased from IBA (Göttingen) and used without additional purification for 5′-labeling with minimal exposure to light. Binding reactions were done in 100 ॖl of RNA binding buffer (see above) that contained 2 nm (as 5′-ends) of either of the two modified oligonucleotides in the presence of either 50 nm His-tagged wild-type PABPN1 or 500 nm of the deletion variants, respectively. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, each binding reaction was evenly distributed to five wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The plate was placed on top of an ice-cooled aluminum block at a distance of 4–4.5 cm to an inverted UV table (Fluolink; Renner GmbH). After 30 min of irradiation at 312 nm, the aliquots from each binding reaction were recombined, and 20 ॖl of each irradiated RNA/protein mix were digested with 200 ng of protease Lys-C (sequencing grade; Roche Diagnostic) at ambient temperature. Aliquots were taken as indicated and an"

HDL-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway can be mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) and/or pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. Although HDL-induced activation of MAPK involves Raf-1, Mek, and Erk1/2, the upstream contribution of p21ras (Ras) on the activation of Raf-1 and MAPK remains elusive. Here we examine the effect of HDL on Ras activity and demonstrate that HDL induces PKC-independent activation of Ras that is completely blocked by pertussis toxin, thus implicating heterotrimeric G-proteins. In addition, the HDL-induced activation of Ras is inhibited by a neutralizing antibody against scavenger receptor type BI.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 187-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This concept of HDL receptor-mediated signaling was recently supported by the identification of a PDZ-containing adaptor protein (3Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of the intensively studied HDL receptor scavenger receptor type BI (SR-BI). More importantly the SR-BI-dependent and HDL-mediated activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase has been demonstrated (4Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N. Nikolova-Karakashian M.

Several laboratories have examined the plethora of signaling responses generated by the interaction of HDL with cells. The diversity of HDL-mediated cellular responses can in part be explained by the heterogeneity in the content of the particles (lipids, apolipoproteins, and enzymes) as well as by the different HDL receptors possibly involved. HDL triggers a variety of intracellular signaling events, including activation of phosphatidylinositol- and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipases C and D (PI-PLC, PC-PLC, and PC-PLD), protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), tyrosine kinase, and heterotrimeric G-proteins (6Nofer J.R.

Both lipid and protein components of HDL have been implicated in the activation of different classes of cellular phospholipases and the mobilization of intracellular calcium but also in the stimulation of mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells. In respect to the HDL-induced activation of the MAPK pathway it was demonstrated that G-protein-dependent signaling proceeds phosphorylation of Raf-1 and Mek-1 (8Deeg M.A. Bowen R.F. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U.

Indeed it was recently shown that sphingosylphosphorylcholine and lysosulfatide in HDL3particles interact with receptors of the endothelial differentiation gene family. This leads to dual activation of signaling through heterotrimeric Gi-proteins that in turn activates PI-PLC. This G-protein-dependent activation of PI-PLC is inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX). Activation of PI-PLC results in the immediate production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol with the subsequent activation of PKC. It is believed that PKC plays a pivotal role regulating the signaling cascade for the HDL-induced phosphorylation of the Raf-1/Mek/MAPK pathway (8Deeg M.A. Bowen R.F. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Frank P.F. Galbiati F. Volonte D. Razani B. Cohen D.E. Marcel Y.L. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1204-C1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a number of observations have demonstrated that HDL-induced activation of the MAPK pathway does not completely depend on PKC signaling. First, in fibroblasts down-regulation or inhibition of PKC only partially (40–507) blocks HDL-induced MAPK activation (8Deeg M.A. Bowen R.F. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Second, in smooth muscle cells HDL-mediated activation of MAPK requires a PKC-independent but PTX-sensitive pathway, indicating the involvement of G-proteins (9Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Walter M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the potential contribution of p21ras (Ras), which is one of the best studied activators of the Raf-1/MAPK pathway, remains unclear, and to date there is no evidence that the interaction of HDL with cell surface receptors increases Ras activity leading to MAPK phosphorylation. Nutrient mixture Ham's F-12, glutathione, TPA, and PDGF were from Sigma (Madrid, Spain). Pertussis toxin was from List Biological Laboratories Inc. Fetal calf serum was purchased from Biological Industries. Peroxidase-labeled antibodies and SDS-PAGE molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. Monoclonal anti-pan-Ras was purchased from Oncogene Sciences. Polyclonal anti-P-Mek and anti-MAPK (P-MAPK) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies against phospho-MARCKS were from Cell Signaling, and PKCα and c-Raf-1 were from BD Biosciences. Rabbit antiserum against the extracellular domain of mSR-BI (KKB-1) was kindly provided by Karen Kosarzky (14Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 ॖg/ml) at 37 °C in 57 CO2. For the measurement of Ras, Raf, and MAPK activity (see below) cells were preincubated overnight in the presence or absence of TPA (500 nm), PTX (0.1 ॖg/ml), or both. High density lipoproteins (HDL3, density 1.125–1.21 g/ml) were isolated from the plasma of normolipidemic volunteers by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously (12Webb L.J. Hirst S.J. Giembycz M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1433-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 13Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). After preparation HDL was stored in KBr at 4 °C and dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline before use. ApoA-I was isolated from HDL preparations as described previously (12Webb L.J. Hirst S.J. Giembycz M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1433-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The capacity of Ras-GTP to bind to RBD (Ras-binding domain of Raf-1) was used to analyze the amount of active Ras (15de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were incubated for 3 min with HDL (40 ॖg/ml), purified apoA-I (15 ॖg/ml), PDGF (10 ng/ml), or TPA (500 nm). In some experiments binding of HDL to SR-BI was inhibited by preincubation of cells with anti-SR-BI as described previously (14Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 17 (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 107 (v/v) glycerol, 0.57 (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g the protein concentration of the cleared cell lysate was determined (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar). Then cellular proteins (600 ॖg) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads precoupled with GST-RBD. Beads were washed four times in lysis buffer, and bound proteins were solubilized with Laemmli loading buffer and electrophoresed on 12.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred and immunoblotted using the anti-pan-Ras antibody. To measure Raf-1 activity, kinase assays following immunoprecipitation were performed essentially as described previously (18Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106) were harvested on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 17 (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitors and cleared as described above. Supernatants (equalized for protein concentration) were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 ॖg of anti-Raf precoupled with 20 ॖl of protein G-Sepharose (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in buffer A (30 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.37 औ-mercaptoethanol, 107 glycerol, 0.17 (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4) with decreasing amounts of NaCl (1 m, 0.1 m, and salt-free) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 20 ॖl of Mek buffer (salt-free buffer A plus 10 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm ATP, 6.5 ॖg/ml GST-Mek, and 100 ॖg/ml GST-Erk2). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 ॖl of ice-cold stop buffer (salt- and glycerol-free buffer A containing 6 mmEDTA). Following centrifugation, 6 ॖl of the supernatant was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 24 ॖl of MBP buffer (salt- and glycerol-free buffer A containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 2.5 ॖl [32P]ATP, 0.5 ॖg/ॖl myelin basic protein, and 0.16 ॖg/ॖl bovine serum albumin), and then aliquots of 24 ॖl were loaded onto P81 sheets, washed three times (20 min each) in 75 mm orthophosphoric acid, and counted. To identify a possible role of Ras in HDL signaling we analyzed the HDL-induced activation of the MAPK pathway in CHO cells. Ras activity was measured by GST-RBD pull-down experiments with cell lysates from CHO cells incubated from 3 to 20 min with HDL3(40 ॖg/ml). Similar to the PDGF-induced activation of Ras (data not shown), incubation with HDL3 resulted in a strong induction of Ras activity in CHO cells. Production of Ras-GTP peaked after 3 min of exposure to HDL and returned to basal levels at later time points (Fig. 1a). Kinetics of growth factor- and TPA-induced Ras-GTP production are characterized by a peak of Ras activity immediately after addition of activating agents (19Marais R. Light Y. Mason C. Paterson H. Olson M.F. Marshall C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that HDL-induced activation of Ras follows kinetics similar to those for receptor tyrosine kinase (epidermal growth factor receptor)- or PKC (TPA)-mediated stimulation of Ras in CHO cells (20Pons M. Tebar F. Kirchhoff M. Peiro S. de Diego I. Grewal T. Enrich C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similar to results described in vascular smooth muscle cells (9Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Walter M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), incubation of CHO cells with HDL resulted in the downstream activation of the Raf-1/MAPK pathway as shown by the immediate increase (70 ± 107) of Raf-1 activity after 3 min of HDL exposure (Fig. 1b) and the HDL-induced phosphorylation of Mek and Erk1/2 (Fig. 1, c andd). To determine whether the major apolipoprotein of HDL3, apoA-I, is responsible for Ras activation, we compared HDL3and purified lipid-free apoA-I (21Rinninger F. Brundert M. Jäckle S. Galle P.R. Busch C. Izbicki J.R. Rogiers X. Henne-Bruns D. Kremer B. Broelsch C.E. Greten H. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 1100-1114PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the immediate increase of Ras-GTP levels in HDL3-incubated cells, addition of purified apoA-I to the culture medium had no effect on Ras-GTP or the P-Mek levels as compared with the control at any time point analyzed (Fig. 1, a and c). These findings indicate that lipid-free apoA-I does not activate Ras-GTP production. Since HDL-induced activation of PKC could be responsible not only for the downstream induction of the Raf-1/Mek/MAPK pathway but also the activation of Ras, we studied the involvement of PKC in the activation of Ras after HDL stimulation. Cells were preincubated overnight in the presence or absence of TPA, a potent PKC inhibitor (8Deeg M.A. Bowen R.F. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Webb L.J. Hirst S.J. Giembycz M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1433-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PKC was confirmed by Western blot analysis of PKC (Fig.2) and reduced phosphorylation of a PKC substate, P-MARCKS (22Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) (data not shown). HDL-induced production of Ras-GTP was clearly detectable even after down-regulation of PKC, indicating that HDL-induced activation of Ras in CHO cells occurs mainly via a PKC-independent pathway (Fig. 2). Nofer and co-workers (9Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Walter M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently reported that HDL-induced activation of the MAPK pathway involves PTX-sensitive G-proteins. To test the possible involvement of G-proteins in HDL-mediated activation of Ras and Erk1/2, RBD assays were performed with lysates from PTX-preincubated CHO cells. Strong inhibition of HDL-induced activation of Ras-GTP production and the MAPK pathway as shown by the reduced phosphorylation of Mek and Erk1/2 proteins was observed upon pretreatment with PTX (Fig. 3). Taken together these findings indicate that HDL-mediated activation of Ras requires G-protein-mediated signaling in CHO cells. SR-BI, which binds HDL particles with higher affinity than lipid-free apoA-I (23Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol.

Second and similar to the results described above, Yuhanna et al. (5Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W.

In addition, in CHO cells the incubation of HDL (50 ॖg/ml) does not lead to changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels in agreement with Smart and co-workers (4Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N.

Thus to identify a possible role for SR-BI in HDL-mediated Ras activation, CHO cells were preincubated with an antibody against the extracellular domain of SR-BI that inhibits HDL binding to SR-BI (14Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with HDL3, and lysates were prepared to determine Ras-GTP levels in RBD assays (Fig.4). In these experiments we observed a strong reduction of HDL-induced activation of Ras and reduced amounts of phosphorylated Erk1/2 in CHO cells preincubated with the inhibitory SR-BI antibody (Fig. 4a). These findings suggest that interaction of HDL and SR-BI plays a crucial role in the activation of Ras in CHO cells. It was previously shown that, in vascular smooth muscle cells treated with HDL, the inhibition of PKC did not interfere with the Raf-1 or the MAPK activity (9Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Walter M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown in fibroblasts that PKC may contribute in some extent in the HDL-mediated stimulation of MAPK (8Deeg M.A. Bowen R.F. Oram J.F. Bierman E.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1667-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The demonstration in the present study that HDL activates Ras and the complexity and cross-talk of signal transmission prompted us to determine the possible involvement of PKC in the overall stimulation of Ras. Here we clearly demonstrate that when PKC was completely depleted, by the action of TPA, no changes in the amount of Ras-GTP (Ras activity) (Fig. 2) or in the P-Erk1/2 could be observed (Fig. 4b). Therefore, as a major step in this direction, we report here for the first time that HDL activates Ras through SR-BI in a PKC-independent manner. To understand the HDL-mediated activation of the MAPK pathway, it is essential to identify the key signal-transducing proteins at the cell surface and/or the endosomal compartment that are activated by the interaction of HDL with receptors. Mapping the specific location where HDL-mediated activation of downstream molecules occurs will have important implications in the understanding of the development of cardiovascular disease.

DAPDC is a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme that stereospecifically converts meso-DAP to l-lysine (Scheme FS1). Like most enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation reactions, the conversion of DAP to lysine is not reversible. The enzyme is of interest because of its importance in bacterial growth and survival. Lysine is required in protein biosynthesis and is essential for bacterial viability and development. The lysine precursor DAP itself is used as a structural cross-linking component of the peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative, Gram-positive (except Gram-positivecocci), and mycobacterial cell walls (1Cummins C.S. Harris H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1996; 14: 583-600Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). DAP cross-links provide stability to the cell wall and confer resistance to intracellular osmotic pressure (2Strominger J.L. Fed. Proc. 1962; 21: 134-143PubMed Google Scholar). DAP can be synthesized by one or more of the following three different pathways: (i) the succinylase pathway, identified in all Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as Myobacterium tuberculosis; (ii) the dehydrogenase pathway, utilized by Bacillus sphaericus, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and Brevibacterium species (3Misono H. Nagasaki S. Soda K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1986; 50: 1455-1460Google Scholar); and (iii) the acetylase pathway, which is limited to certain Bacillusspecies (4Sundharadas G. Gilvarg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3983-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Higher plants also produce lysine using a succinylase pathway (5Chatterjee S.P. Singh B.K. Gilvarg C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple biosynthetic pathways, at least in some bacteria, is probably an indication of the importance of DAP and lysine to bacterial survival. As the substrate and the reaction are not found in mammals, inhibitors of the enzyme may ultimately become leads for therapeutic intervention in bacterial infections (6McCann P.P. Pegg A.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 54: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).In Escherichia coli, the lysA gene is transcriptionally controlled by the LysR regulator protein; in the presence of lysine, transcription of the lysA gene is repressed (7Stagier P. Brone F. Richard F. Richard C. Patte J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 1198-1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, M. tuberculosis does not apparently have a comparable LysR regulator, based on the lack of homologous sequences in the M. tuberculosis genomic sequence (8Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J.

However, in the presence of the major AP endonuclease Ape1, AP sites resulting from the removal of 8-oxoG residues by Ogg1 are primarily processed by Ape1, which catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester bond immediately 5′ to the AP site, generating a 5′-terminal sugar phosphate (5′-dRP) (20Vidal A.E. Hickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Mitra S. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Hazra T.K. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2001; 38: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Afterward, the 5′-dRP is removed by a dRPase activity associated with DNA polymerase β (Polβ), which simultaneously adds one nucleotide. The nick is finally sealed by DNA ligase III, which is associated with the x-ray cross-complementing factor 1 (Xrcc1) (22Caldecott K.W. Tucker J.D. Stanker L.H. Thompson L.H.

The entire process results in the removal of 8-oxoG and its replacement with a guanine and constitutes the short patch base excision repair (SP-BER) pathway. In repair proficient cells, SP-BER is thought to be the major repair pathway for 8-oxoG (25Dogliotti E. Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). Another form of BER, the long patch BER (LP-BER), results in the removal of the DNA damage and the replacement of 2–10 nucleotides extending 3′ to the lesion (26Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the course of LP-BER, the early steps of 8-oxoG repair are performed by Ogg1 and Ape1 as described for SP-BER. Then, a DNA polymerase (Polβ, δ or ε) adds few nucleotides and displaces the 5′-dRP residue, generating a 5′-flap structure with a 5′-dRP end. The 5′-flap is removed by the Flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1), and a DNA ligase seals the nick. The role of different DNA polymerases in LP-BER in the wild type cellular context is unclear. Recently, DNA polymerase δ- or ε-dependent LP-BERs have been reconstituted with purified human proteins (32Pascucci B. Stucki M. Jonsson Z.O. Dogliotti E. Hubscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33696-33702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For efficient repair of a regular AP site, in addition to Ape 1 and DNA polymerase δ the reaction assay required replication factor C (RF-C), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Fen1, and Ligase I (30Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). LP-BER is a minor pathway for the repair of 8-oxoG and regular AP sites in wild type cell-free extracts (26Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In contrast, LP-BER is thought to be the major pathway for the repair of reduced or oxidized AP sites (31Prasad R. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Several studies pointed to Polβ as the major repair DNA polymerase in eukaryotes, involved in both SP- and LP-BER (24Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 30Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 34Podlutsky A.J. Dianova I.I.

Polβ lacks accessory functions such as 3′ to 5′ exonuclease, dNMP turnover, or pyrophosphorolysis (37Friedberg E. Walker G. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995Google Scholar, 38Matsumoto Y. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4441-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R.

A. 1990; 87: 5842-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Polβ possesses a robust AP lyase activity that allows the removal of 5′-dRP in the course of BER (41Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Polβ performs an essential function in development, because knockout mice for Polβ are not viable (42Sugo N. Aratani Y. Nagashima Y. Kubota Y. Koyama H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). However, Polβ-null 3T3 cells are viable but hypersensitive to methylating agents (39Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 44Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The hypersensitivity to a methylating agent can be suppressed by the expression of the AP lyase domain of Polβ (44Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although non-essential, the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) has been shown to intervene in the course of BER in living cells (47Beneke R. Geisen C. Zevnik B. Bauch T. Muller W.U. Kupper J.H. Moroy T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6695-6703Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 48Trucco C. Oliver F.J. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). PARP-1 is a nuclear protein found in proliferating tissues of eukaryotes with the exception of yeast (49Shall S. de Murcia G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 50Burkle A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). PARP-1 binds with high affinity DNA containing single-strand breaks. Upon binding to DNA strand breaks, PARP-1 catalyzes the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) from NAD+ and covalently modifies several nuclear proteins involved in chromatin architecture (such as histones and lamin B) and DNA metabolism (such as topoisomerases, DNA polymerases, and BER factors). The automodification of PARP-1 induces its dissociation from DNA breaks and inhibition of its catalytic activity. PARP-1 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation are proposed to be critical for cellular processes such as DNA repair, transcription, or energy depletion-induced cell death during inflammatory injury (for review see Refs. 50Burkle A. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar and 51Ziegler M. Oei S.L. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of PARP-1 in BER was provided by the fact that PARP-1-null mice are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and alkylating agents (52de Murcia J.M. Niedergang C. Trucco C. Ricoul M. Dutrillaux B. Mark M. Oliver F.J. Masson M. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Walztinger C. Chambon P. de Murcia G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Res. 2000; 462: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, the physical interaction of PARP-1 with proteins such as Polβ and Xrcc1 also points to its role in BER (55Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 56Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Recently, PARP-1 was shown to bind with high affinity to BER intermediates harboring a 5′-dRP (57Lavrik O.I. Prasad R. Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Ackerman E.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25541-25548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reconstitution of BER using purified proteins shows that PARP-1 stimulates two of the key steps of LP-BER, i.e.strand displacement synthesis by Polβ and 5′-flap cleavage by Fen1 (58Prasad R. Lavrik O.I. Kim S.J. Kedar P. Yang X.P. Vande Berg B.J. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32411-32414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In addition repair of AP sites is impaired in cell-free extracts of PARP-1-null mice cell lines (46Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Menissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This study also shows that PARP-1-null Polβ-null cell-free extracts present a dramatic decrease in LP-BER when compared with PARP-1-null cells. Therefore, results with purified proteins and cell-free extracts point to a role of PARP-1 in LP-BER. To investigate the role of Polβ and PARP-1 in the course of BER in the cellular context, we measured the repair of 8-oxoG in murine cell lines (3T3s), either wild type (WT), those deficient in Polβ (Polβ−/−) or PARP-1 (PARP-1−/−), or cells that present the two deficiencies (PARP-1−/−Polβ−/−). We measured the repair kinetics for a single 8-oxoG:C base pair in these four cell lines using shuttle vectors that contain 8-oxoG in a transcribed sequence (TS) or a non-transcribed sequence (NTS) (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our results show that the repair of 8-oxoG in a TS plasmid is not affected in wild type, Polβ-null, PARP-1-null, and double PARP-1-null Polβ-null 3T3 cells. On the other hand, repair of 8-oxoG in an NTS plasmid, which is not affected in Polβ-null cells, occurs at a 2-fold reduced rate in PARP-1-null cells. Furthermore, 8-oxoG repair in the NTS plasmid is nearly completely abolished in cells deficient in both Polβ and PARP-1. The role of the poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis during BER is also discussed in this study. Spontaneously immortalized 3T3 wild-type, homozygous PARP1−/−, homozygous Polβ−/−, and double deficient PARP-1−/−Polβ−/− clones were established in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.5g/liter glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5% gentamycin (46Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Menissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). To obtain PARP1−/−Polβ−/− 3T3 cell lines corrected by the expression of wild-type or mutant human PARP-1, double deficient cell lines were transfected with an empty vector (pECV-23Xho) or a vector containing the cDNA encoding the wild type PARP-1 (pECV-PARP-1) (60Schreiber V. Molinete M. Boeuf H. de Murcia G. Menissier-de Murcia J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or the E988K mutant human PARP-1 protein (pECV-PARP-1E988K) (61Rolli V. O'Farrell M. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12147-12154Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected by growth in medium containing hygromycin at increasing concentrations up to 400 μg/ml. Single clones were isolated after 15 days, propagated in 12-well plates, and analyzed for PARP-1 expression by Western blotting. Cell-free protein extracts were prepared from clonal isolates as described previously (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The protein content was determined according to Bradford, and 50 μg of protein were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For immunodetection, blots were incubated with anti-PARP-1 (1/4000, Montevideo) polyclonal antibodies. Blots were then probed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit 1/25000, Sigma) and immunoreactivity was enhanced by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Standard assay mixture (15-μl final volume) contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 70 mm NaCl, 25 fmol of 5′-32P-labeled 8-oxoG:C 34-mer DNA duplex and 10 μg of cell-free protein extract (62Girard P.M. Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Construction of pSΔoriSV-[8-oxoG:C] or pSΔ(ori-p)SV-[8-oxoG:C] used for repair kinetics has been described (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). pSΔoriSV-[8-oxoG:C] (TS) or pSΔ(ori-p)SV-[8-oxoG:C] (NTS) plasmids were transfected into semiconfluent 3T3 cell lines (Effectene reagent, Qiagen). Cells were incubated from 2 to 24 h and harvested, and plasmid DNA was recovered (63Stary A. Sarasin A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1679-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Assays for removal kinetics of 8-oxoG were carried out using a procedure described previously (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, recovered extrachromosomal DNA was treated or not with 5 ng of theEscherichia coli Fpg protein (64Boiteux S. O'Connor T.R. Lederer F. Gouyette A. Laval J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3916-3922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Plasmid DNA was detected by Southern blotting, and quantification was done using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The repair of 8-oxoG at each time point corresponds to the ratio between covalently closed molecules (CC) after an Fpg treatment and the sum of CC molecules and open circles (OC). This assay requires that the integrity of the CC molecules is preserved during DNA extraction. Thus conversion into the relaxed form (OC) of the plasmid DNA depends on Fpg treatment (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transfection and plasmid extraction were performed as above. Recovered plasmid DNA was used to transformE. coli strain (BH990)fpg−mutY− by electroporation, and transformants were selected by ampicillin resistance. The repair of 8-oxoG:C was monitored by NgoMIV digestion of plasmid DNA extracted from individual bacterial clones as described previously (65Le Page F. Guy A. Cadet J. Sarasin A. Gentil A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1276-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recovered plasmid DNA was used as template for an “asymmetrical PCR amplification.” An 18-mer, located 80 bp from the site of the lesion and used as a primer, was labeled in the 5′-end by [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Primer extensions were performed using an automatic thermocycler and anE. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, 250 μm dNTP in a reaction mixture containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, and 6.6 mm MgCl2 (Biolabs). Amplification conditions were 29 cycles with 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 54 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. Reactions were quenched by denaturing loading buffer, and the reaction products were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. A sequence of plasmid DNA using the unlabeled 18-mer primer was performed according to the standard protocol provided by the manufacturer (Sequenase 2.0 DNA sequence kit, Upstate Biotechnology) and migrated in parallel to the primer extension synthesis. To investigate the role of Polβ and PARP-1 proteins in the repair of 8-oxoG in the cellular context, we used the 3T3 cell lines WT, PARP-1−/−, Polβ−/−, and PARP-1−/−Polβ−/−, which have been characterized previously (46Dantzer F. de La Rubia G. Menissier-De Murcia J. Hostomsky Z. de Murcia G. Schreiber V. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7559-7569Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The different 3T3 cells were transfected with non-replicative plasmids that contain a single 8-oxoG:C base pair. Two constructs were used to allow repair analysis of 8-oxoG located in the same sequence context but with a different transcriptional status (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 66Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). One plasmid allows the analysis of 8-oxoG repair in a TS, whereas the other allows the analysis of 8-oxoG repair in the same sequence but non-transcribed because of the deletion of the SV40 promoter (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 66Le Page F. Kwoh E.E. Avrutskaya A. Gentil A. Leadon S.A. Sarasin A. Cooper P.K. Cell. 2000; 101: 159-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To monitor the repair of 8-oxoG, plasmid DNA was recovered after incubation in 3T3 cells and digested by the Fpg protein, which specifically nicks DNA at the 8-oxoG:C base pair. In this assay, 8-oxoG repair is characterized by increasing amounts of CC plasmid molecules that are resistant to cleavage by Fpg, indicating the replacement of the 8-oxoG:C pair with a G:C pair in DNA and the sealing of the repair-induced nick or gap (59Le Page F. Klungland A. Barnes D.E. Sarasin A. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8397-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Fig.1 (right panel) gives an illustration of different Southern blots obtained with NTS constructs in each cell line used. Fig. 1 (left panel) shows a comparison of 8-oxoG:C repair kinetics in TS and NTS in WT and mutant 3T3 cell lines. Fig. 1B shows that repair kinetics in Polβ-null cells are very similar to those obtained in WT cells (Fig.1A) independently of the transcriptional status of the lesion, TS or NTS. Therefore, DNA polymerase β is not required for the repair of 8-oxoG:C in the cellular context, indicating the action of other DNA polymerases. Fig. 1C shows the repair kinetics of 8-oxoG:C in PARP-1-null cell lines. Again, there is no obvious difference between PARP-1−/− and WT with 8-oxoG:C in the TS status. In contrast, 8-oxoG:C repair on NTS is delayed in PARP-1-null cells when compared with that observed in the WT cell line. However, full repair of 8-oxoG:C is observed at 24 h in the PARP-1−/− cells (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the absence of PARP-1 impairs an efficient replacement of 8-oxoG with a guanine, even if the protein is not absolutely required in the cellular context. To further investigate the role of Polβ and PARP-1, we analyzed the processing of 8-oxoG:C in a double deficient PARP-1−/−Polβ−/− cell line. Fig.1D shows that the 8-oxoG:C base pair is efficiently repaired when located on a TS plasmid in both WT and PARP-1−/−Polβ−/− cell lines. In contrast, until 18 h after transfection we did not observe detectable repair of 8-oxoG:C in the NTS plasmid, whereas all molecules were repaired in WT cells. Finally, less than 10% of repair may be observed in the double knockout cells 24 h after transfection (Fig.1D). These results show that full repair of 8-oxoG:C is greatly impaired in the NTS plasmid in cells lacking both Polβ and PARP-1 proteins. The absence of repair of 8-oxoG:C in the NTS plasmid 12 h after transfection in the PARP-1-null Polβ-null cells could be due to an impaired recognition and/or excision of 8-oxoG by the Ogg1 DNA N-glycosylase. Therefore, Ogg1 enzyme activity in crude extracts was assayed using as substrate a 34-mer oligonucleotide containing an 8-oxoG:C base pair. Fig. 2shows that a cell-free extract of the PARP-1-null Polβ-null 3T3 cells efficiently cleaves the 8-oxoG:C duplex. Furthermore, Western blotting analysis using anti-human Ogg1 antibodies reveals a normal expression of the murine Ogg1 in PARP-1-null Polβ-null cells (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that removal of 8-oxoG is not globally affected. If 8-oxoG is efficiently processed by Ogg1, the plasmid DNA recovered from PARP-1-null Polβ-null cells should contain a nick at or near the site of the lesion.

https://openalex.org/W2033892012,"Bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1) is a shorter spliced variant of mammalian tolloid (mTld), both of which cleave the C-propeptides of type I procollagen during the synthesis of extracellular matrix collagen fibrils. The fact that BMP-1 and mTld both exhibit procollagen C-proteinase (PCP) activity and that BMP-1 is the smaller variant might indicate that BMP-1 comprises the minimal required sequences for PCP activity. BMP-1 comprises a metalloproteinase domain, three CUB domains, and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is located between the second and third CUB (complement components C1r/C1s, the sea urchin protein Uegf, and BMP-1) domains. In this study we showed the following. 1) The CUB1 domain is required for secretion of the molecule. Domain swapping experiments, in which CUB1 and other CUB domains were interchanged, resulted in retention of the proteins by cells. Therefore, CUB1 and its location immediately adjacent to the metalloproteinase domain are essential for secretion of the protein. 2) Mutants lacking the EGF-like and CUB3 domains exhibited full C-proteinase activity. In contrast, mutants lacking the CUB2 domain were poor C-proteinases. 3) Further studies showed that Glu-483 on the β4-β5 loop of CUB2 is essential for C-proteinase activity of BMP-1. In conclusion, the study showed that the minimal domain structure for PCP activity is considerably shorter than expected and comprises the metalloproteinase domain and the CUB1 and CUB2 domains of BMP-1.

Evidence from gene knock-out studies in mice in which the mouse tolloid gene was mutated showed that BMP-1 and/or mTld are essential for normal assembly of extracellular matrix (14Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of the skin detected the presence of abnormal collagen fibrils in the knock-out mouse, which showed that BMP-1 and/or mTld are essential for normal cleavage of procollagen.BMP-1 is encoded by mtld, which also gives rise to mammalian tolloid (mTld or vertebrate Tld). mTld contains five CUB domains and two EGF-like domains at its C terminus, whereas BMP-1 lacks the most C-terminal two CUBs and one EGF-like domain. Interestingly, both BMP-1 and mTld can cleave the C-propeptides of fibril-forming procollagens (6Kessler E. Takahara K. Biniaminov L. Brusel M. Greenspan D.S. Science. 1996; 271: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 7Shi-Wu-Li Sieron A.L. Fertala A. Hojima Y. Arnold W. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5127-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), which implies that BMP-1 contains the minimal sequence requirement for procollagen C-proteinase activity (PCP). Indeed, studies in which human recombinant Tld was subjected to limited proteolysis by α-chymotrypsin showed that the procollagen binding function of human Tld was contained within the first (most N-terminal) three CUB domains (15Sieron A.L. Tretiakova A. Jameson B.A. Segall L.M. Lund-Katz S. Shan M.T. Stocker W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In this study we wanted to know if all the CUB domains of BMP-1 are required for PCP activity. Our approach was to generate truncated and domain-swap mutants of BMP-1, to express and purify the variant proteins, and to examine the proteins in assays of procollagen C-proteinase. We show that BMP-1 molecules lacking the C-terminal EGF-like and CUB3 domains exhibit full PCP activity in vitro. In contrast, BMP-1 lacking the CUB2 domain is a poor C-proteinase. Furthermore, BMP-1 lacking CUB2, EGF-like, and CUB3 domains exhibit no PCP activity. We subsequently went on to identify residues in the CUB2 domain that are essential for PCP activity. We also show that the CUB1 domain is absolutely required for secretion of BMP-1 and, moreover, that this domain needs to be located immediately C-terminal of the metalloproteinase. The results show that the minimal sequence for PCP activity is shorter than the sequences encoded by BMP-1 and includes sequences N-terminal of the EGF-like domain,i.e. the EGF-like and CUB3 domains are not important for C-proteinase activity.DISCUSSIONThis study has shown that: 1) the CUB1 domain of BMP-1 is required for secretion of the molecule; 2) CUB1 needs to be immediately C-terminal of the metalloproteinase domain for secretion of the molecule; and 3) the CUB2 domain is essential for C-proteinase activity. These observations have implications for folding and assembly of other proteins containing CUB domains, for studies of the structure-and-function of proteinases, and for the mode of action of other members of the tolloid family of proteinases.The CUB domain is an extracellular domain of ∼110 residues organized into five β-pleated sheets with two disulfide bonds that stabilize the structure. The domain is found in at least 300 proteins listed on the InterPro site at the European Bioinformatics Institute on-line data bases and at NCBI. Proteins that contain CUB domains exhibit a wide range of biologically different and regulatory functions (19Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 17: 565-574Google Scholar). For example, in addition to BMP-1, CUB domains occur in complement subcomponents C1s/C1r, which form part of the calcium-dependent complex C1; serine protease Casp, which cleaves type I and IV collagen and fibronectin in the presence of calcium ions; enteropeptidase, which activates trypsinogen; neuropilin, a cell adhesion molecule that functions during the formation of certain neuronal circuits; and spermadhesins. The function of CUB domains is poorly understood, although they are thought to be involved mostly in protein-protein interactions. In this study we showed that each CUB domain in BMP-1 has a different function. The CUB1 domain is critical for secretion of BMP-1, and moreover, the domain needs to be positioned immediately C-terminal of the metalloproteinase domain. The replacement of CUB1 with either CUB2 or CUB3, even when CUB1 was positioned downstream of these domains, resulted in retention of BMP-1. Therefore, only CUB1 in the first position could facilitate secretion of BMP-1. This was an unexpected result given the fact that the three CUB domains of BMP-1 are 38% identical. The main differences occur in the loop regions, and this may indicate different functions and protein binding specificities. The fact that the CUB1 domain is necessary and sufficient for secretion of the metalloproteinase domain suggests that there are specific sequences, perhaps in the loop regions of the domain, which bind the metalloproteinase domain and stabilize its three-dimensional structure. Previous studies have shown that BMP-1 lacking the two N-linked glycans on CUB1 is secreted (20Garrigue-Antar L Hartigan N Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43327-43334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, retention of CUB1 deletion mutants was because the CUB1 sequencesper se were absent and not because of the underglycosylated state of the protein. These observations have implications for other proteins with CUB domains, particularly proteinases that have the CUB domain adjacent to the proteinase domain, such as the serine proteases in complement components. Mutations in these CUB domains might be expected to result in intracellular retention or misfolding of the proteins.Early work on Drosophila tolloid revealed a number of natural mutations that affected dorsal-ventral patterning (17Childs S.R. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Finelli A.L. Bossie C.A. Xie T. Padgett R.W. Development. 1994; 120: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). Two such mutations, M487K and E517K (numbering for Drosophilatolloid), occurred in the CUB2 domain. Glu-517 is conserved in the CUB2 domain of all mammalian tolloids and is equivalent to residue Glu-483 in BMP-1. Mapping of the mTld CUB domains onto the crystal structure of the CUB domain from the porcine sperm protein PSPI/PSPII shows that Glu-483 is situated in a loop region between β-strands 4 and 5 (21Romao M.J. Kolln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Romero A. Varela P.F. Sanz L Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Glu-483 could have a role in the PCP activity of BMP-1. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the E483K mutation abolished the C-proteinase activity of BMP-1. The role of Glu-483 in C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 is unknown but might include disruption of the domain fold or destruction of a procollagen binding site.A surprising observation was that the EGF-like and CUB3 domains are not required for PCP of BMP-1 in vitro. Thus, the minimal sequences for PCP activity are contained within the metalloproteinase domain and the first two CUB domains. A mutant that contained the metalloproteinase domain and CUB1 exhibited weak PCP activity, which further demonstrated the importance of the CUB2 domain in PCP activity of BMP-1. Careful structure modeling of the CUB domains as well as type I procollagen binding experiments to fragments of human Tld containing CUB2 and CUB3 have been performed (15Sieron A.L. Tretiakova A. Jameson B.A. Segall L.M. Lund-Katz S. Shan M.T. Stocker W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that CUB2 and CUB3 present several sites for specific interactions. In particular, well defined hydrophobic sites within these domains are postulated to be sites of interaction with substrates, including type I procollagen. BMP-11 was isolated in the latter half of the 1980s from osteogenic fragments of bone and was shown to induce cartilage formation in vivo (1Urist M.R.

Thus, retention of CUB1 deletion mutants was because the CUB1 sequencesper se were absent and not because of the underglycosylated state of the protein. These observations have implications for other proteins with CUB domains, particularly proteinases that have the CUB domain adjacent to the proteinase domain, such as the serine proteases in complement components. Mutations in these CUB domains might be expected to result in intracellular retention or misfolding of the proteins.Early work on Drosophila tolloid revealed a number of natural mutations that affected dorsal-ventral patterning (17Childs S.R.

Two such mutations, M487K and E517K (numbering for Drosophilatolloid), occurred in the CUB2 domain. Glu-517 is conserved in the CUB2 domain of all mammalian tolloids and is equivalent to residue Glu-483 in BMP-1. Mapping of the mTld CUB domains onto the crystal structure of the CUB domain from the porcine sperm protein PSPI/PSPII shows that Glu-483 is situated in a loop region between β-strands 4 and 5 (21Romao M.J.

We hypothesized that Glu-483 could have a role in the PCP activity of BMP-1. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the E483K mutation abolished the C-proteinase activity of BMP-1.

Proteins that contain CUB domains exhibit a wide range of biologically different and regulatory functions (19Bork P. Beckmann G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 17: 565-574Google Scholar). For example, in addition to BMP-1, CUB domains occur in complement subcomponents C1s/C1r, which form part of the calcium-dependent complex C1; serine protease Casp, which cleaves type I and IV collagen and fibronectin in the presence of calcium ions; enteropeptidase, which activates trypsinogen; neuropilin, a cell adhesion molecule that functions during the formation of certain neuronal circuits; and spermadhesins. The function of CUB domains is poorly understood, although they are thought to be involved mostly in protein-protein interactions. In this study we showed that each CUB domain in BMP-1 has a different function. The CUB1 domain is critical for secretion of BMP-1, and moreover, the domain needs to be positioned immediately C-terminal of the metalloproteinase domain. The replacement of CUB1 with either CUB2 or CUB3, even when CUB1 was positioned downstream of these domains, resulted in retention of BMP-1. Therefore, only CUB1 in the first position could facilitate secretion of BMP-1. This was an unexpected result given the fact that the three CUB domains of BMP-1 are 38% identical. The main differences occur in the loop regions, and this may indicate different functions and protein binding specificities. The fact that the CUB1 domain is necessary and sufficient for secretion of the metalloproteinase domain suggests that there are specific sequences, perhaps in the loop regions of the domain, which bind the metalloproteinase domain and stabilize its three-dimensional structure. Previous studies have shown that BMP-1 lacking the two N-linked glycans on CUB1 is secreted (20Garrigue-Antar L Hartigan N Kadler K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43327-43334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, retention of CUB1 deletion mutants was because the CUB1 sequencesper se were absent and not because of the underglycosylated state of the protein. These observations have implications for other proteins with CUB domains, particularly proteinases that have the CUB domain adjacent to the proteinase domain, such as the serine proteases in complement components. Mutations in these CUB domains might be expected to result in intracellular retention or misfolding of the proteins. Early work on Drosophila tolloid revealed a number of natural mutations that affected dorsal-ventral patterning (17Childs S.R. O'Connor M.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Finelli A.L. Bossie C.A. Xie T. Padgett R.W. Development. 1994; 120: 861-870PubMed Google Scholar). Two such mutations, M487K and E517K (numbering for Drosophilatolloid), occurred in the CUB2 domain. Glu-517 is conserved in the CUB2 domain of all mammalian tolloids and is equivalent to residue Glu-483 in BMP-1. Mapping of the mTld CUB domains onto the crystal structure of the CUB domain from the porcine sperm protein PSPI/PSPII shows that Glu-483 is situated in a loop region between β-strands 4 and 5 (21Romao M.J. Kolln I. Dias J.M. Carvalho A.L. Romero A. Varela P.F. Sanz L Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 650-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Glu-483 could have a role in the PCP activity of BMP-1. The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that the E483K mutation abolished the C-proteinase activity of BMP-1. The role of Glu-483 in C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 is unknown but might include disruption of the domain fold or destruction of a procollagen binding site. A surprising observation was that the EGF-like and CUB3 domains are not required for PCP of BMP-1 in vitro. Thus, the minimal sequences for PCP activity are contained within the metalloproteinase domain and the first two CUB domains. A mutant that contained the metalloproteinase domain and CUB1 exhibited weak PCP activity, which further demonstrated the importance of the CUB2 domain in PCP activity of BMP-1. Careful structure modeling of the CUB domains as well as type I procollagen binding experiments to fragments of human Tld containing CUB2 and CUB3 have been performed (15Sieron A.L. Tretiakova A. Jameson B.A. Segall L.M. Lund-Katz S. Shan M.T. Stocker W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that CUB2 and CUB3 present several sites for specific interactions. In particular, well defined hydrophobic sites within these domains are postulated to be sites of interaction with substrates, including type I procollagen.

https://openalex.org/W1968020384,"Despite its lack of specificity, the inhibitor SB 203580 has been widely used to implicate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the synthesis of many cytokines. Here we show unequivocally that the production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) requires p38 MAPK activity by demonstrating that the inhibitory effects of SB 203580 were reversed by expression of an SB 203580-resistant form of p38α (SBR-p38α) that fails to bind to SB 203580. This strategy established the requirement for p38 activity for the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of IL-10, IL-1β, and IL-6 by the monocytic cell WEHI 274 and the production of IL-6 and TNFα stimulated by ligation of the Fc-γ receptor of the mast cell MC/9. Expression of SBR-p38α in primary macrophages abrogated the ability of SB 203580 to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of TNFα but not of IL-10. Expression of SBR-p38α in primary T lymphocytes abrogated the ability of SB 203580 to inhibit the production of interferon-γ induced by co-ligation of CD3 and CD28 but not the production of interferon-γ or IL-10 induced by IL-12. These results suggest that the levels of p38 MAPK activity required for maximal cytokine production vary with different cytokines and stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2090467392,"The amino-terminal domain (ATD) ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial RNA polymerase has been shown to provide a functional link between transcription and post-transcriptional events during mitochondrial gene expression. This connection is mediated in large part by its interactions with the matrix protein Nam1p and, based on genetic phenotypes, the mitochondrial membrane protein Sls1p. These observations led us to propose previously that mtRNA polymerase, Nam1p, and Sls1p work together to coordinate transcription and translation of mtDNA-encoded gene products. Here we demonstrate by specific labeling of mitochondrial gene products in vivo that Nam1p and Sls1p indeed work together in a pathway that is required globally for efficient mitochondrial translation. Likewise, mutations in the ATD result in similar global reductions in mitochondrial translation efficiency and sensitivity to the mitochondrial translation inhibitor erythromycin. These data, coupled with the observation that the ATD is required to co-purify Sls1p in association with mtDNA nucleoids, suggest that efficient expression of mtDNA-encoded genes in yeast involves a complex series of interactions that localize active transcription complexes to the inner membrane in order to coordinate translation with transcription.

Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transcription of yeast mtDNA is initiated at multiple promoters by a dedicated mtRNA polymerase that is encoded by the RPO41 gene (2Greenleaf A.L. Kelly J.L. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3391-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and homologous to the bacteriophage T7 family of RNA polymerases (3Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Most mitochondrial transcripts are polycistronic and require extensive processing to release the mature RNA species for proper gene expression (4Dieckmann C.L. Staples R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 145-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, introns are often present in certain messages that also must be excised. In the case of the COX1 and COBgenes, this is a complex process that requires intron-encoded maturases that help catalyze splicing (5Lazowska J. Jacq C. Slonimski P.P. Cell. 1980; 22: 333-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 6Pel H.J. Grivell L.A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Once fully processed, mRNAs are translated within the matrix by ribosomes associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (7Fox T.D. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 8Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, the newly synthesized mtDNA-encoded proteins are assembled with the corresponding nucleus-encoded subunits to form the oxidative phosphorylation enzyme complexes in the inner membrane. The execution and coordination of these events are necessary for normal cellular respiration. We previously examined the mechanism of mitochondrial gene expression in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and elucidated a pathway of transcription-coupled events that involves an amino-terminal domain (ATD)1 of mtRNA polymerase (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Over the course of these experiments, several mutations in the yeast mtRNA polymerase ATD have been characterized, including two deletion mutations, rpo41Δ2 and rpo41Δ3, and several single or double point mutations, which result in mitochondrial petite phenotypes and defects in mitochondrial RNA processing and/or mtDNA stability (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, the steady-state levels of mature mRNA from the intron-containing COB andCOX1 genes are severely decreased in these strains, whereas those of an intronless gene, COX3, are minimally affected (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These intron-processing defects suggest that the ATD affects translational efficiency (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar) because studies using mitochondria-specific translation inhibitors cause the same defectsin vivo (12Zhang Y. Bell A. Perlman P.S. Leibowitz M.J. RNA (New York). 2000; 6: 937-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, the minimal defects inCOX3 transcript levels in the rpo41 ATD mutants, along with S1 nuclease protection assays of the ori5promoter in an rpo41Δ3 strain (11Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggest that the catalytic activity and initiation properties of mtRNA polymerase are not drastically altered. Analogous in some ways to the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (13Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), the ATD of mtRNA polymerase is the binding site for at least one factor involved in post-transcriptional events. Specifically, it is the interaction point for Nam1p (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a protein involved in RNA processing and translation (14Asher E.B. Groudinsky O. Dujardin G. Altamura N. Kermorgant M. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Groudinsky O. Bousquet I. Wallis M.G. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Mol. Gen.

Two additional lines of evidence support a functional role for this interaction in coordinating mitochondrial translation. First, nam1Δmutations result in similar, yet more severe, COX1 andCYTB intron-processing defects as ATD mutations (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Second, overexpression of the mitochondrial membrane protein Sls1p suppresses the respiration-deficient petite phenotype of bothnam1Δ and mtRNA polymerase ATD mutations, indicating that mtRNA polymerase, Nam1p, and Sls1p exist in an ordered genetic pathway required for normal mitochondrial gene expression (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations and on the proposed function of Sls1p in post-transcription events (17Rouillard J.M. Dufour M.E. Theunissen B. Mandart E. Dujardin G. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 700-708PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that these three factors comprise important components of a mitochondrial RNA-handling pathway that targets newly synthesized transcripts to the inner membrane (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar), where translation of mtDNA-encoded messages occurs (7Fox T.D. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar,8Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5796-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Entirely consistent with this model is the recent identification of interactions between Nam1p and the COX-specific translational activator complex (18Naithani S. Saracco S. Butler C. Fox T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 14: 324-333Crossref Google Scholar), implicating Nam1p as a potential envoy between mtRNA polymerase and the translation machinery. In this study we have demonstrated that Sls1p functions globally in mitochondrial translation, and we provide multiple new lines of evidence that the ATD of mtRNA polymerase is a focal point for critical interactions with Nam1p and Sls1p that act in concert to coordinate transcription and translation at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Yeast were grown as described (19Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) in complete YPG (glycerol) medium, YPD (dextrose) medium, or synthetic dextrose (SD) medium with the necessary nutritional supplements as indicated. The bacto-yeast extract, dextrose, and yeast nitrogenous base (without amino acids) were obtained from Difco. Glycerol and peptone were obtained from Fisher. The yeast strains used in this study were derived from DBY2006 (α his3-Δ200 leu2-3, -112 ura3-52 trp1-Δ1 ade2). With the exception of MSR107 (GS122 + [YEp352-V5SLS1]) and MSR112 (GS125 + [YEp352-V5SLS1]), all yeast strains have been described previously (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The YEp352-V5SLS1 vector was created as follows. The SLS1 gene was PCR-amplified using a 5′-primer that annealed to a sequence 200 bp upstream of the SLS1translation start site and a 3′-primer complementary to the 3′-end of the SLS1 open reading frame, which also contained the V5 epitope and a SacI site at its 5′-end. The PCR product was then ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega), from which the V5 epitope-SLS1 fusion allele was excised on aPstI-SacI fragment and ligated into YEp352 that was digested with the same restriction enzymes. An overnight culture (2 ml) of each yeast strain was grown to saturation in YPG (or YPD for petite mutants) medium and used to inoculate a 15-ml SD culture supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. These cultures were then incubated at 30 °C for 2 h prior to overnight incubation at 37 °C. These cultures were then diluted to an A600 of 0.6 with SD medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 2.5 h, cycloheximide (Spectrum Laboratory Products, Inc.) was added to 250 μg/ml in 10 ml of each culture, and the incubation was continued for 5 min prior to the 15-min incubation with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Labeling was stopped by addition of 4 ml of 1 mm Na2SO4 and 1% casamino acids, followed by an additional 10-min incubation. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and mitochondria were prepared as described (20Fox T.D. Folley L.S. Mulero J.J. McMullin T.W. Thorsness P.E. Hedin L.O. Costanzo M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The procedure was identical for labeling done at 30 °C except that cycloheximide was added to a concentration of 150 μg/ml. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. Mitochondrial protein (15 μg) was separated on a 17% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was then treated with Enlightening (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 40–72 h. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase in 5 ml of liquid YPG media. Cultures were then diluted to an A600 of 0.4 and spotted onto solid YPG medium containing the either 0, 5, 10, 20, or 50 μg/ml of erythromycin (Sigma), using a 48-pin multiplex plating tool. The plates were then incubated at 36 or 30 °C for 6 days prior to the assessment of growth phenotypes. Complete lack of growth was scored as sensitivity to the drug. Yeast strains were set up and grown overnight at 37 °C and diluted to anA600 of 0.6 with SD medium as they were in the radiolabeling experiments. The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. These cultures were then diluted and plated for the petite induction assay, as described previously (21O'Rourke T.W. Doudican N.A. Mackereth M.D. Doetsch P.W. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4086-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was applied to identify outlying data points (22Grubbs F.E. Technometrics. 1969; 11: 1-21Crossref Scopus (2626) Google Scholar). By using this criterion, one data point for rpo41Δ2 was omitted. Total cellular DNA was isolated from cultures grown in the same manner for Southern blot analysis. The total DNA was digested withNdeI and separated on a 0.8% agarose gel for Southern analysis. The Southern blots were hybridized sequentially with radiolabeled probes to mitochondrial encoded COX1 andCOX3 and nuclear encoded ACT1 as a normalization control. Yeast cultures were grown and mitochondria prepared as they were for the in vivotranslation assay described above, except that the cultures were not incubated with cycloheximide or [35S]methionine. Mitochondrial protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A8.40-A8.55Google Scholar), and Western analysis was performed as described in the ECL Western blotting detection kit protocol (Amersham Biosciences), using anti-Cox2p, anti-Cox1p, and anti-porin antibodies (Molecular Probes). Mitochondria competent for in organellotranslation were prepared and stored as described (24Poyton R.O. Bellus G. McKee E.E. Sevarino K.A. Goehring B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 36-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria (2 mg of mitochondrial protein/sample) were thawed, and in organello translation reactions were performed as described (24Poyton R.O. Bellus G. McKee E.E. Sevarino K.A. Goehring B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 36-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except 20 mm HEPES was substituted for Tris in the protein synthesis medium. ATP, GTP, α-ketoglutarate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate kinase (all obtained from Sigma) comprise the energy-regenerating system in the protein synthesis medium. Mitochondria were resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold protein synthesis medium, and pyruvate kinase was added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to the addition of 400 μm of the cross-linking reagent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce). After incubation for 20 min, Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) was added to a concentration of 20 mm, and mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in ice-cold NE2.5 (0.38 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm spermidine) on ice. Mitochondria were then lysed by the addition of 12.5% Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.5%. After incubation on ice for 10 min, DNase I was added where indicated and then all samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was transferred to another tube and incubated on ice for 25 min. The supernatants were then layered on top of a 20/40/60% sucrose step gradient and centrifuged in an SW 41 rotor (111,000 × g for 75 min). The 40/60% interface was collected, diluted to 1 ml in NE2.5 buffer, and pelleted through 40% sucrose at 136,000 × g for 1 h in a TLA 100.3 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in NE2.5 buffer, diluted in 2× Laemmli buffer (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A8.40-A8.55Google Scholar) with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, vortexed, and boiled for 5 min. Samples (10 μl) of each nucleoid fraction and of each lysate (supernatant) fraction (2 μl) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE for silver staining. In parallel, a sample of each nucleoid fraction (40 μl) and each lysate sample (20 μl) were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a membrane for Western analysis using an anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). We identified previously (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar)SLS1 as a genetic suppressor of the mitochondrial petite phenotypes of mtRNA polymerase ATD and NAM1 null (nam1Δ) mutations. Because nam1Δ and ATD mutant strains all demonstrate a defect in intron processing of theCOX1 and COB genes (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 15Groudinsky O. Bousquet I. Wallis M.G. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Sls1p has been implicated to act in the same pathway of transcription-coupled events as Nam1p and mtRNA polymerase (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether ansls1Δ strain has a similar mitochondrial intron-processing defect as nam1Δ and rpo41 ATD mutant strains. Northern analysis of total mitochondrial RNA revealed that ansls1Δ strain expressed nearly wild-type levels ofCOX3 mRNA, a gene that does not contain introns, yet does not accumulate the mature mRNA from the intron-containingCOX1 and COB genes (Fig.1A). Therefore, thesls1Δ strain has the same intron-processing defects asnam1Δ and ATD mutant strains (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because mitochondrial intron-processing defects correlate with translation perturbation, these data suggested that Sls1p impacts mitochondrial translation efficiency. To test the hypothesis directly, mtDNA-encoded proteins in the sls1Δ strain were specifically labeled in vivo using [35S]methionine in the presence of the cytoplasmic translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Accordingly, thesls1Δ strain was severely deficient in labeling of all mtDNA-encoded products (Fig. 1B), indicating that Sls1p is, in fact, required globally for efficient translation in yeast mitochondria. Although sls1Δ strains exhibit a virtual absence of mitochondrial translation (Fig. 1B), nam1Δmutants have been shown by others (14Asher E.B. Groudinsky O. Dujardin G. Altamura N. Kermorgant M. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to exhibit a moderate global decrease in mitochondrial translation and an apparent lack of labeling of Cox1p. Because we have previously placed Nam1p and Sls1p in the same genetic pathway (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of deleting theNAM1 gene on mitochondrial translation in our strain background. Similar to the results obtained with the sls1Δ(Fig. 1B), in vivo labeling of mtDNA-encoded proteins revealed an extremely low if not complete absence of translation of all mtDNA-encoded proteins in this nam1Δstrain (Fig. 1C). We also demonstrated previously that overexpression of Sls1p suppresses the petite phenotype of thenam1Δ mutation in this genetic background (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined whether Sls1p can suppress the observed translation defect in the nam1Δ strain when overexpressed. Labeling of translation products demonstrated that overexpression of Sls1p restored mitochondrial translation in our nam1Δ strain to close to wild-type levels at 30 °C (Fig. 1C), with the exception of Cox1p, which was only moderately increased. Similar results were obtained when in vivo labeling was performed at 37 °C (data not shown). The similar translation phenotypes of thenam1Δ and sls1Δ strains as well as the ability of increased levels of Sls1p to greatly restore translation in the nam1Δ strain provide strong evidence that these proteins act in the same pathway to determine the efficiency of mitochondrial translation. To test the hypothesis that, likesls1Δ and nam1Δ strains, the documented intron-processing defects observed in rpo41 ATD mutant strains (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) result from impaired mitochondrial translation, labeling experiments were performed in these strains. All ATD mutations tested resulted in decreased incorporation of radiolabel into mtDNA-encoded proteins, indicative of a global decrease in translation efficiency (Fig. 2A). Therpo41-N152A/Y154A mutation resulted in the most severe global translation defect (Fig. 2A), requiring extended exposures to reveal the extremely low amount of labeling (data not shown). Additional experiments revealed that labeling of translation products did not diminish when the chase time was increased to 1 h in any of the rpo41 ATD mutants, demonstrating that the defect is not a result of a decrease in stability of the translation products during the labeling period (data not shown). The [35S]-labeling assays require that the cultures be grown in synthetic glucose medium, a condition that allows growth of cells that have lost wild-type (rho+) mtDNA. Because mtRNA polymerase is required for rho+ mtDNA maintenance (1Shadel G.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Greenleaf A.L. Kelly J.L. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3391-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), in principle, the translation defects observed in the in vivo labeling assays could result from a decrease in the number of rho+ genomes. To assess the degree of mtDNA instability in the ATD mutant strains under these conditions, cultures were grown in the same manner as the [35S] incorporation assays and quantitated for the amount of spontaneous petite formation (TableI), which is largely a measure of rho− genome production (1Shadel G.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The deletion mutants,rpo41Δ2 and rpo41Δ3, produce spontaneous petite mutants at a rate similar to the wild-type strain, indicating that their mtDNA is as stable as in the wild-type strain under these conditions. The rpo41-E119A/C121A mutation produced more spontaneous petite mutants than either of the deletion mutants (Table I), yet consistently incorporated more radiolabel in the mitochondrial translation assay (Fig. 2A), indicating that the translation defect observed in the deletion mutants is likely not the result of increased rho− genome production. The strain that exhibited the most severe translation defect,rpo41-N152A/Y154A (Fig. 2A), was also the strain that exhibited the largest amount of spontaneous petite formation (Table I). However, the ∼30% instability observed presumably cannot account for the very small percentage of total translation activity that was observed in the in vivolabeling experiments (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, Southern analysis of mtDNA from the rpo41-N152A/Y154Astrain using two probes that hybridize to mtDNA sequences physically separated on the genome (COX1 and COX3) also revealed that mtDNA is largely intact in this strain under these conditions (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these data indicate that the translation defects measured in all of the rpo41 ATD mutant strains using the in vivo labeling approach, with the possible exception of the rpo41-E119A/C121Astrain (see “Discussion”), are not the result of mtDNA instability at the time of the assay.Table IPetite induction in ATD mutant strainsATD mutantPercent respiratory competentWild-type88.9 ± 10.6rpo41Δ299.1 ± 2.6rpo41Δ395.2 ± 5.0rpo41-E119A/C121A80.1 ± 6.3rpo41-N152A/Y154A71.3 ± 8.2 Open table in a new tab To confirm that the observed translation defect results in decreased steady-state levels of mtDNA-encoded proteins in the rpo41ATD mutant strains, Western blot analysis was performed on mtDNA-encoded Cox1p and Cox2p. Analysis of total mitochondrial protein revealed that all rpo41 ATD mutants accumulated reduced steady-state levels of both proteins, whereas the amount of the nucleus-encoded mitochondrial protein porin was apparently unaffected (Fig. 3A). These data demonstrate that mutations in the ATD perturb mitochondrial translation, resulting in accumulation of less mtDNA-encoded protein as expected. Finally, to assess independently whether the rpo41 ATD mutations affect mitochondrial translation, their sensitivity to the mitochondrial translation inhibitor erythromycin was measured. The yeast cultures used in this assay were maintained on glycerol medium throughout the experiment, selecting for maintenance of rho+ genomes. With the exception of therpo41-E119A-C121A mutation, all of the rpo41 ATD mutants are hypersensitive to the mitochondrial translation inhibitor erythromycin at 36 °C (Fig. 3B). Consistent with results of the in vivo labeling experiments (Fig. 2A) and the steady-state analysis (Fig. 3A), therpo41-N152A/Y154A strain was by far the most sensitive to the drug. The ability of Sls1p to suppress nam1Δ and ATD mutations (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1C) led us to investigate the possibility that Sls1p interacts in some manner with mtRNA polymerase. We hypothesized that if Sls1p interacts with the ATD, either directly or as a complex with other proteins, it may do so in the context of the mitochondrial nucleoid, where mtRNA polymerase is predicted to reside. To test this possibility, nucleoids in actively translating mitochondria were isolated from wild-type and rpo41Δ3 mutant strains expressing a functional V5-tagged version of Sls1p. Western analysis of nucleoids isolated from wild-type strains confirmed that mtRNA polymerase is present in the nucleoid fraction in a DNA-dependent manner (data not shown), demonstrating that mitochondrial nucleoids are being isolated. Western analysis of mitochondrial lysates using an anti-V5 antibody revealed that expression of the tagged Sls1p was similar in both strains (Fig.4). Analysis of the corresponding nucleoid fraction from the wild-type strain revealed the presence of Sls1p in the nucleoid that was dependent on the presence of mtDNA (Fig.4), indicating that Sls1p is not simply a contaminant in the fraction. In addition, its nucleoid association was dependent on the presence of an energy-regenerating system that is needed for optimal in organello translation under these conditions (24Poyton R.O. Bellus G. McKee E.E. Sevarino K.A. Goehring B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 36-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the rpo41Δ3 strain, a mutant in which the ATD is deleted and does not interact with Nam1p (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), Sls1p no longer associated with the nucleoid fraction (Fig. 4). These data indicate that Sls1p interacts with the ATD, either directly or in a complex with other proteins, and this interaction is necessary for the localization of Sls1p to the nucleoid. Because Sls1p is an integral membrane protein, these data also suggest that mtDNA is associated with the inner membrane during active gene expression. It is noted that Nam1p was not detected in the nucleoid fraction under these conditions (data not shown), consistent with the results of Kaufman et al.(25Kaufman B.A. Newman S.M. Hallberg R.L. Slaughter C.A. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because Sls1p overexpression suppresses the translation defect in the nam1Δ strain (Fig.1C) and partially rescues the petite phenotypes of all the ATD mutant strains (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar), we next investigated whether the same conditions would restore translation in the rpo41 ATD mutants. Perhaps unexpectedly, overexpression of Sls1p did not result in increased labeling of mtDNA-encoded proteins in any of therpo41 ATD mutant strains (data not shown). However, Western analysis of Cox1p and Cox2p revealed that overexpression of Sls1p did result in a moderate increase in steady-state levels of both mtDNA-encoded proteins in the ATD mutant strains (Fig.5). We note that the effect on Cox1p was not as dramatic as Cox2p; nonetheless, this difference was reproducible. These data indicate that Sls1p suppresses therpo41 ATD mutants by increasing the steady-state level of mtDNA-encoded proteins presumably in a manner largely independent of its effects on translation. A large body of evidence now indicates that mitochondrial translation is primarily, if not exclusively, a membrane-associated process (7Fox T.D. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 8Sanchirico M.E. Fox T.D. Mason T.L.

Genet. 1978; 164: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In yeast, this is a complex process that involves not only membrane-associated ribosomes but also mRNA-specific translational activators and numerous other proteins involved in processing and stability of mRNA that are directly or indirectly associated with the inner membrane (4Dieckmann C.L. Staples R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 145-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Fox T.D. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1130-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Our previous work (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in this area suggested that mtRNA polymerase is also intricately involved in the efficiency of translation not only directly, through synthesizing the requisite RNA species, but also via functions of the ATD in coordinating transcription with post-transcriptional events. In this report, we have elucidated a role for Sls1p in mitochondrial translation, and we provide additional new lines of evidence that support a model in which one function for the ATD of mtRNA polymerase is to nucleate a series of interactions involving Nam1p and Sls1p that are ultimately required to link mtRNA polymerase to the inner membrane to facilitate efficient mitochondrial protein synthesis. The data supporting these conclusions are discussed below. A recent key observation that led to our initial proposal that the ATD of mtRNA polymerase is involved in coupling transcription to membrane-associated events is the ability of the membrane protein Sls1p to rescue the petite phenotype of nam1Δ and ATD mutations when overexpressed (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). Because Sls1p is required for proper assembly of the respiratory chain, but not for transcription or mtDNA maintenance per se, it has been postulated to be involved in post-transcriptional steps of mitochondrial gene expression (17Rouillard J.M. Dufour M.E. Theunissen B. Mandart E. Dujardin G. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 700-708PubMed Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 1), which clearly demonstrate that our sls1Δstrain has the same intron-processing defect we reported previously fornam1Δ and ATD mutations (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and are globally deficient in labeling of mtDNA-encoded proteins in vivo, establish a function for Sls1p in mitochondrial protein synthesis. Next, we investigated whether the ability of Sls1p to rescue anam1Δ phenotype (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar) was linked to its role in mitochondrial translation identified here. Nam1p was shown by others (14Asher E.B. Groudinsky O. Dujardin G. Altamura N. Kermorgant M. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to be involved in overall mitochondrial translation efficiency, accompanied by a severe defect in translation of Cox1p. We confirmed a role for Nam1p in overall mitochondrial translation (Fig.1C) and went on to show that overexpression of Sls1p re-established a nearly wild-type mitochondrial labeling pattern in annam1Δ strain (Fig. 1C), supporting a critical role for Sls1p in mitochondrial translational efficiency. Interestingly, overexpression of Sls1p in our nam1Δ strain resulted in a Cox1p-specific translation defect (Fig. 1C) that is virtually identical to that originally reported by Asheret al. (14Asher E.B. Groudinsky O. Dujardin G. Altamura N. Kermorgant M. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that the differences observed between these two strains may involve strain-dependent differences in endogenous expression of SLS1. The elucidation that Sls1p is involved in translation in cooperation with Nam1p (Fig. 1) suggested to us that one function of the pathway of gene expression events involving Nam1p, Sls1p and the ATD that we have described previously (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is to facilitate delivery of transcripts to the translation machinery at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Two additional lines of evidence provided by this study support this conclusion. First, all mtRNA polymerase ATD mutations examined here resulted in translation-related defects, including a significant reduction in labeling of all mtDNA-encoded proteins in vivo(Fig. 2A), reduced steady-state levels of the mtDNA-encoded proteins Cox1p and Cox2p (Fig. 3A), and, with the exception of the rpo41-E119A-C121A mutation (discussed later), an increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial translation inhibitor erythromycin (Fig. 3B). That the three ATD mutations that have translation defects in all three assays (rpo41Δ2, rpo41Δ3, andrpo41-N152A/Y154A) are those that were shown previously to negatively impact Nam1p binding (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the observed defects result from disruption of the proposed RNA-handeling pathway. Second, Sls1p is found associated with nucleoids in an ATD-dependent and energy-dependent manner (Fig. 4), strongly supporting the notion that efficient mitochondrial translation is occurring when Sls1p is found in a complex with those mtRNA polymerase molecules that are bound to mtDNA and presumably actively engaged in transcription of the mitochondrial genome. Based on these data, we propose a revised model for mitochondrial gene expression involving these factors (Fig.6). In this model, Nam1p is predicted to bind to the ATD of mtRNA polymerase to facilitate the interaction of a transcriptionally active, nucleoid-associated mtRNA polymerase with Sls1p at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Once this connection is established between mtRNA polymerase and Sls1p (which may involve additional factors), translation of the mRNA is accomplished in a transcription-coupled manner. The precise functions of Nam1p and Sls1p remain to be elucidated. However, based on the recent report by Fox and colleagues (18Naithani S. Saracco S. Butler C. Fox T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 14: 324-333Crossref Google Scholar), Nam1p may facilitate interactions between the nascent mRNA and COX-specific translation activators. If this were the case, then it is tempting to speculate that, once a functionally coupled transcription/translation complex is fully established, Nam1p would dissociate in order to locate another template-bound mtRNA polymerase that has yet to be membrane-coupled. A transient nature to the Nam1p interactions is postulated based on the fact that Nam1p is not found as a nucleoid component (see Ref. 25Kaufman B.A. Newman S.M. Hallberg R.L. Slaughter C.A. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7772-7777Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar; this study, data not shown) and is localized primarily to the matrix in mitochondrial fractionation studies (30Wallis M.G. Groudinsky O. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At present we speculate that the most likely function for Sls1p in this regard is to serve as part of a membrane-anchoring point for mtRNA polymerase during active gene expression. Whereas the vast majority of data presented herein are consistent with this model, it is clear that mutations in the ATD can cause multiple defects in mitochondrial gene expression that are not as easily explained. First, although we were successful at eliminating mtDNA instability as an explanation for the observed overall translation defects seen in most of ATD mutant strains tested (Table I), therpo41-E119A-C121A is a notable exception. This mutation resulted in a relatively large defect in steady-state accumulation of Cox1p and Cox2p (Fig. 3A). In fact, its steady-state defect was comparable with that of the rpo41-N152A/Y154Astrain (Fig. 3A), despite the fact that its in vivo labeling capacity was substantially greater (Fig.2A), and it was not hypersensitive to erthyromycin (Fig.3B). This mutation also does not appear to disrupt Nam1p binding (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that therpo41-E119A-C121A defect is not due to disruption of the proposed translation-coordination function of the ATD but rather its mtDNA instability phenotype (Table I). Second, overexpression of Sls1p is unable to rescue the in vivo labeling defect in therpo41 ATD mutant strains (data not shown) but does moderately increase the steady-state level of Cox1p and Cox2p in the ATD mutants (Fig. 5), suggesting that Sls1p has a role in assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes as originally postulated by others (17Rouillard J.M. Dufour M.E. Theunissen B. Mandart E. Dujardin G. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 700-708PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate the ability to Sls1p to partially rescue the ATD mutant phenotypes (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar) is most likely through this second function and not it ability to reestablish normal membrane coupling of mtRNA polymerase through the ATD. One possibility is that overexpression of Sls1p may allow increased numbers of membrane complexes to form in the ATD mutant strains and, even though they are not “wild-type” complexes, facilitates assembly (and hence stability) of the proteins that do manage to get translated, thus partially rescuing the mutant phenotype. In the case ofnam1Δ strains, a similar scenario is envisioned where the ability of Sls1p to increase the number of membrane sites would, in principle, increase the probability that normally coupled complexes would form because the ATD is intact in these strains, thus providing an explanation for the nearly full rescue of the nam1Δphenotype by Sls1p overexpression (9Bryan A.C. Rodeheffer M.S. Wearn C.M. Shadel G.S. Genetics. 2002; 160: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). This interpretation is entirely consistent with the proposal that Nam1p functions to facilitate formation of the membrane-coupled mtRNA polymerase complex involving Sls1p (Fig. 6), but itself is not an active member of the complex once it is formed. Finally, the rpo41-R129D mutation results in only a moderate reduction in mitochondrial translation (data not shown), yet causes the most severe glycerol growth phenotype (10Rodeheffer M.S. Boone B.E. Bryan A.C. Shadel G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting that this mutation in the ATD of mtRNA polymerase can compromise additional cellular functions. In conclusion, we have elucidated important new aspects of how mitochondrial gene expression is accomplished in yeast. Our results indicate that the primary mechanism involves a complex series of interactions that ensure coordination of transcription and translation of mitochondrial transcripts at the inner mitochondrial membrane that is mediated through the ATD of mtRNA polymerase. It will be of great general importance to determine whether a similar mechanism is operating in human cells, where defects in mitochondrial gene expression can cause and exacerbate disease states and impact the aging process."
https://openalex.org/W2008209085,"Sox transcription factors play key regulatory roles throughout development, binding DNA through a consensus (A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G sequence. Although many different Sox proteins bind to this sequence, it has been observed that gene regulatory elements are commonly responsive to only a small subset of the entire family, implying that regulatory mechanisms exist to permit selective DNA binding and/or transactivation by Sox family members. To identify and explore the mechanisms modulating gene activation by Sox proteins further, we compared the function of Sox-2 and Sox-11. This led to the discovery that Sox proteins are regulated differentially at multiple levels, including transactivation, protein partnerships with Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) transcription factors, and DNA binding autoregulation. Specifically, we determined that Sox-11 activates transcription more strongly than Sox-2 and that the transactivation domain of Sox-11 is primarily responsible for this capability. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Sox-11 DNA binding domain is responsible for selective cooperation with the POU factor Brn-2. This requirement cannot be replaced by the DNA binding domain of Sox-2, indicating that the DNA binding domain of Sox proteins is critical for Sox-POU partnerships. Interestingly, we have also determined that a conserved domain of Sox-11 has the novel capability of autoinhibiting its ability to bind DNA in vitro and to activate gene expression in vivo. Our findings suggest that the autoinhibitory domain can repress promiscuous binding of Sox-11 to DNA and plays an important role in regulating the recruitment of Sox-11 to specific genes.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Sox factors are related by the homology (usually >50%) found within their high mobility group (HMG)1 DNA binding domains. Sox HMG domains have been found to bind to the consensus sequence 5′-(A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G-3′ in the minor groove of DNA (2Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1500-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). As the number of Sox proteins has grown to more than 20 members in multiple species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates, this family has been divided into seven subgroups, the members of which contain high homology within both the HMG domain and flanking regions (1Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In some cases, subgroup members have similar patterns of expression during development and perhaps redundant functions. For example, the structurally similar group B members Sox-1, -2, and -3 show overlapping expression in the fetal nervous system, and it has been suggested that they perform similar functions (3Collignon J. Sockanathan S. Hacker A. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Norris D. Rastan S. Stevanovic M. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1996; 122: 509-520PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Collignon J. Lovell-Badge R. Kondoh H. Development. 1998; 125: 2521-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the group C members Sox-4 and Sox-11 show high homology within their HMG domain and C-terminal tail, and they may also have complementary roles in the developing nervous system (5Cheung M. Abu-Elmagd M. Clevers H. Scotting P.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 79: 180-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The observation that the HMG DNA binding domains of many members of the Sox family bind a consensus sequence has prompted the question of whether there are selective mechanisms in place to recruit a specific Sox protein to a gene regulated by an HMG binding site. A review of the literature reveals that genes rely on a diverse array of mechanisms to regulate DNA binding among members of other transcription factor families, which may also apply to Sox proteins. A particularly intriguing example of DNA binding regulation has been found within multiple members of the Ets family. First characterized in Ets-1, the affinity of these proteins for DNA is tightly regulated by autoinhibitory regions flanking the DNA binding domain (6Hagman J. Grosschedl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8889-8893Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 7Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ubiquitous HMG-1 and HMG-2 proteins employ a similar regulatory strategy whereby their highly acidic C-terminal tails are capable of negatively affecting the ability of those proteins to bind DNA (8Isackson P.J. Beaudoin J. Hermodson M.A. Reeck G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 748: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Importantly, although the autoinhibitory domains of both Ets and HMG proteins repress DNA binding, they can be neutralized by post-translational modification or by interaction with partner proteins, which allows their recruitment to be exquisitely regulated in a gene-specific manner (7Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Goetz T.L. Gu T.L. Speck N.A. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell.

Although specific evidence of DNA binding autoregulation has not yet been observed in Sox proteins, it is clear that cis-regulatory elements are capable of selecting specific Sox transcription factors. Attempts to uncover the mechanisms through which Sox specificity is achieved have revealed that recruitment often requires proper interaction with other transcription factors at adjacent binding sites on the DNA. This is illustrated by one of the cis-regulatory elements that control expression of the fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4) gene in embryonal carcinoma cells. FGF-4 expression depends on a distal enhancer (13Curatola A.M. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Ma Y.G. Rosfjord E. Huebert C. Wilder P.

However, Sox-2 does not appear to be capable of substantial activation of this gene on its own, but rather requires cooperation with the POU transcription factor Oct-3 (18Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The presence of Oct-3 at a site adjacent to Sox-2 promotes cooperative DNA binding, resulting in a synergistic increase in transactivation (18Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar,19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The partnership of Sox-2 and Oct-3 is extremely specific for these two proteins because it requires stereospecific alignment and protein-protein interaction between the HMG and POU DNA binding domains when Sox-2 and Oct-3 are present at their adjacent binding sites (18Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Additionally, the role of Oct-3 cannot be fulfilled by Oct-1 for theFGF-4 enhancer, indicating that only certain Sox-POU combinations can lead to productive regulation of a particular gene (15Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Specific partnerships have also been observed among other members of the Sox and POU families. Utilizing the binding sequence found in the FGF-4 enhancer, it was determined that Sox-10 specifically partners with Oct-6, and Sox-11 cooperates optimally with the POU factors Brn-1 and Brn-2 (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 21Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have led to the hypothesis that a Sox-POU combinatorial code may exist as a mechanism of transcriptional regulation (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although significant progress has been made in understanding the differential function of Sox proteins, both on their own and in combination with other factors, little is known about the mechanisms involved. To elucidate the mechanisms through which Sox proteins may be regulated, we initiated a functional comparison of Sox-2 and Sox-11 using promoter/reporter gene constructs that contain HMG and POU binding sites. Through this study, we determined that Sox-2 performs very differently than Sox-11, being a much weaker transactivator, while at the same time binding more strongly to DNA in vitro. To understand the mechanisms involved in the functional differences between Sox-2 and Sox-11, we addressed three questions. First, what role does each of the domains of Sox-2 and Sox-11 play in differential gene activation? Second, how specific are Sox-2 and Sox-11 partnerships with POU proteins, and which regions of Sox-2 and Sox-11 are important for Sox-POU partnerships? Third, which domain(s) are critical for the decreased DNA binding of Sox-11 compared with Sox-2? We have addressed these questions using Sox deletion mutants and Sox-2/11 chimeric proteins created by interchanging the N terminus, HMG DNA binding domain, or C terminus of both proteins. These studies led to the discovery that the C-terminal transactivation domains play the primary role in the differential capability of Sox-2 and Sox-11 to transactivate. Additionally, we determined that Sox-11, but not Sox-2, can cooperate with Brn-2 and that the Sox-11/Brn-2-specific cooperation requires both adjacent binding of the two factors to DNA and the HMG domain of Sox-11. Therefore, this study further supports the hypothesis that a Sox-POU combinatorial code exists (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) and suggests that this interaction code is dependent on the HMG domain of the Sox protein involved. Finally, we also identified a novel domain within a conserved region of Sox-11 which is capable of negatively regulating both its ability to bind DNA in vitro and activate gene expressionin vivo. Together, this work significantly enhances our understanding of the mechanisms that influence selective recruitment of Sox proteins through partner specificity and DNA binding autoregulation. Constructs pCATSO3, pCMVSox-2F1–180, pCMVSox-2, pCMVOct-3, pCMVOct-1, and CMV-β-gal have been described previously (19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The promoter/reporter construct pCATDC3 was constructed similarly to pCATSO3 as follows. Complementary oligonucleotides (synthesized by the Eppley Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facility) containing two sets of the HMG site from the DC5 enhancer site and the POU binding sites (in boldface) from the FGF-4 enhancer region and BamHI sites at both ends (5′-GATCCTCATTGTTGTGATGCTAATGGCTCATTGTTGTGATGCTAATGGAG-3′) were annealed and ligated to generate multimers. Differences in the DC5 and FGF-4 HMG binding sequence are underlined. These multimers were then ligated into a BglII site upstream from the SV40 promoter of the pCAT vector (Promega) to generate pCATDC3, which contains a total of six tandem copies of the HMG and POU sites. Similarly, pCATS4 contains a total of four tandem copies of the FGF-4 HMG site and was made using identical primers as pCATSO3, with the exception of a scrambled POU site. The upper primer is as follows with the HMG and scrambled POU sites in bold: (5′-GATCTCTTTGTTTGGCGGATCATGGCTCTTTGTTTGGCGGATCATGGA-3′). The plasmids pCMVSox-11 and pCMVBrn-2 were gifts from Michael Wegner (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Sox-11F was constructed using the primers FLAGSox-11 (5′-CGTGCTGGTACCGCCACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGATATGGTGCAGCAGGCCGAGAGC-3′) and Sox-11/395 (5′-GCTGGATCCGACCGCCACGACTGCCTCCCG-3′) to amplify the coding region from CMV5-Sox-11. This PCR incorporated the FLAG epitope sequence, preceded by a Kozak sequence and a KpnI site, onto the 5′-end of the coding region of Sox-11 and aBamHI site at the 3′-end. TheKpnI/BamHI sites were then digested and the Sox-11F sequence ligated into the KpnI/BamHI sites of the CMV5 expression vector. The Sox-2F expression plasmid referred to in this report was constructed by removing the Sox-2F sequence from the pCEP4 vector (19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using theKpnI/BamHI sites and religating the Sox-2F sequence into the same sites present in CMV5. Site-directed mutagenesis or deletions were carried out using a modification of the QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) method. All amino acid numbers are based on the wild-type Met being defined as 1, not the Met included with the FLAG tag. Briefly, two primers, complementary to the sequence flanking the targeted region and to each other, were used in PCR amplification of the entire plasmid, thus modifying the indicated template. Unless otherwise noted, each of the primers identified herein represents the sense strand of a perfectly complementary pair of primers used during PCR. To begin the construction of the Sox-2/11 chimeras, unique restriction sites were incorporated at the N-terminal and C-terminal flanks of the HMG box of both the Sox-2F and Sox-11F plasmid. Sites were chosen in such a way that little alteration would be made to the wild-type coding sequence. Mutagenesis to include a NheI site was performed with either the sox2mut1 (5′-GGCAACCAGAAGAATGCTAGCCCGGAACGTGTCAAGAGGCCC-3′) or sox11mut1 (5′-CCGGACTGGTGCAAGACGGCTAGCGGCCACATCAAACG-3′) primer pair. The NheI alteration added a Ser following Ala-39 of Sox-2F but did not affect the coding sequence of Sox-11F. The products of these PCR reactions were then used in a second round of mutagenesis to include a NotI site using either the sox2mut2 (5′-GTACACGCTTCCCGCGGCCGCTTTGCTCGCCCCCGG-3′) or sox11mut2 (5′-GCCAAGCCCAGCGCGGCCGCACAGAGCCCGGACAAGAGC-3′) primer pair. This replaced Gly-131 and Gly-132 of Sox-2F as well as Ala-134 and Gly-135 of Sox-11F with the amino acids Ala-Ala-Ala. This cloning resulted in Sox-2F double mutant and Sox-11F double mutant, each of which contained a KpnI and BamHI site at their extreme 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, as well as an NheI andNotI site at the 5′- and 3′- respective ends of their HMG boxes. These sites made it possible to use standard restriction digests and ligations to interchange either the N-terminal, HMG, or C-terminal region of Sox-2F with the corresponding region of Sox-11F, resulting in the creation of the chimeric plasmids Sox-11-2-2F, -11-11-2F, -2-11-2F, -2-11-11F, -2-2-11F, and -11-2-11F. To create Sox-11FΔTAD, the primer pair sox11Δtad (5′-CTCTACTACAGCTTCAAGTGAGCGGCCGCAAACATCACCAAGCAGCAG-3′) was used to incorporate a stop codon following Lys-282 of Sox-11F. The Sox-11F and Sox-11FΔTAD expression constructs were then used as the templates to create Sox-11FΔAR and Sox-11FΔARΔTAD, respectively, using the primer pairs of sox11Δar (5′-GCCAAGGTGGTCTTCCTGGACGCGCAGCAGCAACCCCCTCAG-3′) to delete amino acids 190–223. To facilitate in vitro translation of the various Sox proteins, the coding regions from each of the above CMV5-derived vectors were cloned into theKpnI/BamHI sites of pCRScript (Stratagene), downstream from the T7 promoter. The identity of all plasmids modified by PCR-based mutagenesis as well as pCATS4 and pCATDC3 was verified by sequence analysis at the Eppley Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facility. HeLa cells were maintained and transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed in triplicate with representative experiments shown. Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified using Qiagen tip-500 columns. HeLa cells were transfected with 5 μg of the relevant plasmids as described above, and extracts were prepared 2 days post-transfection. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared as described previously (19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated nuclei from ∼6–7 × 106 cells were lysed in 100 μl of nuclear extraction reagent supplemented with various protease and phosphatase inhibitors (22Scholtz B. Lamb K. Rosfjord E. Kingsley M. Rizzino A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When preparing Sox-11F, Sox-11FΔTAD, and Sox-11FΔARΔTAD for the nuclear extracts used in the electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) shown in Fig. 6c, calpain inhibitor I was added to the growth media 4 h before lysis and was included in the extraction buffer to minimize degradation caused by potential proteasome activity. Extracts were stored at −80 °C. Sox proteins produced through in vitro transcription and translation were made using the T7 Quick Coupled Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate (Promega) transcription/translation system. Western blotting was performed using 10 μl of in vitrotranslated lysate or nuclear lysate from 5 × 105transfected HeLa cells as described (19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). Proteins were detected using the enhanced chemifluorescence (ECF) kit (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned on a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitation was performed using the ImageQuant 5.0 analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). Western blots were performed in duplicate or triplicate with representative blots shown. Gel mobility shift analysis was based on the method of Fried and Crothers as modified by this laboratory (23Kelly D. Scholtz B. Orten D.J. Hinrichs S.H. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 40: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Complementary oligodeoxynucleotide probes were annealed for each probe or competitor, and the resulting double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow fill-in reaction of the single-stranded regions at the end of each double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probe (lowercase bases). The wild-type Sox probe (hmg1) contained a single HMG binding site (bold), which was based on the sequence present in the FGF-4 enhancer, whereas in the mutant Sox probe (HMGmut) this sequence is scrambled (underlined). The sequence of hmg1 (sense strand) is 5′-tagaAAACTCTTTGTTTGCCATGTCG-3′, and the sequence of HMGmut (sense strand) is 5′-tagaAAATTAGTCGAATGCCATGTC-3′. The hmg2 probe was created to mimic the pCATSO3 reporter construct in that it contains multiple HMG binding sites separated by 14bp. The sequence of hmg2 (sense strand) is 5′-tagaTCTTTGTTTGGCGGATCATGGCTCTTTGTTTGGCGGATCATGGA-3′. For gel mobility shift and competition assays, 1–2 μl of nuclear lysate or 3–4 μl of in vitro translated protein was incubated (at room temperature) for 30 min in a 20-μl volume containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 50 mmNaCl, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 5 μg of p(dGdC)p(dGdC), and 20,000 cpm of labeled probe (final concentration of 0.5–1 nm) with or without competitor. The exact volume of nuclear lysate used in each assay was determined by first normalizing for differences in Sox protein concentration based on Western blot analysis. In gel mobility supershift assays, reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibody before addition of the probe, after which the reaction was continued at room temperature for 30 min. Immediately after the completion of binding, the reactions were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing 4% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel for 4 h at 150V. The gels were then dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 1–7 days before scanning on a Storm PhosphorImager. Quantitation of band intensities was performed using the ImageQuant 5.0 analysis software. Experiments using hmg2 (see Fig. 6, b and c) were also performed with hmg1 with the same trend in binding intensity between the Sox-11 mutants. All aspects of each mobility shift assay were repeated and similar results were obtained. The initial goal of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms permitting selective recruitment and activation by specific Sox proteins at a particular gene. To address this issue, we compared the function of Sox-2 with the related transcription factor Sox-11. These proteins were selected for several reasons. First, the gross domain structure of each has been studied, revealing the location of the DNA binding domain and transactivation domain of each protein (4Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Collignon J. Lovell-Badge R. Kondoh H. Development. 1998; 125: 2521-2532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Second, to understand the function of a transcription factor in vivo, it is best studied in a model system using a known binding sequence from a regulated gene. The binding site for Sox-2 within the enhancer of the FGF-4 gene has been determined and provides an excellent model system (15Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 16Johnson L.R. Lamb K.A. Gao Q. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus far, target genes of Sox-11 have not been identified; however, the FGF-4 enhancer sequence has also been utilized in a partial characterization of Sox-11 (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), indicating that it may provide a relevant system in which to study this transcription factor. Finally, the expression pattern of Sox-2 and Sox-11 within the developing nervous system overlaps, leading to the postulate that there are cell types in which some genes may be regulated differentially depending on whether Sox-2 or Sox-11 binds to a cis-regulatory element (24Uwanogho D. Rex M. Cartwright E.J. Pearl G. Healy C. Scotting P.J. Sharpe P.T. Mech. Dev. 1995; 49: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). To compare Sox-2 and Sox-11 functionally, we assayed their ability to activate the pCATSO3 promoter/reporter gene construct in HeLa cells, which do not contain any known Sox-like activity (15Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The pCATSO3 plasmid contains six tandem repeats of a 24-bp region of theFGF-4 enhancer upstream from an SV40 promoter driving the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. A promoter/reporter construct containing multiple HMG binding sites was necessary for these studies because gene activation by either Sox-2 or Sox-11 via a single HMG site did not rise above the basal expression of the promoter/reporter gene construct (data not shown). The 24-bp region contains both the HMG binding site and POU binding site found in theFGF-4 enhancer. The pCATSO3 construct was employed to perform a functional comparison of Sox-2 and Sox-11 because it has been used previously to identify the transactivation domain of Sox-2 and to identify p300 as a potential coactivator of Sox-2 activity (19Nowling T. Johnson L.R. Wiebe M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3810-3818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a very similar construct, also containing the HMG/POU enhancer sequence of the FGF-4 gene, was utilized in the initial characterization of Sox-11 (20Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Enderich J. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16050-16057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For the functional comparison of Sox-2 and Sox-11, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pCATSO3 and increasing concentrations of expression plasmid encoding either Sox-2F or Sox-11F, each tagged at their N terminus with a FLAG epitope. This revealed that Sox-11F is a much more potent activator of the pCATSO3 promoter/reporter gene construct than Sox-2F (Fig.1a). At all concentrations tested, transfection of Sox-11F led to 40–75-fold more reporter gene activity than Sox-2F. This experiment was also repeated with Sox-2 and Sox-11 expression constructs without FLAG epitopes, and no differences were observed between the ability of the tagged and untagged proteins to transactivate (data not shown). Additionally, to verify that the functional differences observed between Sox-2F and Sox-11F were not caused by variations in protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed on nuclear extracts of transfected HeLa cells using the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. This analysis revealed that there was little difference between Sox-2F and Sox-11F expression in the nucleus (Fig.1b). In fact, in multiple experiments, we found that Sox-11F expression was consistently lower than Sox-2F. Thus, the difference in transactivation capability between Sox-2F and Sox-11F (Fig.1a) may be an underestimate. Our observation that Sox-11F was such a potent activator on its own led us to question whether an endogenous POU factor could be binding at the adjacent site and assisting in Sox-11F-mediated activation. This is an important question because Sox-2 requires the partner Oct-3 for act"

Although the effects of hypoxia have been studied intensely, less attention has been given to other extracellular parameters such as pH. Thus, the present study investigates the consequences of acidic pH on VEGF binding and activity in endothelial cell cultures. We found that the binding of VEGF165 and VEGF121 to endothelial cells increased as the extracellular pH was decreased from 7.5 to 5.5. Binding of VEGF165 and VEGF121 to endothelial extracellular matrix was also increased at acidic pH. These effects were, in part, a reflection of increased heparin binding, because VEGF165 and VEGF121 showed increased retention on heparin-Sepharose at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.5. Consistent with these findings, soluble heparin competed for VEGF binding to endothelial cells under acidic conditions. However, at neutral pH (7.5) low concentrations of heparin (0.1–1.0 μg/ml) potentiated VEGF binding. Extracellular pH also regulated VEGF activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2). VEGF165 and VEGF121 activation of Erk1/2 at pH 7.5 peaked after 5 min, whereas at pH 6.5 the peak was shifted to 10 min. At pH 5.5, neither VEGF isoform was able to activate Erk1/2, suggesting that the increased VEGF bound to the cells at low pH was sequestered in a stored state. Therefore, extracellular pH might play an important role in regulating VEGF interactions with cells and the extracellular matrix, which can modulate VEGF activity.

Angiogenesis is the process by which endothelial cells sprout and migrate from pre-existing blood vessels to form new capillaries (1Risau W.

Karkkainen M. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar). Several isoforms of VEGF exist that are formed by alternative splicing. At least six VEGF proteins have been discovered: 121, 145, 165, 183, 189, and 206 (3Robinson C.J. Stringer S.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 853-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF165, VEGF121, and VEGF189 are the most abundantly expressed isoforms. These isoforms vary in their ability to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). VEGF121 is the only isoform that is not able to bind to HSPGs directly. It lacks exon 7, which encodes for the heparin-binding domain (3Robinson C.J. Stringer S.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 853-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining isoforms vary in their affinity for HSPGs. VEGF189 and VEGF206 have been found sequestered in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and have a higher affinity for HSPGs than VEGF165, which is able to interact with HSPGs but has not been found to be sequestered in the ECM (4Park J.E. Keller G.A. Ferrara N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). HSPGs are expressed in most tissues and are major components of cell surfaces and extracellular matrices (5Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev.

HSPGs can participate in physiological processes such as cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and lipoprotein uptake (5Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 729-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar, 6Wight T.N. Kinsella M.G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Curr. Opin.

HSPGs consist of a core protein that has generally 1–4 covalently linked heparan sulfate chains consisting of repeating disaccharide units containing N-acetylglucosamine and uronic acid, which can vary in sulfation and epimerization (8Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The heparan sulfate (HS) chains can bind various types of ligands such as growth factors and ECM molecules (9Sasisekharan R. Ernst S. Venkataraman G. Angiogenesis. 1997; 1: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The negatively charged sulfate groups of HSPGs participate in interactions with basic regions of growth factors. HSPGs can act as suppressors or activators of growth factor activity. Cell surface HSPGs may localize growth factors near their receptors or act as coreceptors for growth factors, whereas ECM HSPGs may act as sites for growth factor storage, sequestering them from cell surface receptors (10Turnbull J. Powell A. Guimond S. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 11Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin.

For example, basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) has been shown to bind to HSPGs with high affinity, and these interactions potentiate FGF-2 binding to FGF receptors (13Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 14Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

In addition, it has been shown that VEGF binding to VEGF receptors is dependent on HSPGs (16Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tessler S. Rockwell P. Hicklin D. Cohen T. Levi B.Z. Witte L. Lemischka I.R. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12456-12461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, VEGF binding to HSPGs restores VEGF activity after oxidative damage (18Gengrinovitch S. Berman B. David G. Witte L. Neufeld G. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10816-10822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It has also been found that low concentrations of heparin potentiate VEGF binding to endothelial cells, whereas high concentrations of heparin inhibit VEGF binding (16Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSPGs have been identified to be up-regulated at active sites of angiogenesis (19Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Sharma B. Handler M. Eichstetter I. Whitelock J.M. Nugent M.A. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1599-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, the HSPG glypican-1 has been shown to be expressed in pancreatic cancer cells and the surrounding fibroblasts where it is believed to play a role in tumor growth and progression (21Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Kumbasar A. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lander A.D. Korc M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, HSPGs likely play important roles in regulating VEGF activity during angiogenesis. Active angiogenesis has been found to play important roles in many pathological and physiological processes, such as tumor progression, diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, and wound healing (22Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7218) Google Scholar). Environments surrounding tumors and wounds have been shown to be hypoxic in nature (23Tannock I.F. Br. J. Radiol. 1972; 45: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It has been well established that VEGF and its receptors are up-regulated in response to hypoxia (24Shweiki D. Neeman M. Itin A. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 768-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 25Brogi E. Schatteman G. Wu T. Kim E.A. Varticovski L. Keyt B. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 26Gerber H.P. Condorelli F. Park J. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

Due to the hypoxia, tumor cells undergo high rates of anaerobic glycolysis leading to the production of lactate (28Yamagata M. Hasuda K. Stamato T. Tannock I.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These conditions contribute to the acidity of the extracellular environment surrounding tumor cells. In fact, the extracellular space within malignant tissues has been measured to be as low as pH 5.8 (29Wike-Hooley J.L. Haveman J. Reinhold H.S. Radiother. Oncol. 1984; 2: 343-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 30Wike-Hooley J.L. Van der Zee J. van Rhoon G.C. Van den Berg A.P. Reinhold H.S. Eur. J. Cancer Clin. Oncol. 1984; 20: 619-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is possible that the acidic extracellular pH would impact the activity of angiogenic factors within tumors. Indeed, it was found that the rate of VEGF-stimulated microvessel growth is increased at acidic pH (6.9) in an endothelial cell culture model system (31Burbridge M.F. West D.C. Atassi G. Tucker G.C. Angiogenesis. 1999; 3: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reduced extracellular pH also inhibits apoptotic death in endothelial cells (32D'Arcangelo D. Facchiano F. Barlucchi L.M. Melillo G. Illi B. Testolin L. Gaetano C. Capogrossi M.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, local changes in the extracellular environment, such as acidification, might participate in directing angiogenesis to poorly vascularized sites under both normal and pathological conditions. While changes in extracellular pH would certainly impact cell function, there has been little attention focused on the role of pH in regulating angiogenesis or more specifically VEGF activity. Thus, it is possible that decreased local pH could contribute to recruiting new blood vessels to tumors and other poorly vascularized regions. This type of process might involve direct alterations in VEGF interactions and activity in endothelial cells. To begin to elucidate how local pH changes might affect VEGF, we investigated the impact of pH on VEGF binding and activity in vascular endothelial cells. We found that, as pH is decreased, VEGF165 and VEGF121 binding to cell surface and extracellular matrix sites increased. We also found that VEGF165 and VEGF121 binding to heparin increased as pH was decreased. We further found that VEGF stimulation of Erk1/2 was modulated by extracellular pH. Thus, changes in extracellular pH might dramatically impact VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. Materials—Human recombinant VEGF165 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Human recombinant VEGF121 was from Reliatech (Braunschweig, Germany). Heparinase III from Flavobacterium heparinum was a generous gift from Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (Montreal, Canada). Heparin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sodium orthovanadate, and secondary antibody raised against rabbits and conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), F-12 Ham's medium, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine, and 1 m HEPES buffer were from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Fetal bovine serum and calf serum were from HyClone (Logan, UT). Primary antibody for phospho-Erk1/2 was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Primary antibody for total Erk1/2 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). ECL detection kit, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, and Sepharose CL-6B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Upp-sala, Sweden). Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were a gift from Dr. Elazer Edelman at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, MA). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells were from Dr. Jeffrey Esko at University of Alabama Birmingham (Birmingham, AL). NIH-3T3 cells (Parent cells) and NIH-3T3 cells expressing VEGFR-2 (VEGFR-2 cells) generated by retroviral infection were obtained from Dr. Nader Rahimi at Boston University (Boston, MA). BAECs were maintained in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 5 mm glutamine, 0.1 unit/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F-12 Ham's supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm glutamine, 100 unit/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. For experiments, BAECs were used at confluence from passages 8 to 16. For experiments, NIH-3T3 cells were used at subconfluency, to prevent cell lifting from the substratum, from passages 4 to 15. CHO-K1 cells were used at confluence. Cell number was determined with a Coulter Counter (Miami, FL). Radiolabeling of VEGF—125I-VEGF165 and125I-VEGF121 were prepared by using a modified Bolton-Hunter procedure (33Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Lyophilized VEGF was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5 (final concentration of 285 μg/ml). An aliquot (30 μl) was added to dry Bolton-Hunter reagent (1 mCi, 0.6 μmol) and incubated on ice for 2.5 h. The reaction was quenched by adding 200 μl of 0.2 m glycine and incubating on ice for 45 min. Twenty microliters of 10 mg/ml BSA in PBS and 250 μl of 1 mg/ml BSA in PBS were added. The sample was applied to a PD-10 column equilibrated and run in PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA to separate unincorporated radiolabel from the radiolabeled VEGF. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography revealed125I-VEGF165 and125I-VEGF121 at ∼45 and ∼35 kDa, respectively. After radiolabeling,125I-VEGF165 retained its ability to bind to a heparin-Sepharose column and was eluted with high concentrations of salt. Also, both125I-VEGF165 and125I-VEGF121 were able to stimulate activation of Erk1/2 on BAECs, indicating that the radiolabeling procedure did not adversely disrupt VEGF structure. 125I-VEGF Binding—Equilibrium binding assays were carried out with confluent cell cultures as previously described (15Fannon M. Forsten K.E. Nugent M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). BAECs were seeded at 75,000 cells/well in 24-well dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). CHO-K1 cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/well in 24-well dishes. NIH-3T3 cells and VEGFR-2 cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/well in 24-well dishes. Cells were grown for 20–26 h. Binding assays conducted at various pHs were carried out in binding buffer consisting of 25 mm HEPES adjusted to the indicated pH (7.5–5.5) in DMEM (without bicarbonate) containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were washed once with ice-cold binding buffer. Binding buffer was added to cells and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min to inhibit endocytosis and binding site turnover.125I-VEGF165 (0.12 nm) or125I-VEGF121 (0.14 nm) was added to cells. Cells were incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C. After the binding period, unbound125I-VEGF was removed by washing the cells three times with ice-cold binding buffer. To dissociate VEGF interactions involving HSPGs, cells were exposed to a high salt buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 m NaCl) for ∼5 s and then rinsed with PBS. Cells were then solubilized with 1 n NaOH to account for the remaining interactions that are presumably VEGF-bound to receptor. It has been shown that FGF-2 can be dissociated from HSPGs on cell surfaces by using a 2 m NaCl wash (34Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It has been established that VEGF elutes from a heparin-Sepharose column with 0.69 m NaCl (35Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we have established that 0.75 mm NaCl is enough to sufficiently remove VEGF from the first binding fraction. Moreover, increasing the ionic strength up to 2 m NaCl did not remove additional VEGF. Therefore, we conclude that the first wash contains VEGF that is able to interact with HSPGs through ionic interactions and that the remaining VEGF-receptor interactions are observed by solubilizing the cells in 1 n NaOH. 125I-VEGF binding was quantified by counting in a Cobra Auto-Gamma 5005 γ-counter (Packard Instruments, Meridian, CT). Nonspecific binding was measured using a 500-fold excess of unlabeled VEGF, and the calculated value was subtracted from each sample. Replicate cells were maintained under the same conditions as sample cells in the absence of125I-VEGF and were used to measure final experimental pH. It was found that the pH of the various buffers did not change during the course of the binding experiments. Also, cell numbers were determined after the binding incubation and did not vary between different pHs. All binding data was normalized to cell number, however, it is important to note that we observed some experiment to experiment variability in the absolute amount of VEGF bound per cell. This variability was likely the result of differences in various preparations of 125I-VEGF, cell passage number, and the extent to which the cells were confluent in each individual experiment. In addition, toxicity experiments were conducted in cells maintained in the various pH buffers for up to 4 h at 37 °C. Cell number and viability (trypan blue exclusion) did not vary over the 4-h incubation across the pH range of 7.5–5.5. To determine the effects of removing heparan sulfate proteoglycans, cells were treated with 0.5 unit/ml heparinase III for 1 h at 37 °C prior to conducting the binding studies. Heparinase and digestion products were removed by washing two times with binding buffer. To determine the effects of heparin, various concentrations were added to cells prior to the addition of125I-VEGF. All conditions were conducted in triplicate and each experiment was repeated at least three separate times. Preparation of ECM-coated Dishes—ECM-coated dishes were prepared as previously described (33Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 36Vlodavsky I. Folkman J. Sullivan R. Fridman R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Sasse J. Klagsbrun M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). BAECs were plated at 25,000 cells per well in 24-well dishes. Cells were grown for 3 days and reached confluence. The cells were lysed by incubating the cultures for 3 min at 23 °C in a solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm NH4OH in phosphate-buffered saline, leaving the ECM associated with the culture surface. Subsequently the ECM was washed four times with PBS. The ECM remained intact and was characterized to contain HSPGs by35S labeling of HS chains (data not shown). Heparin-Sepharose Columns—Heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography was used to assess VEGF165 and VEGF121 binding to heparin directly (35Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vandlen R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar).125I-VEGF165 (0.01 μm),125I-VEGF121 (0.011 μm), or125I-EGF (0.05 μm) was incubated in column buffers (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 or 5.5) for 15 min. Columns (1 ml packed with heparin-Sepharose CL-6B) were equilibrated with the column buffers corresponding to those that the growth factor (GF) was incubated by passing 3 ml of buffer through the columns. Individual columns were prepared for each sample condition. After the 15-min incubation, the125I-GF samples were applied to the columns, and the column was washed with the same buffer (1 ml) in which it was equilibrated. Flow-through was collected. The125I-GF was then eluted with either the same buffer in which it was incubated or the other pH buffer. This eluant was collected and labeled pH wash. Fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to remove any free125I from125I-GF. Samples were quantitated in a γ counter. The fraction of125I-GF bound to the column was quantified by counting the entire column in a γ counter. Activation of Erk1/2—BAECs were plated at 20,000 cells per well in 6-well dishes. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum for 24 h, to make the cells quiescent. Prior to stimulation with VEGF, cells were washed with binding buffer at pH 7.5, 6.5, or 5.5 and remained in the binding buffer for 90 min. VEGF165 (0.6 nm) or VEGF121 (0.7 nm) was added to the cells at various time points. Binding buffer with VEGF was removed, and cells were extracted in 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were spun at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected. BCA protein assays were conducted to determine the total protein content. An equal amount of protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with anti-phospho-Erk1/2 or anti-Erk1/2. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and ECL reagent. Autoradiograms were analyzed using Scion Image for Windows (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) to determine relative band intensities. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S to evaluate the total protein loaded. pH did not vary over time at 37 °C. Experiments were repeated for NIH-3T3 cells plated at 50,000 cells per well in 6-well dishes. VEGF165and VEGF121Binding to Cell Surfaces Are Altered by pH—At sites of angiogenesis, such as tumors and wounds, the environment is rather hypoxic. Hypoxia increases expression of VEGF thereby promoting increased rates of migration and proliferation of endothelial cells. Hypoxic environments also lead to decreases in extracellular pH. Although the intracellular signaling events occurring under hypoxic conditions in response to VEGF have been of major focus, there has been little attention to how acidity affects VEGF outside of cells. Therefore, to investigate the role of extracellular pH on VEGF165 and VEGF121 interactions with cell surfaces, binding assays were conducted with confluent BAECs at various pHs ranging from pH 7.5 to 5.5 (Fig. 1). It was found that, as pH decreased, VEGF165 and VEGF121 binding to BAECs increased dramatically. HSPG-mediated VEGF165 binding at pH 5.5 was ∼2.5-fold greater than that at pH 7.5, whereas VEGF121 binding increased 20-fold. At pH 7.5, only ∼40% of the total bound VEGF165 bound through the HSPGs component, where at pH 5.5, greater than 50% of the total VEGF165 bound occurred through the HSPGs component. For VEGF121, there appeared to be a more dramatic specificity for binding to the HSPGs component at the lower pHs. At pH 7.5 ∼40% of total bound VEGF121 occurred through the HSPGs component, whereas at pH 5.5 ∼80% bound through the HSPGs component. Similar binding experiments were conducted with CHO-K1 cells and NIH-3T3 (Parent) cells, which are cell types that do not express endogenous VEGF receptors, and VEGFR-2 cells, which are NIH-3T3 cells engineered to express VEGFR-2. A similar increase in binding was observed at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.5 for VEGF165 and VEGF121 with all three cell types (Fig. 2). These results indicate that the increased VEGF binding at acidic pH does not depend on the expression of VEGF receptors.Fig. 2125I-VEGF165 and125I-VEGF121 binding to CHO-K1 cells, NIH-3T3 cells, and VEGFR-2 expressing cells at pH 7.5 or 5.5. Binding assays were conducted on confluent CHO-K1 cells (A) or subconfluent Parent cells (gray bars) and VEGFR-2 cells (black bars) (B). Cells were incubated at pH 7.5 or 5.5 at 4 °C for 2.5 h. Binding assays were performed with125I-VEGF165 or125I-VEGF121. Samples were quantitated in a γ counter. Samples were normalized to cell number. Representative data are presented as the mean of triplicate determinations ± S.E. Two-tailed paired t tests were conducted to evaluate the binding differences observed at pH 5.5 and 7.5. The increased binding observed for VEGF121 and VEGF165 at pH 5.5 compared with pH 7.5 on CHO, NIH-3T3, and VEGFR-2 cells was found to be significant (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if HSPGs play a role in the pH-induced changes in cell surface binding, endothelial cells were treated with heparinase III to degrade heparan sulfate chains prior to the addition of VEGF. We found that heparinase III treatment to BAECs reduced VEGF165 and VEGF121 binding under neutral (pH 7.5) and acidic (pH 5.5) conditions by ∼60 and ∼30%, respectively (Table I). Thus, HSPGs are involved in VEGF165 and VEGF121 interactions with endothelial cell surfaces at neutral and acidic pH.Table IHeparinase III pretreatment to BAEC- and endothelial cell-deposited ECM reduced 125I-VEGF165 and 125I-VEGF121 bindingVEGF boundDecreasedNativeHeparinase III-treatedfmole/105cells%BAECSpH 7.5 VEGF1650.267 ± 0.0070.103 ± 0.02961.4pH 5.5 VEGF1651.242 ± 0.0720.776 ± 0.04337.6pH 7.5 VEGF1210.037 ± 0.0050.013 ± 0.00764.9pH 5.5 VEGF1210.384 ± 0.0180.254 ± 0.01033.9Extracellular matrixpH 5.5 VEGF1650.534 ± 0.0120.332 ± 0.02437.8pH 5.5 VEGF1212.194 ± 0.1671.458 ± 0.55533.6 Open table in a new tab Changes in Extracellular pH Alter VEGF165and VEGF121Interactions with Extracellular Matrices—HSPGs are a major component of extracellular matrices. Because the previous results suggest that the acidic pH-mediated binding of VEGF may be independent of VEGF receptors, we wanted to determine if binding of VEGF to extracellular matrix would be affected by changes in pH. To investigate the role of pH on VEGF interactions within the extracellular matrix, VEGF binding to BAEC-deposited extracellular matrices was characterized. BAECs were grown for 3 days until confluent. Cell layers were extracted leaving BAEC-deposited extracellular matrix-coated dishes. Extracellular matrices were labeled with 35SO4 to determine if HSPGs are a component of these matrices. Matrices were treated with heparinase III after labeling, and it was found that35S radioactivity decreased by 66% after heparinase III treatment, confirming that HSPGs were a component of the matrices.

In the present study we examined the effect of COX2 activity on organic osmolyte accumulation in renal medulla and in cultured mouse renal medullary interstitial cells (MMICs) and its role in facilitating cell survival. Hypertonicity increased accumulation of the organic osmolytes inositol, sorbitol, and betaine in cultured mouse medullary interstitial cells. Pretreatment of MMICs with a COX2-specific inhibitor (SC58236, 10 μmol/liter) dramatically reduced osmolyte accumulation (by 79 ± 9, 57 ± 12, and 96 ± 10% for inositol, sorbitol, and betaine respectively, p < 0.05). Similarly, 24 h of dehydration increased inner medullary inositol, sorbitol, and betaine concentrations in vivo by 85 ± 10, 197 ± 28, and 190 ± 24 pmol/μg of protein, respectively, but this increase was also blunted (by 100 ± 5, 66 ± 15, and 81 ± 9% for inositol, sorbitol, and betaine, respectively, p < 0.05) by pretreatment with an oral COX2 inhibitor. Dehydrated COX2-/- mice also exhibited an impressive defect in sorbitol accumulation (88 ± 9% less than wild type, p < 0.05) after dehydration. COX2 inhibition (COX2 inhibitor-treated or COX2-/- MMICs) dramatically reduced the expression of organic osmolyte uptake mechanisms including betaine (BGT1) and sodium-myo-inositol transporter and aldose reductase mRNA expression under hypertonic conditions. Importantly, preincubation of COX2 inhibitor-treated MMICs with organic osmolytes restored their ability to survive hypertonic stress. In conclusion, osmolyte accumulation in the kidney inner medulla is dependent on COX2 activity, and providing exogenous osmolytes reverses COX2-induced cell death. These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis of analgesic nephropathy. The mechanism by which COX2 inhibition decreases renal cell survival is poorly understood. In the present study we examined the effect of COX2 activity on organic osmolyte accumulation in renal medulla and in cultured mouse renal medullary interstitial cells (MMICs) and its role in facilitating cell survival. Hypertonicity increased accumulation of the organic osmolytes inositol, sorbitol, and betaine in cultured mouse medullary interstitial cells. Pretreatment of MMICs with a COX2-specific inhibitor (SC58236, 10 μmol/liter) dramatically reduced osmolyte accumulation (by 79 ± 9, 57 ± 12, and 96 ± 10% for inositol, sorbitol, and betaine respectively, p < 0.05). Similarly, 24 h of dehydration increased inner medullary inositol, sorbitol, and betaine concentrations in vivo by 85 ± 10, 197 ± 28, and 190 ± 24 pmol/μg of protein, respectively, but this increase was also blunted (by 100 ± 5, 66 ± 15, and 81 ± 9% for inositol, sorbitol, and betaine, respectively, p < 0.05) by pretreatment with an oral COX2 inhibitor. Dehydrated COX2-/- mice also exhibited an impressive defect in sorbitol accumulation (88 ± 9% less than wild type, p < 0.05) after dehydration. COX2 inhibition (COX2 inhibitor-treated or COX2-/- MMICs) dramatically reduced the expression of organic osmolyte uptake mechanisms including betaine (BGT1) and sodium-myo-inositol transporter and aldose reductase mRNA expression under hypertonic conditions. Importantly, preincubation of COX2 inhibitor-treated MMICs with organic osmolytes restored their ability to survive hypertonic stress. In conclusion, osmolyte accumulation in the kidney inner medulla is dependent on COX2 activity, and providing exogenous osmolytes reverses COX2-induced cell death. These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis of analgesic nephropathy. The maintenance of intracellular solute concentrations and cell volume is a prerequisite for optimal cell function. Changes in extracellular tonicity typically result in corresponding changes in intracellular solute concentration that allow cells to regain their normal size (1Macknight A.D.C. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1988; 11: 114-141PubMed Google Scholar). In renomedullary cells, osmotic equilibrium with elevated extracellular NaCl concentrations is achieved primarily by intracellular accumulation of small organic solutes (“organic osmolytes”) (2Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 3Beck F.X. Dörge A. Thurau K. Guder W.G. Beyenbach K.W. Cell Volume Regulation. Karger, Basel1990: 132-158Google Scholar). In contrast to inorganic electrolytes, organic osmolytes do not severely impair cell function even at high concentrations and are thus considered “compatible osmolytes” (3Beck F.X. Dörge A. Thurau K. Guder W.G. Beyenbach K.W. Cell Volume Regulation. Karger, Basel1990: 132-158Google Scholar). Reduced accumulation of compatible osmolytes may cause decreased cell viability in the renal medulla (4Weinhold P.A. Thanukrishna A. Anderson L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1963; 112: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) as well as inhibition of growth and, ultimately, cell death (5Yancey P.H. Burg M.B. Bagnasco S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C156-C163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prostanoids comprise a diverse family of biologically active lipids derived from the enzymatic metabolism of arachidonic acid by prostaglandin G2/H2 synthase (cyclo-oxygenase (COX)). 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclo-oxygenase; MIC, medullary interstitial cells; MMIC, mouse medullary interstitial cells; SMIT, sodium myo-inositol transporter; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; WT, wild type; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Although prostanoid synthesis occurs in all cells and tissues, the kidney is a particularly rich source for prostanoids. Cyclo-oxygenase is a key enzyme regulating the formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, and two isoforms of COX have been identified, a constitutively expressed isoform (COX1) and an inducible isoform (COX2) (6DeWitt D.

These two proteins are encoded by different genes, which are ∼60% homologous and are both inhibited by non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (9Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24059-24063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these similarities, the expression patterns of COX1 and COX2 genes are quite different. COX1 is constitutively expressed in several tissues and is thought to participate in housekeeping functions, including the maintenance of gastric epithelial integrity. COX2 expression can be dramatically induced in inflammatory cells by cytokines as well as by mitogenic factors (10Hershman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). COX2 is expressed in several tissues, including those of the kidney, lung, and brain (11Crofford L.J. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 49: 15-19Google Scholar, 12Guan Y. Chang M. Cho W. Zhang Y. Redha R. Davis L. Chang S. DuBois R.N. Hao C. Breyer M.D. Am. J.

In the kidney, COX2 is expressed in the cortical thick ascending limb and MICs, whereas COX1 mRNA appears to be mainly expressed in the collecting duct (12Guan Y. Chang M. Cho W. Zhang Y. Redha R.

Blackwell T. Kömhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) in vivo and in vitro (17Yang T. Schnermann J.B. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggest that COX2, a major target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug action, might serve an osmoprotective function in MICs, a site of early injury in analgesic nephropathy (18Molland E.A. Kidney Int. 1978; 13: 5-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This study explored the possible relationship between COX2 activity and organic osmolyte-dependent adaptation of medullary interstitial cells to hyperosmotic stress. Mouse medullary interstitial cells were prepared as described previously (19Dunn M.J. Staley R.S. Harrison M. Prostaglandins. 1976; 12: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). C57BL mice, obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), were sacrificed, both kidneys were rapidly removed under sterile conditions, and the inner medullary regions were excised, minced, and suspended in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The suspension was then injected intracutaneously under sterile conditions at two or three different locations of the ventral abdominal wall of an isogeneic recipient mouse. After 3–4 days the recipient animal was sacrificed, and the firm yellow nodules were removed aseptically. The nodules were minced under sterile conditions, and cells were then trypsinized in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 15 min, washed, and pelleted at 300 × g. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml each penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma). Cells were plated in 75-ml flasks and grown until confluent. Mouse medullary interstitial cells (MMICs) were studied after three or four passages and for experiments moved to DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum. MMIC showed characteristic features of inner medulla fibroblasts, including cytoplasmic Oil Red O staining (20Burger-Kentischer A. Müller E. März J. Fraek M.L. Thurau K. Beck F.X. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Grupp C. Müller G.A. Exp. Nephrol. 1999; 7: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). COX2-deficient mouse primary medullary interstitial cell cultures were generated from COX2-/- animals as described above. COX2-/- mice were genotyped (C57BL6/129) as described previously and are an established colony in our laboratory (22Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). In Vitro—The accumulation of organic osmolytes in cultured MMICs was quantified using an isocratic HPLC system as described previously (23Moeckel G.W. Lien Y.H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F512-F515PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to confluency and then adapted to hyperosmolar conditions in 100 mosmol/liter increments (exposure to each increment for 24 h, final osmolarity of 600 mosmol/liter, produced with NaCl in DMEM and 2% fetal calf serum). MMICs were kept at 600 mosmol/liter for 24 h before harvest. In some experiments SC58236 (16Hao C. Yull F. Blackwell T. Kömhoff M. Davis L.S. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), a COX2-specific inhibitor (Monsanto Searle, St. Louis, MO), was added to all incubation media at a concentration of 10 μmol/liter. At the end of the incubation period cells were harvested, washed with hyperosmotic medium (600 mosmol/liter), and pelleted using 5 min of centrifugation at 200 × g. Osmolytes were quantitated in the neutralized perchloric acid extracts of the pellets as described previously (24Moeckel G.W. Lai L.W. Guder W.G. Kwon H.M. Lien Y.H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F100-F106PubMed Google Scholar). In Vivo—To examine the effect of COX2 inhibition on mouse renal medullary organic osmolyte content, C57BL mice were treated with (n = 6) or without (n = 6) the COX2-specific inhibitor SC58236. COX2 inhibitor was diluted to a final concentration of 0.6 mg/liter in H2O with 0.01% Tween and 0.2% polyethylene glycol 200 as solvents and given to mice via drinking water 3–4 days before a 24-h dehydration (25Kömhoff M. Wang J.L. Cheng H.F. Langenbach R. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. Breyer M.D. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 414-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inner medullary osmolyte concentrations were quantified in kidneys of C57BL WT (+SC58236) and COX2-/- mice after a 24-h dehydration. Neutralized perchloric acid extracts from renal inner medullary tissue sections were prepared as described previously in detail (26Moeckel G.W. Lien Y.H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F94-F99PubMed Google Scholar), and cellular organic osmolyte concentrations were quantified by an isocratic HPLC system. Intracellular osmolyte concentrations in both in vivo and in vitro studies were normalized to tissue protein concentrations in each of the samples. Protein concentrations were determined using the method described by Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). Mouse medullary interstitial cells were grown to confluency in 96-well plates (Costar 3598, Corning Inc., Corning, NY), stepwise adapted to a final medium osmolarity of 600 mosmol/liter using NaCl, and then incubated for 60 min with different concentrations of unlabeled and 3H-labeled inositol (1000-125 μmol/liter unlabeled inositol mixed with 1 nmol of [3H]inositol). [3H]Inositol was purchased from ICN, Boston, MA, with a specific activity of 10–20 Ci/mmol/liter. Isotonic controls were kept at 295 mosmol/liter and then incubated for 60 min with identical inositol solutions as in hypertonic experiments. Selected hyperosmotic and isotonic groups were incubated with 10 μmol/liter SC58236 for 120 min before inositol incubation. Cell count and viability studies were performed before and immediately after SC58236 incubation. At the end of the inositol incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold isotonic and hypertonic DMEM, respectively, and lysed in 1% SDS. [3H]Inositol counts were measured using a Beckman scintillation counter. Total RNA was extracted from mouse renal inner medulla using the guanidinium thiocyanate extraction method (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). RNA yield and purity were estimated spectrophotometrically by determining absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. The integrity of the RNA was checked on a nondenaturing agarose gel. Mouse medullary RNA was reverse transcribed using the Ready To Go T-primed first-strand kit (Amersham Bio-sciences). The betaine transporter (BGT1) cDNA probe was generated using reverse transcriptase-PCR as described previously (24Moeckel G.W. Lai L.W. Guder W.G. Kwon H.M. Lien Y.H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F100-F106PubMed Google Scholar). A 2-μl aliquot of the reverse transcriptase reaction was used as a template for PCR reaction to obtain a betaine-γ-aminobutyric acid transporter probe by PCR (94 °C denaturation, 60 °C annealing, 72 °C extension, 35 cycles) using specific primers (sense, 5′-CGG GGC GGA TCG TTT CTA T-3′; antisense, 5′-GTG GCC CTG ACC TAA GTT CCT G-3′, NCI GenBank™ accession number ACU26342) as described in Ref. 20Burger-Kentischer A. Müller E. März J. Fraek M.L. Thurau K. Beck F.X. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. Probe analysis on 2% agarose gel showed a product length of 471 bp. The aldose reductase probe was generated using reverse transcriptase-PCR (94 °C denaturation, 53 °C annealing, 70 °C extension, 35 cycles) using specific primers (sense, 5′-GCA TGG TGA AAG GGG CCT GCC-3′; antisense, 5′-GCT GGT GTC ACA GAC TTG G-3′, NCI GenBank™ accession number NM-012498) After PCR, an aliquot was separated on a 2% agarose gel showing a product length of 545 bp. The cDNA probe for sodium myo-inositol transporter (SMIT) was a generous gift from Dr. Moo Kwon, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was amplified by PCR as described previously (20Burger-Kentischer A. Müller E. März J. Fraek M.L. Thurau K. Beck F.X. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All probes were 32P-labeled using the Prime-It RII random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Northern blot assays were carried out as described previously (24Moeckel G.W. Lai L.W. Guder W.G. Kwon H.M. Lien Y.H.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F100-F106PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the COX2 inhibitor-mediated effect on cell viability, MMICs were grown to confluency in 96-well plates and either adapted to 600 mosmol/liter as described under “Experimental Protocols” or kept under isotonic conditions (295 mosmol/liter) with and without 10 μmol/liter SC58236 in the incubation medium. In further experiments we evaluated COX2-mediated cell death in cultured MMICs under hypertonic stress with and without preincubation with individual osmolytes. MMICs were grown either under increasing medium osmolarities up to a final osmolarity of 600 mosmol/liter with and without 20 μmol/liter SC58236 or preincubated for 24 h at mildly elevated hyperosmolarity (430 mosmol/liter) with medium containing 1.0 mmol/liter of individual osmolytes (inositol, sorbitol, or betaine), before the addition of COX2 inhibitor and raising of the osmolarity of the medium to 600 mosmol/liter. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay as described previously (29Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μl of MTT solution (1 mg/ml) were added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were dissolved in 100 μl of acid isopropyl alcohol solution under agitation, and absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a microtiter plate reader (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Percent viability was calculated as (OD of drug-treated sample/OD of control sample) × 100. For in situ detection of apoptotic cells, TUNEL assay was performed using ApopTag fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY). MMICs were adapted either to increasing medium osmolarities up to a final osmolarity of 600 mosmol/liter with and without 20 μmol/liter SC58236 or preincubated for 24 h with mildly elevated hyperosmolarity (430 mosmol/liter) with medium containing 1.0 mmol/liter of the individual osmolyte (inositol, sorbitol, or betaine), before the addition of COX2 inhibitor and the raising of medium osmolarity. At the end of the incubation period, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, on silanized glass slides, incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 1 h, and immersed in stop/wash buffer for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and counterstained with 1.0 μg/ml propidium iodide. Fluorescence-positive cells were counted using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Axioscope, Germany). The percentage of apoptotic cells was estimated as (fluorescein-positive/propidium iodide-positive) × 100. For detection of apoptotic DNA cleavage, DNA fragmentation assay was performed using Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI). MMICs were either adapted to a final osmolarity of 600 mosmol/liter with and without 20 μmol/liter SC58236 or preincubated for 24 h with mildly elevated hyperosmolarity (430 mosmol/liter) with medium containing 0.5 or 1.0 mmol/liter of an osmolyte mixture (inositol, sorbitol, and betaine together), before the addition of COX2 inhibitor and raising of the osmolarity of the medium to 600 mosmol/liter. DNA fragmentation was visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Cells were prepared in a fashion identical to the TUNEL protocol described under “TUNEL Assay.” Caspase-3 activity was detected using the Apo-ONE™ homogenous caspase-3 assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). At the end of the experiment incubation period, 100 μl of homogenous caspase-3 reagent was added to each well, and plates were shaken at 300 rpm for 30 s. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 min, and then fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Negative controls worked appropriately. Results are presented as mean ± S.D. of 4–6 replicates. Differences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05, using analysis of variance and Bonferroni t tests. Accumulation of Organic Osmolytes by Medullary Interstitial Cells Is COX2-dependent—Primary cultures of MMICs were more than 99% pure for interstitial cells with the presence of characteristic abundant cytoplasmatic lipid droplets (Fig. 1). MMICs accumulated the organic osmolytes inositol, sorbitol, and betaine in response to hyperosmotic conditions. Compared with isotonic conditions (295 mosmol/liter), the intracellular accumulation of inositol, sorbitol, and betaine in MMICs increased by 234 ± 19, 74 ± 11, and 134 ± 26 pmol/μg of protein, respectively, after culture in 600 mosmol/liter. In contrast, when MMICs were cultured in the presence of a COX2-specific inhibitor (SC58236, 10 μmol/liter) (Table I), accumulation of inositol, sorbitol, and betaine after hypertonicity was dramatically reduced by 79 ± 9% for inositol, 57 ± 12% for sorbitol, and 96 ± 10% for betaine (Fig. 2).Table IEffect of COX2 inhibition on hypertonicity-dependent osmolyte accumulationOsmolyteΔOOHTΔOOHT + SC%ΔInositol234 ± 1949 ± 6-79 ± 9Sorbitol74 ± 1132 ± 4-57 ± 12Betaine134 ± 265 ± 0.7-96 ± 10 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Intracellular accumulation of organic osmolytes inositol, sorbitol, and betaine in mouse medullary interstitial cells with and without COX2-specific inhibitor (SC58236, 10 μmol/liter) in the incubation medium.

Inner medullary concentrations of inositol, sorbitol, and betaine increased by 85 ± 10, 197 ± 28, and 190 ± 24 pmol/μg of protein, respectively, in WT animals subjected to a 24-h dehydration (Fig. 3). This increase was markedly diminished by a COX2 inhibitor (SC58236, 600 μg/liter administered in the drinking water × 4 days), with complete inhibition (100 ± 5%) of inositol, a 66 ± 15% reduction for sorbitol, and a 81 ± 9% reduction for betaine accumulation. Similarly dehydrated COX2-/- mice showed an even more dramatic reduction in medullary sorbitol accumulation (173 ± 30 pmol/μg of protein; 88 ± 9%) as compared with SC58236-treated WT mice (Fig. 3). Also inositol and betaine concentrations were further reduced by 235 ± 35 and 267 ± 15 pmol/μg of protein, respectively, in COX2-/- animals. Effect of COX2-specific Inhibitor on Osmolyte Gene mRNA Expression—To explore the underlying mechanisms of the above observations, we investigated the effect of SC58236 on betaine (BGT1) and SMIT transporter mRNA levels in MMICs. Messenger RNA levels for both the betaine transporter BGT1 and the inositol transporter SMIT were diminished by 44 ± 11 and 23 ± 7%, respectively, after 48 h at 600 mosmol/liter with COX2 inhibitor (Fig. 4). Furthermore, cultured MMICs from COX2-/- mice also exhibited dramatically reduced medullary sorbitol accumulation and aldose reductase mRNA levels (27 ± 3% at 400 and 63 ± 3% at 500 mosmol/liter medium tonicity, respectively, p < 0.05, see Fig. 5). Interestingly, under isotonic conditions cultured COX2-/- MMICs showed similar aldose reductase messenger RNA levels as compared with MMICs from WT mice.Fig. 5Aldose reductase mRNA levels in primary MMIC cultures from WT and COX2-/- animals, grown under isotonic and different hypertonic conditions. Values are mean ± S.D. of n = 4. *, p < 0.05 compared with cells grown under isotonic conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To exclude the possibility that SC58236 directly blocked osmotic osmolyte transporters, we investigated the effect of SC58236 on [3H]inositol uptake in hyperosmotically treated MMICs, compared with isotonic controls. Hypertonicity (600 mosmol/liter) produced a 4-fold increase in [3H]inositol uptake as compared with isotonic controls (7778 ± 1400 versus 1288 ± 558 cpm/100 μg of protein, respectively) that was independent of SC58236 treatment (10 μM, 2 h) (data not shown). Furthermore, preincubation with SC58236 for 2 h did not significantly affect cell count or viability under isotonic or hypertonic conditions. Medullary Interstitial Cell Survival under Hypertonic Stress Is Osmolyte-dependent—To evaluate the role of organic osmolytes in determining the increased MMIC fragility after hyperosmotic stress, we facilitated cellular osmolyte uptake by adding betaine, inositol, and sorbitol to the extracellular medium. When adapted to 600 mosmol/liter culture media by stepwise increases in media tonicity, MMICs tolerated hyperosmotic conditions well without a significant decrease in viability compared with isotonic controls (Fig. 6). Even in these gradually adapted MMICs, COX2 inhibition (SC58236, 10 μmol/liter) significantly reduced cell viability (30 ± 14%, p < 0.05). Importantly, preincubation with the organic osmolytes betaine and sorbitol dramatically increased MMIC survival in COX2-inhibited cells (65 ± 12% improvement in betaine-treated and 27 ± 6% in sorbitol-treated MMICs, p < 0.05) compared with SC-treated cells without osmolytes. Inositol did not significantly increase cell viability in SC58236-treated MMICs (Fig. 6). Osmolytes Decrease MMIC Apoptosis and Caspase Activity after Hypertonic Stress—To explore the mechanism of osmoprotection we evaluated apoptotic MMICs using an in situ TUNEL assay. Under isotonic conditions only 1.9 ± 0.1% of MMICs were apoptotic. Stepwise adaptation to 600 mosmol/liter medium tonicity produced a 6-fold increase in TUNEL-positive cell numbers (12 ± 1.0%, respectively). However, in MMICs treated with the COX2-specific inhibitor (SC58236, 10 μM) a 25-fold increase in fluorescence-positive apoptotic cells was observed at 600 mosmol/liter culture conditions (50 ± 2.7%, p < 0.05) compared with isotonic controls (Fig. 7A). Preincubation with a mixture of organic osmolytes (sorbitol, betaine, and inositol, all 1 mmol/liter) dramatically decreased apoptosis by 77 ± 18% in SC58236-treated MMICs cultured at 600 mosmol/liter. As shown in Fig. 7B, caspase-3 activity is enhanced in an osmolarity-dependent fashion in cultured MMICs. Caspase-3 activity increased 4-fold when medium tonicity was increased to 600 mosmol/liter, and preincubation with both betaine and sorbitol (1 mM/liter) significantly reduced caspase activity (by 41 ± 10 and 59 ± 12%, respectively, p < 0.05) in MMICs cultured at 600 mosmol/liter. This protective effect was maintained in MMICs treated with the COX2-specific inhibitor (SC58236, 10 μM) and subjected to hypertonic stress as shown in Fig. 8, A and B. Fig. 8A shows nuclear fluorescein positivity in MMICs cultured at either isotonic (295 mosmol/liter) or hypertonic (500 mosmol/liter) medium conditions. Treatment with SC58236 (10 μM) without osmolytes significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells (TDT) and decreased overall cell numbers (PI). This observation was dramatically ameliorated by preincubation with a mixture of organic osmolytes (inositol, sorbitol, and betaine, 1 mmol/liter each). Fig. 8B depicts apoptotic DNA laddering under hyperosmotic stress (lane B, 600 mosmol/liter), which is enhanced by the addition of SC58236 and reversed by increasing concentrations of organic osmolytes. Effect of Organic Osmolytes on COX2 Inhibitor-mediated Decrease in MMIC Viability—Previous studies (30Hao C. Kömhoff M. Guan Y. Redha R. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F352-F359PubMed Google Scholar) found that the COX2-specific inhibitor SC58236 reduces COX2 activity and COX2 products in renal medullary interstitial cells. The present study shows that inhibition of COX2 activity is associated with decreased hypertonicity-induced osmolyte accumulation in MMICs (Fig. 2). COX2 inhibition most dramatically inhibited betaine accumulation (96 ± 10%), whereas inositol and sorbitol accumulation were less affected by treatment with SC58236. Decreased accumulation of intracellular osmolyte concentrations was also associated with diminished mRNA levels of genes coding for osmolyte transporters and aldose reductase (Figs. 5 and 6). The reductions in betaine and myo-inositol transporter mRNA levels seen with the COX2 inhibitor were proportional to the reduction of cellular concentrations of these compounds. In fact, BGT1 showed a nearly 2-fold greater reduction in mRNA levels compared with SMIT (Fig. 4). SC58236 did not have any direct effect on [3H]inositol uptake in MMIC, suggesting that COX2 activity exerts its effect on osmolyte transporter genes possibly at the transcriptional level, rather than on the cytoplasmic membrane osmolyte transporters. The mechanism of the particular sensitivity of BGT1 to COX2 inhibition might therefore be because of transcriptional regulation, but this remains to be elucidated. In vivo the effect of COX2 inhibition either with SC58236 or COX2 gene disruption was associated with a more pronounced impairment of osmolyte accumulation than in cultured MMICs (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, as seen in cultured interstitial cells, medullary concentrations of betaine and inositol also showed the greatest sensitivity to COX2 inhibition, with inositol levels in COX2 inhibitor-treated or COX2-/- dehydrated mice being below even those of control animals (Fig. 3). Because aldose reductase mRNA levels diminish after increased tonicity in cultured COX2-/- MMICs, the existence of a down-regulatory factor that becomes fully active in the absence of COX2 could possibly explain these observations. Elucidation of these regulatory mechanisms are under current investigation. When MMICs were slowly adapted to medium osmolarities of 600 mosmol/liter (100 mosmol/liter increments/24 h), cell survival was equal to isotonic controls (Fig. 6). However, MMICs were quite sensitive to abrupt increases in medium tonicity of more than 200 mosmol/liter/24 h, which were poorly tolerated (data not shown). This time-dependent adaptation is consistent with insufficient time to transcribe and translate genes encoding for osmolyte transporters and enzymes. We therefore tested the effect of COX2 inhibitors on cell survival only in adapted MMICs. SC58236 reduced MMIC survival by 30% at 600 mosmol/liter, even when adequate time to adapt was provided. Preincubation with 1 mmol/liter betaine or sorbitol rescued MMICs and returned survival rates back to normal levels. Betaine showed the greatest potential to prevent MMIC death, similar to its protective capacity in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells exposed to hypertonic stress (31Horio M. Ito A. Matsuoka Y. Mriyama T. Orita Y. Takenaka M. Imai E. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2001; 16: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was a major mechanism contributing to cell demise in MMICs exposed to hyperosmotic stress, as shown by TUNEL stain and DNA laddering (Fig. 8, A and B). In contrast, provision of exogenous organic osmolytes largely prevented apoptosis in COX2 inhibitor-treated MMICs after hypertonic stress. Similarly, in cultured cells tonicity-dependent activation of caspase-3 activity was reduced by betaine and sorbitol but not inositol (Fig. 7B). These findings suggest that the inability to adequately accumulate organic osmolytes significantly contributes to COX2 inhibitor-mediated action to decrease MMIC survival after hypertonic stress. Furthermore, the results of our studies argue against a direct toxic effect induced by the COX2-specific inhibitor per se. COX2-dependent Osmolyte Accumulation in MMIC and Mouse Inner Medulla—The accumulation of organic osmolytes in response to exposure of hypertonic medium has been described previously for rat kidney papillary interstitial cells (20Burger-Kentischer A.

Similar to this study, our results in mouse medullary interstitial cells show that betaine and inositol are the predominant osmolytes accumulated at 600 mosmol/liter medium tonicity, with a lower increase in sorbitol. Burger-Kentischer et al. (20Burger-Kentischer A. Müller E. März J. Fraek M.L. Thurau K. Beck F.X. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) also detected low levels of glycerophosphorylcholine accumulation, an observation that we could not confirm. This might be because of lesser amounts of cell protein in our experiments, leaving glycerophosphorylcholine concentrations below detection levels or a particular species difference. Interestingly, the present studies showed a different pattern of osmolyte accumulation in the in vivo setting in which sorbitol accumulation predominated as compared with the in vitro setting in which betaine and inositol predominated. Because inner medullary whole tissue sections contain many additional cell types (i.e. collecting duct cells), this discrepancy could be because of a larger relative increase in sorbitol accumulation in papillary-collecting duct cells as compared with interstitial cells, as shown previously (20Burger-Kentischer A. Müller E. März J. Fraek M.L. Thurau K. Beck F.X. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 1417-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the present studies demonstrate that accumulation of organic osmolytes in kidney medullary cells exposed to hypertonic stress is dependent on COX2 activity. The diminished ability of MMICs to tolerate hypertonic stress after COX2 inhibition can be reversed by providing exogenous organic osmolytes to these cells. To our knowledge this is the first study to link organic osmolyte accumulation to COX2 activity, which provides a possible molecular mechanism contributing to medullary interstitial cell injury in patients with analgesic nephropathy.

https://openalex.org/W2074341051,"The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein plays a central role in early stages of DNA double strand break (DSB) detection and controls cellular responses to this damage. Although hypersensitive to ionizing radiation-induced clonogenic lethality, ataxia telangiectasia cells are paradoxically deficient in their ability to undergo ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis. This contradiction illustrates the complexity of the central role of ATM in DNA damage response and the need for further understanding. Certain hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) compounds are implicated as occupational respiratory carcinogens at doses that are both genotoxic and cytotoxic. Cr(VI) induces a broad spectrum of DNA damage, but Cr(VI)-induced DSBs have not been reported. Here, we examined the role of ATM in the cellular response to Cr(VI) and found that Cr(VI) activates ATM. We also show that physiological targets of ATM, p53 Ser-15 and Chk2 Thr-68, were phosphorylated by Cr(VI) exposure in an ATM-dependent fashion. We found that ATM−/− cells were markedly resistant to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis but considerably more sensitive to Cr(VI)-induced clonogenic lethality than wild type cells, indicating that resistance to Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis did not confer a selective survival advantage. However, analysis of long term growth arrest revealed a striking difference: ATM−/− cells were markedly less able to recover from Cr(VI)-induced growth arrest. This indicates that terminal growth arrest is the fate of these apoptosis-resistant cells. In summary, ATM is involved in cellular response to a complex genotoxin that may not directly induce DSBs. Our data suggest that ATM is a major signal initiator for genotoxin-induced apoptosis but, paradoxically, also contributes to maintenance of cell survival by facilitating recovery/escape from terminal growth arrest. The results also strongly suggest that terminal growth arrest is not merely an extended or even irreversible form of checkpoint arrest, but instead an independent and unique cell fate pathway."

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Most prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation of an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPC),1 denoted PrPSc, which is the major component of infectious prions (2Prusiner S.B. Science. 1982; 216: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar). The formation of PrPSc from PrPC is accompanied by profound structural and biochemical changes. PrPC, rich in α-helical regions, is converted into a highly β-sheeted protein partially resistant to proteolytic digestion, PrPSc (3Prusiner S.B. Scott M.R. Dearmond S.J. Cohen F.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 337-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Chemical analysis of the purified protein demonstrates that PrPSc, like PrPC, possesses a COOH-terminal GPI anchor (4Stahl N. Borchelt D.R. Hsiao K. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Unlike PrPC, PrPSc is not releasable by PIPLC from brain membranes or from the surface of scrapie infected N2a cells (5Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

Stowring L.E. DeArmond S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar).

Interestingly, PrP mutations that have additional copies of the octapeptide repeats induced neurodegeneration in transgenic mice (14Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1339-1351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it could be hypothesized that prion diseases are linked to an alteration of copper metabolism that impacts the activity of copper enzymes and/or the response of cells to oxidative stress. Previously, we showed that neuronal cells infected with prions were more susceptible to oxidative stress through an alteration of physiological anti-oxidative cellular mechanisms (15Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A. Arlotto M. Casanova D. Riondel J. Favier A. Lehmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, we show that a fraction of PrP in infected cells was not readily released from the plasma membrane by PIPLC, a feature that may revealed the formation of misfolded PrP. Pefabloc and proteinase K were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum (FCS) was from BioWhittaker. All other reagents are from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibody P45–66 raised against synthetic peptide encompassing mouse PrP residues 45–66 has been described previously (32Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J.

SAF 60, 69, and 70, raised against the peptide sequence 142–160 of hamster PrP, were produced in the laboratory of J. Grassi (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France). A mixture of the three antibodies was used to enhance the detection of PrPSc. Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Generation of GTI cells infected with the Chandler strain (GT1Chl) and cured with Congo red have been reported earlier (23Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS, 5% horse serum, and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin). Cells were cultured in 35-mm Petri dishes. Culture medium was replaced by 2 ml of fresh complete medium containing 0.1 μg of 64Cu/ml (2 μCi/ml) (CIS Biointernational, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; specific activity: 20 mCi/mg) to evaluate copper binding. Cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The radioactive medium was removed after 0, 8, 11, 20, 27, and 30 h. Cells were rinsed twice with 2 ml of diluted Puck's saline A solution (Invitrogen) and harvested. Each dish was then rinsed with 1 ml of Puck's saline A solution. The final 2 ml obtained for each dish were counted for 2 min using a Packard Cobra III monowell γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Data were analyzed using a “self-made” computer half-life calculation program to obtain results as μCi of 64Cu incorporated or retained per mg of protein. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (LB, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing different protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 mm EDTA). After a low speed centrifugation (8,000 × g for 4 min) to remove the debris, the lysates were centrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 30 min in the TLA 100.4 rotor of a Beckman Optima TL ultracentrifuge to separate detergent-soluble and -insoluble protein. Fractions were then treated with N-glycosidase F (0.01 units/ml) for 16 h at 37 °C prior to Western blot analysis. For protease resistance, cell lysates were spun as described above, and then each fraction was treated with 16 μg of proteinase K per mg of total protein for 30 min at 37 °C, and digestion was stopped by the addition of Pefabloc (1 mm) for 5 min on ice. The different fractions were Western blotted as described below. Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in LB plus protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 4 min) and when indicated were eventually treated with N-glycosidase F. Samples were loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. PrP was detected by using the antibodies indicated above. For quantitation, films were analyzed using Sigma Scan Image Analysis Software. In a recent work, we demonstrated, using 64Cu, that binding of copper to the outer of the plasma cell membrane is related to the level of PrPC expression in an inducible cell line (9Rachidi W. Vilette D. Guiraud P. Arlotto M. Riondel J. Laude H. Lehmann S. Favier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 9064-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that PrP was not directly involved in the delivery of copper inside of the cell but served as a sink for copper and bound metal ions as part of the acquisition of its active conformation and/or its physiological function. Here, we investigated the influence of prion generation on copper binding using a similar paradigm, i.e. the study of the uptake of physiological concentration of 64Cu by cultured cells. This was performed using the hypothalamic cell line GT1, which was eventually infected with the Chandler strain (GT1Chl). As a control cell line, the GT1Chl treated with Congo red (GT1Chl-CR) was used, since this treatment allows for a cessation of PrPC conversion and removal of PrPSc (15Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A. Arlotto M. Casanova D. Riondel J. Favier A. Lehmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It was noteworthy that all these lines expressed a similar level of PrPC, while, as expected, only the GT1Chlaccumulated the protease-resistant PrP isoform, PrPSc (Fig.1A). The latter molecule could easily be detected in the cultures after deglycosylation even in absence of proteinase K digestion (Fig. 1B, lane 2). To demonstrate that most PrPSc was cleaved in GT1Chl cells as in ScN2a (16Caughey B. Race R.E. Ernst D. Buchmeier M.J. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 175-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Taraboulos A. Raeber A.J. Borchelt D.R. Serban D. Prusiner S.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), soluble (S) and insoluble (I) PrP molecules were separated by ultracentrifugation and revealed by Western blot after deglycosylation (Fig. 1C, PK−). More than 90% of the insoluble PrP was actually cleaved and corresponded to PrPScmolecules as confirmed by proteinase K digestion (Fig. 1C,PK+). Binding of a small concentration of 64Cu (1.6 μm) to the different cell lines was monitored by measuring, after different time points, the amount of radioactivity remaining associated with the cells (Fig.2A, see “Material and Methods”). A significant difference between infected and control cell lines was apparent 10 h after the beginning of the experiment. Following the incubation with 64Cu, the initial uptake of the metal ion was likely to be related to classical transport system such as CTR1 (18Horn N. Tumer Z. J. Trace Elem. Exp. Med. 1999; 12: 297-313Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In a previous work, we showed that the presence of PrP did not influence copper uptake in this early phase. Subsequently, incorporation of 64Cu was found to be proportional to the level of PrP expression by the cells (9Rachidi W. Vilette D. Guiraud P. Arlotto M. Riondel J. Laude H. Lehmann S. Favier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 9064-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This relates to the synthesis of new PrP molecules that incorporate metal ions and/or to the exchange of metal ions between PrP and other copper-binding molecules. Recently, it has been shown that octapeptide domains of PrPC have a copper-reducing ability (19Opazo C. Barria M.I. Ruiz F.H. Inestrosa N.C. Biometals. 2003; 16: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The interaction of PrPC with copper could be necessary to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) on the plasma cell membrane and then presenting Cu(I) to the classical copper transport CTR1. We observed here that after 24 h, copper binding was significantly diminished in infected cells which accumulated high levels of cleaved PrPSc (Fig. 2A). It is likely that PrPSc, which had lost its octapeptide region known to bind metal ions, would not by itself modify the amount of copper associated with the cells. This is also in agreement with several studies in animals and in vitro showing that this isoform does not bind copper and might be associated with other metal ions such as manganese or zinc (20Brown D.R. Hafiz F. Glasssmith L.L. Wong B.S. Jones I.M. Clive C. Haswell S.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Wong B.S. Chen S.G. Colucci M. Xie Z. Pan T. Liu T. Li R.

Virol. 2001; 75: 7872-7874Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is puzzling that infected cells, while they have a normal amount of full-length PrP, did not bind copper in expected amounts. In a previous work, we were able to demonstrate that the PIPLC release of GPI anchor proteins, including PrP, reduced the amount of64Cu associated with cell cultures, suggesting with other data that PrP was a major copper-binding GPI-anchored protein (9Rachidi W. Vilette D. Guiraud P. Arlotto M. Riondel J. Laude H. Lehmann S. Favier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 9064-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To confirm these results in GT1 cells, cell cultures were incubated 30 h with 64Cu, treated with PIPLC, and the amount of64Cu still bound to the cells was measured (Fig.2B). As expected, PIPLC treatment significantly decreased64Cu binding in GT1 and GT1Chl-CR and released radioactive copper in the media (data not shown). After PIPLC treatment of infected GT1Chl cells, copper binding was not modified (Fig. 2B). In fact, the level remained low but was still largely within the limits of detection of the method used. This indicated that copper content in infected cells was not affected by the release of GPI-anchored proteins, including PrP. However, we then checked by Western blot whether PIPLC effectively released PrP from the cell membranes and unexpectedly; it appeared that significantly less PrP was released from GT1Chl than from control GT1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). As reported on the bar graph, we also confirmed this result in control and scrapie infected N2a cells available in the laboratory (23Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Importantly, the PrP molecules detected in these experiments could not correspond to PrPSc which was NH2-terminally cleaved in our cultures and not recognized by P45–66 (Fig. 1,B and C). The decrease of the PIPLC release of PrPC in infected cells may be the consequence of a modification of the cellular environment of the molecule as suggested before (24Viret J. Dormont D. Molle D. Court L. Leterrier F. Cathala F. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Gajdusek D.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 101: 830-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is possible that PrPSc could be responsible for this modification of the cellular environment of PrPCand could interact/co-aggregate with PrPC and renders PIPLC cleavage inefficient. This result is reminiscent of that obtained with mutated PrP molecules, which just after synthesis are resistant to PIPLC cleavage (25Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For mutated PrPs, this property has been explained by the fact that their GPI anchors become physically inaccessible to the phospholipase, as part of their conversion to PrPSc-like molecules (26Narwa R. Harris D.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8770-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Importantly, this PIPLC resistance acquired in the endoplasmic reticulum was the earliest biochemical change detected in mutated PrPs until the acquisition of their PrPSc-like properties (25Daude N. Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11604-11612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similarly, it is possible that the PrP “resistant” to PIPLC in infected cells represents an intermediate in the formation of PrPSc and corresponds to a misfolded PrP generated in the endoplasmic reticulum, as a recent report suggests that this organelle plays an important role in the generation of PrPSc (27Beranger F. Mange A. Goud B. Lehmann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38972-38977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A speculative scenario would be that prion generation leads to the formation of a misfolded PrP that is unable to bind copper and could not fulfil the physiological function of PrP. The fact that prion infection has a dramatic effect on 64Cu binding by the cells is important, since copper, as other transition metals, is believed to play an important role in the neuropathology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (28Sayre L.M. Perry G. Atwood C.S. Smith M.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2000; 46: 731-741PubMed Google Scholar). By its ability to readily adopt two ionic states Cu(I) and Cu(II), copper is required for the catalytic activity of a number of essential enzymes such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) or cytochrome c oxidase, the majority of which catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions. Free copper is also a toxic ion that generates a hydroxyl radical, a highly reactive oxygen species involved in causing direct damage to nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, as well as apoptosis (29Butterfield D.A. Howard B.J. LaFontaine M.A. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both deficiency and excess in copper lead to a number of pathological disorders such as Menkes syndrome or Wilson's disease (30Mercer J.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), which illustrates its physiological importance and duality in the central nervous system. The modification of copper metabolism following prion infection is also reminiscent of previous works showing that prion infection strongly affected the copper content in synaptosomes (31Herms J. Tings T. Gall S. Madlung A. Giese A. Siebert H. Schurmann P. Windl O. Brose N. Kretzschmar H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8866-8875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, metal ions could play an essential role in the pathogenesis of prion diseases and represent important targets for future therapeutic approaches.

https://openalex.org/W2081884876,"RepA protein is the DNA replication initiator of the Pseudomonas plasmid pPS10. RepA dimers bind to an inversely repeated operator sequence inrepA promoter, thus repressing its own synthesis, whereas monomers bind to four directly repeated sequences (iterons) to initiate DNA replication. We had proposed previously that RepA is composed of two winged-helix (WH) domains, a structural unit also present in eukaryotic and archaeal initiators. To bind to the whole iteron sequence through both domains, RepA should couple monomerization to a conformational change in the N-terminal WH, which includes a leucine zipper-like sequence motif. We show for the first time that, by itself, binding to iteron DNA in vitro dissociates RepA dimers into monomers and alters RepA conformation, suggesting an allosteric effect. Furthermore, we also show that similar changes in RepA are promoted by mutations that substitute two Leu residues of the putative leucine zipper by Ala, destabilizing the hydrophobic core of the first WH. We propose that this mutant (RepA-2L2A) resembles a transient folding intermediate in the pathway leading to active monomers. These findings, together with the known activation of other Rep-type proteins by chaperones, are relevant to understand the molecular basis of plasmid DNA replication initiation. RepA protein is the DNA replication initiator of the Pseudomonas plasmid pPS10. RepA dimers bind to an inversely repeated operator sequence inrepA promoter, thus repressing its own synthesis, whereas monomers bind to four directly repeated sequences (iterons) to initiate DNA replication. We had proposed previously that RepA is composed of two winged-helix (WH) domains, a structural unit also present in eukaryotic and archaeal initiators. To bind to the whole iteron sequence through both domains, RepA should couple monomerization to a conformational change in the N-terminal WH, which includes a leucine zipper-like sequence motif. We show for the first time that, by itself, binding to iteron DNA in vitro dissociates RepA dimers into monomers and alters RepA conformation, suggesting an allosteric effect. Furthermore, we also show that similar changes in RepA are promoted by mutations that substitute two Leu residues of the putative leucine zipper by Ala, destabilizing the hydrophobic core of the first WH. We propose that this mutant (RepA-2L2A) resembles a transient folding intermediate in the pathway leading to active monomers. These findings, together with the known activation of other Rep-type proteins by chaperones, are relevant to understand the molecular basis of plasmid DNA replication initiation. origin recognition complex 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binapthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid electrophoretic mobility shift assay kanamycin leucine zipper maltose-binding protein winged helix wild type high pressure liquid chromatography DNA replication is a tightly regulated process to guarantee that genetic information is precisely copied once, and only once, each cell cycle (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). This is achieved by means of complex circuits that are distinct in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, although some similarities have become evident recently (2Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Cell. 1998; 92: 295-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 3Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Curr. Opin.

Common essential elements are acis-acting DNA sequence (the origin of replication) and atrans-acting factor (the initiator). DNA replication initiators are single proteins, or multisubunit complexes, that bind specifically to the origin of replication, where they usually assemble into oligomers. Initiators play two roles: (i) to melt the strands of DNA and (ii) bring to the so-created replication bubble a number of other protein factors. These are required for further extension of the replication fork (helicases), synthesis of an RNA primer (primases), and copying the template (DNA polymerases) (reviewed in Refs. 1Kornberg A.

Any initiator, to be enabled to bind and melt origin DNA, requires an activation step whose molecular basis is a central subject in research on both DNA replication and the cell cycle. A trait common to initiators is that their function is controlled by ATP binding and hydrolysis (3Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Lee D.G. Makhov A.M. Klemm R.D. Griffith J.D. Bell S.P.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) defining active or silent conformational states. In the bacterial chromosomal initiator, DnaA (reviewed in Ref. 7Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar), ATP is not strictly required for specific binding to double-stranded origin DNA (oriC). However, it is essential for melting oriC AT-rich repeats, binding to the resulting single-stranded sequences (6Speck C. Messer W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and then for loading DnaB helicase. Subsequent ATP hydrolysis, stimulated by the processivity factor of DNApol III (β-clamp) and other cellular factors, renders DnaA unable to initiate further replication rounds. DnaA can then be reactivated by either acidic phospholipids or DnaK chaperone, which exchange ADP by ATP (7Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). On their side, Orc1 and Orc5 subunits of the eukaryotic initiator ORC1also bind ATP, which is required for specific recognition of origin sequences (8Klemm R.D. Austin R.J. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 493-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA, generated after origin melting, stimulates ATP hydrolysis and exerts a change in the overall shape of ORC (5Lee D.G. Makhov A.M. Klemm R.D. Griffith J.D. Bell S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4774-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that borrow from their hosts most of the factors required for replication. However, they often encode their own initiator, termed Rep (reviewed in Refs. 9del Solar G. Giraldo R. Ruı́z-Echevarrı́a M.J. Espinosa M. Dı́az R. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 434-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 10Cohen S. Couturier M. del Solar G. Dı́az-Orejas R. Espinosa M. Giraldo R. Jánniere L. Miller C. Osborn M. Thomas C.M. Thomas C.M.

In Gram-negative bacteria, Rep proteins usually bind to directly repeated sequences (iterons) to establish the initiation complex. In addition, some Rep proteins also bind to an inversely repeated sequence (operator) that overlaps with the promoter of the rep genes, thus acting as self-repressors. Dimers of Rep bind to the operator, whereas monomers bind to the iterons (11Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

RepA is the initiator protein of pPS10, a plasmid isolated fromPseudomonas (18Nieto C. Giraldo R. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutations in an LZ-like sequence motif, found at the N terminus of RepA (19Giraldo R. Nieto C. Fernández-Tresguerres M.E. Dı́az R. Nature. 1989; 342: 866Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), enhance dimer dissociation (14Garcı́a de Viedma D. Giraldo R. Rivas G. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, a proof for a direct role of LZ in RepA dimerization is still lacking. An helix-turn-helix motif at the protein C terminus is the main determinant of RepA binding to both operator and iteron DNA sequences (20Garcı́a de Viedma D. Serrano-López A. Dı́az-Orejas R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 5048-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have proposed recently (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that RepA consists of two WH domains (reviewed in Ref. 22Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a similar WH fold is found at the C terminus of the eukaryotic/archaeal initiators Orc4/Cdc6 (4Giraldo R. Dı́az-Orejas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4938-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 23Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), underlining the relevance of studying the molecular mechanism of RepA activation. We had proposed that dissociation of RepA dimers into monomers would result in a structural change altering the relative arrangement and compaction of its two WH domains (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the dimers, the C-terminal domain (WH2) binds to the operator through the major groove, whereas the N-terminal domain (WH1) acts as dimerization interface. In the monomers, WH2 binds to iteron DNA as it does to the operator, whereas the remodeled WH1 binds to the opposite end of iteron through both the phosphodiester backbone and the minor groove (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This model has been then confirmed by the crystal structure of the monomer of a related initiator, RepE54, bound to iteron DNA (24Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It shows that the α-helix that might resemble an LZ in the dimers is found in the monomers split into two helical portions, packed together, and buried in the hydrophobic core of WH1 (24Komori H. Matsunaga F. Higuchi Y. Ishiai M. Wada C. Miki K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4597-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A feature of Rep-type initiators is that, unlike DnaA and ORC, they do not bind ATP. Thus, although Rep proteins can promote some structural transitions in DNA, most plasmids require DnaA to aid in origin melting (17Krüger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones, either the triad DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE or ClpA, have been implicated in the activation of the Rep-type initiator proteins of plasmids P1 (11Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, ClpA unfolds P1 Rep to be proteolyzed by ClpP (37Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl.

A. 2001; 98: 4938-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that Hsp70 chaperones, the eukaryotic homologues of DnaK, are implicated in the assembly of ORC. Two alternative functions have been proposed for chaperones in P1 replication; either Rep dimers would be so stable that chaperones are required to dissociate them (31Wickner S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D.F. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), or they would modify Rep conformation (39Dibbens J.A. Muraiso K. Chattoraj D.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, some monomeric mutants still require the action of chaperones in vivo (33Sozhamannan S. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34DasGupta S. Mukhopadhyay G. Papp P.P. Lewis M.S. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although they have higher association rates to iterons in vitro and increased initiation frequency (40Mukhopadhyay G Sozhamannan S. Chattoraj D.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, dimers of a few Rep-type proteins dissociate spontaneously by dilution (34DasGupta S. Mukhopadhyay G. Papp P.P. Lewis M.S. Chattoraj D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,41Ingmer H. Fong E.L. Cohen S. J. Mol.

Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The current view is that chaperones would induce in Rep both monomerization and a conformational change, whose exact nature remains to be determined (30Chattoraj D.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 39Dibbens J.A. Muraiso K. Chattoraj D.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 43Pak M. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4901-4906Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have searched for determinants of the activation of pPS10 RepA. We show in this paper that micromolar amounts of a single iteron DNA sequence actively induce in vitro both the dissociation of RepA dimers into monomers and a conformational change. On the contrary, binding of RepA dimers to the operator sequence neither dissociates them nor changes their conformation. The ligand-induced monomerization of RepA dimers with a coupled conformational change, reported in this paper, would thus be a case for the allosteric effect of DNA substrates in the structure of their binding domains (44Spolar R.S. Record Jr., T.M. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar, 45Jen-Jacobson L. Engler L.E. Jacobson L.A. Structure. 2000; 8: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and a novel player in the activation of plasmid DNA replication initiators. Furthermore, we also present a detailed biophysical characterization of RepA-2L2A, a mostly monomeric species of RepA obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of two Leu residues in the LZ-like motif. Our data suggest that it resembles a transient folding intermediate in the way from dimers to active monomers. In RepA-2L2A, the mutations disable the first of the two α-helical portions of the putative LZ to fold back into the second one, thus disrupting hydrophobic interactions at the core of monomeric WH1. His6-RepA-WT was expressed and purified, and when required, its tag was removed as described previously (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mutant repA-2L2A gene was obtained by PCR, using as template the expression vector pRG-recA-NHis-repA-WT (23Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and primers including the following: (i) a SacII site plus sequences coding for the 5′ end of repA but with mutated codons (GCC for Ala-12 and GCG for Ala-19) replacing those for leucines in the putative LZ and (ii) a HindIII site plus a TGA stop codon and sequences complementary to the 3′ end of repA. Mutations were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Expression of His6-RepA-2L2A was carried out at 30 °C inEscherichia coli SG22097 (clpXP), as performed for RepA-WT (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). His6-RepA-2L2A was purified to homogeneity from inclusion bodies using the same procedure developed for deletion mutants in RepA (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein stocks were kept in 0.5m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm NH4-acetate, pH 6.0, 10 mm β-MeEtOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol. RepAs concentrations were calculated based on their absorption at 280 nm in 5.6 m GuHCl, considering a molar extinction coefficient of 17210 m−1·cm−1(www.expasy.ch/tools/protparam.html). pPSEC, a new series of shuttle vectors including the pPS10 and ColE1 replicons, was constructed as follows. pRG9B (46Fernández-Tresguerres M.E. Martı́n M. Garcı́a de Viedma D. Giraldo R. Dı́az-Orejas R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI to give a 4-kbp fragment including the pPS10 replicon (18Nieto C. Giraldo R. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the Kn resistance determinant. This fragment was then filled in with Klenow and ligated to a 759-bp DraI-AflIII (ori) fragment from pUC18, in which the latter site had also been made blunt-ended. The resulting plasmid (pPSEC1) was then modified to substitute the 5′ half of the repA-WT gene (a 317-bpEcoRI-SphI fragment) by versions encoding a His6 tag (pPSEC2) and the 2L2A mutations (pPSEC3). This was carried out by PCR on the corresponding pRG-recA-NHis-repA-WT/2L2A templates (see above), using as primers the following: (i) a 41-bp tail with the sequence between the EcoRI site and the ATG initiation codon inrepA (18Nieto C. Giraldo R. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), plus the encoded His6 tag and (ii) sequences from the complementary non-coding strand comprising theSphI site in repA. The three pPSEC constructs were rescued in E. coli JM109, checked by DNA sequencing, and then transformed into P. aeruginosa PAO1024 (18Nieto C. Giraldo R. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Relative plasmid copy numbers were determined from cultures of PAO1024/pPSECs in LB medium, supplemented with Kn to 50 μg/ml, at 30 °C. 1.5-ml aliquots were harvested at A600= 0.5, and total lysates were obtained as described (18Nieto C. Giraldo R. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 60 μl (1/10) of the lysates were then loaded into 0.8% agarose-Tris acetate EDTA gels, run at 30 V for 12.5 h, and stained with EtBr. Southern blotting was carried out by transferring the gels to nylon membranes (18Nieto C. Giraldo R. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and then hybridized with a 954-bp EcoRIrepA fragment from pRG9B, radiolabeled by random priming with Klenow and 40 μCi of [α−32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). X-ray films (AGFA) were exposed and then both the hybridized plasmid bands and the EtBr-stained chromosome were quantified using GelDoc (Bio-Rad). The amount of intracellular RepA inP. aeruginosa cells carrying pPSEC plasmids was estimated by Western blotting, as described (47Swack J.A. Pal S.K. Mason R.J. Abeles A.L. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3737-3742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 200-μl culture aliquots were taken at different A600 values. Total lysates were obtained, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Membranes were incubated with an anti-RepA rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:1000) and then revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000) by the ECL procedure (Amersham Biosciences). RepA amounts were estimated by comparing the intensities of the specific luminescent bands in pPSEC-containing cells with those in lanes including extracts from plasmid-free cells, the latter supplemented with known amounts of pure RepA. The number of cells contributing to the loaded extracts was estimated after serial dilutions of the cultures by counting at a microscope. Viables were then determined by plating on LB-agar supplemented with Kn. Molar concentration of RepA was calculated considering for a P. aeruginosa cell the same volume determined previously for E. coli (4.6 × 10−10 μl) (48Brenner M. Tomizawa J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides containing either the operator or the four iteron sequences of pPS10 (18Nieto C. Giraldo R. Fernández-Tresguerres E. Dı́az R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were synthesized and then phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase. After annealing with their complementary strands, they were cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 and sequenced. Plasmids were cut at the XbaI site and then labeled with 2 units of Klenow and 30 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP for 30 min at 25 °C. Fragments were excised with EcoRI and purified by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels (13Garcı́a de Viedma D. Giraldo R. Ruı́z-Echevarrı́a M.J. Lurz R. Dı́az-Orejas R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of RepA proteins (WT or 2L2A) were incubated in ice with radiolabeled DNAs (4000 cpm) in a 20-μl volume of 20 mm Hepes·NH4, pH 7.8, 5 mm β-MeEtOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and (NH4)2SO4, provided by the supplied protein, to 0.2 m. Samples, assembled in ice, were then transferred to room temperature for 30 min before loading into 6% polyacrylamide (29:1)-0.5× TBE gels. Electrophoresis was run at 150 V and 4 °C. Gels were then dried out and exposed to x-ray films. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. RepA stocks were dialyzed against 0.25 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mmNH4-acetate, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm EDTA. 60-μl samples, with different protein concentrations, were displayed into six-channel centrifuge cells, with a 1.2-cm optical path and centerpieces of epon charcoal. Sedimentation equilibrium gradients were formed at 5 °C by spinning at either 13000 or 15000 rpm. Radial scans were taken at different wavelengths. Baseline offsets were measured at 50000 rpm. Sedimentation velocity of RepA, either alone or complexed with DNA fragments, was performed at 50000 rpm and 5 °C with 350-μl samples displayed into double sector cells. Data from both types of experiments were processed as described (49Abril A.M. Salas M. Andreu J.M. Hermoso J.M. Rivas G. Biochemistry. 1997; 6: 11901-11908Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient distributions for the RepA-DNA complexes (Fig. 6C, inset) were calculated by direct linear least squares boundary modeling of the sedimentation velocity data (ls-g*(s)) using SEDFIT (50Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Steady state fluorescence spectroscopy was performed in a Fluorolog Jobin Yvon-Spex spectrofluorimeter. 350-μl samples of His6-RepA-WT or His6-RepA-2L2A (5 μm) in 0.25 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mmNH4-acetate, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm EDTA buffer were displayed into 0.2 × 1.0-cm path length quartz cuvettes and left to equilibrate at 5 °C. Trp-94 in RepA was then selectively excited (2-nm slit) at 295 nm (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and emission spectra were acquired between 300 and 450 nm (3-nm slit, Δλ = 1 nm). For extrinsic fluorescence measurements, bis-ANS (Sigma) was supplied, from a stock in methanol, to a final concentration of 10 μm. Samples were left to equilibrate for 30 min at 5 °C and then were excited at 395 nm. Emission spectra were acquired in the interval of 400 to 600 nm. The contribution of the buffer was subtracted to all spectra. Circular dichroism analysis of His6-RepA-WT, His6-RepA-2L2A, and their complexes with DNAs was performed in a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter, using 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvettes. The DNA oligonucleotides tested in the binding assays (RepA sites underlined) were as follows: 1IR (operator), 5′-GAACAAGGACAGGGCATTGACTTGTCCCTGTCCCTTAAT-3′ (39-mer); 1DR (iteron), 5′-ATACCCGGGTTTAAAGGGGACAGATTCAGGCTGTTATCCACACCC-3′ (45-mer); TEL (unrelated), 5′-GATCCCACACCCACACACCCACACACCCACACACCCAG-3′ (38-mer); plus their complementary strands. Oligonucleotides were purified, and their concentrations were determined as described (21Giraldo R. Andreu J.M. Dı́az-Orejas R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4511-4526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Annealing was carried out by slow cooling in Tris-EDTA buffer, and double-stranded DNA stocks (50 μm) were stored at −20 °C. Binding reactions (200 μl) were assembled in ice, in a solution containing 0.145 m (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm NH4-acetate, pH 6.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm β-MeEtOH, 5% glycerol, plus 5 μm protein and/or double-stranded DNA. Spectra were acquired at 5 °C from 320 to 200 nm, using a bandwidth of 1 nm, 4-s response, 50 nm/min scan speed (0.2-nm steps), and 10 millidegrees of sensitivity. Five to ten spectra were accumulated for averaging. The spectrum of the buffer was subtracted, and raw ellipticity data (in millidegrees) were transformed to molar ellipticity ([θ]) (in degrees·cm2·dmol−1). No differences in the spectra were appreciated when reactions were incubated for variable times, ranging from 15 min to 3 h, indicating that binding equilibrium is reached rather quickly (42Chattoraj D.K. Ghirlando R. Park K. Dibbens J.A. Lewis M.S. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Secondary structure estimates were performed with CDNN (51Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Prot. Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) at its Web server (bioinformatik.biochemtech.uni-halle.de/cdnn/java/Started.html). Thermal denaturation analyses were performed on the same samples, overlaid with mineral oil. Ellipticity at 228 nm was measured while temperature of the cell holder was increased, using a computer-interfaced water bath, from 5 to 90 °C (0.2 °C steps, 20 °C/h; scans performed at 50 °C/h gave similar curves). Gel filtration assays were performed in a Superdex-200 HR10/30 column, assembled in an ÅKTA basic-10 HPLC equipment (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated at room temperature in 0.145 m(NH4)2SO4, 50 mmNH4-acetate, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-MeEtOH, 5% glycerol. Duplicates ("

Serp-1 is one such viral serpin that effectively protects virus-infected tissues from host inflammatory responses. When given as purified protein, Serp-1 markedly inhibits vascular monocyte invasion and plaque growth in animal models. We have investigated mechanisms of viral serpin inhibition of vascular inflammatory responses. In vascular injury models, Serp-1 altered early cellular plasminogen activator (tissue plasminogen activator), inhibitor (PAI-1), and receptor (urokinase-type plasminogen activator) expression (p < 0.01). Serp-1, but not a reactive center loop mutant, up-regulated PAI-1 serpin expression in human endothelial cells. Treatment of endothelial cells with antibody to urokinase-type plasminogen activator and vitronectin blocked Serp-1-induced changes. Significantly, Serp-1 blocked intimal hyperplasia (p < 0.0001) after aortic allograft transplant (p < 0.0001) in PAI-1-deficient mice. Serp-1 also blocked plaque growth after aortic isograft transplant and after wire-induced injury (p < 0.05) in PAI-1-deficient mice indicating that increase in PAI-1 expression is not required for Serp-1 to block vasculopathy development. Serp-1 did not inhibit plaque growth in uPAR-deficient mice after aortic allograft transplant. We conclude that the poxviral serpin, Serp-1, attenuates vascular inflammatory responses to injury through a pathway mediated by native uPA receptors and vitronectin."

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6418-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Two small G-proteins, Rac and Cdc42, regulate actin polymerization and are responsible for the assembly of membrane ruffles and filopodia, respectively (8Hall A. Paterson H.F. Adamson P. Ridley A.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recent work has elucidated the essential role of the Arp2/3 complex in the Rac- or Cdc42-mediated actin polymerization (6Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Actin alone polymerizes rather slowly because of the rate-limiting process of nucleation. The Arp2/3 complex greatly accelerates the nucleation process in a Rac- or Cdc42-dependent way; Rac or Cdc42 activates the effector proteins of WASP family proteins including N-WASP and WAVE (SCAR). Together they activate the nucleation activity of the Arp2/3 complex and induce rapid actin polymerization. The Arp2/3 complex also binds to the side of actin filaments and initiates branched actin polymerization, resulting in the formation of a dendritic actin network. The appearance and extent of membrane ruffling vary widely depending on cell types, as well as cellular conditions and external circumstances. For example, fibroblasts generally show more vigorous ruffling than do epithelial cells. Membrane ruffling is regulated by a variety of external signals including serum or growth factors, extracellular matrix, and cell-cell contacts (9Ridley A.J. Allen W.E. Peppelenbosch M. Jones G.E. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 65: 111-123PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 11Boonstra J. Rijken P.

Med. 1998; 9: 128-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). On the other hand, intrinsic signals appear to control constitutive membrane ruffling of motile cells. It is thus conceivable that, in addition to the small G-proteins, other proteins may modulate Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Candidates with such functions are actin-binding proteins present in membrane ruffles. For example, cortactin activates Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization and stabilizes branched actin polymerization in vitro (13Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X.

Most recently, coronin has been reported to bind to the Arp2/3/VCA complex and inhibit the de novo nucleation activity of Arp2/3 (17Humphries C.L. Balcer H.I. D'Agostino J.L. Winsor B. Drubin D.G.

Caldesmon is an actin-binding protein that is localized in stress fibers, as well as in membrane ruffles (18Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J.

It is not clear, however, what functions caldesmon plays in membrane ruffles. We have examined the effects of caldesmon on Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization and found that caldesmon inhibits the Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation process. Skeletal muscle G-actin was prepared as described (29Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), and pyrene dye was conjugated as described (30Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J.

The GST1-tagged C-terminal region of N-WASP (GST-VCA) was cloned by PCR using the N-WASP-expressing baculovirus (a kind gift from Drs. Takenawa and Miki, Tokyo University) as the template, expressed in bacteria, and purified as described (31Egile C. Loisel T.P. Laurent V. Li R. Pantaloni D. Sansonetti P.J. Carlier M.F. J.

Protoplasma. 1988; (Suppl. 2): 9-21Crossref Google Scholar). Cdc2 kinase was prepared as described previously (35Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calmodulin and λ-phosphatase were purchased from Sigma and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), respectively. Actin polymerization was measured by pyrene fluorescence using a Perkin Elmer spectrofluorometer, LS-50B. Mg-ATP G-actin (2 μm 5% pyrene-labeled actin) was mixed with various proteins in polymerization buffer (final condition: 10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT) at time 0. When we examined the effects of Ca2+/calmodulin, 0.4 mm CaCl2 was added instead of EGTA. The high concentration of DTT was included to prevent the dimerization of caldesmon (36Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle caldesmon was phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase as described (35Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylation (determined by 32P incorporation) was found to be 4.5 ± 0.5 mol/mol. In some experiments, phosphorylated caldesmon was dephosphorylated by the incubation with λ-phosphatase at 30 °C for 30 min, which resulted in the decrease of the incorporation to 0.8 ± 0.4 mol/mol. λ-Phosphatase was denatured by heat treatment, and dephosphorylated caldesmon was recovered in a heat-stable fraction. F-actin was polymerized from Mg-ATP G-actin (final concentration, 2 μm) in the polymerization buffer (10 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT, 4 μm phalloidin) for 40 min. After polymerization, caldesmon (final concentration, 0.5 μm) was added and incubated for 10 min, and then varying concentrations (5–20 nm) of Arp2/3 and GST-VCA (50 nm) were added. The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge (26 p.s.i. × 20 min). Both pellets and supernatants were suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by the Western blot method using mouse monoclonal antibody against Arp3 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). A standard curve was made by immunoblotting known concentrations of Arp2/3 complex with the same antibody and used to quantitatively determine the levels of Arp3 using Kodak one-dimensional Image Analysis Software (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The average length of actin filaments at the equilibrium state (after pyrene fluorescence reached a plateau) was measured by electron microscopy using negative staining technique (36Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). More than 1000 actin filaments were measured for each polymerization experiment. We first examined effects of caldesmon on Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. Actin (2 μm), Arp2/3 (15 nm), and VCA (50 nm) were mixed with varying concentrations (0–2 μm) of either smooth muscle or nonmuscle caldesmon, and polymerization was initiated by the addition of salt at time 0. As Fig. 1 (A and B) shows, the higher the concentration of caldesmon, the longer the delay in actin polymerization. To quantitate the effects of caldesmon, we measured the delay times required to reach one-fifth of the final fluorescence, as well as slopes at the half-maximal fluorescence (proportional to the number of barbed ends, assuming that caldesmon did not change the elongation rate). As Fig.2 shows, the delay time is increased from 100 to 200 s for smooth muscle caldesmon and to 210 s for nonmuscle caldesmon. The delay is saturated at 0.25 μmfor smooth muscle caldesmon and at 0.5–1 μm for nonmuscle caldesmon. The inhibition of the polymerization rates is saturated at approximately 1 μm of either type of caldesmon. It is noteworthy that caldesmon at a very low concentration (50 nm) has more effect on the delay time than on the slope of polymerization. The inhibition by caldesmon is at least as effective as that reported for tropomyosin (16Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1300-1304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Figure 2Effects of caldesmon on maximum rates of actin polymerization and the retardation time. The maximum rates of polymerization (filled squares) were measured by the slopes at half-maximum fluorescence obtained from the experiments shown in Fig. 1. The retardation (open circles) was measured by times required to reach at one-fifth of the final fluorescence obtained from the experiments shown in Fig. 1.A, nonmuscle caldesmon. B, smooth muscle caldesmon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Without Arp2/3, the effect of caldesmon on actin polymerization was minimal. The delay time was changed from 165 to 180 s when 0.5 μm of caldesmon was added in the absence of Arp2/3 (Fig.1C). The difference was only 9%. In contrast, the same concentration (0.5 μm) of caldesmon delayed Arp2/3-dependent polymerization to a much greater extent (from 99.4 to 193.2 s, corresponding to a 94% increase; see Fig.2B). The polymerization rate (slopes at the half-maximal fluorescence) also showed little change in the absence of Arp2/3; caldesmon decreased the rate by merely 5%. In contrast, the same concentration of caldesmon decreased the rate by 62% in the presence of Arp2/3 (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that caldesmon affects Arp2/3-dependent processes of actin polymerization. The C terminus of caldesmon is indispensable for the inhibitory effect. Although the N terminus of caldesmon contains a major myosin-binding site, the C terminus has the actin-binding domains in addition to the domains that bind to tropomyosin or calmodulin (37Hayashi K. Yamada S. Kanda K. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Sobue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We found that the C-terminal half (Glu235–Val531 of rat nonmuscle caldesmon) was able to show inhibitory effects on Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization similar to the full-length molecule, whereas the N terminus showed no effects on actin polymerization (results not shown). This result suggests that actin binding ability is important for the inhibition. The retardation of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization could be caused by the reduction of the elongation rate from barbed ends, by the inhibition of actin nucleation, or by both. We first examined whether caldesmon slows the elongation from barbed ends of Arp2/3-capped actin seeds. To make seeds, actin (2 μm, without pyrene label) was polymerized in the presence of the Arp2/3 complex (20 nm) and VCA (50 nm). The seeds were then diluted 10-fold and incubated with 0.3 μmpyrene-labeled G-actin with or without caldesmon to monitor barbed end polymerization. We conclude from the following reasons that this assay reasonably tests the effects of caldesmon on elongation from barbed ends. First, the concentration of G-actin is below the critical concentration of pointed ends so that barbed end polymerization was monitored (final concentrations: 0.2 μm F-actin seeds, 0.3 μm G-actin, with or without 0.5 μmcaldesmon). Second, caldesmon did not increase the annealing of Arp2/3-capped actin filaments in this condition, and thus the number of barbed ends was not changed with or without caldesmon. When Arp2/3-capped actin filaments with two different colors were mixed with or without caldesmon, the percentage of annealed actin filaments (visualized by combined actin filaments with two colors) was the same, indicating that caldesmon did not dissociate Arp2/3 complexes from pointed ends. Third, no nucleation occurred under this condition. It was possible that Arp2/3 and VCA used for making seeds could inducede novo nucleation. However, no actin polymerization was observed within 200 s (Fig.3A, filled circles) when 0.5 μm G-actin was mixed with 2 nmArp2/3 and 5 nm VCA (the same concentrations used in this assay). Fourth, caldesmon binding is faster than actin elongation at the barbed ends. Because the binding of caldesmon to F-actin is rather a fast reaction (k+ = 1 × 107m−1 s−1) (38Chalovich J.M. Chen Y.D. Dudek R. Luo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9911-9916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), most actin filaments would be saturated with caldesmon before any significant actin polymerization could occur at the free barbed ends; half of caldesmon binds to actin in 0.1 s in this condition, whereas only 0.2% of actin seems to polymerize at the ends at the same time. As Fig. 3B shows, caldesmon inhibits the elongation rates to a small extent. The rates were decreased 20% by smooth muscle caldesmon and 10% by nonmuscle caldesmon. This small extent of inhibition, however, does not account for the large decreases in the rates of actin polymerization by caldesmon as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 in which the slope at half-maximum fluorescence was decreased by 62% by 0.5 μm caldesmon. We then examined how caldesmon affects the apparent nucleation rate, k*, and the apparent elongation rate, k+. According to the theory of actin polymerization devised by Oosawa and Asakura (39Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Proteins. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1975Google Scholar), the nucleation rate k* is proportional to the inverse of <i>*t, where <i> is the average length of actin filaments at the equilibrium state, and t is the time when a certain amount of monomers has polymerized. On the other hand, the elongation rate k+ is proportional to <i>/t. Fig. 4 shows the time courses of actin polymerization in the absence (panel A) or presence (panel B) of caldesmon when the concentrations of the Arp2/3 complex were changed from 0 to 20 nm. At the equilibrium, the lengths of more than 1000 actin filaments were measured by electron microscopy, and the length distribution is shown as the histogram in Fig. 5. It is clear that filament length becomes longer when caldesmon is present. TableI shows the average lengths, <i>, of actin filaments, as well as times (t15) at which 20% of F-actin was polymerized relative to the final level of F-actin. Both average lengths andt15 become longer in the presence of caldesmon than in its absence. We have then calculated relative changes ink* and k+ by normalizing the rates,k* and k+, of polymerization of actin alone to 1.0. Fig. 6 shows the plots of relative values of k* and k+versus Arp2/3 concentrations.Figure 5Histogram of length distribution of actin filaments polymerized with or without caldesmon. After actin polymerization reached equilibrium in the experiment shown in Fig. 4, the lengths of actin filaments were determined by electron microscopy, and distribution is shown as histograms.

Closed squares, without caldesmon; open squares, with caldesmon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These plots indicate that caldesmon greatly decreases the nucleation rate, k* (Fig. 6A), but not the elongation rate,k+ (Fig. 6B). As expected,k* increased as the concentration of Arp2/3 increases (Fig.6A). Importantly, k* in the presence of caldesmon (open squares) is decreased to one-third of that in the absence of caldesmon (filled squares). On the other hand,k+ (Fig. 6B) seems to be the same whether caldesmon is present (open squares) or absent (filled squares), although k+decreases when the Arp2/3 concentration becomes high. The reason for the decrease is not clear at this time. It is interesting to note that the Arp2/3-dependent increase in k* is proportional to the second power of Arp2/3 concentrations (Fig.6A, inset). This relationship may be reflected by the fact that Arp2/3 nucleation activity is greatly increased when the Arp2/3 complex binds to the side of an actin filament (29Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 40Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The kinetic analyses shown above (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) strongly suggest that caldesmon inhibits the nucleation activity of Arp2/3 complexes. One possibility was that caldesmon might directly associate with Arp2/3 complex or VCA and interfere the nucleation activity. However, we were unable to detect the binding of caldesmon to the Arp2/3 complex, VCA, or a VCA-Arp2/3 complex when the association was examined by a pull-down assay using affinity column chromatography or by the surface plasmon resonance method (data not shown). This suggests that caldesmon may indirectly inhibit the nucleation activity of Arp2/3 complex. How does caldesmon indirectly reduce the nucleation activity of Arp2/3? Arp2/3 is able to nucleate actin in two ways. One is de novo nucleation (without polymerized actin), and the other is branched nucleation via binding of Arp2/3 to the side of F-actin filaments. Branched nucleation has been reported to be far more effective than de novonucleation (29Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 40Marchand J.B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Because caldesmon binds to the side of actin filaments, it is possible that caldesmon inhibits the latter nucleation by inhibiting Arp2/3-F-actin binding. To test this possibility, we performed the following two experiments. We first asked whether caldesmon reduces the ability of F-actin seeds as the secondary activator of Arp2/3 nucleation. F-actin seeds (final concentration, 0.3 μm) were first mixed with or without 0.5 μm caldesmon, and then Arp2/3, VCA, and pyrene-labeled G-actin were added to initiate polymerization. As Fig. 7 shows, actin polymerization in the presence of Arp2/3 occurred very rapidly with almost no lag time when F-actin seeds without caldesmon were added (Fig. 7, filled squares; compare the actin polymerization without F-actin seeds shown in Fig. 1). The addition of caldesmon (Fig. 7A, nonmuscle caldesmon; Fig. 7B, smooth muscle caldesmon) to F-actin seeds, however, greatly reduces the ability of F-actin seeds (compare open squares with filled squares). The effect is specific to Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization because, in the absence of Arp2/3, the addition of either nonmuscle (Fig. 7A) or smooth muscle (Fig.7B) caldesmon showed only small (for nonmuscle caldesmon) or no (for smooth muscle caldesmon) effects on actin polymerization (compare filled and open circles). These results suggest that caldesmon inhibits branched nucleation mediated by the binding of Arp2/3 to F-actin seeds. However, because there was an excess amount of caldesmon in these assays, it is possible that free caldesmon may also inhibit de novo nucleation of Arp2/3. We next examined whether caldesmon inhibits binding of Arp2/3 to F-actin, because actin binding of Arp2/3 is required for branched nucleation. Using co-sedimentation assays, we examined whether caldesmon affects actin binding of Arp2/3. F-actin (2 μm) with or without caldesmon (0.5 μm) was incubated with varying concentrations of Arp2/3 (5–20 nm), and the levels of Arp2/3 in F-actin pellets were determined by quantitative Western blot method using the monoclonal antibody against Arp3. As Fig.8 shows, the levels of bound Arp2/3 are reduced to 30–60% of the controls, when actin was preincubated with either nonmuscle or smooth muscle caldesmon. These results indicate that caldesmon inhibits Arp2/3 binding to F-actin. The interaction of caldesmon with actin is regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin or by phosphorylation of caldesmon with a variety of kinases including cdc2 kinase (35Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because actin binding of caldesmon is important for its effects on Arp2/3, we examined whether these agents regulate the effects of caldesmon on Arp2/3 nucleation. As Fig. 9 shows, Ca2+/calmodulin negated the effects of the inhibition of caldesmon. Although caldesmon alone (filled triangles) retarded Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization greatly (compare with filled squares), the addition of Ca2+/calmodulin (open triangles) to caldesmon almost completely reversed the inhibitory effect of caldesmon. As an additional control, we examined the effect of calmodulin alone on Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization and found no significant effect (open squares). We also found that phosphorylation of caldesmon with cdc2 kinase completely negates the inhibition of caldesmon (Fig.10). Although unphosphorylated caldesmon (Fig. 10, ×) greatly inhibited Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization, caldesmon phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase to 4–5 mol/mol showed no inhibition on Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. The time course without caldesmon (filled squares) was identical to that with phosphorylated caldesmon (open circles). The release of inhibition was phosphorylation-specific; when caldesmon was dephosphorylated with λ-phosphatase, caldesmon regained its inhibitory effect on Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (filled triangles). Dephosphorylation was not complete (phosphorylation level was 0.8 ± 0.4 mol/mol), which appears to explain the fact that dephosphorylated caldesmon showed less inhibition than unphosphorylated caldesmon. Our data indicate that caldesmon reduces the nucleation rate of the Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization by inhibiting actin binding of Arp2/3. Three lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, kinetic analyses showed that caldesmon reduced the nucleation rate, whereas it did not alter the elongation rate largely (Fig. 6). Second, F-actin seeds bound with caldesmon were much less effective in activating nucleation by Arp2/3 than were F-actin seeds without caldesmon (Fig. 7). Finally, caldesmon inhibited actin binding of Arp2/3 (Fig. 8). These results strongly suggest that caldesmon reduces the nucleation rate by inhibiting branched nucleation, which is similar to the way of the inhibition reported for tropomyosin (16Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1300-1304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The inhibition of branched nucleation is probably related to the way of actin binding of these two proteins; both tropomyosin and caldesmon bind to the side of filaments. Although it has not been shown that tropomyosin inhibits actin binding of Arp2/3, side binding of tropomyosin is likely to reduce the actin binding affinity of Arp2/3 as did caldesmon. Another possibility for the inhibition of branching would be that caldesmon stimulates the conversion of ATP-actin to ADP-actin. However, we did not detect any stimulation of actin ATPase by caldesmon (data not shown). We attempted to observe directly, by fluorescent microscopy, whether caldesmon inhibits branched F-actin formations. However, we found that this assay had the following problems, which made results unreliable. First, the binding of caldesmon made F-actin filaments more rigid and resistant to shearing force than F-actin without caldesmon. During microscopic observation, we observed that branched F-actin without caldesmon was frequently broken at its branch sites by shearing force, whereas branched F-actin with caldesmon was preserved better under the same conditions. Second, caldesmon tends to form a dimer in the absence of reducing agents, and dimer caldesmon can cross-link actin filaments (36Yamashiro-Matsumura S. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1973-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although a high concentration of DTT reduced dimer formation of most but not all caldesmon, residual caldesmon dimers appear to generate loosely cross-linked actin filaments. Such loosely cross-linked actin filaments were quite similar to branched filaments under a microscope, again making accurate quantitation of branching quite difficult. The inhibition of Arp2/3-induced actin polymerization by caldesmon is likely to have physiological significance. First, caldesmon and Arp2/3 are co-localized in membrane ruffles. Second, the intracellular concentration of caldesmon appears high enough to affect Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. For example, fibroblasts contain ∼2–8 μm caldesmon (32Yamashiro S. Chern H. Yamakita Y. Matsumura F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because total actin concentration is approximately 100–200 μm, the molar ratio of caldesmon to actin could be between 1:100 and 1:12, in which range caldesmon was shown to affect actin polymerization in this work (Figs. 1 and 2). Fourth, changes in caldesmon concentrations appear to alter the motile activity of the peripheral membranes. For example, caldesmon has been reported to be down-regulated in many transformed cells (19Koji-Owada M.K. Hakura A. Iida K. Yahara I. Sobue K. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3133-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Yamashiro S. Yoshida K. Yamakita Y. Matsumura F. Estes J.E. Higgins P.J. International Conference on the Biophysics, Biochemistry, and Cell Biology of Actin. Plenum Publishing Corp., Troy, NY1994: 113-122Google Scholar). This down-regulation is well correlated to the increases of membrane ruffling upon cell transformation. Furthermore, in our preliminary experiments, we found that microinjection of caldesmon into normal rat kidney cells reduced membrane ruffling movement considerably (data not shown). Caldesmon may be a key molecule that could confer phosphorylation-dependent or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent regulation of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. We have demonstrated that the inhibition of caldesmon of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization is released by phosphorylation with cdc2 kinase (Fig.10) and by Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 9). This release is likely to be caused by the inhibition of actin binding of caldesmon by these agents. Although tropomyosin has been reported to inhibit Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (16Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1300-1304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it is mainly localized in stress fibers, and the actin binding of tropomyosin is not regulated like caldesmon. Because other kinases including MAPK (43Hedges J.C. Yamboliev I.A. Ngo M. Horowitz B. Adam L.P. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C527-C534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (44Vorotnikov A.V. Gusev N.B. Hua S. Collins J.H. Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) were also reported to regulate the actin binding of caldesmon, caldesmon may play a role in motile phenomena in a variety of signal transduction pathways. For example, growth factors like PDGF are known to induce membrane ruffles. PDGF also causes caldesmon phosphorylation by MAPK. Because the phosphorylation sites of caldesmon by MAPK partially overlap with those by cdc2 kinase, phosphorylation with MAPK is likely to reverse the inhibition of caldesmon on Arp2/3 nucleation. Indeed, our preliminary data showed that caldesmon phosphorylated by MAPK lost its inhibition of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (data not shown). Thus, although growth factors like PDGF activate small G-proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac, which in turn initiate membrane ruffles, phosphorylation of caldesmon by MAPK would enhance Arp2/3-induced actin polymerization, leading to more vigorous membrane ruffling and cell movement during growth factor treatment (45Goncharova E.A. Vorotnikov A.V. Gracheva E.O. Albert W.C. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Stepanova V.V. Tkachuk V.A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 46Yamboliev I.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1680-C1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This notion appeared to be supported by a report showing that caldesmon phosphorylation by MAPK is involved in PDGF-stimulated cell migration of smooth muscle cells (46Yamboliev I.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C1680-C1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caldesmon phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase may also have physiological significance. It has been recently reported that Arp2/3 plays an important role in the completion of cytokinesis in yeast (47Pelham R.J. Chang F. Nature. 2002; 419: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) as well as Drosophila (42Stevenson V. Hudson A. Cooley L. Theurkauf W.E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have shown here that phosphorylation of caldesmon by cdc2 kinase completely abolished the inhibition of caldesmon on Arp2/3 (Fig. 10). Because our previous study has shown that caldesmon is phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase during mitosis (35Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12022-12029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,41Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), it is possible that the release of the inhibition of caldesmon may be involved in Arp2/3-mediated assembly of contractile rings. Future studies should be conducted to define how the regulation of actin-caldesmon binding controls actin polymerization and cell motility during signal transduction. We thank Dr. F. Deis (Rutgers) for critical reading of this manuscript."

Macromolecular traffic occurs via nuclear pore complexes, huge proteinaceous structures that span the double membrane that allow transport in essentially two modes: energy-independent passive diffusion and energy-dependent facilitated translocation (for reviews see Refs. 1Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar and 2Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Passive diffusion is efficient for small molecules but becomes slow and inefficient as the size approaches a limit of 20–40 kDa. In contrast, facilitated translocation allows passage of macromolecules as large as several megadaltons and proceeds via specific nuclear transport receptors able to associate with components of the nuclear pore complex as well as cargo molecules that are translocated across the pore. Cargo molecules are recognized via import or export targeting signals, referred to as nuclear localization signals or nuclear export signals (NES),1 respectively (1Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 2Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 3Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). There are several types of nuclear localization signals, which mediate nuclear import by direct binding to one or more importin receptors of the α or β type (reviewed in Ref. 3Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pathways and details of signal-mediated nuclear export are less well defined. The best characterized nuclear export signal is the small, hydrophobic, leucine-rich NES, identified initially in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein (4Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) and the heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKI) (5Wen W.

Structurally and functionally related export sequences have since been detected in many cellular and viral proteins (6Dobbelstein M. Roth J. Kimberly W.T. Levine A.J. Shenk T.

Fukuda M. Mishima M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Direct interaction with the export factor CRM1 (exportin 1) is essential for the export of proteins containing a leucine-rich NES (9Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). An increasing number of actin-binding proteins has been reported to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. Already in 1993, Onoda et al. (10Onoda K., Yu, F.X. Yin H.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1993; 26: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) showed that CapG (Mbh1 or gCap39), a ubiquitous 39-kDa barbed end F-actin-binding protein particularly abundant in macrophages (11Johnston P.A., Yu, F.X. Reynolds G.A. Yin H.L. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17946-17952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein. CapG does not contain a canonical nuclear localization signal, but it has been suggested that phosphorylation of CapG may be involved in controlling the subcellular localization of the protein (12Onoda K. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4106-4112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recent data obtained from CapG null mice showed that CapG plays a role in phagocytosis and receptor membrane ruffling (13Witke W. Li W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Southwick F.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Cofilin is a major actin depolymerizing protein, and its nuclear translocation is regulated by phosphorylation in some cells (14Ohta Y. Nishida E. Sakai H. Miyamoto E. J. Biol.

Cytoskelet. 1996; 35: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There is evidence in favor of a role for actin in nuclear processes, ranging from chromatin remodelling (18Rando O.J. Zhao K. Crabtree G.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 92-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) to nuclear export (19Hofmann W. Reichart B. Ewald A. Muller E. Schmitt I.

The presence of actin-binding proteins in the nucleus suggests that actin may not merely be present in the nucleus but that its polymerization is controlled as well. Alternatively, nuclear actin-binding proteins may display functions distinct from controlling actin polymerization. For instance, supervillin, an F-actin bundling protein, contains nuclear localization signals (20Wulfkuhle J.D. Donina I.E. Stark N.H. Pope R.K. Pestonjamasp K.N. Niswonger M.L. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and associates with the androgen receptor, modulating its transcriptional activity (21Ting H.J. Yeh S. Nishimura K. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Zyxin, a component of focal adhesions, is involved in controlling mitosis through association with h-warts/LATS1, a serine/threonine kinase and constituent of the mitotic apparatus (22Hirota T.

CapG is structurally related to Dictyostelium discoideumseverin and Physarum polycephalum fragminP (FrgP). These proteins are characterized by repeats of 125–150-amino acid segments. In CapG, severin, and FrgP, the subdomains are organized in triplicate, whereas gelsolin contains six repeats. CapG displays 54% similarity with severin (23Andre E. Lottspeich F. Schleicher M.

In addition to binding the fast growing end of actin filaments, severin and fragminP display F-actin severing activity in the presence of calcium, enabling these proteins to modulate cell morphology and cell motility processes. We show here that severin and FrgP, but not CapG, contain Rev-like NESs at their N termini that control nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of these proteins. Mutation of single leucine residues in the export sequence abrogated export activity. As such, these findings may provide a molecular basis for the observed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of CapG as compared with the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of severin and FrgP. Myopodin, a muscle-specific actin bundling protein, was recently shown to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in a developmentally regulated manner (27Weins A. Schwarz K. Faul C. Barisoni L. Linke W.A. Mundel P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Delineation of a nuclear export sequence in severin and fragminP enabled us to identify a nuclear export sequence in myopodin, as well as in the Bloom syndrome protein. Texas Red-X-phalloidin and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG conjugate were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Platinum Taq HIFI polymerase, pcDNA3.1 V5-His-TOPO, pCR® T7 CT-TOPO, and anti-V5 antibody were purchased from Invitrogen. Pfu Turbo polymerase and Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pEGFP-N1 was purchased from Clontech (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Leptomycin B and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were obtained from Sigma. DEAE-cellulose (DE-52) was purchased from Whatman (Maidstone, UK).

MDCK-AZ (28Vleminckx K. Vakaet Jr., L. Mareel M. Fiers W. van Roy F. Cell. 1991; 66: 107-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar), C2C12, and HEK293T cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 10% CO2 incubator and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells seeded on rat tail collagen-coated cover slips were transfected with cDNA constructs using calcium phosphate. MDCK-AZ and C2C12 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were grown for 24–72 h before processing for microscopy. For quantitation of experimental data, 200 cells were counted and scored for GFP localization (cytoplasmic only, or cytoplasmic and nuclear). KS100 software (Zeiss) was used to calculate the ratio of nuclear fluorescence versus cytoplasmic fluorescence in transfected cells. CapG-EGFP as well as fragminP NES mutants showed a nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of 1.40 (arbitrary units), whereas FrgP(M1-L27)-CapG-EGFP and other constructs with a similar subcellular distribution were characterized by a nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of 0.71 (arbitrary units). The experiments were performed in triplicate. The mean values and standard deviations were calculated. Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 myoblasts (generously provided by Dr. J. C. Adams, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH) with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and mRNA was reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA. For PCR, 50-μl reactions were set up containing 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase, 2 μl of template cDNA, and 0.8 μmprimer. 35 cycles of PCR were performed using the following primers to obtain full-length myopodin: 5′-cgaattcgccaccatgattccttgcagtcatcaattcag-3′ and 5′-cggtggatcccgctcttccacaactgacggtttccac-3′. For myopodin lacking the NES, the primer 5′-cgaattcgccaccatgtctgaaaagcaagtgaaagaagc-3′ was used. cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His (Invitrogen). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. cDNA clones encoding FrgP, CapG, or severin were cloned into pEGFP-N1. FrgP was subcloned into CapG-pEGFP-N1 as aKpnI/AgeI fragment. CapG-FrgP chimeras were created by a unique procedure using partially complementary primers in a PCR with CapG-FrgP-pEGFP-N1 as template. In the example of swapping the CapG S3 subdomain for FrgP S3, the forward primer contains 21 nucleotides at the end of the S2 domain of CapG and 24 nucleotides at the beginning of the S3 domain of FrgP. The reverse primers contains 45 nucleotides at the end of the S2 domain of CapG, including the complementary nucleotides of the forward primer. After the addition ofPfu Turbo polymerase and temperature cycling (18 cycles), the nonmutated, parental cDNA was digested with DpnI. Following transformation, XL1-Blue supercompetent cells repair the DNA as a consequence of the 21 complementary nucleotides. Using CapG-pEGFP-N1 as a template, the coding sequence for the FrgP NES was fused N-terminally to CapG in a similar manner. The forward primer encodes amino acids 18–27 of the NES sequence, a Kozak sequence, an extra ATG codon, and 24 nucleotides of the N terminus of CapG, starting with the second codon, omitting the start codon of CapG, to prevent incorrect initiation of translation. The reverse primer contains the complementary nucleotides of the NES sequence and 24 nucleotides starting from the HindIII-cloning site in the pEGFP-N1 vector. Additional sequences were fused to CapG in separate PCRs. N-terminal tagging of the myopodin or Bloom NES to CapG-EGFP was performed according to the same strategy. Mutations in the NES-FrgP-CapG construct were generated using the Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The full-length CapG sequence was cloned into the pLT10T3 expression vector (29Mertens N. Remaut E. Fiers W. Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and transformed into Escherichia coli MC1061 that already contained the pSCM26 plasmid (30Mertens N. Remaut E. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and harbors the T7 polymerase gene (see also Ref. 24T'Jampens D. Meerschaert K. Constantin B. Bailey J. Cook L.J. De Corte V. De Mol H. Goethals M. Van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Gettemans J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1215-1226PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were grown in 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were grown to anA600 of 0.6 at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside for 4 h at 30 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 15 min and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl) by lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml, 40 min at room temperature) and sonication. Soluble CapG was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE and monoQ column. Full-length CapG cDNA was also amplified by PCR, whereby a sequence encoding a Myc tag was introduced N-terminally. This construct was cloned into the pCR T7 CT-TOPO vector, resulting in a fusion protein with a C-terminal V5 and His6 tag. Expression of this fusion protein was achieved as described above, and purification was accomplished by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE column. The cells were viewed directly for EGFP fluorescence after fixation with 3%para-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) for 20 min at room temperature and staining with DAPI. For myopodin staining, the cells were fixed, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with anti-V5 antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, and following several washes in phosphate-buffered saline incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 30 min at room temperature. Microscopic images were captured with a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope (×40 objective) equipped with an Axiocam cooled CCD camera and processed using KS100 software (Zeiss). The experiments were performed essentially as described earlier (31Gettemans J. De Ville Y. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2644-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 32Sklyarova T. De Corte V. Meerschaert K. Devriendt L. Vanloo B. Bailey J. Cook L.J. Goethals M.

Briefly, preassembled unlabeled actin filaments (final concentration, 1 μm) were used as “nuclei.” They were subsequently mixed with 3 μm G-actin (25% pyrene-labeled) in the absence or presence of untagged recombinant CapG or Myc-V5-His6-tagged CapG, in a total volume of 300 μl. The increase in fluorescence (λex, 365 nm; λem, 388 nm) was measured over time. MDCK-AZ cells transfected with fragminP-EGFP, CapG-fragminP-EGFP or NES fragminP-CapG-EGFP were treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma) and fixed 360 min after the addition of the drug. Invasion into collagen Type I was performed as described previously (33Bracke M.E. Boterberg T. Bruyneel E.A. Mareel M.M. Brooks S.A. Schumacher U. Metastasis Research Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 81-89Google Scholar). Six-well plates were filled with 1.25 ml of neutralized type 1 collagen (0.09%; w/v) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and incubated for at least 1 h at 37 °C to allow gelification. The cells were harvested using Moscona buffer and Trypsin/EDTA and seeded on top of the collagen gel. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The depth of cell migration inside the gel was measured using a phase contrast microscope controlled by a computer program. Invasive and superficial cells were counted in 12 fields of 0.157 mm2. The invasion index is the percentage of cells invading the gel over the total number of cells. The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The molecular mass of native CapG (39 kDa) is compatible with passive transport of the protein to the nucleus (2Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Despite their similar size, severin and FrgP are predominantly cytoplasmic, and these proteins are not observed in the nucleus under normal growth conditions. We cloned CapG upstream of EGFP, resulting in a fusion protein with a predicted molecular mass of 67 kDa. Transient expression of CapG-EGFP in HEK293T cells showed a distribution identical to wild type CapG (10Onoda K., Yu, F.X. Yin H.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 1993; 26: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus (Fig.1A). By contrast, FrgP-EGFP and severin-EGFP were present in the cytoplasm under these conditions. In a limited number of cells, very weak nuclear staining could be observed (Fig. 1, B–D). Western blots on crude extracts of transfected HEK293T cells showed a band corresponding with the expected molecular mass of the fusion proteins (not shown). Because passive diffusion of bovine serum albumin, a protein with similar mass (68 kDa), is extremely slow (2Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar), we considered it unlikely that CapG-EGFP (67 kDa) translocates to the nucleus by passive diffusion. We further examined nuclear trafficking of these proteins by generating a CapG-FrgP-EGFP fusion polypeptide. We expected that CapG-FrgP-EGFP would display a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization similar to those of CapG-EGFP. Surprisingly, however, the CapG-FrgP-EGFP fusion protein was present in the cytoplasm following transfection in HEK293T or MDCK cells (Fig. 2, A andB). This may be due to inhibition of interaction between CapG and a putative nuclear import factor by FrgP in the large fusion protein. Alternatively, FrgP may contain a nuclear export sequence that prevents nuclear accumulation of the CapG-FrgP-EGFP fusion protein. The second possibility was further investigated using leptomycin B (LMB), a drug that interferes with the nuclear export factor CRM1 (35Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). When MDCK cells transiently expressing CapG-FrgP-EGFP were incubated with LMB, we observed nuclear enrichment of the fusion protein (Fig.2C). Similarly, FrgP-EGFP (Fig. 2, D andE) accumulated in the nucleus upon incubation of transfected MDCK cells with LMB. These findings suggest that FrgP contains a nuclear export sequence. If CapG should lack such a regulatory sequence, it could explain why this actin-binding protein is constitutively present in the nucleus and cytoplasm under normal growth conditions. This was further investigated by transfection studies using CapG-FrgP chimerical proteins (domain swapping). To identify the putative regulatory sequences in severin, FrgP, and CapG controlling their subcellular localization, we generated CapG-FrgP chimerical proteins whereby CapG subdomains were exchanged for structurally similar FrgP subdomains (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because FrgP is cloned downstream of CapG, hybrid proteins always start with the CapG methionine residue (Table I). We predicted that when a nuclear export sequence in FrgP is deleted, the hybrid protein would be nuclear. Surprisingly, all of the chimeras showed a distribution identical to CapG-EGFP, displaying cytoplasmic as well as nuclear distribution. Even the chimera that contained 95% of the FrgP sequence and barely 5% of the CapG sequence (CapG M1-L27/FrgP Q52-D371) showed nuclear localization (Fig.3A).Table ICapG-FrgP-EGFP hybrid proteinsCapG sequenceFrgP sequenceLocationCapG(M1–A244)1-aContains the first two domains of CapG (S1 and S2) and the third domain of FrgP (S3).FrgP(K273–D371)nucl/cyt (100%)1-cnucl, nucleus. cyt, cytoplasm.CapG(M1–F125)1-bContains the first domain of CapG (S1) and the second and third domains of FrgP (S2 and S3).FrgP(H157–D371)nucl/cyt (100%)CapG(M1–P92)FrgP(V123–D371)nucl/cyt (100%)CapG(M1–L61)FrgP(P 92–D371)nucl/cyt (100%)CapG(M1–Q39)FrgP(G64–D371)nucl/cyt (100%)CapG(M1–L27)FrgP(Q52–D371)nucl/cyt (100%)1-a Contains the first two domains of CapG (S1 and S2) and the third domain of FrgP (S3).1-b Contains the first domain of CapG (S1) and the second and third domains of FrgP (S2 and S3).1-c nucl, nucleus. cyt, cytoplasm. Open table in a new tab Aligning the N-terminal regions of CapG, severin, and FrgP revealed several conserved hydrophobic residues in severin and FrgP, a hallmark of nuclear export sequences (36Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This stretch of amino acids is absent in CapG (Fig. 3B). This sequence resembles the Rev-type export signal (37Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 38Heger P. Lohmaier J. Schneider G. Schweimer K. Stauber R.H. Traffic. 2001; 2: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but the spacing between the hydrophobic amino acids is different from the Rev NES signal. We tested the functionality of this region by deleting FrgP amino acids Met1–Leu27 in CapG-FrgP-EGFP, FrgP-EGFP, and the corresponding 27 amino acids in severin-EGFP and analyzed the distribution of these truncated fusion proteins following transfection in HEK293T cells. Interestingly, fluorescence was detected in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, C–E), similar to CapG-EGFP. This result shows that the N-terminal region of severin and FrgP constitutes a functional nuclear export sequence. To ascertain whether the FrgP/severin nuclear export sequence is able to export an otherwise nuclear protein, we cloned the FrgP export sequence upstream of CapG-EGFP. Appendage of amino acids Gly18–Leu27 of FrgP to the N terminus of CapG-EGFP followed by transfection in HEK293T cells did not affect the localization of the fusion protein (not shown), suggesting that this region alone is not sufficient for nuclear export. This finding also demonstrates that modification of the CapG N terminus per sedoes not interfere with nuclear trafficking. Furthermore, a CapG fusion protein containing an N-terminal Myc tag and a C-terminal V5 epitope in addition to a His6 tag was found to cap the barbed ends of actin filaments as efficiently as the untagged recombinant protein (Fig. 4). Therefore, N-terminal attachment of amino acids does not interfere with the F-actin capping activity of the actin-binding protein. However, appendage of FrgP amino acids Leu17–Leu27, containing three leucine residues, promoted export of CapG-EGFP in 22% of the cells (Fig.5, A and D). FrgP M1-L27-CapG-EGFP, containing the full stretch of the 27 N-terminal amino acids of FrgP, promoted cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein in nearly 100% of the cells (Fig. 5, B andD), demonstrating that the FrgP N-terminal region represents a functional nuclear export sequence able to export CapG from the nucleus. Transfection of this construct into MDCK cells also resulted in a cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 5C) in the absence of LMB. However, the addition of LMB to the cells resulted in nuclear enrichment of FrgP NES-tagged CapG-EGFP (Fig. 5C′).Figure 5Role of leucine residues Leu17, Leu21, and Leu27 in the ability of the FrgPNESto export CapG to the cytoplasm.A, localization of FrgP (L17-L27)-CapG-EGFP in HEK293T cells and of FrgP(M1-L27)-CapG-EGFP following expression in HEK293T (B) or MDCK cells (C).

The values are representative of three independent experiments (means ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The FrgP nuclear export sequence contains two isoleucines and three leucine residues (Fig. 3B). In severin, Ile14 is substituted by a Val residue. To examine the contribution of these hydrophobic residues in directing nuclear export, we generated single and double point mutants in the CapG-EGFP cDNA construct that harbors the FrgP nuclear export sequence (FrgP M1-L27-CapG-EGFP). Single mutants in which either Ile9, Ile14, or Val25 were substituted by an alanine residue did not significantly prevent nuclear export of FrgP M1-L27-CapG-EGFP (I9A, 96.5% cytoplasmic; I14A, 96% cytoplasmic; and V25A, 99.5% cytoplasmic). Expression of the I9A/I14A double mutant yielded similar results (Fig. 5, E and I); 96.5% of the cells showed cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein. These results suggest that both isoleucine residues as well as Val25 do not play a significant role in export activity of the fragminP NES. Significantly, mutation of Leu17, Leu21, or Leu27 resulted in a subcellular distribution virtually identical to that of wild type CapG, tagged to EGFP (Fig. 5,F–H). These results demonstrate that the Leu17/Leu21/Leu27 triad is a critical determinant in the FrgP/severin nuclear export sequence. Fig.5I shows that the distribution of these NES mutants reverted to the typical nuclear-cytoplasmic localization pattern of CapG-EGFP in 100% of the cells observed. Recently, Weins et al. (27Weins A. Schwarz K. Faul C. Barisoni L. Linke W.A. Mundel P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reported that mouse myopodin, a muscle-specific actin-bundling protein and synaptopodin homolog, accumulates in the nucleus under stress conditions. Furthermore, myopodin shows differentiation-dependent nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution. Nuclear export of myopodin is sensitive to LMB, despite the absence of a classical NES (27Weins A. Schwarz K. Faul C. Barisoni L. Linke W.A. Mundel P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment between myopodin and FrgP/severin showed conservation of the three leucine residues, which, incidentally, are also located at the N terminus of myopodin (Fig. 6A). To examine the role of this myopodin region as a potential nuclear export sequence, we tagged this sequence onto CapG-EGFP following the same strategy as for FrgP and analyzed its distribution in transfected HEK293T cells. Surprisingly, fusion of myopodin amino acids Leu14–Leu24 to CapG-EGFP yielded no change in the subcellular localization (Fig. 6B), in contrast to FrgP L17-L27-CapG-EGFP (see above). However, the myopodin Pro3–Val13 segment on its own exported CapG-EGFP in 10% of the cells (Fig. 6C). Finally, myopodin P3-L24-CapG-EGFP gave rise to cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein in 16% of the cells (Fig. 6, D and F). This finding shows that the N-terminal region of myopodin displays weaker nuclear export activity as compared with the severin/FrgP NES. Furthermore, despite the similarity between FrgP and myopodin N-terminal regions at the primary structure level, both export sequences are probably different because the myopodin region containing the leucine-rich stretch displays no export activity, in contrast to the corresponding region in fragminP. Finally, our data do not exclude the presence of other regions in myopodin involved in controlling the subcellular distribution of this actin bundling protein. Henderson and Eleftheriou (37Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) previously predicted a putative Rev-like NES in the Bloom syndrome protein (Lys1146–Asp1163). However, this region was unable to export EGFP from the nucleus, suggesting that it is not a functional NES. Based on our data we examined the Bloom sequence for a potential NES. An 11-amino acid region in the center of the Bloom DEAD box domain (Ile749–Ile759) contains one leucine and two isoleucine residues, spaced at identical intervals as in the FrgP NES (Fig. 6A). Although the corresponding myopodin segment (Leu14–Leu24) showed no significant export activity (Fig. 6B), the Bloom amino acid sequence Ile749–Ile759 was able to export CapG-EGFP from the nucleus with an efficiency comparable with that of myopodin Pro3–Leu24; in 20% of the cells, CapG-EGFP was exported from the nucleus (Fig. 6, E–F). Secondary structure predictions did not reveal particular features that are common to the export signals of Bloom, FrgP, or myopodin, apart from the hydrophobic residues. The presence of this NES in an ATP-dependent helicase is not fully clear at present but opens up new avenues for future research. Of note, the Bloom NES and the surrounding residues are conserved in a number of other helicases. The partial effect of the myopodin NES on nuclear exclusion of CapG-EGFP, as compared with the efficiency of the FrgP/severin NES, is not unexpected. Indeed, as reported earlier (37Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 38Heger P. Lohmaier J. Schneider G. Schweimer K. Stauber R.H. Traffic. 2001; 2: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), different NES sequences do not export EGFP from the nucleus with the same efficiency. These differences in relative NES strength are physiologically relevant in that some shuttling proteins require more rapid export from the nucleus than others. Other regions in the protein may also affect the subcellular localization, as illustrated in the case of myopodin. When amino acids Met1–Leu24 of myopodin were deleted, no significant enrichment in the nucleus was observed as compared with the wild type protein following overexpression in differentiating C2C12 muscle cells (Fig.7A). In both cases, co-localization with F-actin was observed as reported previously by Weins et al. (27Weins A. Schwarz K. Faul C. Barisoni L. Linke W.A. Mundel P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), most likely because of the actin-binding region in myopodin (amino acids 410–563). Therefore, we performed collagen type I invasion experiments as an independent method to explore a potential role for the myopodin NES. Whereas HEK293T or C2C12 cells did not invade a collagen matrix (Fig. 7B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), cells expressing full-length myopodin invaded into collagen type I (Fig. 7B,lanes 3 and 7). Significantly, the myopodin deletion mutant lacking Met1–Leu24 was unable to induce collagen invasion (Fig. 7B, lanes 4 and8). This result argues in favor of a regulatory role of the myopodin export sequence in mediating collagen invasion, although its exact mode of action in this mechanism is not clear at present. Possibly, deletion of the NES perturbs the natural ability of myopodin to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm in a subtle manner, causing the mutant to reside longer in one cellular compartment. This hypothesis requires analysis of putative myopodin interaction partners that are involved in promoting invasion by the actin-binding protein. In summary, we have shown that the occurrence of a nuclear export sequence can account for the differential localization in cells of several representatives of a subfamily of gelsolin-related actin-binding proteins. The observations that CapG lacks such a NES and that it does not translocate to the nucleus in a passive manner may suggest that it plays an active role in that cell compartment. Possibly, CapG is involved in transmitting changes in actin treadmilling to the nucleus, because changes in actin dynamics are known to affect gene transcription mediated by serum response factor (39Sotiropoulos A. Gineitis D. Copeland J. Treisman R. Cell. 1999; 98: 159-169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, as shown previously for zyxin (22Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y. Marumoto T. Tada K. Hara T. Masuko N. Inagaki M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and supervillin (21Ting H.J. Yeh S. Nishimura K. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), actin may not necessarily be the target of nuclear CapG. Further studies are aimed at elucidating this question."
https://openalex.org/W2033420730,"Osteoclasts are the sole bone-resorbing cells. Heightened activity of these cells under pathological conditions leads to the development of bone loss diseases, such as osteolysis, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. We have shown previously that tumor necrosis factor α-(TNF) strongly induces osteoclastogenesis of preosteoclasts and do so through activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB. Most importantly, recent studies have shown that NF-κB is required for the development of osteoclasts. This transcription factor has also been proven as an essential mediator of inflammatory diseases including those related to bone. In this regard, we have shown that various mutated forms of IκBα are potent inhibitors of osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we examined the direct effect of DN-IκB on mature and preosteoclast development in the presence of TNF. Our findings indicate that once committed to the osteoclastogenic pathway, preosteoclasts form giant and hyperactive osteoclasts in response to TNF. However, administration of DN-IκB to cultures prior to TNF exposure averts the osteoclastogenic effect of TNF into apoptosis. Screening potential mediators of DN-IκB and TNF-induced apoptosis shows that caspase 3, caspase 9, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and Bax are activated, whereas levels of Bcl-XL, cIAP-1, and TRAF6 were reduced. Taken together, these findings suggest that under conditions of NF-κB inactivity levels of pro-survival factors are diminished, which in turn facilitates TNF induction of pro-apoptotic factors leading to apoptosis. Osteoclasts are the sole bone-resorbing cells. Heightened activity of these cells under pathological conditions leads to the development of bone loss diseases, such as osteolysis, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. We have shown previously that tumor necrosis factor α-(TNF) strongly induces osteoclastogenesis of preosteoclasts and do so through activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB. Most importantly, recent studies have shown that NF-κB is required for the development of osteoclasts. This transcription factor has also been proven as an essential mediator of inflammatory diseases including those related to bone. In this regard, we have shown that various mutated forms of IκBα are potent inhibitors of osteoclastogenesis. In this study, we examined the direct effect of DN-IκB on mature and preosteoclast development in the presence of TNF. Our findings indicate that once committed to the osteoclastogenic pathway, preosteoclasts form giant and hyperactive osteoclasts in response to TNF. However, administration of DN-IκB to cultures prior to TNF exposure averts the osteoclastogenic effect of TNF into apoptosis. Screening potential mediators of DN-IκB and TNF-induced apoptosis shows that caspase 3, caspase 9, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and Bax are activated, whereas levels of Bcl-XL, cIAP-1, and TRAF6 were reduced. Taken together, these findings suggest that under conditions of NF-κB inactivity levels of pro-survival factors are diminished, which in turn facilitates TNF induction of pro-apoptotic factors leading to apoptosis. Pathologic bone loss is generally attributed to increased recruitment and heightened activity of osteoclasts (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). These bone-resorbing cells are derived from bone marrow-residing monocyte/macrophages.

NF-κB proteins are a family of transcription factors expressed in most cell types, play an important role in the development of osteoclasts, and regulate immune and inflammatory responses (12Abu-Amer Y.

NF-κB proteins are also involved in protecting cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to cytokine treatment (17Thanos D. Maniatis T.

These events facilitate dissociation of the inhibitory protein and release of NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates target genes (19Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

In osteoclast precursor cells, members of the TNF family (RANKL and TNF) are potent activators of the NF-κB pathway and strong inducers of osteoclastogenesis (7Lacey D.L. Timms E. Tan H.L.

However, studies from knockout mice showed that in the absence of certain NF-κB molecules, the anti-apoptotic effect of NF-κB is hampered. Under these conditions, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF exert a potent pro-apoptotic outcome (20Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 22Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 23Wang C. Mayo M.W.

Invest. 2002; 109: 579-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that TNF strongly augments RANKL-primed osteoclastogenesis utilizing mechanisms that involve NF-κB activation (11Zhang Y.H. Heulsmann A. Tondravi M.M. Mukherjee A. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 563-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We have also shown that inhibition of NF-κB activation arrests osteoclastogenesis (29Abu-Amer Y. Dowdy S.F. Ross F.P. Clohisy J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30499-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examined the direct effect of TNF on osteoclasts in which the NF-κB pathway has been blocked. Our findings point out that administration of DN-IκB to osteoclasts and preosteoclasts arrests their differentiation and renders them unprotected by virtue of reduced TRAF6, Bcl-XL, and cIAP-1 expression. This process is further propagated by TNF. In this system, we document that several apoptotic factors, namely caspase 3, caspase 9, PARP, and Bax, are clearly activated. These findings suggest that TNF, in the presence of DN-IκB, induces osteoclast apoptosis through combined inhibition of cIAP-1 and activation of caspases. Reagents—Antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The ECL kit was obtained from Pierce. The TUNEL assay kit was purchased from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MD). Dominant-negative IκBα mutant was generated by N-terminal deletion of residues 1–45 using a standard PCR approach. All of the other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Lysates of unstimulated and cytochrome c (0.25 mg/ml/1 h)-stimulated Jurkat cells used as controls were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Animals—C3H/HeN male mice were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN). Cell Culture—Osteoclast precursor cells in the form of bone marrow macrophages were isolated as previously described (27Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole bone marrow of 4–6-week-old mice was collected and incubated in tissue culture plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF (27Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. Edwards J. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). After 24 h in culture, the nonadherent cells were collected and layered on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. Cells at the gradient interface were collected, plated in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 ng/ml M-CSF, and plated according to each experimental condition. Osteoclast Generation—Osteoclasts were generated by culturing purified precursor cells in the presence of M-CSF and soluble RANKL (10–20 ng/ml each) for 4 days. Bona fide osteoclasts develop on day 3–4 of culture at a point when cells are fixed and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-stained or subjected to further treatments. DN-TAT:IκB was added at 5 ng/ml on day 3 of culture followed (after 2 h) by TNF (10 ng/ml). The cultures were then continued for an additional day, after which they were processed for immunostaining, immunoblots, or TUNEL assay. Immunostaining—Bone marrow macrophages were plated on multi-well coverslips in the absence or presence (1 h) of DN-TAT:IκB. The cells were then fixed and stained with anti-HA antibody and detected with fluorescent secondary antibody. Immunoblotting—Total cell lysates were boiled in the presence of 2× SDS sample buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, distilled water) for 5 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 8–12% SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a semi-dry blotter (Bio-Rad) and incubated in blocking solution (10% skim milk prepared in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) to reduce nonspecific binding. The membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween buffer and exposed to primary antibodies (1 h at room temperature), washed again four times, and incubated with the respective secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1 h at room temperature). The membranes were washed extensively (5 × 15 min), and an ECL detection assay was performed following the manufacturer's directions. pTAT Construct and Protein Coupling—IκBα constructs were cloned into the pTAT-HA bacterial expression vector previously described by Nagahara et al. (31Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar), which contains a six-histidine tag, for easy purification; an HA tag for detection followed by the TAT transduction domain; and finally the IκB sequence. The resultant plasmid, pTAT-IκB, was transformed into the DH5α strain of Escherichia coli. The transformants were screened initially by restriction enzyme mapping. A recombinant containing the correct restriction fragments was then sequenced on both strands. This plasmid was then used to express the TAT-coupled IκBα in the BL21 (DE3) strain of E. coli. Following a 4–6 h of induction, the cells were sonicated in 8 m urea, and the TAT-coupled IκBα was purified on a nickel-Sepharose column (Qiagen) and then applied to an ionic exchange column (Mono Q) in 4 m urea. To shock misfold the protein, the ionic exchange column was switched in one step from 4 m urea to aqueous buffer (20 mm HEPES). IκBα was eluted by stepping from 50 mm to 1 m NaCl followed by desalting on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Corp.) into phosphate-buffered saline or 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 137 mm NaCl and frozen in 10% glycerol at –80 °C. pTAT-coupled and misfolded proteins remain highly concentrated and resistant to freeze-thaw denaturation and readily enter the cells upon incubation. Once in hand, the coupled TAT proteins were added to cultured marrow cells without the aid of transfection agents. TdT-mediated dUTP-Biotin Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay— The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and washed at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline. The slides were then covered with 0.1% H2O2 in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature in a closed container to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After washing the slides were then covered with TdT reaction buffer to rinse out Tris-buffered saline. The solution was then removed, and 25 μl of TdT/digoxigenin-dUTP mix was added to each well. The slides were incubated for 45–60 min at 37 °C in a humidified container. Detection was performed by incubating slides with anti-digoxigenin primary antibody solution for 1 h at room temperature in a closed container followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Color was then developed by incubating slides with substrate working solution for 10–20 min at room temperature. The slides were then transferred to Methyl Green solution and incubated for 1 min followed by sequential washes with 70, 95, and 100% ethanol and two washes with Xylene. The slides were mounted and visualized by light microscope. Generation and Expression of DN-IκB—IκBα directly binds to and inhibits NF-κB activation. N-terminal phosphorylation of IκBα facilitates dissociation of NF-κB and subsequent nuclear translocation and activation. To permanently prevent NF-κB activation we utilized a dominant-negative form of IκBα that lacks all possible N-terminal phosphorylation sites. In short, we deleted amino acids 1–45 and ligated the remaining 46–317 amino acids into pTAT plasmid for protein expression (not shown). Bacterial expression of DN-IκB was then confirmed by immunoblots compared with endogenous expression in macrophages (Fig. 1A). We have successfully utilized the pTAT transduction system to introduce IκBα, STAT6, and other proteins into macrophages and osteoclasts (29Abu-Amer Y. Dowdy S.F. Ross F.P. Clohisy J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30499-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Abu-Amer Y. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1375-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). DN-IκB Localizes to Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Compartments and Inhibits NF-κB Activation—Following protein expression and purification, the deleted IκBα protein was added to osteoclast cultures for 2 h. The cells were then fractionated to separate cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Immunoblots using anti-HA antibody show that pTAT-IκB is present in both fractions and most abundant in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 1B). The protein is abundant in cytosols and nuclei within 1 h, and its levels remain elevated up to 24 and 8 h, respectively (Fig. 1B). The relative short time of protein retention in the nuclei may be due to nuclear transport and clearance of the protein from this compartment. Next we examined whether the newly transduced DN-IκB is active. To accomplish this goal, we tested whether DN-IκB is capable of inhibiting TNF-induced NF-κB activation. To this end, cells in the absence or presence of DN-IκB (60 min) were challenged with TNF for 30 min. At the end of incubation cells were processed for nuclear extraction, and NF-κB activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results depicted in Fig. 1C clearly show that DN-IκB potently inhibits TNF-induced activation of NF-κB. DN-IκB Induces Apoptosis of Osteoclast Precursors (Macrophages) by TNF—Marrow-derived macrophages are the precursor cells that in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF undergo osteoclastogenesis in an NF-κB-dependent process. We have shown previously that specific inhibition of NF-κB activation arrests osteoclastogenesis (29Abu-Amer Y. Dowdy S.F. Ross F.P. Clohisy J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30499-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of the transcription factor was not investigated in TNF-stimulated precursor cells that have not been primed with RANKL and hence do not have high NF-κB activity. Thus, we asked whether DN-IκB inhibits NF-κB stimulation by TNF in osteoclast precursor cells. Our findings indicate that TNF alone exerts morphological changes typical for inflammatory-primed cells, such as spreading and cytoplasmic granulation (Fig. 2b). Limited morphological changes, such as cellular shrinkage and DNA condensation, were observed when DN-IκB alone was added to macrophages (Fig. 2c, arrow), suggesting that the inhibitory protein likely initiated DNA condensation and morphological change by merely interfering with NF-κB availability. More importantly, in the presence of DN-IκB, TNF exerts a potent apoptotic signal on macrophages evident by TUNEL assay (Fig. 2d). The data demonstrate that under combined treatment with both proteins, the cells exhibit all of the major morphological hallmarks of apoptosis, including, shrinkage, membrane shredding, DNA condensation, and fragmentation. DN-IκB Renders Osteoclasts Sensitive to Apoptosis by TNF— NF-IκB is an anti-apoptotic factor essential for osteoclastogenesis and in part mediates the osteoclastogenic properties of TNF. Therefore, we asked whether inhibition of NF-κB alters the TNF pro-osteoclastogenic response by RANKL-primed precursors. As we have published previously (11Zhang Y.H. Heulsmann A. Tondravi M.M. Mukherjee A. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 563-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 29Abu-Amer Y. Dowdy S.F. Ross F.P. Clohisy J.C. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30499-30503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), TNF mounts a strong osteoclast response when added to preosteoclast cultures (Fig. 3A, panel a). Interestingly, however, administration of DN-IκB to primed osteoclast cultures significantly inhibits osteoclast formation. More importantly, TNF in the presence of DN-IκB caused a marked reduction and shrinkage of osteoclasts typical for apoptotic processes (Fig. 3A, panel d). The apoptotic effect is obvious as shown by chromatin condensation (compare nuclei in panels c and f) and overall cytoplasmic shredding (compare panels b and e). The inhibitory effect of DN-IκB on osteoclast formation was obvious when multi-nucleated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclasts were counted (Fig. 3B). The data demonstrate that although TNF causes an approximate 5-fold increase in osteoclast number, inclusion of DN-IκB for the same time period (1-day) led to complete inhibition of cytokine-induced osteoclastogenesis. In fact, osteoclast formation in the presence of DN-IκB and TNF was 68% lower than control (p < 0.005) and a statistically insignificant 18% below control when treated with DN-IκB alone. Osteoclast Programmed Death by DN-IκB and TNF Is Mediated at Least in Part by Caspase 3, Caspase 9, and PARP— TNF, based on precise and cell-specific machinery, induces pro- and anti-apoptotic signals. Evidence from our studies as well as others indicates that under normal circumstances TNF activates NF-κB in primed osteoclast precursors and supports survival of osteoclasts (33Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P.

Inhibition of NF-κB, however, diverts TNF signaling toward a pro-apoptotic avenue. To investigate the mechanisms underlying TNF-mediated apoptosis of osteoclast precursors, RANKL-primed cells were treated with TNF in the absence or presence of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα. The cells were then lysed and screened for caspases, the mediators of apoptosis. Our data show that caspases 3 and 9 and PARP are activated in cells treated with DN-IκB and TNF (Fig. 4). Activation is evident by cleavage of the precursor zymogen yielding the active subunits relevant to each protein. We also observed activation of caspase 9 in the presence of DN-IκB alone, although this activation was not evident in the downstream proteins, namely caspase 3 and PARP. No evidence of activation of caspases 7 and 8 was observed. DN-IκB Facilitates TNF Induction of Apoptosis by Blocking and/or Reducing Expression of Key Signaling and Pro-survival Molecules—To further examine the mechanism underlying this DN-IκB-dependent, TNF-induced apoptosis, we turned to investigate parallel pathways known to play essential roles in signaling cell survival and death. Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL are members of the Bcl/Bax family that differentially regulate apoptosis. Our findings point out that TNF and DN-IκB significantly increase the expression of Bax (Fig. 5A). Specifically, TNF and DN-IκB increased Bax expression levels by 5- and 8-fold, respectively, as measured by densitometric analysis. Combined addition of both proteins resulted in slight increase in Bax expression (10-fold) compared with control. In addition, although not affecting basal level expression, DN-IκB inhibits TNF induction of Bcl-XL expression (Fig. 5B). No effect on Bcl-2 was observed (not shown). Thus, an increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-XL supports apoptosis and further substantiates caspase-mediated apoptosis. Osteoclasts, similar to other cells, possess survival machinery inducible by cytokines and various growth factors. Given that cIAP protein is central in protecting cells, we examined expression of this protein in osteoclasts treated with various combinations of TNF and DN-IκB. The data depicted in Fig. 6A indicate that TNF induces expression of cIAP-1 by 23- and 18-fold compared with Tat and Tat+I, respectively. The TNF-induced increase was partially blocked (74%) by DN-IκB. We also examined the expression of TRAF2 and TRAF6; the latter factor is essential for osteoclastogenesis, and both proteins are required for osteoclast signaling. Although no obvious differences in TRAF2 expression were observed (not shown), DN-IκB reduced TRAF6 expression levels in the absence or presence of TNF (Fig. 6B). TNF family members, especially RANKL and TNF, utilize mechanisms directed at activation of NF-κB to promote osteoclastogenesis (26Abu-Amer Y. Erdmann J. Alexopoulous L. Kollias G. Teitelbaum S.L. J.

Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), regulates secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and TNF (25Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 89: 4333-4337Google Scholar, 37Lawrence T. Gilroy D. Colcille-Nash P. Willoughby D. Nat.

Res. 2000; 18: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These cytokines are capable of directly activating the transcription factor, thus establishing a positive feedback cycle that amplifies osteoclastogenesis and associated inflammatory bone loss. This cycle, if not attenuated, leads to a vicious and progressive bone loss. In this regard, evidence from our previous studies point out that TNF exerts a strong osteoclastogenic effect when added to RANKL-primed osteoclast precursors (11Zhang Y.H. Heulsmann A. Tondravi M.M. Mukherjee A. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 563-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Heightened osteoclastic activity under these conditions was associated with elevated levels of active NF-κB (11Zhang Y.H. Heulsmann A. Tondravi M.M. Mukherjee A. Abu-Amer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 563-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These are classical patho-osteoclastogenic features typical for osteolytic diseases. Therefore, TNF induction of NF-κB and subsequent anti-apoptotic molecules, such as TRAFs and cIAPs that antagonize caspases and cell death, protect prolonged osteoclast presence and activity. These events point to NF-κB as a centerpiece of the pathoosteoclastogenic response. Switching this transcription factor off not only arrests the pathologic process but in the presence of preexisting pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, would lead to adverse effects, namely cell death and reduction of osteoclast numbers. Our data confirm this notion. In this regard, a potent osteoclastic response exerted by TNF (Fig. 3) turns deadly in the presence of DN-IκB. The most likely scenario according to these data is that DN-IκB forms a complex with NF-κB and inhibits its activation as evident by the gel shift analysis. This complex resists phosphorylation by upstream kinases because it lacks all of the potential N-terminal phosphorylation sites. This action of arresting NF-κB activation compromises NF-κB-mediated anti-apoptotic events, thus tilting the balance of TNF action toward induction of apoptosis. This proposition is supported by our finding that DN-IκB and TNF combined treatment activates caspases 3 and 9, PARP, and Bax and causes DNA condensation and cytoplasmic shredding (Figs. 3 and 4). Our findings are in agreement with previous reports in which adenoviral delivery of DN-IκB (super-repressor) to chemoresistant tumors in mice sensitizes these cells to undergo apoptosis in response to TNF or other therapeutic agents resulting in tumor regression (39Wang C.Y. Cusack Jr., J.C. Liu R. Baldwin Jr., A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). NF-κB regulates the expression of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and TNF, all known as pro-osteoclastogenic factors. Attenuation of NF-κB activation often leads to a decline in the expression of these cytokines, as we and other have reported in previous studies (33Abu-Amer Y. Ross F.P. McHugh K.P. Livolsi A. Peyron J.F. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29417-29423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 35Franzoso G. Carlson L. Poljak L. Shores E. Brown K. Leonardi A. Tran T. Boyce B. Siebenlist U. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3482-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that in the absence of NF-κB-directed endogenous cytokine support for osteoclast differentiation, proliferation, and survival, TNF action is averted toward an apoptosis-susceptible osteoclast. DN-IκB, in the absence of TNF, appears to have little or no effect on certain pro-apoptotic factors. This is evident in the case of caspase 3 and PARP activation (Fig. 4). The requirement of TNF to further potentate osteoclast death is likely due to the complexity of the osteoclast survival machinery. Namely, NF-κB unrelated pathways such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt cascades might be able to maintain survival of osteoclasts under physiological conditions (40Miyazaki T. Katagiri H. Kanegae Y. Takayanagi H. Sawada Y. Yamamoto A. Pando M.P. Asano T. Verma I.M. Oda H. Nakamura K. Tanaka S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 41Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These signaling pathways, however, may not be able to withstand a direct TNF-transmitted apoptotic signal in the absence of NF-κB. In support of this speculation, it is clear that in the presence of TNF, direct administration of DN-IκB seems to facilitate programmed death of osteoclasts. In this regard, it has been shown that treatment of isolated osteoclasts with antisense oligonucleotides to the p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB or with NF-κB inhibitory agents such as pyrralidinedithiocarbamate- and tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-induced apoptosis (42Boyce B.F. Xing L. Fransozo G. Siebenlist U. Bone. 1999; 25: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 43Xing L. Bushnell T. Carlson L. Tai Z. Tondravi M. Siebenlist U. Young F. Boyce B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1200-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, our observations indicate that DN-IκB, in the absence of TNF, is a poor inducer of osteoclast apoptosis. It appears likely that NF-κB inhibition alone compromises cellular protection mechanisms and sets the stage for cytokine-driven programmed cell death. These speculations are in agreement with recent findings by Xing et al. (43Xing L. Bushnell T. Carlson L. Tai Z. Tondravi M. Siebenlist U. Young F. Boyce B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1200-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which reported that although p50 and p52 NF-κB subunits are required for osteoclast formation, the absence of these subunits does not cause further apoptosis of osteoclasts (43Xing L. Bushnell T. Carlson L. Tai Z. Tondravi M. Siebenlist U. Young F. Boyce B. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1200-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, in this model neither the apoptotic outcome of stimulation with TNF nor the role of other key NF-κB molecules, such as p65, were investigated. Thus, although it is likely that under unstimulated conditions, p50 and p52 may not exert an anti-apoptotic effect, other NF-κB members, particularly p65, might be essential for osteoclast survival. Furthermore, genetic adaptation of NF-κB-null cells to acquire other compensatory mechanisms in the knockout mouse should be considered. Programmed cell death is governed by complex pathways that intersect negatively and positively at various levels and compartments. To further elucidate the mechanism underlying DN-IκB/TNF-induced apoptosis, we investigated the role of Bcl/Bax family in osteoclast death. Traditionally, these proteins regulate the pro-apoptotic cytochrome c/Apaf1 pathway, whereby Bax activates and Bcl-XL inhibits this pathway. Clearly, the increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-XL supports apoptosis and complements caspase activation. NF-κB protects cells by induction of various gene products. Cellular inhibitors of apoptosis have immerged as central to transmitting NF-κB-related anti-apoptotic signals. Furthermore, cIAPs play a rate-limiting role in NF-κB activation because they are required for upstream activation of the transcription factor in a positive feedback loop. Moreover, a direct anti-apoptotic effect of these proteins over caspases 3 and 9 has been established (44Deveraux Q.L. Roy N. Stennicke H.R. Van Arsdale T. Zhou Q. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2215-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar, 45Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.

We find that combined treatment of osteoclasts with DN-IκB and TNF reduces cIAP-1 expression. In what appears as consequential events, NF-κB activation and TRAF6 protein expression, another integral protein required for osteoclastogenesis, are reduced. Thus, it is conceivable that insufficient levels of cIAP-1 are no longer able to maintain caspases 3 and 9 under control, which leads directly to intensification of the apoptotic event. A plausible explanation for reduced levels of cIAP-1 in the presence of DN-IκB stems from recent findings implicating caspases as partially responsible for cleavage of cIAPs (46Herrara B. Fernandez M. Benito M. Fabregant I. FEBS Lett. 2002; 520: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47Doyle B.T. O'Neill A.J. Newsholme P. Fitzpatrick J.M. Watson R.W.G. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies apoptosis of osteoclasts was achieved by exposure to osteoprotegrin, a soluble TNF receptor family member and RANKL decoy molecule (36Lacey D.L. Tan H.L. Lu J. Kaufman S. Van G. Qiu W. Rattan A. Scully S. Fletcher F. Juan T. Kelley M. Burgess T.L. Boyle W.J. Polverino A.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 435-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This protein acts upstream by interfering with RANK/RANKL binding. It is unlikely that osteoprotegrin plays a part in the DN-IκB/TNF-mediated apoptosis of osteoclasts that we describe in this study. This notion is supported by the facts that 1) we used a relatively osteoblast-devoid pure population of osteoclast precursors that do not express or secrete osteoprotegrin and 2) RANKL was added exogenously at levels that permit osteoclastogenesis and was maintained continuously throughout the duration of the culture. In summary, we have used a convenient tool, namely a TAT fusion system that permits efficient delivery of DN-IκB into osteoclasts and their precursors. Our data indicate that DN-IκB attenuates NF-κB activation and in the presence of TNF, which alone is a pro-osteoclastogenic factor, leads to osteoclast apoptosis. The mechanism of this cell death includes reduction in cIAP-1 expression leading to activation of caspases and up-regulation of Bax/Bcl-XL ratio. These finding may provide the basis for designing strategies to block bone loss because of heightened osteoclast activity."

MAPKs possess a phosphorylation motif that comprises a Thr-X-Tyr sequence. Upon activation of the relevant pathway this motif is dually phosphorylated, leading to structural changes and a dramatic increase in specific activity (7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Current models of MAPK activation suggest that phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr at the phosphorylation motif is an absolute requirement for activation. Substitution of any one of these phosphoacceptors diminishes the kinase activity as detected by in vitro kinase assays (9Prowse C.N. Deal M.S. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40817-40823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

Although both Thr and Tyr seem to be equally important for catalysis, the three-dimensional structures of phosphorylated ERK2 and p38γ suggested that the Thr-183 residue contributes more significantly to stabilization of the active form (5Bellon S. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fox T. Hsiao H.M. Wilson K.P. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1057-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, Thr-183 forms ionic and hydrogen bonds with the N-terminal domain, thereby promoting domain closure. Tyr-185 is positioned to participate in substrate recognition. Recently we reported the isolation of MAPK kinase-independent hyperactive MAPK mutants of both the yeast Hog1 and the human p38α (12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These MAPKs were rendered intrinsically active by point mutations in either the L16 domain (mutations F318L, F318S, F322L, W320R, and W332R in Hog1) or the phosphorylation lip (D170A in Hog1) and were shown to rescue pbs2Δ cells from high osmolarity (12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although manifested very high basal activities, the catalytic activity of the mutants was further increased when cells were exposed to osmotic stress. The goal of this work was to examine the exact role of Tyr-176 or Thr-174 phosphorylation in Hog1 catalytic and biological activity. We show that in the hyperactive mutants Tyr-176 is required mainly for enhancing catalytic activity following osmostress, whereas Thr-174 is essential for biological and catalytic activity although not necessarily as a phosphoacceptor. Unexpectedly, when Tyr-176 was replaced with Phe in the wild type Hog1 enzyme, most of its catalytic activity was abolished, but its biological activity was maintained. We suggest that Thr phosphorylation stabilizes an active catalytic conformation that is independent of Tyr phosphorylation. Tyr phosphorylation serves to further amplify the basal activity in response to external signals. Strains used in this study were thepbs2Δ strain MAY1 and the hog1Δ strain JBY13 (12Bell M. Capone R.

Dual phosphorylation of both Thr and Tyr at the phosphorylation lip is considered an absolute requirement for MAPK activation (10Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D.

The recently isolated hyperactive Hog1 mutants do not require the MAPK kinase Pbs2 for their activity and therefore seem to have escaped the requirement of phosphorylation (12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by the fact that when Tyr-176 was mutated to Phe the Hog1 mutants remained biologically active, i.e. they rescued hog1Δ and pbs2Δ cells from hyperosmotic shock (Ref. 12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and Fig.1). Also attempts to directly measure dual phosphorylation of the hyperactive mutants (expressed inpbs2Δ cells) using α-phospho-p38 antibodies revealed no or very low phosphorylation levels (depending on the particular mutant; see Fig. 6 in Bell et al.

However, when Thr-174 was mutated to Ala, all Hog1 variants lost the capability to rescuepbs2Δ cells and even hog1Δ cells from osmotic stress (12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), strongly suggesting that Thr-174 has a more central role in Hog1 activity.Figure 6Hog1Y176F is capable of inducing Hog1 target genes in hog1Δ cells.Hog1WT or Hog1Y176F was subcloned into the pRS426 plasmid and expressed under the native HOG1 promoter in hog1Δ cells.

HAL3 was used as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether differences in biological activity of the mutants reflect differences in catalytic activity, we immunoprecipitated the various proteins and analyzed their catalytic activity in vitro. As expected, Hog1WT completely lost its catalytic activity when mutated in either Thr-174 or Tyr-176 (Fig.2, left panel, lanes 3–8). In contrast, the catalytic activity of Hog1 hyperactive mutants that also harbored a Y176F mutation was readily observed (with the exception of Y68H,Y176F that manifested low activity; Fig. 2). Notably active mutants harboring the T174A mutation lost activity altogether (see clones T174A,F318L and T174A,F318S in Fig. 2). When tested in pbs2Δ cells, three mutants (Y176F,D170A; Y176F,F318L; and Y176F,F318S) manifested catalytic activity (see Supplemental Fig. 1S). Interestingly the activity of Hog1Y176F,F322L that was high in hog1Δ cells was barely measurable in pbs2Δ cells (see Supplemental Fig. 1S). The parental enzyme Hog1F322L was fully active inpbs2Δ cells (see Supplemental Fig. 2S), suggesting that this particular variant became Pbs2-dependent by the Y176F mutation. However, Hog1Y176F,F322L could rescuepbs2Δ cells (see Fig. 7 in Bell et al. (12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol.

Most of the hyperactive Hog1 mutants acquired very high catalytic activity that is independent of salt induction. Yet this activity was further enhanced when cells were exposed to salt (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol.

The results shown in Fig. 2 suggest that when mutated in Tyr-176 the basal catalytic activity of the mutants was not lost, but their ability to further enhance activity in response to salt induction was compromised. To verify this point we measured kinase activity of the Hog1D170A and Hog1F318L molecules side by side with the Hog1D170A,Y176F and Hog1F318L,Y176Fderivatives. The results clearly show that the basal catalytic activity of the hyperactive mutants harboring Phe at position 176 was similar to that of the active mutants carrying the native Tyr-176 (Fig.3). However, whereas the activity of the Hog1 hyperactive molecules increased upon exposure to salt, molecules mutated in Tyr-176 were not as responsive to salt (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the catalytic activity of the hyperactive Hog1 alleles could be divided to two levels: 1) an intrinsic activity, acquired through the activating mutations, that is Pbs2-independent, salt-independent, and Tyr-176-independent; and 2) an enhanced activity that is salt-dependent. In most mutants an intact Tyr-176 is important for the enhanced activity and is dispensable for the intrinsic activity. Intact Thr-174 is essential for all levels of activity of the wild type and the hyperactive Hog1 mutants (Fig. 2). It seems that Thr-174 is essential for catalytic and biological activity of the hyperactive mutants. The question remains whether this residue is required as a phosphoacceptor or is essential due to conformational reasons. To address this question we analyzed the phosphorylation state of Thr-174 in some of the active mutants using α-phospho-Thr antibodies (Fig. 4). The results show that when expressed in pbs2Δ cells the active mutants manifested either barely or no detectable Thr phosphorylation (Fig. 4, right panel). When expressed in hog1Δ cells Thr(P) was clearly detected in all hyperactive Hog1 molecules (Fig. 4, left panel). In fact, Thr-174 in the hyperactive Hog1 alleles seemed to have elevated basal phosphorylation levels when Tyr-176 was mutated. Since the active mutants manifested clear catalytic activity in pbs2Δ cells (Fig.3B) but were not significantly phosphorylated on any Thr residue in this strain (Fig. 4), we conclude that Thr-174 is not required for kinase activity as a phosphoacceptor but rather as an essential structural component. As expected (9Prowse C.N. Deal M.S. Lew J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40817-40823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), when we mutated each of the phosphoacceptors in wild type Hog1 we could not measure any kinase activity (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). We expected that these mutants would not show any biological activity either (16Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when overexpressed, Hog1Y176F was able to rescue hog1Δ cells from osmotic shock (Fig.5). In contrast, Thr-174 was found to be essential for biological activity as Hog1T174A or even Hog1T174E did not rescue hog1Δ cells (Fig. 5 and Supplemental Fig. 3S). Our inability to detect any catalytic activity of Hog1Y176Fon one hand (Fig. 2) and the fact that Hog1Y176F is biologically active on the other hand (Fig. 5) led us to test whether Hog1Y176F supports growth on salt by activating the authentic downstream targets of the Hog1 pathway. To this end we analyzed RNA levels of GPD1, GPP2, andSTL1. In hog1Δ cells these genes did not show significant increase in RNA levels following exposure to salt (Fig.6, lanes 1–7). In contrast, when Hog1 or Hog1Y176F were expressed, a significant elevation in the transcription of these genes was detected following salt induction (Fig. 6, lanes 12–14 and 19–21). It appears that Hog1Y176F is capable of inducing expression of these genes to nearly wild type levels, explaining its ability to support growth on salt. To test whether Hog1Y176F is capable of imposing the most extreme Hog1-dependent phenotype (i.e. growth arrest) we expressed this variant in cells that also expressed the constitutively active PBS2 allelePBS2DD. PBS2DD was previously shown to induce growth arrest, depending on the presence of intact Hog1 (23Bilsland-Marchesan E. Arino J. Saito H. Sunnerhag P. Posas F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in Supplemental Fig. 4S, Pbs2DD induced growth arrest of cells expressing Hog1WT as expected. Cells expressing Pbs2DD and Hog1Y176F were able to grow (Supplemental Fig. 4S) on galactose. Thus, Hog1Y176F is capable of executing important functions of Hog1 (Figs. 5 and 6) but is probably not maximally activated (Supplemental Fig. 4S). The ability of Hog1Y176Fto efficiently induce gene expression suggests that although the catalytic activity of Hog1Y176F was below the threshold of our in vitro assay the enzyme was activated in the cell. We could not obtain an indication that this is the case because α-phospho-Thr antibodies did not react with Hog1Y176F(Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). Although this result may suggest that Hog1Y176F is not phosphorylated on Thr-174, we decided to further explore the issue through the use of antibodies against the dually phosphorylated p38. We speculated that these antibodies might recognize determinants of the active conformation of the phosphorylation motif and not merely the phosphorylated residues. This idea was based on the results of Bardwell et al. (14Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2887-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) who showed that α-phospho-ERK antibodies react with Thr-183 phosphorylated Kss1Y185F. We found (lane 6 in Fig. 7) that α-phospho-p38 reacted with Hog1Y176F after salt induction. This result supports the notion that Hog1Y176F was activated in vivo to some level. We believe that this low activity was responsible for the induction of gene expression shown in Fig. 6, which enabled growth ofhog1Δ cells on hyperosmotic medium (Fig. 5). Many enzymes, receptors, and transcription factors are regulated through phosphorylation (18Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 19Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5001-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 20Cohen P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 21Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3109) Google Scholar). MAPKs are considered unusual as their activation requires concomitant dual phosphorylation of neighboring Thr and Tyr residues. This report provides evidence that at least for the yeast MAPK Hog1 this dogma only partially holds. With respect to biological activity Tyr phosphorylation plays a partial role. Mutating Tyr-176 to Phe in the hyperactive Hog1 alleles revealed that this residue functions in enhancing catalytic activity of these molecules by Pbs2 but has no role in the elevated intrinsic activity of those alleles (Fig. 3). Furthermore it appears that Tyr-176 might have an inhibitory effect on the basal activity of the hyperactive mutants as Hog1F318L,Y176F shows a higher catalytic activity in comparison with Hog1F318L in pbs2Δ cells (Fig.3B, right panel, lanes 7–10). It must be noted that these roles of Tyr-176 may be specific to the hyperactive mutants. However, the results obtained with Hog1WT mutated in Tyr-176 suggested that these roles might be relevant to the native protein as well. In wild type Hog1, mutating Tyr-176 resulted in a dramatic decrease of catalytic activity below our detection level (Fig. 2). However, Hog1Y176F, unlike Hog1T174A or even Hog1T174E, was probably catalytically active at a low levelin vivo, a level sufficient for induction of target genes (Fig. 6) and for rescuing hog1Δ cells from hyperosmotic shock (Fig. 5). It was not sufficient, however, to mediate Pbs2DD-induced growth arrest (Supplemental Fig. 4S) suggesting that Tyr-176 phosphorylation is required to obtain some further increase in activity, a case similar to that observed in the hyperactive mutants (Fig. 3). The unexpected capabilities of Hog1Y176F led us to carefully inspect previous studies in which MAPKs carrying similar mutations were used. Schüller et al. (16Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) suggested that Hog1T174A and Hog1Y176F cannot support growth of hog1Δ cells on hyperosmotic media. However, careful inspection of their data reveals that Hog1Y176F-expressing cells (but not cells expressing Hog1T174A) did grow on 0.4 m KCl but grew very poorly on 0.9 m KCl (16Schuller C. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Tyr phosphorylation may be required for extreme conditions. The notion that Hog1Y176Fis biologically active was also raised by Warkma et al.(22Warmka J. Hanneman J. Lee J. Amin D. Ota I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). How crucial is tyrosine phosphorylation for the biological activity of MAPKs other than Hog1? In the case of Kss1, mutating Tyr-185 to Phe did not abolish biological activity completely as cells expressing Kss1Y185F were capable of inducing invasive growth to some extent (14Bardwell L. Cook J.G. Voora D. Baggott D.M. Martinez A.R. Thorner J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2887-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Gartner et al. (15Gartner A. Nasmyth K. Ammerer G. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1280-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) reported that in Fus3 dual phosphorylation is essential for biological activity. Importantly none of these studies provided sufficient quantitative information regarding the catalytic and biological activities of the mutated MAPK. Based on the available data, we believe that the case of Hog1 analyzed here reflects a general situation in MAPK activation. Namely for many MAPK molecules Tyr phosphorylation may not be as vital as Thr phosphorylation for biological activity. Structural studies revealed that in both ERK2 and p38 phospho-Thr forms important networks of interactions that appear to be critical for stabilizing the active conformation of the enzyme (5Bellon S.

Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This information coincides with our results, which show that Thr-174 is essential for both biological and catalytic activity (Bell et al. (12Bell M. Capone R. Pashtan I. Levitzki A. Engelberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25351-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2). However, it appears that in the hyperactive alleles Thr-174 is important mainly for structural reasons and not as a phosphoacceptor (Fig. 4). One may speculate that the activating mutations maneuver Thr-174 toward the L16 domain and stabilize an active conformation that is not phosphorylated. Upon phosphorylation Thr-174 forms stronger interactions with residues in L16 resulting in a more active conformation. Phospho-Tyr appears to be involved in changing the conformation of the substrate (P + 1) recognition site (7Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40817-40823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the hyperactive alleles, it was possible to obtain a more detailed insight into the role of Tyr-176 in Hog1 catalysis and to reveal that it is not essential as a stabilizer of the active conformation but is more important as an amplifier of enzyme activity.

Previous studies indicate that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is significantly induced with the onset of terminal differentiation of C2 myoblasts. We have investigated the part played by the MAPK pathway in the differentiation of C2 myoblasts. Specific activation of MAPK by expression of an active Raf1-estrogen receptor chimera protein reduced significantly the number of myoblasts undergoing programmed cell death in the differentiation medium. Activation of Raf1 prevented the proteolytic activation of the proapoptotic caspase 9-protein during differentiation. The antiapoptotic function of Raf1 correlated with accumulation of the p21WAF1 protein resulting from its increased stability. Antisense expression of p21 was used to determine whether the p21WAF1 protein mediated the antiapoptotic activity of Raf1. Reduction of p21WAF1 protein in muscle cells abolished the antiapoptotic activity of the MAPK pathway. We conclude that MAPK contributes to muscle differentiation by preventing apoptotic cell death of differentiating myoblasts and that this activity is mediated by stabilization of the p21WAF1 protein.

During myogenesis, proliferating myoblasts withdraw permanently from the cell cycle, express muscle-specific genes, and fuse into multinucleated myotubes.

Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). During the process of in vitro differentiation of myogenic cell lines a large fraction of myoblasts is lost through apoptotic cell death, but terminally differentiated myotubes are more resistant. It is generally accepted that myoblasts are exposed to apoptotic cell death during the gross changes occurring in the differentiation process. Those myoblasts that cannot complete the process because of incomplete withdrawal from the cell cycle are subjected to apoptotic cell death (1Walsh K. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The resistance of myoblasts to apoptosis was found to be correlated with the induction of p21WAF1 cdk inhibitor and hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, molecules that participate in the withdrawal from the cell cycle (2Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In addition, forced expression of p21WAF1 blocked apoptosis during the differentiation of C2 cells, whereas inhibition of p21WAF1 by antisense oligonucleotides induced frequent apoptosis (2Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Also, mice deficient in both p21WAF1 and p57 cdk inhibitors have defective muscle formation and exhibit increased rates of myoblast apoptosis (3Zhang P. Wong C. Liu D. Finegold M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The effect of p21WAF1 on myoblast survival is likely to be determined by its capacity to induce the activity of pRb. Consistent with this idea are results showing that pRb-deficient (Rb-/-) myoblast cells undergo higher rates of apoptosis during differentiation than their wild type counterparts (4Wang J. Guo K. Wills K.N. Walsh K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 351-354PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, transgenic mice expressing low levels of pRb display substantial cell death of muscle tissue prior to the onset of terminal differentiation (5Zacksenhaus E. Jiang Z. Chung D. Marth J.D. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Taken together these studies suggest that defects in those proteins that induce permanent withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle may trigger apoptotic cell death. Although the function of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) as inducers of muscle survival has been known for a long time, the intracellular signaling pathways have only recently begun to emerge (6Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11330-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Two classes of intracellular pathways, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in different aspects of IGF-facilitated muscle differentiation (7Xu Q. Wu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36750-36757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Weyman C.M. Wolfman A.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recent studies have focused mostly on the function of the PI3K pathway in the survival of differentiating myoblasts. By manipulating different kinases and using inhibitors of this pathway, it was demonstrated that it played a major role in protecting differentiating myoblasts from undergoing cell death (11Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 12Lawlor M.A. Rotwein P. J.

A second signaling pathway induced by IGF-MAPK might also protect muscle cells from apoptotic cell death (10Sarbassov D.D. Peterson C.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1870-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that transient transfection of constitutively active Mek1, a specific activator of extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs), maintained myoblast viability in the absence of growth factors (14Lawlor M.A. Feng X. Everding D.R. Sieger K. Stewart C.E. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3256-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Several authors (15Sarbassov D.D. Jones L.G. Peterson C.A. Mol.

We suggested that this activation is an intrinsic property of muscle cells. It is now well established that the MAPK pathway that was commonly regarded as mitogenic, can also induce withdrawal from the cell cycle and survival of cells depending on the magnitude and length of the signal and the specific cell type (17Ravi R.K. Weber E. McMahon M. Williams J.R. Baylin S. Mal A. Harter M.L. Dillehay L.E. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Clin.

We decided to investigate the role played by the MAPK pathway in the commitment and differentiation of myoblasts. Our results show that the activity of the MAPK pathway reduces the number of differentiating myoblasts undergoing apoptotic cell death. The MAPK pathway also induces the accumulation of the p21WAF1 protein by prolonging its half-life in differentiating cells. Reduction of p21WAF1 protein by antisense expression interferes with the antiapoptotic function of the MAPK pathway. We conclude that the MAPK pathway regulates the survival of differentiating myoblasts and that this activity is mediated by stabilization of the p21WAF1 protein. U0126 was supplied by Calbiochem.

The pBABE-GFP retroviral vector was constructed by replacing the puromycin coding sequence with the EGFP coding sequence, which was PCR-amplified and cloned into the ClaI-HindIII sites of pBABE-puro. The mouse p21 cDNA fragment was cloned in the EcoRI site of pBABE-GFP, and a clone that contained the antisense orientation of p21 relative to the promoter was used for further studies. C2 cells were a gift from Dr. D. Yaffe (23Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Infection of C2 myoblasts with replication-defective retroviruses was used to generate C2 cell lines expressing the different chimera proteins. Retroviruses expressing the different proteins were generated by transfection of retroviral vectors and an expression vector of vesicular stomatitis virus, the glycoprotein, into viral packaging cells, 293gp, expressing the gag and pol genes (24Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The medium of transfected 293gp cells containing retroviruses was used to infect C2 cells. Forty-eight hours later, cells were selected with puromycin (3 μg/ml). Resistant clones were pooled together a week later. The expression of the chimera proteins was determined in Western blots with an antibody to estrogen receptor. Cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% calf serum (HyClone), penicillin, and streptomycin (growth medium, GM). To induce differentiation, we used Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mg of insulin per ml and 10 mg of transferrin per ml (differentiation medium, DM). Differentiation of C2 cell lines expressing the fusion ER proteins was induced by the addition of DM. β-Estradiol (10-6m) was added to DM at different time periods as indicated, and U0126 (10 μm) was added to DM after 24 h. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (25Davis R.L. Cheng P.F. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 60: 733-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) or using the TransFast reagent of Promega according to the recommended protocol. Myoblasts in 6-cm TC dishes (Corning) were transfected with a total amount of 10 mg (or 5 mg, using TransFast) of luciferase reporter plasmid DNA and a control reporter gene expressing Renilla under the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. Following transfection, the medium was replaced with DM for another 24–48 h. β-Estradiol was added to the cells as indicated. Protein extracts were prepared and used to measure luciferase and Renilla activities using the Luciferase Assay system from Promega. Luciferase activity was divided by Renilla activity of each reaction to correct for the transfection efficiency. Cells were fixed and immunostained as described previously (16Gredinger E. Gerber A.N.

The primary antibodies used were anti-phospho-ERK (Sigma), anti-p21WAF1, anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Transduction Laboratories), and monoclonal anti-MHC (MF-20). The immunochemically stained cells were viewed at ×200 magnification under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, model BX50) and photographed with a digital camera. RNA was extracted using TRI™ reagent (MRC Inc.) and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (16Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol.

Blots were hybridized with probes for MLC2 (PVZLC2), p21WAF1 (pCDNA-Waf1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pMGAP). Cells were lysed, and whole cell extracts were collected as described (16Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of extracted proteins (30–100 μg) were loaded and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For detecting the different forms of pRb, proteins were separated over 7.5% SDS-PAGE before being transferred to membranes. Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2% w/v nonfat dry milk) and then with the same buffer with the first and secondary antibodies. Between the second and third incubations, membranes were washed three times in 0.1% Tween 20 and 1× TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). Immunoblotting was conducted with the following antibodies: anti-ERK and anti-phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling), 1:1000; anti-pRb (Pharmingen), 1:1000; anti-p21WAF1, 1:1000; anti-MHC, 1:2.5; and anti-caspase 9, 1:1000. Proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit by Pierce Inc. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to cell media at 10 μm. After 2–3 h the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol (10 min), and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 (10 min). Following a PBS wash, the cells were incubated in 2 n HCl solution for 1 h. The solution was neutralized by washing the cells three times in 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 8.5). Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 6 mg/ml anti-BrdUrd antibody in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h. The remainder of the procedure was identical to the immunohistochemical staining of cells described earlier (16Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TUNEL Assay—The assay kit was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hoechst Staining—After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with the DNA dye bisbenzimidine (Hoechst 33258) (10 μg/ml) for 30 min. Nuclear morphology was observed at ×200 magnification under an upright fluorescence microscope (Olympus, model BX50) and photographed with a digital camera. The percentage of cells with condensed DNA was calculated. DNA Fragmentation Assay—After washing with PBS, cells were collected and then resuspended in extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 μg/ml RNase A, 0.5% SDS). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Proteinase K (100 mg/ml) was added, and incubation was continued at 50 °C for 3 more h. DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Following a 70% ethanol wash, genomic DNA was resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). An aliquot of 30 μg of DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Replication-defective retrovirus expressing mouse p21 antisense and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or control retroviruses expressing the GFP protein were used to infect C2 cells. One day following infection, the medium was replaced by differentiation medium. β-Estradiol was added to medium 24 h later, and cells were stained with Hoechst after 48 h in DM. Cells were viewed for the Hoechst and green fluorescence staining under the above fluorescence microscope. The assay was performed as described in Gredinger et al. (16Gredinger E. Gerber A.N.

Regulated Activation of ERK MAPK Pathway in C2 Myoblasts—In a previous study we observed that ERK MAPK activity was significantly induced during in vitro muscle differentiation (16Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y. Tapscott S.J. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10436-10444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this study we have found that an increase in phosphorylated ERK was observed after 24 h of C2 myoblasts growth in differentiation medium (DM), and it gradually accumulated as cells differentiated into myotubes (Fig. 1A). To study the functional significance of MAPK pathway activation during myoblast differentiation, we generated inducible C2 cell lines that expressed a conditional Raf1 protein. C2 myoblasts were infected with retroviruses containing either a fusion gene of an activated Raf1 and the hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor (ΔRaf1DD:ER) or an inactivated Raf1 and the hormone-binding domain of estrogen receptor (ΔRaf301:ER) (21McMahon M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Clones harboring the retroviral vectors were selected and further analyzed. These cells constitutively expressed the fusion proteins (not shown). Addition of β-estradiol to C2 cells expressing the active Raf1 protein (ΔRaf1DD:ER) induced the phosphorylation of ERK1 by 3–5 fold (Fig. 1B). It did not affect the phosphorylation state of the closely related MAPKs, p38 and JNK (data not shown). Addition of hormone to C2 cells expressing the inactive Raf1 protein (ΔRaf301:ER) had no effect on the phosphorylation of MAPK (Fig. 1B). The in vitro kinase activity of ERK protein that was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts was also analyzed (Fig. 1C). Addition of β-estradiol to C2 cells expressing the active Raf1 protein (ΔRaf1DD:ER) induced ERK activity by 3- to 5-fold (lanes 1–4), whereas its addition to C2 cells expressing the inactive Raf1 protein (ΔRaf301:ER) had no effect on ERK activity (lanes 5–8). ERK activity that was induced by exogenously activated Raf1 (ΔRaf1DD:ER) was only 1.5- to 2-fold higher than endogenous ERK activity in cells growing in DM for 48 h (compare lanes 2 and 4 to lane 11). Thus, the system enables us to phosphorylate and activate ERK in an Raf1-dependent manner. Activation of Raf1 induces ERK activities that are in the range of the endogenous activity of ERK in differentiating cells. Several studies suggest that the activation of MAPK inhibits muscle differentiation (26Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 27Jones N.C. Fedorov Y.V. Rosenthal R.S. Olwin B.B. J. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13709-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To study whether MAPK affected muscle differentiation, β-estradiol was added to cells together with the differentiation medium (0 h), during myoblast proliferation, or 36 h following the addition of differentiation medium (36 h). ERK was phosphorylated in each case of Raf1 activation (not shown). First, we investigated the structure of myotubes after growing them for 72 h in DM by immunostaining with an antibody to myosin heavy chain and found that ERK activation affected the size of myotubes (Fig. 1D). Early activation of ERK (0 h) usually reduced the size of myotubes relative to control cells (Fig. 1D, middle panel). Late activation of ERK (36 h) was followed by the appearance of larger myotubes with more nuclei per myotube relative to control cells (Fig. 1D, right panel). The number of nuclei per myotube was calculated (Fig. 1D, histogram). Early activation of Raf1 slightly reduced the average number of nuclei per myotube, whereas late activation increased this number by 2-fold relative to control cells. To find out whether these differences in myotube structure were also reflected in the expression of the structural protein MHC, the levels of MHC were analyzed at several time points following early or late activation of Raf1 (Fig. 1E). Early activation of Raf1 (0 h) mildly reduced (<2-fold) MHC expression after 8, 24, and 48 h of growth in DM relative to untreated cells (lanes 2–7). However, after 72 h of growth in DM, MHC levels were similar between treated and untreated cells (lanes 9 and 10). Late activation (36 h) of Raf1 did not affect the expression levels of MHC at 48 and 72 h of growth in DM relative to untreated cells (compare lanes 6–8 and 9–11). Thus, differences in the structure of myotubes, especially those resulted from late Raf1 activation are probably not due to any significant changes in muscle-specific expression. MAPK Does Not Induce Proliferation of Differentiating MyoBlasts—One obvious consequence of Raf1 activation was the higher density of nuclei in β-estradiol-treated cultures relative to untreated cultures (Fig. 1D, compare the left panel to the middle and right panels). This difference raised the possibility that MAPK could promote myoblast proliferation during these stages. The percentage of cells in S phase was analyzed by the bromodeoxyuridine labeling assay (Fig. 2A). Activation of Raf1, at different times after myoblasts were induced to differentiate in DM, did not induce any significant proliferation beyond the levels observed in control cells grown in DM for the same period of time (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation state of the retinoblastoma protein can serve as an indicator for the proliferation state of muscle cells. Two major phosphorylated forms of pRb exist in replicating myoblasts, whereas only one underphosphorylated form is found in postmitotic cells. The phosphorylation of pRb is expected if resting muscle cells are induced to re-enter the cell cycle. We analyzed how the activation of MAPK affected the phosphorylation status of pRb (Fig. 2B). The two forms of pRb were present in proliferating myoblasts, whereas only the underphosphorylated form was found in myoblasts growing in DM (lanes 1 and 2). Activation of MAPK in myoblasts growing in DM for short (24 h) or long (72 h) periods did not change the phosphorylation pattern of pRb; namely, the protein remained in its underphosphorylated form, indicating that resting myoblasts did not re-enter the cell cycle (lanes 3 and 5). On the whole, the results presented in Fig. 2 suggest that activation of the MAPK pathway does not reverse the withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle. Activation of MAPK Prevents Apoptotic Cell Death of Differentiating Myoblasts—A high proportion of myoblasts undergoes programmed cell death (PCD) during in vitro differentiation (1Walsh K. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). First, we wanted to validate that, in the C2 cell line, myoblasts were undergoing PCD at these stages. For that purpose, we immunostained cells grown in DM for 48 h with an antibody to cleaved caspase 3 (active form) to detect ongoing apoptosis and with an antibody to MHC to detect myotubes (Fig. 3A). Most (above 95%) of the cells that were stained for the expression of cleaved caspase 3 did not stain for myosin heavy chain (Fig. 3A, see “Merge”). A higher magnification of a portion of the microscopic field presented in Fig. 3A shows that staining of caspase 3 was in most cases cytoplasmic (Fig. 3B). Occasionally, staining of cells appeared nuclear, although it could reflect false identification of cells found in advance stages of apoptosis with their cytoplasm collapsed and structure deformed. We can conclude that at these stages the majority of cells undergoing PCD are myoblasts and not myotubes. We calculated the number of cells positively stained for cleaved caspase 3 relative to the total number of myoblast nuclei and found that 29% of the cells were undergoing PCD. To investigate the role of MAPK in preventing apoptotic cell death of myoblasts, we asked how activation or repression of the pathway affected cell viability by Hoechst and by TUNEL staining of nuclei (Fig. 4A). A significant percentage of myoblasts growing in DM for 48 h undergo apoptosis as can be seen by chromatin condensation observed by the dense staining of DNA (Fig. 4A). Addition of β-estradiol to C2-ΔRaf1DD:ER cells after 24 h of myoblasts growth in DM for an additional period of 24 h largely prevented cell death. Conversely, treatment of cells with Mek inhibitor, U0126 increased dramatically cell death (Fig. 4A). The addition of β-estradiol to the control C2-ΔRaf301:ER cells did not change the number of cells undergoing PCD, suggesting that the antiapoptotic effect was specific to Raf activity (Fig. 4A). Apoptotic cell death was also analyzed by TUNEL staining of fragmented DNA (Fig. 4B). Activation of the ΔRaf1DD:ER protein reduced while the addition of U0126 increased PCD to similar values observed in the Hoechst staining. Fragmentation of genomic DNA that appears as a typical ladder in gel electrophoresis can serve as a hallmark of PCD. Identical amounts of genomic DNA were separated over an agarose gel. No ladder was observed in DNA from proliferating myoblasts, however, a ladder was noticeable after growth of myoblasts in DM for 72 h (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1 and 2). If the same cells were treated with U0126 for 48 h, after 24 h of myoblasts growth in DM the staining intensity of the ladder was increased significantly (Fig. 4C, lane 3). Treatment with β-estradiol to increase MAPK activity during the same period of time decreased the intensity of the DNA ladder relative to untreated cells (compare lanes 2 and 4). During the process of apoptotic cell death certain caspases are being activated by proteolytic cleavage (29Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 30Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). We analyzed the possible involvement of caspase 9 in PCD of myoblasts and searched whether the MAPK pathway affected its activation. In proliferating myoblasts the inactive pro-caspase was the only noticeable form (Fig. 4D, lane 1). During differentiation of myoblasts, in addition to the inactive form of caspase 9, the active shorter form was observed after 24 h in DM, and its amount was increased after 48 h (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 3). Myoblasts growing for 48 h in DM and treated with U0126 expressed more of the active form than control cells not treated with the inhibitor (compare lanes 3 and 4). On the other hand, induction of Raf1 activity reduced the levels of active caspase 9 (compare lanes 3 and 5). These re"

When combined nitrogen becomes limiting, Anabaena species and their close relatives respond by initiating a developmental program that results in the production of terminally differentiated, nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts. Normally, approximately 10% of the cells become heterocysts that are present singly at semiregular intervals along the filaments, forming a spacing pattern. By sequestering nitrogenase within heterocysts, Anabaena spp. can carry out, simultaneously, oxygenic photosynthesis and the O2-labile assimilation of N2. Differences between heterocysts and their progenitor vegetative cells enable the heterocysts to provide a micro-oxic environment for nitrogenase (1Wolk C.P. Ernst A. Elhai J. Bryant D.A. Molecular Biology of the Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 769-823Google Scholar). They lack the oxygen-producing reaction of photosystem II; respire rapidly; and have, outside of their cell wall, a layer of glycolipids that impedes the entry of oxygen and an outer, protective layer of polysaccharide (2Murry M.A. Wolk C.P.

However, no overall regulatory strategy has been identified, and the detailed mechanisms that regulate differentiation remain largely unknown. It has been shown, however, that transcription of hepA, whose product is a member of the family of ABC transporters and is essential for biosynthesis of heterocyst envelope polysaccharide (4Wolk C.P. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L.J. Prokaryotic Development. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Far more research on polysaccharides has emphasized their structure and biosynthesis than the regulation of their biosynthesis. Developing heterocysts provide a model of patterned, functional differentiation in which synthesis of a specific polysaccharide is an essential feature. The structure of heterocyst envelope polysaccharide has been determined for several species (25Cardemil L. Wolk C.P. J. Biol.

Two-component phosphorelay regulatory systems are the principal means for coordinating responses to environmental changes in bacteria and are found also in plants, fungi, protozoa, and amoebae (30Loomis W.F. Kuspa A. Shaulsky G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Hwang I. Sheen J.

Typically, such a system consists of a membrane-associated sensor kinase and its cognate response regulator. Most known sensor kinases consist of a cytoplasmic N terminus, two transmembrane segments linked by a periplasmic bridge, and a cytoplasmic, C-terminal, transmitter portion with a conserved histidine residue. Signal reception by the kinase stimulates an ATP-dependent autophosphorylation of that histidine. Transfer of the phosphate group to a conserved aspartyl residue of the response regulator renders the latter functional. Most known response regulators function as transcription factors whose effector domains bind DNA and regulate the expression of certain genes, effecting an adaptive response (33Fabret C. Feher V.A. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, some response regulators lack a known effector domain (32Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 139-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and some effector domains are enzymatically active (34Shaulsky G. Fuller D. Loomis W.F. Development. 1998; 125: 691-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Stock J.B. Koshland D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). When signaling subsides, both components undergo dephosphorylation, inactivating the response regulator. Genomic sequence data have identified no presumptive vertebrate, nematode, or fruit fly genes that encode two-component phosphorelay proteins (36Thomason P. Kay R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3141-3150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Lander E.S. Linton L.M. Birren B. Nusbaum C. Zody M.C. Baldwin J. Devon K. Dewar K. Doyle M. FitzHugh W. Funke R. Gage D. Harris K.

Because some two-component phosphorelay proteins are essential for the virulence of microbial pathogens including human fungal and bacterial pathogens, novel anti-microbial drugs targeted to two-component phosphorelay systems may prove highly specific for microbial pathogens. Although more than 1000 two-component phosphorelay proteins have been predicted from genomic data, very few have an identified function and have been shown experimentally to participate in phosphorelays. Some predicted homologs of histidine kinases may not be kinases or may not phosphorylate a histidine residue (32Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1999; 41: 139-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, Azoto-bacter vinelandii NifL contains five conserved blocks of amino acids characteristic of histidine sensor kinases (39Blanco G. Drummond M. Woodley P. Kennedy C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but has not been observed to autophosphorylate (40Austin S. Buck M. Cannon W. Eydmann T. Dixon R. J.

Predicted proteins HepK from Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 and DevR from Nostoc punctiforme strain ATCC 29133 resemble respectively a sensory protein-histidine kinase (10Zhu J. Kong R. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a response regulator that lacks known DNA-binding domains (45Campbell E.L. Hagen K.D. Cohen M.F. Summers M.L. Meeks. J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2037-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Anabaena sp. ortholog DevRA of DevR but for a possible 30-amino acid, N-terminal extension, is 93% identical and 98% similar to that of Nostoc DevR. Unlike most response regulators, DevR and DevRA have a 7-amino acid peptide, 57SRSVYQG63, in the γ-turn loop region. DevR, but not DevRΔ7, from which that peptide was deleted, is weakly phosphorylated in vitro by Escherichia coli sensor kinase EnvZ, a result that supported the interpretation of Hagen and Meeks (46Hagen K.D. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4430-4434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that DevR is a response regulator in an unidentified phosphorelay system that controls heterocyst maturation in N. punctiforme strain ATCC 29133. However, no cognate histidine kinase was identified for DevR. No gene that evidently encodes a response regulator neighbors hepK. devRA is 1.4 Mb distant from hepK (28Kaneko T. Nakamura Y. Wolk C.P. Kuritz T. Sasamoto S. Watanabe A. Iriguchi M. Ishikawa A. Kawashima K. Kimura T. Kishida Y. Kohara M. Matsumoto M. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Shimpo S. Sugimoto M. Takazawa M. Yamada M.

We present evidence that Anabaena sp. HepK is a histidine kinase, that DevRA is its cognate response regulator, and that the two comprise part or all of a two-component system that controls the biosynthesis of heterocyst envelope polysaccharide. Culture and Preparation for Electron Microscopy—Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 and derivatives of it were grown at 30 °C in the light at approximately 140 microeinsteins m—2 s—1 (Li-Cor Quantum Radiometer/Photometer model LI-185A; Lincoln, NE) on AA + N agar (47Hu N.T. Thiel T. Giddings T.H. Wolk C.P. Virology. 1981; 114: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) in the presence of appropriate antibiotics or on a rotary shaker in medium AA/8 or AA/8 + N (47Hu N.T. Thiel T. Giddings T.H. Wolk C.P. Virology. 1981; 114: 236-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) plus appropriate antibiotics. Wild-type and devRAAnabaena sp. strains and wild-type N. punctiforme strain ATCC 29133 and its devR derivative UCD311 were prepared for electron microscopy (48Black K. Buikema W.J. Haselkorn R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6440-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after the following regimens of growth. Anabaena sp. strains grown 5 days in AA/8 + N (plus, for the mutant strain, 2 μg of spectinomycin sulfate ml—1) were sedimented, washed three times with AA/8, and incubated for 3 days on a Nuclepore Rec-85 membrane atop AA agar. Wild-type N. punctiforme was grown for 5 days in AA/8. UCD311 was incubated 2 days in AA/8 after 7 days of growth in AA/8 + N plus 10 μg of neomycin sulfate ml—1 and three washes with AA/8. DNA Manipulation—Recombinant DNA procedures were performed in a standard manner (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis. T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs, Invitrogen, and Roche Applied Science and used as recommended by the manufacturers. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Truncated hepK (′hepK) encoding residues 267–575 of HepK that lack the two presumptive transmembrane regions and full-length hepK (GenBankTM accession number U68034) were amplified by PCR with, respectively, primer pairs 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCGGACTAGTCGAGCGATCGCT-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTAACTTTGCTCCTGAAGTGGCAGG-3′ (CPW99), and 5′-GGAATTCCATATGCAAACTCAGCAGCCGATCCCTG-3′ and CPW99 (introduced NdeI and BglII sites are underlined) with pRL2079 (10Zhu J. Kong R. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template. The PCR products were cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of plasmid pET-14b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), which provided an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. To reduce the extent of PCR product that had to be validated by sequencing, the region from MfeI to BstXI in intact hepK was replaced by a portion of wild-type hepK as was a smaller portion in truncated hepK. The resulting plasmids were denoted pRL2406 and pRL2433, respectively. devR and devRΔ21 (encoding DevRΔ7) of N. punctiforme were PCR-amplified from plasmids pSCR169 and pSCR343 (Ref. 46Hagen K.D. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4430-4434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; gifts of J. C. Meeks), respectively, as templates with the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAAAACTGTTTTAATTGTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTATGATTGGCCGTCTGTGG-3′ and were cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-14b, producing pRL2461 and pRL2487. pSCR351, encoding H6DevR-D53Q, was also from Dr. Meeks. devRA, PCR-amplified from total Anabaena sp. DNA with the primers 5′-GGAATTCCATATGACAGCAAAGCATATTGATACTA-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGTGGTTGTCACTGGGGAGGAGAG-3′, was cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-14b to produce pRL2749 for production of H6DevRA. The ompR gene (GenBankTM accession number J01656) of E. coli strain MC4100 in plasmid pLAN801 (a gift of Dr. M. Igo) was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGCAAGAGAACTACAAGATTCTG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCATGCTTTAGAGCCCTCCGG-3′. The PCR product was first cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to produce pRL2483 for DNA sequencing; then an NdeI-BamHI fragment containing ompR was transferred between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-14b, yielding pRL2484. All of the above PCR products were proven error-free by DNA sequencing. Site-directed Mutation of hepK—Primer-mediated PCR mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis; Stratagene) was used to change the conserved His348 to Ala at the presumptive site of phosphorylation of HepK to produce a mutant truncated HepK protein, which we denote ′HepK-H348A. The mutagenic oligonucleotides 5′-ATTTCTTGCCAACGTTAGTGCTGAGTTGCGTAC-3′ and 5′-GTACGCAACTCAGCACTAACGTTGGCAAGAAAT-3′ (codon 348, CAT → GCT) with pRL2406 as template were used for PCR; the product was cloned in pET-14b, producing pRL2454. The sequence of the 310-bp BstEII-BstXI fragment of pRL2454 was shown to be identical to the corresponding fragment of pRL2406, except for the H348A substitution, by DNA sequencing. Transfer of the BstEII-BstXI fragment from pRL2454 to pRL2406 produced pRL2457, from which H6′HepK-H348A was produced and purified as had been H6′HepK. Test of Complementation of hepK Mutant Y7 by hepK-H348A—Transposon-generated hepK mutant Y7 cannot grow aerobically on N2, but Y7 (pRL2078) can (10Zhu J. Kong R. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4233-4242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pRL2480, identical to pRL2078 but for an H348A change in hepK, was constructed by transferring the 4.9-kb, hepK-bearing BamHI DNA fragment of pRL2078 to pRL57 (50Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), which lacks BstEII and BstXI sites; replacing the 310-bp BstEII-BstXI fragment of hepK by the corresponding fragment of pRL2457; and then replacing the 4.9-kb BamHI fragment of pRL2078 with the resulting BamHI fragment. pRL2480 was transferred by conjugation (51Elhai J. Vepritskiy A. Muro-Pastor A.M. Flores E. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1998-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) into Y7 with selection on AA plus nitrate agar plates supplemented with 30 μg of neomycin sulfate ml—1 to select for Y7 and 10 μg of spectinomycin sulfate ml—1 to select for pRL2480. 10 days later, 10 resulting colonies were restreaked onto the same medium for proliferation and were then spotted onto AA agar plates without or with nitrate (the latter was supplemented with neomycin and spectinomycin as before). Production and Purification of Hexahistidine-tagged Proteins—To overproduce H6′HepK, H6HepK, H6′HepK-H348A, H6DevRA, H6DevR, H6DevRΔ7, H6DevR-D53Q, H6OmpR, and H6EnvZc, E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with pRL2406, pRL2433, pRL2457, pRL2749, pRL2461, pRL2487, pSCR351, pRL2484, and pPH001 (a gift of M. Inouye) (52Hidaka Y. Park H. Inouye M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), respectively. Each transformant was grown in 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg of ampicillin ml—1 at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5–0.6, 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and incubation was continued for 3 h. The His6-tagged proteins were purified to homogeneity as follows. E. coli suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, was broken with a French press (American Instrument Co. Div. Travenol Laboratories, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). The supernatant solution from centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C was applied to a cobalt-based resin column (Clontech), which was then washed thrice with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. The intended protein, eluted with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 5.5, was loaded onto a Sephadex G-100 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) from which it was eluted at 4 °C with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, at 20 ml h—1. Assays of Phosphorylation and Transphosphorylation—Unless otherwise specified, phosphorylation reaction mixtures contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 30–80 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci mmol—1). H6HepK, H6DevR, or derivatives of them, H6DevRA,H6EnvZc, and H6OmpR were added to final concentrations of 2.5 μm or as indicated. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the radioactive substrate, incubated at room temperature (approximately 24 °C) for different times, and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.003% bromphenol blue). The reactions, once stopped, were immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE. After completion of electrophoresis, the gels were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) at 200 mA in protein-transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, 5% methanol, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.3) at 4 °C for 1 h, and the membrane was then air-dried at room temperature. The radioactivity of proteins attached to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was determined qualitatively by autoradiography with Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) or quantitatively with a PhosphorImager model V5.6 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To show the protein bands, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was later stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 for 2 min and then destained with 50% methanol. In time course experiments, portions of a sample were removed, mixed with loading buffer, and kept on ice until all of the samples were taken. To compare transfer of 32P from H6′HepK-32P to H6DevR and to H6DevRΔ7, one 13-μl fraction and two 40-μl fractions were removed from a solution of 9 μg of phosphorylated H6′HepK in 100 μl of standard phosphorylation buffer. Six μg of H6DevR or H6DevRΔ7 in 12 μl of standard phosphorylation buffer were added to separate 40-μl fractions of phosphorylated H6′HepK. At the indicated reaction times, 15-μl portions of samples were rapidly transferred to an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The mixtures were kept on ice until all of the portions had been removed and were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Stability of Phosphate Linkages in Phosphorylated H6′HepK, H6DevRA, and H6DevR, and Effects of Nucleoside Diphosphates on Dephosphorylation of H6′HepK-32P—To examine the chemical stability of their phosphate linkages, 30 pmol of H6′HepK or 50 pmol of H6DevRA or H6DevR with 20 pmol of H6′HepK were phosphorylated for 30 min in 30 μl of reaction mixture. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Samples of 10 μl were pipetted into microcentrifuge tubes containing 2 μl of 1 n HCl, 0.15 n HCl, water, or 3 n NaOH, giving final pH values of 0.9, 2.7, 7.2, or 12.5, respectively. pH values were confirmed with Color pHast® indicator strips (EM Science, Darmstadt, Germany). The mixtures were incubated for 60 min in a water bath at 42 °C. Another sample, to which 2 μl of water was added, was kept on ice. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for radioactivity. The kinetics of loss of 32P from H6′HepK-32P and H6DevR-32P at pH 12.5 were assessed as follows. H6′HepK (35 pmol) was phosphorylated for 30 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture; in some experiments the 35 pmol of H6′HepK-32P in 20 μl was then used to phosphorylate 35 pmol of H6DevR for 30 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture, and the protein or proteins were then denatured at neutral pH by the addition of 30 μl of 2× concentrated loading buffer (pH 6.8). Each resulting 60-μl mixture, prewarmed for 2 min at 42 °C, was adjusted to pH 12.5 by addition of 12 μl of 3 n NaOH. pH values were confirmed with Color pHast® indicator strips. At intervals thereafter (see Fig. 6), an 8-μl sample was withdrawn and introduced into a microcentrifuge tube containing 1.33 μl of 3 n HCl to readjust the pH to 7.0. The samples were immediately placed on ice until sampling was completed. All of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for radioactivity. ADP, CDP, GDP, or TDP (sodium salts; Sigma; sodium ADP was also purchased from TCI America for confirmation) at a final concentration of 0.5 mm was incubated for 5 min in a 15-μl phosphorylation reaction mixture containing 2 μg of H6′HepK-32P. The reactions were stopped by addition of 2× concentrated SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples subjected to SDS-PAGE were analyzed for radioactivity. Inactivation of devRA—A 1415-bp DNA fragment containing devRA and DNA downstream from it was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of Anabaena sp. with the primers 5′-TAAATAAAATTCTCATGAAAACTG-3′ and 5′-GAGCAAGACTGGCTAGCCAGTT-3′ (BspHI site underlined). The PCR product was first cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ to produce pRL2478 for DNA sequencing. Then a BspHI-BamHI fragment containing the PCR product, which was free of errors, was transferred between the BspHI and BglII sites of pRL278 (70Black T.A. Cai Y. Wolk C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) to produce pRL2479. devRA was inactivated by insertion of a 2.7-kb, SmaI-gfp-omega-PvuII cassette from pRL2379 (8Xu X. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) into the unique NruI site of pRL2479, 110 bp 5′ from the stop codon of devRA. The resulting plasmid, denoted pRL2481a, was transferred to wild-type Anabaena sp. by conjugation, and a double recombinant (devRA) strain denoted DR2481a was isolated as described (50C"
https://openalex.org/W2026131352,"DnaK, a Hsp70 homolog of Escherichia coli, together with its co-chaperones DnaJ and GrpE protects denatured proteins from aggregation and promotes their refolding by an ATP-consuming mechanism. DnaJ not only stimulates the γ-phosphate cleavage of DnaK-bound ATP but also binds polypeptide substrates on its own. Unfolded polypeptides, such as denatured luciferase, thus form ternary complexes with DnaJ and DnaK. A previous study has shown that d-peptides compete with l-peptides for the same binding site in DnaJ but do not bind to DnaK (Feifel, B., Schönfeld, H.-J., and Christen, P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11999–12002). Here we report that d-peptides efficiently inhibit the refolding of denatured luciferase by the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system (EC50 = 1–2 μM). The inhibition of the chaperone action is due to the binding of d-peptide to DnaJ (Kd = 1–2 μM), which seems to preclude DnaJ from forming ternary (ATP·DnaK)m·substrate·DnaJn complexes. Apparently, simultaneous binding of DnaJ and DnaK to one and the same target polypeptide is essential for effective chaperone action.

The chaperones assist protein folding by preventing and reversing off-pathway interactions that lead to aggregation (1Fink A.L. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins: Structure, Function and Mode of Action. Marcel Dekker, New York1998: 123-150Google Scholar). The key features of the Hsp70 chaperone system are the binding of unfolded hydrophobic segments of the target polypeptides to the ATP-liganded form of DnaK, the stabilization of the complex upon ATP hydrolysis, and the release of the bound ligands upon ADP/ATP exchange (1Fink A.L.

DnaJ interacts with DnaK through its highly conserved NH2-terminal J-domain and stimulates the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP (2Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DnaJ also exerts a chaperone action on its own; upon association with denatured polypeptides, such as luciferase or rhodanese, it may prevent their aggregation (3Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H.

Here we report that two retro-all d-peptides derived from the NH2-terminal segment of rhodanese inhibit the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system in refolding denatured firefly luciferase. Proteins—DnaK was isolated from an overproducing strain of E. coli (JM 83) bearing the plasmid pTPG9 (3Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The stock solution of the protein in assay buffer (25 mm Hepes/NaOH, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.0) was stored at –80 °C and contained less than 0.1 mol of ADP/mol of DnaK (9Feifel B. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The concentration of DnaK was determined photometrically with ϵ280 = 14.6 mm–1 cm–1. DnaJ and GrpE were prepared as described (10Schönfeld H.-J. Schmidt D. Schröder H. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2183-2189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); stock solutions were stored at –80 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.7. Peptides—The peptide ala-p5 (ALLLSAPRR) was purchased with a purity of >90% from Chiron. The peptide was dissolved in 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid, 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and stored at –20 °C. The two d-peptides RI1–17 (EALWKSTSVLARYLVQHV) and RI1–10 (VLARYLVQHV) were synthesized by Dr. S. Klauser in our Institute with an ABI 430 A Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) and purified on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Corp.) by gel filtration (Fractogel EMD BIOSEC 650 S, from Merck). The molecular masses were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and the concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The peptides were dissolved and stored at –20 °C in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile. Control experiments excluded the possibility that the chaperone-inhibitory effect was due to contaminating acetonitrile or acetate in the refolding mixture. Both peptides were labeled with the environmentally sensitive fluorophor acrylodan (Molecular Probes) and purified as described (3Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P.

Three peaks were separated, corresponding to labeling at the ϵ-amino group, the ϵ-amino group of the d-lysine residue, and double labeling at both groups. The fractions of the first peak corresponding to uniquely ϵ-labeled RI1–17 or RI1–10 were used for the experiments. Other Materials—Nuclease- and protease-free bovine serum albumin (fraction V) was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. The stock solutions of serum albumin were filtrated with a 0.2-μm membrane; ATP was from Fluka, and d-luciferin was from Sigma. [2,5′,8-3H]Adenosine 5′-triphosphate ammonium salt (41.0 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All of the buffers were filtrated with a 0.2-μm membrane. Analytic Procedures—The ATPase activity of DnaK was determined with a single-turnover assay (5Pierpaoli E.V. Sandmeier E. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6643-6649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The radioactive ADP product was separated from radioactive ATP by thin layer chromatography, and the radioactivity of ADP and ATP was determined with a liquid scintillation counter. The binding rate constants of DnaJ for acrylodan-labeled peptides were determined with a Spex Fluorolog spectrofluorimeter as described (7Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm (band pass, 4.6 nm) with the emission wavelength set at 520 nm (band pass, 4.6 nm). For fluorescence titration, the reactions were followed at an emission wavelength of 520 nm (band pass, 4.6 nm) until equilibrium was reached. Preparation of Luciferase—Luciferase of Photinus pyralis was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For denaturation, 1 mg of lyophilized material was dissolved in 1.56 ml of refolding buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 55 mm KCl, 5.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.7), filtrated with a 0.2-μm membrane, and precipitated by adding five volumes of acetone (–20 °C, 30 min). After centrifugation for 10 min at 10000 × g and 4 °C, the pellet was redissolved in 1.56 ml of denaturing buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.7) and after 0.2-μm filtration was stored at –80 °C in 20-μl portions. Refolding Assay—The chaperone activity of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system was assessed by its effect on the refolding of guanidine HCl-denatured luciferase. Under the conditions used, denatured luciferase refolds to the active enzyme only in the presence of the chaperones under consumption of ATP. In the presence of O2, luciferase catalyzes the conversion of d-luciferin and ATP to oxiluciferin, CO2, AMP, PPi, and hν. Generated photons were counted with a luminometer (Lumac Biocounter M 1500 from Lumac bv). DnaJ (0.1 μm) was preincubated in refolding buffer at 25 °C for 20 min with the peptide to be tested. DnaK (1 μm), GrpE (0.5 μm), ATP (2 mm), and MgCl2 (5 mm) were then added; the total protein concentration was set to 0.5 mg/ml by supplementation with bovine serum albumin. The refolding reaction was performed at 25 °C and started by adding 2 μl of denatured luciferase (0.1 μm) to the refolding solution with a final dilution factor of 1:100. All of the concentrations in parentheses given above are the final concentrations in the total 200 μl of the refolding reaction mixture. The activity was measured in triplicate every 22.5 min according to a modified previously published procedure (4Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 12De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). Samples of the refolding mixture (10 μl) were added to 190 μl of refolding buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A 10-μl sample of this 1:20-diluted solution was added to 990 μl of luciferase assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 15 mm MgCl2, pH 7.7), and subsequently 300 μl of 5 μm d-luciferin in 50 mm Tris/HCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, pH 7.7, were added. After a delay of 90 s, the intensity of the light generated by the luciferase reaction was measured for 10 s. Programs and Calculations—For graphical evaluation of the peptide-induced inhibition, we used the program GRAFIT 3.0 (Erithacus Software Ltd.), applying a one-site competition algorithm. The EC50 values were estimated from the fitted curves in the plots of yield of luciferase reactivation versus concentration of the peptide inhibitor. Binding of Peptides to DnaJ—The NH2-terminal segment of rhodanese protein has proven to be a high affinity binder of DnaJ (11Kudlicki W. Odom O.W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31160-31165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The two d-peptides RI1–17 and RI1–10 are derived from this segment of rhodanese. To preserve the side chain topology of the rhodanese segment, both d-peptides were synthesized as retro-all-D (retro-inverso) analogs of the l-rhodanese peptide, i.e. both peptides were exclusively composed of d-amino acids, and, as compared with the reference l-peptides, possessed the reverse sequence (7Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We examined the binding of the acrylodan-labeled peptides a-RI1–17 and a-RI1–10 to DnaJ by following the change in fluorescence (3Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The kinetic traces followed a double-exponential function (Fig. 1A). The rates of the first phases were found to be a linear function of the concentration of DnaJ (Fig. 1B), and the kon and koff values were obtained from the slope and intercept, respectively, of the plot (Table I). The rate of the second, smaller phase was independent of the concentration of DnaJ (data not shown) and thus may reflect an isomerization of the complex formed in the first phase. In accord with previous reports (7Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), both d-peptides did not bind to DnaK, as indicated by the fact that they did not stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK, whereas the control peptide ala-p5, a known substrate for DnaK (13Grimshaw J.P.A. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6098-6104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), increased the ATPase activity by a factor of 20 (Table II). The peptide binding properties of DnaK are different from those of DnaJ. DnaK interacts with both the backbone and side chains of the peptides (14Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) and thus shows binding polarity that admits only d-peptide (7Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J.

The final concentrations of DnaK and DnaJ were 1 and 0.1 μM, respectively (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Luciferase was denatured in 6 M guanidine HCl as described under “Experimental Procedures”; the concentration of the stock solution was 25 μM. The final guanidine HCl concentration (51 mM) had no effect on the ATPase activity of DnaK (not shown).

Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that for efficient refolding the presence of all three chaperones is necessary (15Buchberger A. Valencia A. McMacken R. Sander C. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and that denatured luciferase forms ternary complexes with DnaK and DnaJ (6Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, it has remained unclear whether the conjoint binding of DnaK and DnaJ to different sites of the same target polypeptide chain is prerequisite for the chaperone action. The finding that d-peptides bind exclusively to DnaJ and compete with l-peptides for the same binding site in DnaJ (7Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) provides an approach to explore this question. We tested the effect of the d-peptides on the refolding of denatured luciferase in the presence of DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP. Upon preincubation of DnaJ with RI1–17 or RI1–10, the yield of refolding decreased with increasing concentration of the d-peptide (Fig. 2A). Both RI1–17 and RI1–10 were effective in inhibiting the chaperone-assisted refolding of luciferase, with EC50 values of ∼2 μM (Fig. 2B) and ∼1 μM (Fig. 2C), respectively. The EC50 values correlated with their binding affinities for DnaJ (Table I). In a control experiment, the addition of either peptide alone to denatured luciferase did not affect its spontaneous refolding (data not shown). Because both d-peptides bind exclusively to DnaJ and compete with l-peptide ligands for the same binding site (7Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the observed inhibition appears to be due to the formation of DnaJ·d-peptide complexes that renders DnaJ incapable to bind to denatured luciferase and to form ternary (ATP·DnaK)m·luciferase·DnaJn complexes (the indices point out that more than one molecule of either chaperone might simultaneously interact with luciferase). Addition of the inhibitory d-peptide RI1–17 at different times after initiation of the refolding of luciferase arrests the refolding process without apparent delay (Fig. 3). Apparently, binding of the d-peptide to DnaJ disrupts the chaperone action.Fig. 3Inhibition by d-peptide of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system engaged in luciferase refolding. In contrast to the experiments of Fig. 2, the d-peptide inhibitor RI1–17 at 25 μm final concentration was not preincubated with DnaJ but added as the last component to the refolding solution immediately before a sample of the refolding solution was removed for measuring luciferase activity: addition of RI1–17 at 0 min (•), at 20 min (▾), at 40 min (▿), and at 60 min (▪); controls without chaperones and RI1–17 (○) and in the presence of DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE/ATP but without RI1–17 (□).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Conjoint binding of DnaK and DnaJ to one and the same polypeptide chain increases the ATPase activity of DnaK by 1 order of magnitude over and above the activity observed in the presence of DnaJ and a small peptide (16Han W. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; : 19038-19043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This effect provides an additional means to examine the formation of ternary DnaK· substrate·DnaJ complexes. In the presence of denatured luciferase, DnaJ stimulated the ATPase activity of DnaK ∼100-fold (Table II and Ref. 17Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), whereas preformed DnaJ·RI1–17 or DnaJ·RI1–10 stimulated the ATPase activity of DnaK only 10-fold (Table II). The binding of peptides RI1–17 or RI1–10 to DnaJ does not affect the interaction of the J-domain of DnaJ with the ATPase domain of DnaK; the stimulatory effect of DnaJ on the ATPase activity of DnaK in the presence of either d-peptide was the same as that in the absence of peptide inhibitor (Table II). Apparently, the ineffectiveness of DnaJ·d-peptide complexes in stimulating the ATPase activity of DnaK in the presence of denatured luciferase is due to the incapability of the DnaJ·d-peptide complexes to bind to denatured luciferase. These results corroborate the notion that d-peptides inhibit the chaperone action of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system by precluding DnaJ from engaging in ternary (ATP· DnaK)m·substrate·DnaJn complexes. Conceivably, the conjoint binding of DnaJ and DnaK to one and the same polypeptide chain facilitates the interaction of the J-domain of DnaJ and the ATPase domain of DnaK by a propinquity effect (16Han W. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; : 19038-19043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The cis-interaction of DnaJ with DnaK seems not only to be necessary for efficient chaperone-mediated refolding of target proteins but has also been reported to be required for the activation of latent P1 RepA dimer into its active monomer (18Kim. S.-Y. Sharma S. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44778-44783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Why is the binding of DnaK and DnaJ to one and the same unfolded target polypeptide necessary for the chaperone action of the DnaK system? Rapid triggering of the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP might be essential for feeding the substrate protein into the chaperone cycle. Hydrolysis of ATP converts DnaK from its low affinity state to its high affinity ADP-liganded state. Without the cis-action of DnaJ, the substrate would cycle on and off ATP·DnaK, without chaperone action being effected. Concluding Remarks—The exclusive binding of d-peptides to the substrate-binding site of DnaJ (7Feifel B. Schönfeld H.-J. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11999-12002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) specifically allows inhibition of the association of DnaJ with a substrate polypeptide. Substrate-induced effects in the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system that are due to the binding of substrate to DnaJ may thus be discriminated from effects that are due to the binding of substrate to DnaK. Using this approach, we provided evidence that the chaperone action of the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system depends on the formation of ternary (ATP·DnaK)m·substrate·(DnaJ)n complexes. The acceleration of the chaperone cycle consequent to the formation of ternary complexes, perhaps together with an as yet unknown topological or conformational constraint inherent in the cis-interaction of DnaK and DnaJ, appears to be a prerequisite for efficient chaperone action. We thank Dr. S. Klauser for the synthesis of the d-peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2057332608,"The molecular basis of constitutive gene activation is largely unknown. The yeast profilin gene (PFY1), encoding a housekeeping component of the actin cytoskeleton, is constitutively transcribed at a moderate level. ThePFY1 promoter dispenses with classical transactivators and a consensus TATA box; however, it contains a canonic site for the abundant multifunctional nuclear factor rDNA enhancer-binding protein (Reb1p) combined with a dA·dT element. Reb1p binds specificallyin vitro. Mutation of this site reduces PFY1expression to about 35%. A nucleosome-free gap of about 190 bp is centered at the genomic Reb1p binding site in vivo and spans the presumptive core promoter and transcriptional initiation sites. Nucleosomes at the border of the gap are positioned. Mutation of the Reb1p motif in the genomic PFY1 promoter abolishes nucleosome positioning, fills the gap with a non-positioned nucleosome, and reduces transcription by a factor of 3. From permutation studies we conclude that Reb1p induces a strong bend into the DNA. Phasing analyses indicate that it is directed toward the major groove. The data suggest that Reb1p plays an architectural role on DNA and that Reb1p-dependent DNA bending leads to a DNA conformation that is incompatible with packaging into nucleosomes and concomitantly facilitates constitutive transcription. In the absence of other transcription activators, Reb1p excludes nucleosomes and moderately stimulates transcription by distorting DNA.

In yeast, it has been shown to be involved in the establishment of cell polarity and bud site selection, in intracellular transport, and in signal transduction as well as in cytokinesis. According to the plethora of functions, the organization of the microfilament system and intracellular distribution of actin is highly dynamic and closely linked to the progression of the cell cycle. Despite continuous cell cycle-controlled reorganization of the cytoskeleton, the single actin gene in yeast (ACT1)1 is expressed constitutively (1McLean M. Hubberstey A.V. Bouman D.J. Pece N.

It involves the binding of phosphoinositides to profilin and their controlled cleavage by phospholipase C, which could provide the basis for the regulation of profilin-actin interaction (10Lassing I.

In fact, results of recent experiments on yeast profilin and CAP, a component of the yeast adenylyl cyclase complex, functionally link the growth signaling pathway to the control of the cytoskeleton (15Vojtek A.

Previously we have isolated and characterized the single structural gene for yeast profilin (PFY1) and shown that its deletion leads to a temperature-conditional phenotype. PFY1 is constitutively transcribed at a moderately high level (8Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Müller G. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Amazingly little is known about the chromatin constellation at constitutive promoters and about transcription factors involved in transcription of housekeeping genes. It is supposed that constitutive transcription reflects a static situation in which the promoter is in a permanently activated state. Accordingly these promoters are presumed to be constitutively kept free of nucleosomes (18Scott E.W. Baker H.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Angermayr M. Oechsner U. Gregor K. Schroth G.P. Bandlow W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4199-4207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but the principles and mechanisms underlying nucleosome exclusion are far from clear. Moreover it is unknown whether constitutive transcription is basal transcription involving only the basal transcription apparatus or whether specific transactivators are required in addition. Sincecis-acting sites for any of the classical transactivators are absent from the 5′-flank of the PFY1 gene, we tested the hypothesis that constitutive transcription of this gene dispenses with classical transcription activators. We have dissected thePFY1 promoter and demonstrate that it harbors a binding site for the rDNA enhancer-binding protein (Reb1p; also known as Grf2p, factor Y, and factor Q).Reb1p is among the abundant so-called “general regulatory factors.” It is multifunctional, as it is involved in transcriptional termination (20Lang W.H.

However, the direct transcriptional activation potential of Reb1p is marginal compared with specific activator proteins, but combinations of Reb1p binding sites with cognate motifs for weak transcription activators or dA·dT elements cause considerable synergistic effects (22Chasman D.I.

Reb1p is encoded by an essential gene (32Ju Q. Morrow B.E. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 1: 5226-5234Crossref Google Scholar); however, the reason for its indispensability has not yet been established. The 125-kDa protein binds as a monomer to its site on DNA with the consensus YNNYYACCCG, and its DNA-binding domain, which bears some similarity to the vertebrate proto-oncogenemyb, is extraordinarily large (about 400 amino acids) (32Ju Q. Morrow B.E. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 1: 5226-5234Crossref Google Scholar, 33Morrow B.E. Ju Q. Warner J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The analysis of the chromatin structure at theGAL1-GAL10 promoter, which contains a Reb1p site overlapping with a motif for binding of Gal4p, has revealed a nucleosome-free gap of 230 bp. Previous studies indicated that Reb1p binding is responsible for nucleosome exclusion from the GAL1-GAL10 promoter (34Fedor M.J. Lue N.F. Kornberg R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, more recent results have demonstrated that the chromatin structure in this intergenic region is not influenced by Reb1p binding (35Reagan M.S. Majors J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the importance of Reb1p binding for the arrangement of nucleosomes and the efficiency of transcriptional initiation is still obscure. Whether nucleosome exclusion is a general feature of Reb1p remains to be elucidated and is controversially discussed (22Chasman D.I. Lue N.F. Buchman A.R. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 29Moreira J.M. Hörz W. Holmberg S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 7004-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). More importantly, if nucleosome exclusion is a general feature, it is yet unknown which property of Reb1p prevents assembly of nucleosomes in the flanks of its binding site extending over distances as long as about 100 bp to either side.We show that constitutive transcription at the PFY1 promoter dispenses with classical transactivators. We demonstrate that Reb1p has an architectural role, and its DNA binding is necessary and sufficient to keep nucleosomes off the DNA region spanning the core promoter and the transcription initiation sites of the PFY1 promoter. Destruction of the Reb1p binding motif in the genomic context by site-directed point mutation leads to occupation of the promoter by randomly arranged nucleosomes and reduction of mRNA synthesis by a factor of 3. Permutation studies imply that nucleosome exclusion could be related to the strong bending of the DNA structure induced by Reb1p binding in conjunction with a neighboring dA·dT element. We conclude that, at the PFY1 promoter, transcription may ensue spontaneously as long as the core promoter is prebent and accessible to polymerase II holoenzyme. The actin cytoskeleton is fascinating because of both the complexity of its functions and the dynamics of its structure. In yeast, it has been shown to be involved in the establishment of cell polarity and bud site selection, in intracellular transport, and in signal transduction as well as in cytokinesis. According to the plethora of functions, the organization of the microfilament system and intracellular distribution of actin is highly dynamic and closely linked to the progression of the cell cycle. Despite continuous cell cycle-controlled reorganization of the cytoskeleton, the single actin gene in yeast (ACT1)1 is expressed constitutively (1McLean M. Hubberstey A.V. Bouman D.J. Pece N. Mastrangelo P. Wildeman A.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The polymerization state and organization of actin is controlled posttranscriptionally by accessory proteins (2Way M. Weeds A.

One of the actin-binding proteins is profilin (3Stossel T.P. Chaponnier C. Ezzell R.M. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lind S.E. Smith D.B. Southwick F.S. Yin H.L. Zaner K.S. Annu. Rev.

Cell. 1991; 66: 419-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It involves the binding of phosphoinositides to profilin and their controlled cleavage by phospholipase C, which could provide the basis for the regulation of profilin-actin interaction (10Lassing I.

Science. 1990; 247: 1575-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In fact, results of recent experiments on yeast profilin and CAP, a component of the yeast adenylyl cyclase complex, functionally link the growth signaling pathway to the control of the cytoskeleton (15Vojtek A. Haarer B. Field J. Gerst J. Pollard T.D. Brown S.S. Wigler M. Cell. 1991; 66: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Previously we have isolated and characterized the single structural gene for yeast profilin (PFY1) and shown that its deletion leads to a temperature-conditional phenotype. PFY1 is constitutively transcribed at a moderately high level (8Magdolen V. Oechsner U. Müller G. Bandlow W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5108-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Haarer B.K. Lillie S.H. Adams A.E.M. Magdolen V. Bandlow W. Brown S.S. J.

Amazingly little is known about the chromatin constellation at constitutive promoters and about transcription factors involved in transcription of housekeeping genes. It is supposed that constitutive transcription reflects a static situation in which the promoter is in a permanently activated state. Accordingly these promoters are presumed to be constitutively kept free of nucleosomes (18Scott E.W. Baker H.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Angermayr M. Oechsner U. Gregor K. Schroth G.P. Bandlow W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4199-4207Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), but the principles and mechanisms underlying nucleosome exclusion are far from clear. Moreover it is unknown whether constitutive transcription is basal transcription involving only the basal transcription apparatus or whether specific transactivators are required in addition. Sincecis-acting sites for any of the classical transactivators are absent from the 5′-flank of the PFY1 gene, we tested the hypothesis that constitutive transcription of this gene dispenses with classical transcription activators.

In addition to their functions as odorant receptors in olfactory epithelium, they have been suggested to play a role in the fertilization process. Here, we report the first in-depth analysis of their expression and regulation within testicular tissue. Sixteen HLA-linked OR and three non-HLA-linked OR were analyzed. One OR gene (hs6M1-16, in positive transcriptional orientation) exhibited six different transcriptional start sites combined with extensive alternative splicing within the 5′-untranslated region, the coding exon, and the 3′-untranslated region. Long distance splicing, exon sharing, and premature polyadenylation were features of another three OR loci (hs6M1-18, -21, and -27, all upstream of hs6M1-16, but in negative transcriptional orientation). Determination of the transcriptional start sites of these OR genes identified a region of 81 bp with potential bi-directional transcriptional activity.

Odorant receptors (OR) 1The abbreviations used are: OR, odorant receptor; HLA, human leucocyte antigen; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; OSN, olfactory sensory neuron; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; UTR, untranslated region; TM, transmembrane. encode the largest multigene family in vertebrates. More than 900 members, distributed in 24 clusters on nearly all chromosomes, were uncovered after sequence analysis of the human genome (1Glusman G. Yanai I. Rubin I. Lancet D.

However, it appears that fewer than 350 OR genes (∼40%) have an intact, undisrupted open reading frame (2Zozulya S. Echeverri F. Nguyen T. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-12Crossref Google Scholar) coding for all seven transmembrane (TM) domains that are characteristic for these G-protein-coupled receptors (3Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3726) Google Scholar, 4Dryer L. Berghard A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 413-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a high degree of OR polymorphism producing a variable functional repertoire with genes that are nonfunctional in one haplotype and functional in another (5Ehlers A. Beck S. Forbes S.A. Trowsdale J. Volz A. Younger R. Ziegler A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1968-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Despite these interindividual differences, the coding regions of vertebrate OR genes usually have a length of ∼1 kb and are not interrupted by introns, although some expressed sequence tag data suggest that splicing within the predicted open reading frame may occur, producing a protein with only five transmembrane domains (6Younger R.M. Amadou C. Bethel G. Ehlers A. Lindahl K.F. Forbes S. Horton R. Milne S. Mungall A.J. Trowsdale J. Volz A. Ziegler A. Beck S. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The frequency of this type of splicing in OR genes is currently unknown. A number of 5′-untranslated exons located up to 11 kb upstream have been found by computational prediction of the genomic organization of human and mouse OR genes (7Sosinsky A. Glusman G. Lancet D. Genomics. 2000; 70: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 8Glusman G. Clifton S. Roe B. Lancet D. Genomics. 1996; 37: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Ben-Arie N.

Expressed sequence tag analysis has even demonstrated a 5′-untranslated exon to exist ∼64 kb upstream of the coding exon (6Younger R.M. Amadou C. Bethel G. Ehlers A. Lindahl K.F. Forbes S. Horton R. Milne S. Mungall A.J. Trowsdale J. Volz A. Ziegler A. Beck S. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Support for this long distance splicing has also been provided by studies with transgenic mice revealing that genomic elements essential for transcription and axonal target recognition may be more than 50 kb upstream of the coding exon (10Serizawa S.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Most of the 5′-untranslated exons of OR described so far have been found by shared sequence identity in a limited region upstream of the coding exon (7Sosinsky A. Glusman G. Lancet D.

Additional exons that do not share identity with these exons may exist further upstream. Knowledge about such 5′-untranslated exons is of special relevance, because tissue-dependent alternative usage of these exons has already been demonstrated for one OR (11Asai H. Kasai H. Matsuda Y. Yamazaki N. Nagawa F. Sakano H. Tsuboi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 3′-Untranslated exons of OR genes have not been described so far. OR genes are expressed not only in the olfactory epithelium but also in numerous other organs (12Parmentier M. Libert F. Schurmans S. Schiffmann S. Lefort A. Eggerickx D. Ledent C. Mollereau C.

A. 1998; 95: 9072-9077Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), suggestive of additional functions. In the testes of several mammalian species including man, at least 50 OR genes are transcribed that could be involved in sperm development, sperm competition, chemotaxis, or interaction between sperm and oocyte (16Branscomb A. Seger J. White R.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 785-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Walensky L.D. Ruat M. Bakin R.E. Blackshaw S. Ronnett G.V. Snyder S.H. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2002; 48: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The involvement of OR in path finding has already been demonstrated for axon guidance of olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) (19Mombaerts P. Wang F. Dulac C. Chao S.K. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Edmondson J. Axel R. Cell. 1996; 87: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 20Wang F. Nemes A. Mendelsohn M. Axel R. Cell. 1998; 93: 47-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). For testicularly expressed OR, an involvement in self non-self-discrimination has been suggested that could have developed to favor fertilization of female gametes by genetically different male germ cells (21Ziegler A. Dohr G. Kentenich H. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Hanson J. Dupont B. HLA 2002: The Immunobiology of the human MHC. IHWG Press, Seattle, WA2003Google Scholar). However, next to nothing is known about the transcriptional control of OR genes. Only a single OR is expressed by a given OSN in a monoallelic fashion (22Chess A. Simon I. Cedar H. Axel R. Cell. 1994; 78: 823-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), probably to avoid the necessity of signal integration or scoring. It is enigmatic how this monoallelic expression mode is achieved for hundreds of OR genes present in a single OSN and whether it is implemented also in nonolfactory tissues. Interestingly, the analysis of promoter regions of the odorant transduction pathway components and other marker proteins of mature OSN has so far failed to reveal a general understanding of transcriptional control mechanisms. However, a consensus sequence, the Olf-1 site, that binds a transcription factor (early B-cell factors) expressed solely in OSN and early B-cells (23Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) has been identified. The importance of this site for OR expression has, however, been questioned, because mice with an early B-cell factors null mutation displayed a profound B-cell deficit but exhibited a morphologically normal olfactory epithelium, an expressed olfactory marker protein, and the OR-specific G-protein Golf (24Lin H. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1995; 376: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Recently, two additional transcription factors (O/E-2 and O/E-3) were identified that interact with the same DNA-binding site. They were found to be transcribed only in OSN, but their relevance for OR expression awaits confirmation (25Wang S.S. Tsai R.Y. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental evidence is also lacking for OLF-1 sites within the putative promoter region of some OR genes belonging to the chromosome 17p13.3 cluster (7Sosinsky A. Glusman G. Lancet D. Genomics. 2000; 70: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Likewise, the comparison of paralogous OR genes in man and mouse (6Younger R.M. Amadou C. Bethel G. Ehlers A. Lindahl K.F.

Our study addresses these problems by carrying out a detailed analysis of the transcriptional status of HLA-linked OR genes. We have employed testicular tissue for these studies to explore the function of these receptors in reproduction. We describe here that testicular OR gene transcripts are generated by a highly unorthodox combination of complex co- and post-transcriptional events, including long distance and intracoding exon splicing, exon sharing, and premature polyadenylation. Nomenclature for OR Genes—The Human Nomenclature Committee has not yet agreed on a common nomenclature for OR genes. 2S. Povey, personal communication. Therefore, we have used the original nomenclature under which these OR genes were first published (5Ehlers A. Beck S. Forbes S.A. Trowsdale J. Volz A. Younger R. Ziegler A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1968-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Ziegler A. Ehlers A. Forbes S. Trowsdale J. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Volz A. Younger R. Beck S. Kasahara M. Major Histocompatibility Complex: Evolution, Structure, and Function. Springer-Verlag, Tokyo2000: 110-130Crossref Google Scholar). Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—Gene-specific primers were located directly downstream of the start codon or in the third transmembrane domain for the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Initially, a “pool” PCR was conducted containing the anchor primer 1 (AP1, 10 pmol), the gene-specific primers of all analyzed OR (gene-specific primer 1, 10 pmol each; Table I), 0.5 ng of anchored cDNA (Marathon-Ready™ cDNA; Clontech), 2.5 units of Taq (Takara), and dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (0.2 mm each) in a 50-μl reaction. The following parameters were used: 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s for 35 cycles and finally 72 °C for 4 min. Subsequently, nested gene-specific PCRs were conducted using 0.5 μl of PCR product from the pool PCR, the respective nested gene-specific primer (gene-specific primer 2; Table II) and the nested anchor primer AP2 with the following parameters: 94 °C for 30 s, X °C (Table II, Temperature column) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s for 35 cycles and finally 72 °C 4 min. This nested PCR strategy eliminated much of the nonspecific background. In experiments with cDNA from freshly prepared testicular RNA (see below), the anchor primers AP1 and AP2 were replaced by SMART-TAG-1 and SMART-TAG-2, respectively (Tables III and IV).Table IOuter gene-specific primers for 5′-RACEGeneDesignationSequencehs6M1-1OR1-73rTGATATTAACAGGACCACAAAAAGGGGCAThs6M1-3OR3-111rAACAGGTTTCCTATCAGTGTCATCAAGTAGhs6M1-4POR4-116rGGATGATGATGAACAGGTTTCCTATCAGTGhs6M1-6OR6-62rCCACAAAGAGAACTACTTCCAGCTGAGGCChs6M1-10OR10-61rCATCACAAAGGGTGGAATCTCTAGCCATGGhs6M1-12OR12-58rGACAACCACGAAGAGAGTCCTTTCCAGCCChs6M1-13POR13p-310rATCACCGTCAGGAGGATGCACTCAGTGGTChs6M1-14POR14p-309rGGACGCATTCGGCGGAACCCAGhs6M1-15OR15-69rATGGCGACAACTCCTGACAGGATCATCTCChs6M1-16C-Test-OR16-45r + BioCTTTCCAGTGCTGGGTGTTChs6M1-17OR17-65rTGAGAAAGACAGAGAAGAGCAAGCCCTGGAhs6M1-18OR18-53rAGAAATGCAGTTCAGGGATGTCATAGAAGChs6M1-19POR19-5′313rACAACATGGCCTCTGTGCTGCCCAGhs6M1-20OR20-58rGAAAACCACGAAGAGAAAAGGCTGCAGTTChs6M1-21OR21-64rGAAGATGGTGAATAGTAAAAACTGCAATTChs6M1-27OR27-5′316rTGATAGCCAGTAAAATGGCCTCTGTGCTTChs7M1-2hs7-M1-2-60rAGGACAAACAGGGAGACCCGAGTGTCCCAGhs17M1-20hs17M1-20-62rAGAGGATGGGCTGTAGAGCTGCAGTCTCTGhs19M1-4hs19M1-4-72rGACAGAAACAGCCCAAAGAGGAAGGGCTGCAnchor primerAP1CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC Open table in a new tab Table IINested gene-specific primers for 5′-RACEGeneDesignationSequenceTemperature°Chs6M1-1OR1-40rnTAGCCAAGCCCTATCTGAGAAGCCAAGTAG66hs6M1-3OR3-73rnGACAACCACAAAGATAACTACTTCCAGATG64hs6M1-4POR4-60rnACAAAGAGAACTACTTCCAGATGAGGCCAG66hs6M1-6OR6-26rnAAAATCCAAGTAGAATAAAGAAGTCTTCCG61hs6M1-10OR10-22rnGAAAACTAACAGAATGAACTCCTGTGGGAC64hs6M1-12OR12-19rnAGAGAAGCCCAGAAGGAGGAAGCCCGGTGT70hs6M1-13POR13p-272rnCAGGAAGATGAAGAACTGGACAGAGCAGCC65hs6M1-14POR14p-276rnCGCACAGCTGGGCCGTGCAGTG65hs6M1-15OR-15-28GTTAGAGAAGCCAAGCAGAATAAAACCATG64hs6M1-16C-Test-OR16-20rCAGAAGGAGGAAGCCCATGG61hs6M1-17OR17-30rnGCCAGGTGGGAGAAGCCGAGAAGAAGAAAC70hs6M1-18OR18-17rnGGACAAATTCAGTAATAGTTTCGTTTCCTG61hs6M1-19POR19-5′279rnTGGAAGAAATGGAGTTGGCTTATGCATCCC66hs6M1-20OR20-24rnATGTCTGTCACTCCCAAGAGGAGAAATTCG66hs6M1-21OR21-20rnATCCCAAGATGATGAATTCAGTTATAGCTG61hs6M1-27OR27-5′279rnGTGGAAGAAGTGTAGCTGGGTGATACAGCC69hs7M1-2hs7-M1-2-18rnCCGAGGAGAATAAATTCACTCACCCAAGTC66hs17M1-20hs17M1-20-25rnCAGCAGGACAAACTTGGTCACAACTGAATC66hs19M1-4hs19M1-4-23rnGTCCCAGAAGAACAAATTCTGAAATCCCTG64Anchor primerAP2ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC Open table in a new tab Table IIIOuter gene-specific primers for 3′-RACEGeneDesignationSequencehs6M1-1L-OR1-3′fATTCAATAAACAAACATTGATTGCTTTCCThs6M1-3T-OR3-3′fCTGGCTTTTATTTTTTATTCATGTGTGCTGhs6M1-6T-OR6-3′fCTTTTGTCTTCAATCTGTTTGCAAGTGAGChs6M1-12T-OR12-3′fTGACCTCACAAACACCCAGGCTGAGTTTTGhs6M1-16T-OR16-3′fTGCTGTGACCTCACAAACACCCAGGCTGAGhs6M1-18T-OR18-3′fATAACGTTAGGCTTGGTATAGAAGATGCAGhs6M1-20OR20-59-3′fkorAGGTTTGGAAGAAGTACAACAGTACTCTCChs6M1-21T-Or21-3′fTGCAGCATATGATTCATTTTTATAATCTGGhs6M1-27OR27-1-3′fAGCAATGGAGAATGTCACTACAATGAATGAhs7M1-2T-hs7-3′f(ex2)AAAAAGGTCAAGGGCTACCTGAAAGACCGGK-hs7-3′fGATCTAAAATACCTGCCTAGGGCTGGCTGGhs17M1-20T-hs17-3′fTTGATGATTGTTATCAACACCTCACCCTGCAnchor primerAP1CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAnchor primer 2SMART-TAG1GAAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGA Open table in a new tab Table IVNested gene-specific primers for 3′-RACEGeneDesignationSequenceTemperature°Chs6M1-1L-OR1-3′nACATTTTTTTAGGAGTGCGAAATAAGTGAG61hs6M1-3T-OR3-3′nTTTTTGGATCATTTGTTTACTCGTTTTTTG58hs6M1-6T-OR6-3′nGCATGGACAGACTTTGAGTTTATGTGGTTC65hs6M1-12T-OR12-3′nTGAATCACACTGGGGTGACAGCCTCATCCC70hs6M1-16T-OR16-3′nGACAGGTTGAATCACACTGGGGTGACAGCC58, 5hs6M1-18T-OR18-3′nACATGCTAAAATTTCTCCCCCAATTATTGC58, 5hs6M1-20OR20-45-3′fnkor:AAATTCTGAGCCGGAAGGATTCTGATTGCG65hs6M1-21T-Or21-3′nTTTGCCCAATTCCTGAAAGGAAACCAGGCG65hs6M1-27OR27-3′-fnATGGAGAATGTCACTACAATGAATGAGTTT60hs7M1-2T-hs7-3′n(ex2)CCTCAAAGCATCCAAACCATCCCTATACTC65K-hs7-3′nGCTTCTGTTTTTTTCTGACTCCCTTCACAG65hs17M1-20T-hs17-3′nCCACCACCGGCCCCATCTAACACTGCTCAG70Anchor primer 1AP2ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGCAnchor primer 2SMART-TAG2GTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACTTT Open table in a new tab To analyze coding region and 3′-UTR, primers located directly upstream of the start codon or in the last third of the coding region were used (Tables III, IV, V).

Isolation of Total RNA and cDNA Synthesis—To preserve the RNA, human testis obtained from the Urologische Klinik, Universitätsklinikum Charité, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, was immersed in RNALater (Ambion) directly after surgery. Total RNA was purified by RNAgents® Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA with an oligo(dT) primer (Oligo-dT-SMART) using SuperScript™II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. cDNA quality was assessed by the amplification of housekeeping genes (Table VII; primer and conditions were from Ref. 31Dixon A.K.

Inserts of positive clones were amplified with vector-specific primers (M13APfor and M13Aprev; Table VII; 95 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 25 cycles and finally 72 °C for 7 min) and, after ethanol precipitation, utilized directly for automatic sequencing (Licor) with labeled M13 primers (M13for and M13rev; Table VII; 95 °C for 4 min, 95 °C for 15 s, 56 °C for 15 s, and 70 °C for 15 s for 27 cycles and finally 72 °C for 7 min; with 5% Me2SO). Promoter Search—An analysis of putative promoter regions was undertaken using the TRANSFAC data base, in conjunction with the MatInspector program (32Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar), and an in silico promoter search was performed using two pieces of software, Promoter Inspector (33Scherf M. Klingenhoff A. Werner T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and Eponine (34Down T.A. Hubbard T.J. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Functional Promoter Assay—The region of interest was cloned into the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) in front of the firefly luciferase reporter gene using restriction sites BglII and XhoI. All of the resulting constructs were verified by sequencing, and plasmid DNA was purified prior to transfection. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) (35Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) and Odora cells (36Murrell J.R. Hunter D.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8260-8270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 2 × 105 cells grown to 40–80% confluence were transfected using the manufacturer's protocol for SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). Luciferase activity was determined on 100 μl of the cells in medium with 100 μl of Bright-Glo reagent (Promega). After a 2-min incubation to allow complete cell lysis, the samples were placed in a luminometer (Berthold Sirius), and readings were taken. Activity values were normalized to the average activity of the pGL3 control vector (which contains SV40 Promoter and Enhancer sequences) after subtracting the background luminescence activity (medium without cells plus Bright-Glo reagent). Genomic Organization of HLA-linked OR Genes—The 5′- and 3′-UTRs of 16 HLA-linked and three unlinked OR genes were analyzed by RACE using an anchored testis cDNA library (Marathon-Ready™ cDNA, Clontech). To improve specificity, a second nested amplification was conducted prior to cloning and sequencing. Analysis of 5′-Untranslated Regions—Initially, gene-specific 5′ RACE primers were located directly downstream of the start codon. This proximal position was chosen to facilitate access to the very 5′ end of the transcripts. Because some G-protein-coupled receptors have been shown to be functional without the first two TM domains (37Ling K. Wang P. Zhao J. Wu Y.L. Cheng Z.J. Wu G.X. Hu W. Ma L. Pei G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7922-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), additional gene-specific primers located in the third TM domain were designed to take also account of a transcriptional start site further downstream. After amplification of the 5′-UTR, the RACE reactions were examined by Southern analysis with OR-specific probes (Fig. 1), before cloning and sequencing of individual amplicons. OR-specific sequences were analyzed with the BLAST algorithm (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71436) Google Scholar), revealing the genomic organization of the respective OR genes. Subsequently, splice donor and acceptor sites were verified. Despite two nested RACE reactions, a high background of false positive clones was obtained, especially for weakly expressed genes. The precise data are summarized in www.charite.de/immungenetik/ORexpression/exon-table.xls. 5′ RACE was successful for almost all of the analyzed HLA-linked OR. No positives were detected for hs6M1-4P, -13P, -14P, and -19P, which are, at least in some haplotypes, likely to be pseudogenes. 5′-UTRs of varying sizes but without additional exons were found for hs6M1-1, -3, -6, -10, -15, -17, and -20. In contrast, additional 5′ exons were uncovered for hs6M1-12, -16, -18, -21, and -27. 3Website address: www.charite.de/immungenetik/ORexpression/exon-table.xls. To compare HLA-linked and unlinked OR genes, 5′ RACE was also conducted for three OR genes located on other chromosomes. hs19M1-4 was not expressed in testis, hs17M1-20 was expressed but revealed no 5′ exon, and hs7M1-2 was expressed and showed two 5′ exons. For hs6M1-12, the most centromeric gene of the HLA-linked OR cluster, one additional 5′ exon (A) was identified ∼1.5 kb upstream of the start codon in three unrelated clones, and no additional 5′ exon was found in four unrelated clones. 3Website address: www.charite.de/immungenetik/ORexpression/exon-table.xls. hs6M1-21, -27, -18, and -16 genes are located in a genomic region of about 110 kb (Fig. 2) and show a very unusual genomic organization. hs6M1-21, the most telomeric gene, exhibited several 5′-untranslated exons and shared some of these exons (exon L, exon M, and exon S, (Fig. 2) 3Website address: www.charite.de/immungenetik/ORexpression/exon-table.xls. with hs6M1-27 and hs6M1-18. The first exon of hs6M1-21, observed in all three splice variants, was situated more than 100 kb upstream of the start codon. Variant 1 comprised only exon L, whereas variant 2 showed in addition to exon L another exon (M) ∼98 kb upstream of the initiator ATG codon. Variant 3 was found to contain exon S, situated ∼50 kb upstream of the start codon, and exon L (Fig. 2). 3Website address: www.charite.de/immungenetik/ORexpression/exon-table.xls. The coding region of hs6M1-27 was located ∼20 kb centromeric to the coding region of hs6M1-21.

We have demonstrated previously that LGE2reacts with the ε-amine of lysine to form both the levuglandinyl-lysine Schiff base and the pyrrole-derived levuglandinyl-lysine lactam adducts. We also have reported that these levuglandinyl-lysine adducts are formed on purified PGHSs following the oxygenation of arachidonic acid.

After proteolytic digestion of the platelet proteins, and isolation of the adducted amino acid residues, this adduct was identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We also demonstrate that formation of these adducts is inhibited by indomethacin, a PGHS inhibitor, and is enhanced by an inhibitor of thromboxane synthase. These data establish that levuglandinyl-lysine adducts are formed via a PGHS-dependent pathway in whole cells, even in the presence of an enzyme that metabolizes PGH2.

Utilizing this analytical approach, we have demonstrated formation of LG-lysine adducts on PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 following the oxygenation of arachidonic acid (6Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Chaurand P. Li J.

Formation of covalent adducts also was observed with proteins co-incubated with PGHS and arachidonic acid. These findings formed the basis for a hypothesis that PGHS activity in cells could generate levuglandinyl adducts of proteins. Oxygenation of arachidonic acid by PGHS-1 in platelet microsomes has been shown to produce arachidonic acid-derived adducts of multiple proteins (7Wilson A.G. Kung H.C. Anderson M.W. Eling T.E. Prostaglandins. 1979; 18: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Such labeling also has been reported in whole platelets (8Lecomte M. Lecocq R. Dumont J.E. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5178-5187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is increased when thromboxane A2 synthase is inhibited. However, the reactive product of arachidonic acid that forms these protein adducts has not yet been characterized. We hypothesized that these adducts of platelet proteins are formed from LGE2 and LGD2. This report provides evidence that levuglandinyl-lysine adducts of proteins are formed in cells as a consequence of the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by a PGHS. Dazoxiben was a generous gift from Pfizer Ltd. (Sandwich, UK). Methanol was ordered from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Arachidonic acid, sodium citrate, citric acid, indomethacin, and butylated hydroxytoluene were purchased from Sigma. Sepharose 2B is from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). OasisTM Sep-Pak cartridges were obtained from Waters Corp. (Milford, MA), and dimethyl formamide and trisphenylphosphine were from Aldrich. Pronase and aminopeptidase M from porcine kidney were from Calbiochem. Thrombin was obtained from Pharmingen. Human blood was obtained following a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Vanderbilt University. Washed human platelets were isolated following the protocol described previously (9Boutaud O. Aronoff D.M. Richardson J.H. Marnett L.J. Oates J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7130-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The blood was drawn with a syringe containing 5 ml of 3.87 sodium citrate (final volume: 50 ml), then centrifuged in plastic tubes at 300 × gfor 10 min at room temperature (23 °C). The supernatant (platelet-rich plasma) was acidified to pH 6.4 with 0.15 mcitric acid (10Lagarde M. Bryon P.A. Guichardant M. Dechavanne M. Thromb. Res. 1980; 17: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended with 5 ml of washing buffer (24.4 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.113m NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose). After 15 min at room temperature, the platelets were purified on a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated with washing buffer. The eluted platelets were counted with a Coulter counter and diluted with resuspension buffer (8.3 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.109 m NaCl, 5.5 mm glucose) for a final count of 600,000 platelets/ॖl. Washed platelets were then preincubated with indomethacin (final concentration of 100 ॖm), dazoxiben (final concentration of 10 ॖm), or vehicle for 30 min at room temperature. At this time, the platelets were activated by adding arachidonic acid (final concentration of 20 ॖm) or thrombin (final concentration of 1 Unit/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. After incubation, platelets were pelleted at 2,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the LG-lysine lactam adduct was isolated from proteins and analyzed by LC MS/MS as described previously (5Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol.

In short, 10 ml of cold ethanol (containing 50 mg/liter of butylated hydroxytoluene and 500 mg/liter of trisphenylphosphine) were added to the cell pellets, and the proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 2,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins were then reprecipitated in 10 ml of cold solution of methanol/chloroform 1:2 (v:v) and washed with 10 ml of methanol (each containing butylated hydroxytoluene and trisphenylphosphine). Then, partial digestion of proteins to single amino acid was performed using 3 mg of Pronase and 3 ॖl of aminopeptidase M (0.15 unit) per sample. After purification the LG-lysine lactam adduct was analyzed by LC MS/MS as described previously (5Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol.

Raychaudhuri S.R. Avasthi K. Lal K. Levison B. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 1990; 55: 3164-3175Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and [13C]lysine; the LG-lysine lactam standard was then purified as described previously (11Bernoud-Hubac N. Davies S.S. Boutaud O. Montine T.J. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30964-30970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We examined the formation of LG-lysine lactam adducts on platelet proteins following oxygenation of exogenous arachidonic acid. Following proteolytic digestion of platelet proteins, the products were analyzed by LC MS/MS. Selected reaction monitoring was used to analyze the LG-lysine lactam fragment ions derived from the levuglandinyl moiety (m/z 332.1) and the lysyl moiety (m/z 84.1) of the adduct (5Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Morrow J.D. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13139-13146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). From platelets incubated with 20 ॖmarachidonic acid, both of these fragment ions are detected (Fig.3). The simultaneous elution of the two fragment ions concurrently with the [13C]LG-lysine lactam standard provides consistent evidence that identifies the LG-lysine lactam adduct. Preincubation of the cells with indomethacin for 30 min markedly reduces the formation of the LG-lysine lactam from 169 to 20 pg of lactam/1 × 109 platelets. These findings demonstrate that levuglandins are generated in human platelets in a PGHS-dependent fashion and form covalent adducts with proteins.Figure 3Characterization of the levuglandinyl-lysine adducts from platelets. Human platelets were pre-incubated with indomethacin 100 ॖm or vehicle for 30 min. After incubation with 20 ॖm arachidonic acid for 15 min, the proteins from human platelets were precipitated and digested to single amino acids by step-digestion with Pronase and aminopeptidase M. The adducts were purified by chromatography on an OasisTMcartridge followed by a reverse phase HPLC and then analyzed by LC/ESI MS/MS. Selected reaction monitoring chromatograms for the transitions of m/z 479.4 to the daughter ions m/z 84.1, and 332.1, representing the LG-lysine lactam adducts formed from arachidonic acid, and the transitions of m/z 485.4 to the daughter ions m/z 89.1, and 332.1, representing the internal standard LG-lysine lactam adducts formed with [13C]lysine, are shown. The fragment ion atm/z 84.1 that elutes earlier than the internal standard does not co-elute with a corresponding fragment at m/z 332.1 and, therefore, is derived from a different molecule, possibly one containing lysine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of the theoretical possibility that activation of platelets with exogenous arachidonic acid might generate an amount of PGH2 that saturates its catalytic disposition by the thromboxane synthase, we also examined the formation of LG-lysine lactam adducts after activation of platelets with the physiological agonist, thrombin. As depicted in Fig. 4, LG-lysine adducts are formed following thrombin. Inhibition of formation of the adducts by indomethacin confirms that they are derived from oxygenation of arachidonic acid by the PGHS. Further evidence that the adducts are derived from PGH2 was obtained by examining the effect of dazoxiben, an inhibitor of thromboxane synthase. As shown in Fig. 5, inhibition of thromboxane synthase by dazoxiben led to an increase in the levels of LG-lysine lactam adduct (357 pg of lactam/1 × 109 platelets) by 2.1-fold compared with the control experiment in which no inhibitor was present. This report provides the first evidence that levuglandinyl adducts of proteins can be formed in a cell as a consequence of oxygenation of arachidonic acid by a PGHS. The immediate product of the PGHS, PGH2, is the substrate for synthases that catalyze its conversion to specific prostanoids. PGH2 also undergoes non-enzymatic rearrangement to several products, and the highly reactive ketoaldehydes, LGE2 and LGD2, account for ∼207 of these products. Even though levuglandinyl adducts of proteins have been demonstrated after exposure of the proteins to PGH2in vitro (2Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Salomon R.G. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9389-9939Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Chaurand P. Li J. Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Ji C. Marnett L.J. Caprioli R.M. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6948-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the competing enzymatic biotransformation of PGH2 in cells has provided a reason to question whether non-enzymatic rearrangement of PGH2 to LGE2 could occur in intact cells. To address this question, we chose to examine the platelet, in which there is robust biotransformation of PGH2 via the thromboxane synthase. Attention also has been focused on the platelet by the findings of Lecomte et al. (8Lecomte M. Lecocq R. Dumont J.E. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5178-5187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of uncharacterized, PGH2-derived adducts of at least 10 platelet proteins; one of these adducted proteins was PGHS-1, which we have shown to be adducted by levuglandin as a consequence of arachidonic acid oxygenation in vitro (6Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Chaurand P. Li J. Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Ji C. Marnett L.J. Caprioli R.M. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6948-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our finding that formation of the LG-lysine adduct of platelet proteins is inhibited by indomethacin indicates that its formation is a consequence of the oxygenation of arachidonic acid by the PGHS. The increased levels of LG-lysine adducts after treatment of the platelets with dazoxiben supports their origin from PGH2. The evidence that a levuglandinyl adduct of platelet proteins is derived from PGH2 provides support for the levuglandin pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism; it, of course, does not exclude the formation of adducts derived from other products of arachidonic acid. It may be concluded from these findings that LGE2 is formed in platelets and adducts platelet proteins even in the presence of an enzyme that uses PGH2as a substrate. The known properties of levuglandins provide a context for considering any possible functional consequences of the formation of such adducts of proteins. Clearly, adduct formation will add a lipophilic moiety to the protein. Considerable information on other lipid adducts of proteins indicates that they may alter processes such as localization, degradation, or function (13Buser C.A. Sigal C.T. Resh M.D. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13093-13101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As an example specific to the levuglandins, formation of levuglandinyl adducts on proteins significantly reduces their clearance by the 20 S proteasome (14Davies S.S. Amarnath V. Montine K.S. Bernoud-Hubac N. Boutaud O. Montine T.J. Roberts II, L.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 715-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Also, the initial species of the levuglandinyl adducts are known to be highly reactive. This can lead to cross-linking between proteins and DNA (4Murthi K.K. Friedman L.R. Oleinick N.L. Salomon R.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4090-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and between proteins and small molecules that contain amine groups (6Boutaud O. Brame C.J. Chaurand P. Li J. Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Ji C. Marnett L.J. Caprioli R.M. Roberts II, L.J. Oates J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6948-6955Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, levuglandinyl adducts can produce intermolecular cross-linking between proteins (3Iyer R.S. Ghosh S. Salomon R.G. Prostaglandins. 1989; 37: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, we have found that PGH2 accelerates the formation of amyloid औ oligomers in vitro (15Boutaud O. Ou J.J. Chaurand P. Caprioli R.M. Montine T.J. Oates J.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1003-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because of the irreversible character of the adducts and cross-linked proteins, they have the potential to accumulate in cells over time. In conclusion, cyclooxygenase-dependent formation of levuglandinyl adducts of proteins occurs during platelet activation. This finding provides a basis for investigations that address the possible function of these reactive lipid adducts of proteins in platelets, as well as in other cells in which there is abundant or protracted production of PGH2. We thank Dr. Sheila Timmons for her valuable advice."

RNA polymerase transcription initiation factor 5-(N′-[p-azidobenzoyl]-3-aminoallyl)-dUMP Bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzymes locate their cognate promoters through ς subunits that recognize specific DNA motifs located upstream of transcriptional start sites. ς subunits also participate in subsequent steps of the reaction sequence that generates an RNA chain-elongating transcription complex. For example: 1) ς54 is directly involved in initiating promoter opening next to its −12 DNA-binding site (1Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct.

In addition, ς70 and ς54 also mediate effects of proteins that activate transcription by allowing or accelerating promoter opening (9Rombel I. North A. Hwang I. Wyman C. Kustu S.

Eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases locate their promoters through DNA-bound complexes of core transcription initiation factors. Yeast RNA polymerase (pol)1 III is brought to its promoters primarily by interacting with its transcription factor TFIIIB, which is composed of subunits TBP, Brf1, and Bdp1 (previously called B“ or TFIIIB90). A homologous assembly operates at most human pol III promoters, whereas a paralogous assembly containing Brf2 (previously called BRFU or TFIIIB50) in place of Brf1 functions at a specialized subgroup of promoters that require participation of the SNAPC DNA-binding complex and its activators (reviewed in Refs. 11Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Schramm L. Hernandez N.

TFIIIB also participates in two post-recruitment steps of transcriptional initiation. The first evidence for this ς protein-like role of TFIIIB came from analysis of the properties of certain Brf1 and Bdp1 mutants that are inactive in transcription of linear DNA, although they recruit pol III to the promoter (15Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Hahn S. Roberts S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 719-730PubMed Google Scholar): 1) A cluster of Bdp1 internal deletions interferes with initiation of DNA strand separation of the upstream end of the transcription bubble; this defect can be repaired by unpairing a short (3 or 5 bp) DNA segment at the corresponding location, 5–9 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. 2) An N-terminal Brf1 deletion that removes its zinc-binding region interferes with propagation of DNA strand separation past the transcriptional start site; this defect is repaired by unpairing short DNA segments of the downstream end of the transcription bubble (17Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Breaks in either DNA strand in the vicinity of the transcriptional start also restore some transcriptional activity to these defective TFIIIB assemblies in a strand break location-specific and mutation-specific pattern. Interpretation of these effects of DNA breaks leads to an explanation of how Brf1 and Bdp1 help to enforce the upstream → downstream polarity of promoter opening (18Kassavetis G.A. Grove A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although the demonstration of a role for TFIIIB in promoter opening exposes a fundamental parallel between the action of initiation factors in bacterial and eukaryotic transcription, the distinctive architecture of bacterial and eukaryotic promoters may dictate corresponding differences of initiation mechanism. In particular, DNA strand separation at bacterial promoters initiates within or immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start-proximal DNA-binding sites of their ς subunits. On the other hand, the DNA-anchoring site of TFIIIB is centered ∼17 bp upstream of the upstream edge of the transcription bubble, and pol II as well as pol I promoter complexes are also DNA-anchored at some distance from (and primarily upstream of) the transcription bubble. Thus, it is not clear whether the TFIIIB subunits should be expected to interact directly with the pol III transcription bubble, as ς70 does, or whether they might act allosterically, perhaps through pol III subunits C82, C34, or C31, which have a clear role in open complex formation and in initiation of transcription (19Wang Z.

We report the outcome of experiments that approach this question by probing DNA proximity of TFIIIB in the DNA segment of the transcription bubble by site-specific photochemical cross-linking. The 198-bp (−60 to +138) pU6RboxB-derived transcription template has been described (25Grove A. Adessa M.S. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fully duplex and heteroduplex bubble-containing 86-bp (−56 to +30) photochemical cross-linking probes all differ from pU6RboxB at three positions: an upstream (−29) A → G substitution to generate a TGTA mutant TATA box for TFIIIB binding in a single orientation with the TBP variant, TBPm3 (26Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and two downstream (+8 and +9) A → T substitutions (Fig.1A). These substitutions were generated by PCR with mutagenic primers using the above-specified 198-bp transcription template (25Grove A. Adessa M.S. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and variants of this template that were previously used for making transcription templates with short heteroduplex bubbles (27Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Bottom (transcribed) strands that served as templates for primer-directed incorporation of the photoreactive deoxyribonucleotide 5-(N′-[p-azidobenzoyl]-3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (28Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with adjacent 32P-labeled deoxyribonucleotides (essentially as described in Ref. 29Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Kumar A. Ramirez E. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5299-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and heteroduplex formation were generated by PCR in which the primer for the bottom strand contained a ribonucleotide at its 3′ end for subsequent alkaline hydrolysis and denaturing gel isolation (25Grove A. Adessa M.S. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One half of each duplex photoreactive probe was denatured at 94 °C in the presence of a 3-fold molar excess of bottom strands altered in sequence to form either a −9/−5 or a +2/+6 heteroduplex bubble (Fig. 1A), followed by annealing for 60 min at 63 °C in 30 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 7 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Both duplex and heteroduplex probes were purified on MDE-Hydrolink (BioWhittaker) gels (30Holstege F.C. Timmers H.T. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1997; 12: 203-211Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The purification and quantification of proteins (with the exception of FLAG epitope-tagged pol III) has been described (17Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Quantities of pol III are specified as fmol of enzyme active for specific transcription (31Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar); quantities of other proteins are specified as fmol of protein. Wild type TBP and full-length Bdp1 were estimated to be nearly 100% active, and full-length Brf1 was estimated to be 20% active in the formation of heparin-resistant TFIIIB-DNA complexes. Brf1Δ366–409 (rtBrf1), the parental reference type for Brf1NΔ68, is 70% more active than Brf1 in specific transcription. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain NZ16 (32Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (originally constructed by Nick Zecherle and Benjamin Hall, University of Washington) was generously provided by Blaine Bartholomew (Southern Illinois University at Carbondale). The strain contains a hexahistidine tag followed by four tandem FLAG epitope tags at the N terminus of theRET1 gene (encoding the C128 subunit of pol III). A rapid purification scheme involving tandem chromatography on BioRex 70, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and heparin-Sepharose, using an automated fast protein liquid chromatography system, yielded apparently homogeneous pol III (as judged by silver staining) with 40% of molecules active for specifically initiating transcription. The details of the procedure and chromatography program are available upon request. Preinitiation complexes were prepared in two closely related ways. In procedure I (Figs. 1,B, C, and E, and2) TFIIIB-DNA complexes were formed during a 60-min incubation at 20 °C in 96 μl of binding buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 7 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml poly(dG-dC):poly(dG-dC), 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1.6 pmol of TBPm3, 1.4 pmol of Brf1, or 1 pmol of Brf1NΔ68, 0.9 pmol of Bdp1, or Bdp1Δ355–372, and 24 fmol of photoreactive DNA probe. This was followed by the addition of 600 ng of sheared salmon sperm DNA in 4 μl of diluent buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8, 0.1 mm Na3EDTA) and 9.6 fmol of FLAG-tagged pol III in 24 μl of buffer H (20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3EDTA, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin) also containing 65 mm(NH4)2SO4, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min. Complexes were UV-irradiated as described (33Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), loaded onto 20-μl anti-FLAG M2 agarose columns equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 7 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm Na3EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), washed four times with 40-μl aliquots of buffer A and eluted with 40 μl of buffer A containing 100 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide. Nuclease treatment followed (33Bartholomew B. Tinker R.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 476-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In procedure II (Fig. 1D) TFIIIB-DNA complexes were formed for 40 min in 40 μl of the above binding buffer containing 90 mm instead of 60 mm NaCl, 1.8 pmol of TBPm3, 200 fmol of Brf1, 300 fmol of Bdp1, and 12 fmol of photoreactive DNA probe. This was followed by the addition of 450 ng of sheared salmon sperm DNA in 3 μl of diluent buffer and 28 fmol of FLAG-tagged pol III in 8 μl of buffer H also containing 50 mm (NH4)2SO4 and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 more min prior to UV irradiation. Chromatography on anti-FLAG agarose proceeded as above. All of the experiments shown were replicated two or three times with essentially identical results. If Bdp1 and Brf1 play a direct role in DNA melting at the transcriptional start, they should contact this DNA segment. Both TFIIIB subunits can be cross-linked to both DNA strands near bp +1 in TFIIIB-DNA complexes (15Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B.

Biol. 1998; 63: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but it remained to be determined whether the proximity of Bdp1 and Brf1 to the start site of transcription is maintained upon entry of pol III into the initiation complex or whether these subunits of TFIIIB are displaced. The following approach was used to examine the cross-linking of TFIIIB in the presence of DNA-bound pol III. Initiation complexes were assembled with FLAG-tagged pol III on duplex DNA as well as DNA unpaired at the upstream end (bp −9 to −5) or downstream end (bp +2 to +6) of the transcription initiation bubble. Duplex DNA and bp −9/−5 “bubble” DNA were photoactively tagged in the nontranscribed strand at bp −8 and −7 with ABdUMP. Duplex and bp +2/+6 bubble DNA were also photoactively tagged in the nontranscribed strand at bp +2 and +3. Each DNA probe contained a radioactive nucleotide next to its photoactive nucleotides (Fig.1A). TFIIIB-pol III complexes assembled on these DNAs were UV-irradiated, pol III-containing complexes were separated from TFIIIB-DNA complexes on immobilized anti-FLAG antibody, and both the antibody-retained and flow-through materials were analyzed to identify cross-linked proteins. Control promoter complexes were made with TFIIIB alone, with the omission of Bdp1 and with promoter opening-defective TFIIIB assembled with Bdp1Δ355–372 or Brf1NΔ68. The nearly symmetric U6 TATA box allows some TBP binding and resultant assembly of TFIIIB-pol III complexes in the reverse orientation, which complicates structural interpretation of cross-linking. This problem was circumvented by the use of the mutant TBPm3 in conjunction with a TGTA box promoter (TGTAAATA) (26Whitehall S.K. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Strubin M. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 68: 721-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Truncating the upstream end of the DNA probe at bp −56 also eliminated the possibility of pol III binding to reverse-oriented TFIIIB-DNA complexes. The principal result of the analysis of probes photoactively tagged at bp −8 and −7 was that both Bdp1 and Brf1 (the latter cross-linking more weakly) are located in the vicinity of DNA in a pol III-containing complex (Fig. 1B, lane 15). TFIIIB complexes were cleanly separated from TFIIIB-pol III-DNA complexes on the anti-FLAG column (lanes 1–5 and 11–15); omission of Bdp1 prevented pol III recruitment (lanes 6–10). The C160, C128, C82, and C34 subunits of pol III were also cross-linked to DNA at this location. Preopening bp −9 to −5 restores the transcriptional activity of promoter opening-defective Bdp1 internal deletion mutants. Completely opening bp −9 to −5 by unpairing clearly correlated with greatly increased cross-linking of the C82 pol III subunit in the presence of full-length Bdp1 (Fig. 1C, lane 7; compare the ratio of the C82:Brf1 signals with Fig. 1B, lane 15). Although this result appears to imply that cross-linking of the C82 subunit at positions −8/−7 is an inherent property of open complex formation, this may not be the case. Wild type TFIIIB-pol III-duplex DNA complexes formed and UV-irradiated at 30 °C (open) and 0 °C (closed) both displayed equivalent, low levels of C82 cross-linking relative to Bdp1, Brf1, and the other subunits of pol III (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 3; only the FLAG peptide-eluted fractions are shown). The somewhat weaker cross-linking of all proteins in Fig. 1D (lane 3, relative to lane 1) was not reproducibly observed and probably reflects variations in the efficiency of pol III assembly at 0 °C or in recovery of complexes from anti-FLAG agarose, because the relative efficiencies of all protein cross-linking (including C34; not shown) at 30 and 0 °C were indistinguishable. Cross-linking to C160 and C128 (relative to Bdp1 and Brf1) also increased when the bp −9/−5 segment was preopened but did not change between 30 and 0 °C in complexes formed with duplex DNA. Cross-linking at the downstream segment of the transcription bubble was also examined. Preopening bp +2 to +6 restores transcriptional activity to TFIIIB assembled with the N-terminal deletion subunit Brf1NΔ68. Full-length Bdp1 and Brf1 were found to cross-link to the nontranscribed strand at bp +2/+3 in duplex DNA along with C128 (Fig.1E, lane 10) and C34 (not shown). Cross-linking of the largest pol III subunit, C160, at this location was very weak. Opening the bp +2/+6 bubble greatly increased the efficiency of Brf1 cross-linking and also increased Bdp1 cross-linking relative to C128 (lane 5). Pol III entry into the bp +2/+6 bubble promoter changed the relative efficiencies of Brf1 and Bdp1 cross-linking (compare lanes 2 and 5). Cross-linking of Brf1 and Bdp1 to DNA at bp +2/+3 does not require promoter opening, because it was also observed in FLAG antibody-purified TFIIIB-pol III promoter complexes formed and UV-irradiated at 0 °C and because the relative cross-linking efficiencies of C160, C128, Bdp1, Brf1, and C34 at 30 and 0 °C were indistinguishable (data not shown). The above results indicate that Bdp1 and Brf1 lie in close proximity to the upstream and downstream borders of the prospective and actual open complex. Because the photoreactive moiety of ABdUMP barely protrudes beyond the edge of the major groove (28Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), both subunits could potentially play a direct role in the nucleation of DNA strand opening and downstream propagation of the bubble. Small (∼15 amino acids) deletions between amino acids 355 and 421 of Bdp1 prevent the onset of DNA strand separation at the upstream edge of the prospective transcription bubble. Deletion of the N-terminal 68 amino acids of Brf1 prevents the downstream propagation of the transcription bubble. The effect of promoter opening-defective Bdp1 and Brf1 deletion mutants on the cross-linking of TFIIIB and pol III subunits near the start site of transcription was examined next (Fig. 2). Protein-DNA complexes containing both pol III and TFIIIB were affinity-purified after UV irradiation, as in the preceding experiment. Only the FLAG peptide-eluted fractions are shown. TFIIIB-pol III-DNA complexes assembled with Bdp1Δ355–372 displayed significantly diminished cross-linking of Bdp1, Brf1, and the C160, C128, and C82 subunits of pol III relative to the C34 subunit of pol III to bp −8/7 in duplex DNA (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and2). A similar diminution of C160 and C128 cross-linking was previously observed with Bdp1Δ372–387 in a mixture of TFIIIB- and TFIIIB-pol III-DNA complexes (15Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Preopening the bp −9/−5 bubble, which allows a fully open complex to be formed with Bdp1Δ355–372, partially restored C160, C128, Bdp1, and Brf1 cross-linking relative to C34 (compare lanes 5 and 2). The effect of deleting Bdp1 amino acids 355–372 on cross-linking at the downstream end of the transcription bubble (probe +2/+3) was more pronounced, with a nearly complete loss of cross-linking of Bdp1, Brf1, and the C128 subunit of pol III but not of C34 cross-linking (compare lanes 7 and 8). The loss of pol III large subunit cross-linking to duplex DNA evidently reflects a subtle structural change, in light of a prior methidiumpropyl EDTA-Fe(II) footprinting analysis of the transcribed strand of TFIIIB-pol III-DNA complexes formed with wild type Bdp1 and Bdp1Δ372–387 (17Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showing identical protection of duplex DNA in this region. Opening the bp +2/+6 bubble, which does not ameliorate the promoter opening defect of Bdp1Δ355–372 (17Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), partly restored C128, Brf1, and Bdp1 cross-linking (compare lanes 11 and 8). Deletion of the N-terminal 68 amino acids of Brf1 had nearly the opposite effect, in that cross-linking of the C34 pol III subunit at bp −8/−7 in duplex DNA decreased significantly relative to that of Bdp1, Brf1, C160, and C128 (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and3). The most pronounced effect of the NΔ68Brf1 deletion on TFIIIB-pol III complexes was the loss of cross-linking of the C82 subunit of pol III (lane 3). Opening the bp −9/−5 bubble restored cross-linking to C82 and increased cross-linking to C34 (lane 6). The pol III complex assembled on bp −9/−5 bubble promoters with Brf1NΔ68 remains defective in downstream bubble propagation and transcription (17Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), so restoration of C82 cross-linking to bp −8 and −7 only reflects local strand separation rather than transcriptional competence. Brf1NΔ68 had little effect on the pattern of cross-linking at downstream segment of the transcription bubble (probe +2/+3; lanes 9 and 12). In summary, we conclude that Bdp1, Brf1, and four pol III subunits lie close to the upstream edge of the transcription bubble both in open and in closed promoter complexes. One signature of this segment of the open complex transcription bubble is cross-linking of the C82 pol III subunit, which increases when this region is preopened and dramatically decreases in complexes formed with promoter opening-defective Brf1NΔ68. Proximity of Brf1 and Bdp1 to DNA extends downstream of the transcriptional start site, in both open and closed pol III-promoter complexes. The characteristic of the downstream site is the loss of cross-linking of Bdp1, Brf1, and the C128 pol III subunit in complexes formed with Bdp1Δ355–372. The regions in Bdp1 and Brf1 that cross-link to the nontranscribed strand of the transcription bubble lie outside of the protein segments whose deletion prevents open complex formation (that is, outside Bdp1 amino acids 355–421 and Brf1 amino acids 1–68; data not shown). Four subunits of pol III (C160, C128, C82, and C34), Bdp1, and Brf1 all lie close to bp −8 and −7 on the nontranscribed strand at the upstream end of the open complex transcription bubble. At bp +2 and +3, at the downstream end of the open complex transcription bubble, cross-linking of C160 diminished significantly, and cross-linking of C82 was not detected. This pattern of cross-linking is similar to what has been observed previously on the SUP4tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes, with the exception that cross-linking to Bdp1 and Brf1 was either barely detectable or absent downstream of bp +1 in the presence of TFIIIC but could be detected at bp +6 when TFIIIC was removed (Ref. 34Bartholomew B. Durkovich D. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 942-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; see Ref. 32Lannutti B.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9821-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar for a comprehensive survey of protein cross-linking between bp −17 and +17). The proximity of these pol III and TFIIIB subunits to these sites was not strongly dependent on open complex formation; the same subunits were cross-linked at 30 and 0 °C. The close proximity of the nontranscribed strand to multiple protein subunits near the start site of transcription has also been observed in human pol II initiation complexes: Rpb1, Rpb2, TFIIB, and the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF co-cross-link at the upstream edge of the prospective transcription bubble in both closed and open promoter complexes; Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb5, TFIIE-α, and the ERCC3 subunit of TFIIH co-cross-link at the downstream edge of the transcription bubble (38Kim T.K. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D. Science. 2000; 288: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Two aspects of the cross-linking patterns are somewhat puzzling and deserve comment. First, it is possible to rationalize the cross-linking of six subunits of pol III and TFIIIB to the −8/−7 probe (or four subunits to the +2/+3 probe) in open promoter complexes. The nontranscribed strand of the pol III open complex is not constrained (18Kassavetis G.A. Grove A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5508-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and therefore might not be tethered to any particular site. However, the same proteins are also cross-linked to DNA at 0 °C in the absence of DNA strand separation. Although the ABdUMP reactive side chain has some rotational flexibility, it barely projects beyond the DNA major groove, making it unlikely that two adjacent side chains would access six proteins. Heterogeneity of pol III placement at the start site of transcription by TFIIIB would account for the diversity of subunits cross-linked at 0 °C. This possibility clearly applies to the previously analyzed TATA-less SUP4 tRNA gene, for which alternative placements of TFIIIB by TFIIIC lead to heterogeneity in selection of the transcriptional start site (39Andrau J.C. Werner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 40Joazeiro C.A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, this does not appear to be the case for the TATA-containing SNR6(U6) gene; initiation occurs exclusively at bp +1 on U6 DNA templates with an intact transcribed strand (25Grove A. Adessa M.S. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We suggest instead that the polymerase-DNA association in the TFIIIB-pol III-promoter closed complex is transient, like that of bacterial RNA polymerase closed complexes. Transient release and reassociation of duplex DNA with pol III would account for the diversity of cross-linking observed at 0 °C. We note that the DNase I and methidiumpropyl EDTA-Fe(II) footprints of gel-purified TFIIIB-pol III-DNA complexes are less complete for pol III than for TFIIIB (Fig. 4c in Ref. 15Kassavetis G.A. Kumar A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9196-9201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, Fig. 7 in Ref. 27Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5042-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, and Fig. 8 in Ref. 17Kassavetis G.A. Letts G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2823-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), an observation that would also be accounted for by a loosely held pol III-DNA interaction. Transient association of DNA may also partly account for the cross-linking of nine proteins to ABdUMP at bp −5 on the transcribed strand in pol II preinitiation complexes (Ref.41Douziech M. Coin F. Chipoulet J.M. Arai Y. Ohkuma Y. Egly J.M. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8168-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar; although partial complex assemblies may exist in this study, three subunits of the final member of this complex, TFIIH, cross-link to this position). The second peculiarity concerns the absence of strong differences between the patterns of cross-linking at 0 and 30 °C. One anticipates that the pattern of cross-linking at bp +2/+3 would change when the promoter opens because a fully opened promoter complex pulls an additional 4–5 bp of downstream DNA into polymerase (25Grove A. Adessa M.S. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 704-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and open complex formation should accordingly shift the location of bp +2 and +3 relative to protein. In contrast, we found no significant difference in the relative levels of cross-linking of C160, C128, Bdp1, Brf1, and C34 at 30 and 0 °C (data not shown). However, preopening the downstream end of the transcription bubble between bp +2 and +6 significantly enhanced +2/+3 probe cross-linking of Brf1 relative to C128 (Fig.1E). A prior analysis of the SUP4 tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes suggested that cross-linking of the C82 subunit of pol III might also depend on open complex formation (35Bartholomew B. Braun B.R. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18090-18095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that work, C82 was cross-linked to DNA containing the photoreactive nucleotide 4-S-thymidine upstream of the start site of transcription but not with ABdUMP at the same positions. Efficient cross-linking to 4-S-thymidine, like its RNA counterpart, 4-S-uridine, occurs at sites that become unpaired or helically distorted (42Nikiforov T.T.

Again, no difference in the relative amounts of C82 cross-linking at bp −8/−7 was observed between 0 and 30 °C (Fig. 1D), yet preopening the upstream end of the transcription bubble increased the relative efficiency of C82 cross-linking ∼4-fold (Fig. 1C). The simplest interpretation of the above observations is that even at 30 °C, the TFIIIB-pol III-DNA complex is predominantly closed. If the 4-fold difference in C82 cross-linking reflects the difference between closed and fully open complexes, then open complex formation at 30 °C would need to be less than 20% to obscure detection of increased C82 cross-linking. Alternatively, the changed pattern of cross-linking that is generated by preopening different segments of the transcription bubble may result from a fraction of these templates that fail to enter the single-stranded binding channel of pol III. A single-stranded bubble lying at the surface of polymerase in the closed complex would have considerably greater reach and flexibility than duplex DNA. Deletions and point mutations in the N-terminal domain containing the zinc ribbon motif and the adjacent sequence of both Brf1 and TFIIB display three similar properties: 1) a defect in binding their cognate polymerases, 2) alterations in transcriptional start site selection and 3) a defect in transcription at a step subsequent to polymerase recruitment (16Hahn S.

TFIIB has also been observed to cross-link to DNA within the transcription bubble region of the pol II initiation complex (38Kim T.K. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D. Science. 2000; 288: 1418-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is likely that the post-recruitment roles of TFIIB and Brf1 are related mechanistically but not necessarily in open complex formation. The cross-linking experiments shown here demonstrate an intimate proximity of Brf1 and Bdp1 to the DNA segment that becomes unwound in the pol III open complex and also to the pol III subunits likely to be involved in open complex formation (Fig. 1). This proximity is consistent with a direct involvement of TFIIIB in the DNA strand separation process during open complex formation. However, the effects of promoter opening-defective deletion mutations in Bdp1 and Brf1 on cross-linking do not provide additional evidence for the direct involvement of TFIIIB. In particular, the expectation that the segments of Brf1 and Bdp1 whose deletion prevents open complex formation would be proximal to the prospective or actual open complex transcription bubble is not realized (Fig. 2). Instead, the region of Bdp1 that cross-links to the bp −8 and −7 probe has been tentatively mapped between Met425 and Cys485, using a technique similar to one that was described previously (Ref. 53Shah S.M. Kumar A. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28736-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and data not shown). The results of these experiments favor an indirect mode of action of TFIIIB in open complex formation. If promoter opening-defective deletion mutations in Bdp1 or Brf1 alter or prevent DNA/protein contacts by pol III that are required for pol III-mediated DNA strand opening, one would predict that these deletions might affect the cross-linking of pol III subunits. This is what is observed (Fig. 2). Promoter opening-defective Bdp1 mutations grossly alter the proximity of pol III to DNA, reducing cross-linking of C160, C128, and C82 to bp −8 and −7 and obliterating cross-linking of all pol III subunits, except for C34, to bp +2 and +3. Similarly, the promoter opening-defective Brf1NΔ68 affects cross-linking of the C82 and C34 pol III subunits to bp −8 and −7. Thus, although the Brf1 and Bdp1 subunits of TFIIIB are located close to the transcriptional start site in pol III-containing preinitiation complexes and can be cross-linked from the upstream and even the downstream edge of the DNA segment that forms the transcription bubble, the evidence of this analysis favors an indirect, pol III-mediated mode of action of TFIIIB in promoter opening rather than a bacterial ς-like direct participation in DNA strand separation.

We report that PGE2 accelerated ProNectin FTM (a proteolytic fragment of fibronectin)-mediated adhesion, which was abolished by addition of the GRGDS peptide, an inhibitor of the RDG binding site of ProNectin FTM. We show that the cAMP level and cAMP-regulated protein kinase (PKA) activity are critical mediators of this PGE2 effect, because the cell-permeable cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP accelerated P-815 cell adhesion to ProNectin FTM and the pharmacological inhibitor of PKA, H-89, blocked PGE2-mediated adhesion. Consistent with mRNA expression of the Gs-coupled EP4- and Gi-coupled EP3-PGE receptor subtypes, P-815 cell adhesion was accelerated by treatment with a selective EP4 agonist, ONO-AE1–329, but not a selective EP1/EP3 agonist, sulprostone. However, simultaneous treatment with ONO-AE1–329 and sulprostone resulted in augmentation of both the cAMP level and cell adhesion. The augmentation of EP3-mediated cAMP synthesis was dose-dependent, without affecting the half-maximal concentration for EP4-mediated Gs-activity, which was inhibited by a Gi inhibitor, pertussis toxin. In conclusion, these findings suggest that PGE2 accelerates RGD-dependent adhesion via cooperative activation between EP3 and EP4 and contributes to the recruitment of mast cells to the ECM during inflammation.

MCs are widely distributed in tissues throughout the body, especially in connective tissues, serosal cavities, and on mucosal surfaces under normal physiological conditions. This characteristic distinguishes MCs from other bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils.

As well known for rodent connective tissue-typed MCs and mucosal-typed MCs, the biological activity of MCs vary with their interactions with the ECM and other cells.MCs are widely distributed along basement membranes, indicating that MCs might adhere to laminin. Supporting this fact, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) have been reported to adhere to laminin, when the cells were activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1Thompson H.L.

In addition to laminin, MCs can adhere to other matrix components such as fibronectin (5Dastych J. Costa J.J. Thompson H.L. Metcalfe D.D. Immunology. 1991; 73: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar) and vitronectin (6Bianchine P.J. Burd P.R. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3665-3671PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gurish, M. F., Bell, A.

As with laminin, the adherence of BMMC to fibronectin has been reported to occur through activation with PMA or after aggregation of FcεRI. These adherence activities required calcium (3Thompson H.L. Burbelo P.D. Yamada Y. Kleiman H.K. Metcalfe D.D. Immunology. 1991; 72: 144-149PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to BMMC, the mouse PT18 cell line spontaneously adhered to laminin (1Thompson H.L. Burbelo P.D. Segui-Real B. Yamada Y. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2323-2327PubMed Google Scholar), and human skin mast cells also spontaneously adhered to laminin and fibronectin (8Walsh L.J. Kaminer M.S. Lazarus G.S. Lavker R.M. Murphy G.F. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 433-439PubMed Google Scholar). These previous findings indicate that the interactions between MCs and matrix components may depend on the cells involved and the kinds of stimuli.PGE2, which is involved in inflammation section (9Ohuchi K.

PGE2 enhances mast cell differentiation from cord blood mononuclear cells (10Saito H. Ebisawa M. Tachimoto H. Shichijo M. Fukagawa K. Matsumoto K. Iikura Y. Awaji T. Tsujimoto G. Yanagida M.

However, no reports have published the effects of PGE2 on MC adhesion to the ECM.The PGE2 receptors (EP) are comprised of four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, which are coupled to different G proteins and signal pathways (14Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 15Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Among these subtypes, EP2 and EP4 couple to Gs, resulting in increases of intracellular cAMP concentrations (16Katsuyama M. Nishigaki N. Sugimoto Y. Morimoto K. Negishi M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A.

Very recently, we and other investigators have reported that activation of the Gi-coupled EP3 receptor was able to augment adenylyl cyclase activity via stimulation of a Gs-coupled receptor (22Hatae N.

We previously reported that the mouse EP3β receptor was able to augment EP2-induced adenylyl cyclase activity in both EP2- and EP3-transfected COS-7 cells (22Hatae N. Yamaoka K. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Southall and Vasko (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed that the simultaneous depletion of rat EP3C and EP4 was essential to abolish PGE2-stimulated cAMP production and neuropeptide release in rat sensory neurons (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These permissive actions between the two subtypes may be involved in the events of a number of physiological actions of PGE2 (15Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Here we extended the analyses of the effects of PGE2on adhesion of mouse mastocytoma P-815 cells to the fibronectin component in a PKA-dependent manner, and we examined the correlation between cAMP levels and adhesion in P-815 cells to see whether EP3 could augment EP4-induced cAMP synthesis.DISCUSSIONPGE2 was previously reported to affect both differentiation and growth of mast cells in vitro. For example, PGE2 is essential for the differentiation of IL-3-dependent mouse mast cells from spleen cells (30Hu Z.Q. Asano K. Seki H. Shimamura T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2134-2142PubMed Google Scholar), PGE2 enhanced human mast cell differentiation from cord blood mononuclear cells by inhibiting the production of macrophage-derived GM-CSF (10Saito H. Ebisawa M. Tachimoto H. Shichijo M. Fukagawa K. Matsumoto K. Iikura Y. Awaji T. Tsujimoto G. Yanagida M. Uzumaki H. Takahashi G. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 343-350PubMed Google Scholar), and PGE2 enhanced the growth of differentiated mast cells in a fibroblast co-culture system (11Kameyoshi Y. Morita E. Tanaka T. Hiragun T. Yamamoto S. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 2000; 292: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that PGE2 plays a role in the interaction of mast cells with fibroblastic cells and extracellular matrix components. The interaction between mast cells and extracellular matrix components have profound influences on the targeting of mast cell progenitors to specific locations, the distribution of mast cell subsets, and the biological responsiveness of mast cells in tissues. The ability of mast cells to adhere to fibronectin, which involves the RGD sequence located within the cell-attachment domain of the fibronectin molecule, may play a role in the migration of mast cells in various tissues (5Dastych J. Costa J.J. Thompson H.L. Metcalfe D.D. Immunology. 1991; 73: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we found that PGE2 is able to stimulate the adhesion of P-815 cells to Pronectin-F through the RGD cell attachment domain of fibronectin, and that this adherent activity is mediated via a cAMP-dependent pathway induced by the activation of the EP4 and/or EP3 receptors. It is possible that the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway may be involved in the induction of these cell attachment molecules, as PGE2-induced cell attachment was inhibited by treatment with H-89 (Fig. 3B) and cycloheximide (data not shown). However, neither PGE2 nor 8Br-cAMP augmented the expression of VLA-5, one of the fibronectin receptors (data not shown). Therefore, cycloheximide may affect the signaling pathway of the fibronectin receptors. Further experiments are required to clarify these points.Prostaglandin E2 acts through binding to its specific receptors, which are comprised of four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (14Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 15Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Among them, EP3 and EP4 couple to Gi and Gs, and result in inhibition and stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, respectively (17Honda A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Watabe A. Irie A. Negishi M.

Commun. 1994; 204: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mouse EP3 receptor is comprised of three isoforms, EP3α, EP3β, and EP3γ, which differ in their C terminus. Among them, EP3β, which was used in this experiment is known to be coupled to the Gi protein (19Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Hayashi Y. Namba T. Honda A. Watabe A. Hirata M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, activation of a Gi-coupled receptor has been reported to augment the adenylyl cyclase activity induced by the stimulation of a Gs-coupled receptor in COS-7 cells. For example, activation of Gi-coupled receptors such as α2 adrenoreceptor (29Fereman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and bradykinin B2 receptor (32Hanke S. Nurnberg B. Groll D.H. Liebmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8452-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) lead to the augmentation of Gs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in COS-7 cells. This synergistic effect has not been clearly shown in mammalian cells. Southall and Vasko (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed that the simultaneous depletion of both rat EP3C and EP4 was essential for abolishing PGE2-stimulated cAMP production and neuropeptide release in rat sensory neurons (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the current experiment we showed that the Gi-coupled EP3 agonist sulprostone augmented cAMP formation induced by the EP4 agonist ONO-AE1-329 in P-815 cells. Similarly, we found that sulprostone was able to augment cAMP formation in P-815 cells activated by an IP agonist, carbacyclin, suggesting that the augmentative effects of EP3 can be observed irrespective of Gs activation. The mechanism underlying these phenomena was thought to be via Gβγ-mediated activation of type IV adenylyl cyclase (29Fereman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), because pretreatment with PT inhibited the augmentation by the activation of the Gi-coupled EP3 receptor, and P-815 cells express type IV adenylyl cyclase (data not shown). Therefore, Gβγ-mediated activation of type IV adenylyl cyclase may be involved in EP3-mediated signaling to augment EP4-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in P-815 cells.Although the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in cell adhesion to matrix proteins is shown in a variety of cell types (33Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of PI3K in mast cell adhesion is still unknown. Kinashiet al. (31Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the adhesion of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-expressed bone marrow-derived mast cells was inhibited by the addition of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. To understand whether PI3K is activated by PGE2 during P-815 cell adhesion, we examined the effect of the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (10 μm) on EP3/EP4-agonist induced cell adhesion to fibronectin. As a result, these inhibitors showed an additive effect on the augmentation of PGE2-induced cell adhesion (wortmannin: 81.7 ± 0.1% and LY294002: 82.4 ± 0.2%, compared with PGE2stimulation alone: 24.8 ± 0.6%). Furthermore, each inhibitor alone had an effect on cell adhesion (wortmannin: 20.4 ± 0.1% and LY294002: 24.1 ± 0.1%, compared with the absence of these inhibitors (3.3 ± 0.1%)). Therefore, these results indicate that P-815 cell attachment to fibronectin is regulated by two independent signaling pathways involving PKA and PI3K. Further experiments are necessary to clarify the fundamental differences in the signaling involving PKA and PI3K in P-815 cell attachment to fibronectin. In summary, this study clearly demonstrates that two subtypes of the PGE2 receptor, EP3 and EP4, are cooperatively involved in PGE2-evoked and cAMP-mediated functions of P-815 cell adhesion. Differentiated mast cells (MCs),1 which originate from bone marrow stem cells, traffic throughout the circulation and adhere to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in various tissues. MCs are widely distributed in tissues throughout the body, especially in connective tissues, serosal cavities, and on mucosal surfaces under normal physiological conditions. This characteristic distinguishes MCs from other bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cells, such as basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils.

As well known for rodent connective tissue-typed MCs and mucosal-typed MCs, the biological activity of MCs vary with their interactions with the ECM and other cells. MCs are widely distributed along basement membranes, indicating that MCs might adhere to laminin. Supporting this fact, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC) have been reported to adhere to laminin, when the cells were activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1Thompson H.L.

In addition to laminin, MCs can adhere to other matrix components such as fibronectin (5Dastych J. Costa J.J. Thompson H.L. Metcalfe D.D. Immunology. 1991; 73: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar) and vitronectin (6Bianchine P.J. Burd P.R. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3665-3671PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gurish, M. F., Bell, A. F., Smith, T. J., Ducharme, L. A., Wang, R.-K., and Weis, J. H. (149) J. Immunol. 149, 1964–1972.Google Scholar). As with laminin, the adherence of BMMC to fibronectin has been reported to occur through activation with PMA or after aggregation of FcεRI. These adherence activities required calcium (3Thompson H.L. Burbelo P.D. Yamada Y. Kleiman H.K. Metcalfe D.D. Immunology. 1991; 72: 144-149PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to BMMC, the mouse PT18 cell line spontaneously adhered to laminin (1Thompson H.L. Burbelo P.D. Segui-Real B. Yamada Y. Metcalfe D.D. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2323-2327PubMed Google Scholar), and human skin mast cells also spontaneously adhered to laminin and fibronectin (8Walsh L.J. Kaminer M.S. Lazarus G.S. Lavker R.M. Murphy G.F. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 433-439PubMed Google Scholar). These previous findings indicate that the interactions between MCs and matrix components may depend on the cells involved and the kinds of stimuli. PGE2, which is involved in inflammation section (9Ohuchi K. Yoshino S. Kanaoka K. Tsurufuji S. Levine L. Int. Archs. Allergy Appl. Immun. 1982; 68: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), affects both differentiation and growth of MCs in vitro. PGE2 enhances mast cell differentiation from cord blood mononuclear cells (10Saito H. Ebisawa M. Tachimoto H. Shichijo M. Fukagawa K. Matsumoto K. Iikura Y. Awaji T. Tsujimoto G. Yanagida M.

Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) reported that a COX-2 inhibitor suppressed αVβ3-dependent HUVEC spreading, migration, and angiogenesis through Rac activation (12Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and PGE2 accelerated αVβ3-mediated HUVEC responses in a cAMP-dependent manner (13Dormond O. Bezzi M. Mariotti A. Ruegg C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45838-45846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, no reports have published the effects of PGE2 on MC adhesion to the ECM. The PGE2 receptors (EP) are comprised of four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, which are coupled to different G proteins and signal pathways (14Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 15Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Among these subtypes, EP2 and EP4 couple to Gs, resulting in increases of intracellular cAMP concentrations (16Katsuyama M. Nishigaki N. Sugimoto Y. Morimoto K. Negishi M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A.

Very recently, we and other investigators have reported that activation of the Gi-coupled EP3 receptor was able to augment adenylyl cyclase activity via stimulation of a Gs-coupled receptor (22Hatae N. Yamaoka K. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol.

We previously reported that the mouse EP3β receptor was able to augment EP2-induced adenylyl cyclase activity in both EP2- and EP3-transfected COS-7 cells (22Hatae N. Yamaoka K. Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Ichikawa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Southall and Vasko (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed that the simultaneous depletion of rat EP3C and EP4 was essential to abolish PGE2-stimulated cAMP production and neuropeptide release in rat sensory neurons (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These permissive actions between the two subtypes may be involved in the events of a number of physiological actions of PGE2 (15Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Here we extended the analyses of the effects of PGE2on adhesion of mouse mastocytoma P-815 cells to the fibronectin component in a PKA-dependent manner, and we examined the correlation between cAMP levels and adhesion in P-815 cells to see whether EP3 could augment EP4-induced cAMP synthesis. DISCUSSIONPGE2 was previously reported to affect both differentiation and growth of mast cells in vitro. For example, PGE2 is essential for the differentiation of IL-3-dependent mouse mast cells from spleen cells (30Hu Z.Q. Asano K. Seki H. Shimamura T. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2134-2142PubMed Google Scholar), PGE2 enhanced human mast cell differentiation from cord blood mononuclear cells by inhibiting the production of macrophage-derived GM-CSF (10Saito H. Ebisawa M. Tachimoto H. Shichijo M. Fukagawa K. Matsumoto K. Iikura Y. Awaji T. Tsujimoto G. Yanagida M. Uzumaki H. Takahashi G. Tsuji K. Nakahata T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 343-350PubMed Google Scholar), and PGE2 enhanced the growth of differentiated mast cells in a fibroblast co-culture system (11Kameyoshi Y. Morita E. Tanaka T. Hiragun T. Yamamoto S. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 2000; 292: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that PGE2 plays a role in the interaction of mast cells with fibroblastic cells and extracellular matrix components. The interaction between mast cells and extracellular matrix components have profound influences on the targeting of mast cell progenitors to specific locations, the distribution of mast cell subsets, and the biological responsiveness of mast cells in tissues. The ability of mast cells to adhere to fibronectin, which involves the RGD sequence located within the cell-attachment domain of the fibronectin molecule, may play a role in the migration of mast cells in various tissues (5Dastych J. Costa J.J. Thompson H.L. Metcalfe D.D. Immunology. 1991; 73: 478-484PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we found that PGE2 is able to stimulate the adhesion of P-815 cells to Pronectin-F through the RGD cell attachment domain of fibronectin, and that this adherent activity is mediated via a cAMP-dependent pathway induced by the activation of the EP4 and/or EP3 receptors. It is possible that the cAMP-protein kinase A pathway may be involved in the induction of these cell attachment molecules, as PGE2-induced cell attachment was inhibited by treatment with H-89 (Fig. 3B) and cycloheximide (data not shown). However, neither PGE2 nor 8Br-cAMP augmented the expression of VLA-5, one of the fibronectin receptors (data not shown). Therefore, cycloheximide may affect the signaling pathway of the fibronectin receptors. Further experiments are required to clarify these points.Prostaglandin E2 acts through binding to its specific receptors, which are comprised of four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (14Coleman R.A.

Among them, EP3 and EP4 couple to Gi and Gs, and result in inhibition and stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, respectively (17Honda A. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Watabe A. Irie A. Negishi M.

Among them, EP3β, which was used in this experiment is known to be coupled to the Gi protein (19Sugimoto Y. Negishi M. Hayashi Y. Namba T. Honda A. Watabe A. Hirata M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, activation of a Gi-coupled receptor has been reported to augment the adenylyl cyclase activity induced by the stimulation of a Gs-coupled receptor in COS-7 cells. For example, activation of Gi-coupled receptors such as α2 adrenoreceptor (29Fereman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and bradykinin B2 receptor (32Hanke S. Nurnberg B. Groll D.H. Liebmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8452-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) lead to the augmentation of Gs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in COS-7 cells. This synergistic effect has not been clearly shown in mammalian cells. Southall and Vasko (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed that the simultaneous depletion of both rat EP3C and EP4 was essential for abolishing PGE2-stimulated cAMP production and neuropeptide release in rat sensory neurons (23Southall M.D. Vasko M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16083-16091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the current experiment we showed that the Gi-coupled EP3 agonist sulprostone augmented cAMP formation induced by the EP4 agonist ONO-AE1-329 in P-815 cells. Similarly, we found that sulprostone was able to augment cAMP formation in P-815 cells activated by an IP agonist, carbacyclin, suggesting that the augmentative effects of EP3 can be observed irrespective of Gs activation. The mechanism underlying these phenomena was thought to be via Gβγ-mediated activation of type IV adenylyl cyclase (29Fereman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), because pretreatment with PT inhibited the augmentation by the activation of the Gi-coupled EP3 receptor, and P-815 cells express type IV adenylyl cyclase (data not shown). Therefore, Gβγ-mediated activation of type IV adenylyl cyclase may be involved in EP3-mediated signaling to augment EP4-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in P-815 cells.Although the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in cell adhesion to matrix proteins is shown in a variety of cell types (33Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the role of PI3K in mast cell adhesion is still unknown. Kinashiet al. (31Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the adhesion of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-expressed bone marrow-derived mast cells was inhibited by the addition of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. To understand whether PI3K is activated by PGE2 during P-815 cell adhesion, we examined the effect of the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin (100 nm) and LY294002 (10 μm) on EP3/EP4-agonist induced cell adhesion to fibronectin. As a result, these inhibitors showed an additive effect on the augmentation of PGE2-induced cell adhesion (wortmannin: 81.7 ± 0.1% and LY294002: 82.4 ± 0.2%, compared with PGE2stimulation alone: 24.8 ± 0.6%). Furthermore, each inhibitor alone had an effect on cell adhesion (wortmannin: 20.4 ± 0.1% and LY294002: 24.1 ± 0.1%, compared with the absence of these inhibitors (3.3 ± 0.1%)). Therefore, these results indicate that P-815 cell attachment to fibronectin is regulated by two independent signaling pathways involving PKA and PI3K. Further experiments are necessary to clarify the fundamental differences in the signaling involving PKA and PI3K in P-815 cell attachment to fibronectin. In summary, this study clearly demonstrates that two subtypes of the PGE2 receptor, EP3 and EP4, are cooperatively involved in PGE2-evoked and cAMP-mediated functions of P-815 cell adhesion. PGE2 was previously reported to affect both differentiation and growth of mast cells in vitro. For example, PGE2 is essential for the differentiation of IL-3-dependent mouse mast cells from spleen cells (30Hu Z.Q. Asano K. Seki H. Shimamura T. J.

https://openalex.org/W2027038969,"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) plays a key regulatory role in arterial blood pressure homeostasis. We recently generated mice with selective deletion of the ANP receptor, guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A), in vascular smooth muscle (SMC GC-A knockout (KO) mice) and reported that resting arterial blood pressure was completely normal in spite of clear abolition of the direct vasodilating effects of ANP (Holtwick, R., Gotthardt, M., Skryabin, B., Steinmetz, M., Potthast, R., Zetsche, B., Hammer, R. E., Herz, J., and Kuhn M. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 7142–7147). The purpose of this study was to clarify mechanisms compensating for the missing vasodilator responses to ANP. In particular, we analyzed the effect of the endothelial, cGMP-mediated vasodilators C-type natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide (NO). In isolated arteries from SMC GC-A KO mice, the vasorelaxing sensitivity to sodium nitroprusside and the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine, was significantly greater than in control mice. There was no difference in responses to C-type natriuretic peptide or to the activator of cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP. The aortic expression of soluble GC (sGC), but not of endothelial NO synthase or cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, was significantly increased in SMC GC-A KO mice. Chronic oral treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester increased arterial blood pressure, the effect being significantly enhanced in SMC GC-A KO mice. We conclude that SMC GC-A KO mice exhibit a higher vasodilating sensitivity to NO. This can be attributed to an enhanced expression of sGC, whereas the expression and/or activity levels of downstream cGMP-effector pathways are not involved. Increased vasodilating responsiveness to endothelial NO contributes to compensate for the missing vasodilating effect of ANP in SMC GC-A KO mice.

Chronic oral treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester increased arterial blood pressure, the effect being significantly enhanced in SMC GC-A KO mice. We conclude that SMC GC-A KO mice exhibit a higher vasodilating sensitivity to NO. This can be attributed to an enhanced expression of sGC, whereas the expression and/or activity levels of downstream cGMP-effector pathways are not involved. Increased vasodilating responsiveness to endothelial NO contributes to compensate for the missing vasodilating effect of ANP in SMC GC-A KO mice. smooth muscle cells atrial natriuretic peptide B-type natriuretic peptide C-type natriuretic peptide nitric oxide NO synthase endothelial NO synthase guanylyl cyclase-A soluble guanylyl cyclase knockout cGMP-dependent protein kinase 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP sodium nitroprusside Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine 3-morpholinosydnonimine beats per minute Cyclic GMP-dependent modulation of vascular tone is fundamental to the regulation of blood pressure. The levels of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC)1 are regulated by the activities of three different guanylyl cyclases (GCs): soluble GC (sGC), the intracellular receptor for endothelial nitric oxide (NO) (1Ignarro L. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar); particulate GC-A, a specific membrane receptor for the cardiac natriuretic peptides, atrial (ANP) and B-type (BNP) natriuretic peptides (2Garbers D.L.

Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar); and particulate GC-B, a specific receptor for the endothelial C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) (4Drewett J.G. Fendly B.M.

Burnett Jr., J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H1318-H1321PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of either GC results in the conversion of GTP to the intracellular messenger cGMP. Subsequent increases in cellular cGMP modulate the activity of specific cGMP-effector molecules, i.e.cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKG I), ultimately leading to decreased cytosolic calcium levels and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells (6Lincoln T.M. Corwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 7Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.-X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thereby, local factors released by the vascular endothelium (NO and CNP) and circulating hormones (ANP and BNP) cooperate in the cGMP-mediated regulation of vascular tone. In addition, it has been suggested that the vasodilating effect of ANP involves endothelial GC-A and is partly mediated by the stimulation of the local release of NO and CNP (8Leitman D.C.

In the past years, the development of several monogenetic mouse models contributed to elucidate the role of these factors and their respective receptor-GCs in the regulation of blood pressure. In particular, mice lacking endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) (12Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), ANP (13John S.W.M. Veress A.T. Honrath U. Chong C.K. Peng L. Smithies O. Sonnenberg H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: R109-R114PubMed Google Scholar), or the ANP receptor, GC-A (14Lopez M.J. Wong S.K. Kishimoto I. Dubois S. Mach V. Friesen J. Garbers D.L. Beuve A. Nature. 1995; 378: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 15Oliver P.M. Fox J.E. Kim R. Rockman H.A. Kim H.S. Reddick R.L. Pandey K.N. Milgram S.L. Smithies O. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A. 1997; 94: 14730-14735Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), exhibit drastic arterial hypertension, experimental observations that emphasize the importance of cGMP-dependent vasodilation in cardiovascular homeostasis. Because the soluble and particulate GC/cGMP systems have complementary roles in blood pressure homeostasis, an interaction between these pathways to regulate cGMP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells might represent an important physiological mechanism to control vascular tone. In this way, an excess or deficiency in one mediator could be compensated by the other, or conversely, the interaction may constitute a negative feedback system that prevents overactivation of cGMP signaling in SMC by NO and/or natriuretic peptides. Indeed, acute or chronic alterations of endothelial NO production in human and murine arteries resulted in reciprocal changes in the vasorelaxing responses to ANP (16Hussain M.B. MacAllister R.J. Hobbs A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1151-H1159Crossref Google Scholar). The authors suggested that the NO/sGC system modulates the sensitivity and/or expression levels of GC-A in a cGMP-dependent manner (16Hussain M.B. MacAllister R.J. Hobbs A.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1151-H1159Crossref Google Scholar). Vice versa, it is not clear whether changes in the vasodilating effects of ANP modulate the activity and/or vasodilating effects of the NO/sGC and CNP/GC-B systems. In a recent study, we developed a new genetic mouse model in which the GC-A receptor is selectively deleted in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC GC-A KO mice) (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, despite the clear abolition of the direct vasorelaxing effects of ANP, the resting blood pressure of conscious SMC GC-A KO mice is completely normal. This was unexpected since the decisive role of the ANP/GC-A system in the chronic regulation of arterial blood pressure has been clearly shown by the hypertensive phenotype of mice with generalized GC-A gene deletion (14Lopez M.J. Wong S.K. Kishimoto I. Dubois S. Mach V. Friesen J. Garbers D.L. Beuve A. Nature. 1995; 378: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar,15Oliver P.M. Fox J.E. Kim R. Rockman H.A. Kim H.S.

One possibility is that in the long term setting, other cGMP-dependent vasodilating systems, such as NO/sGC or CNP/GC-B, compensate for the missing vasodilating effects of ANP. To address this possibility, in the current study, we evaluated the responsiveness of SMC GC-A KO mice to different cGMP-mediated vasodilators. In addition, we took advantage of the selective inhibition of GC-A expression in vascular smooth muscle cells to dissect the specific endothelium-mediated vasodilating effects of ANP in intact vessel preparations. Mice with selective abolition of the ANP receptor, GC-A, in vascular smooth muscle (SMC GC-A KO mice) were generated as described (loxP/Cre recombination system) (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Genotypings were by Southern blot (verification of the floxed GC-A and the Cre-deleted GC-A alleles) and PCR analyses (detection of the SM22-Cre transgene) of tail DNA. Studies were done with 4-month-old floxed GC-A mice (which retain normal GC-A expression levels) and SMC GC-A KO littermates (floxed GC-A mice harboring the SM22-Cre transgene) (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). All experimental protocols included in this manuscript were approved by the local animal care committee and conform with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U. S. National Institutes of Health (32U. S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. NIH, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar). For the in vitro studies, mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The aorta was dissected free of surrounding tissue and used for organ chamber studies, Western blot analysis, and determination of cGMP content and sGC activity. Ring segments of the descending thoracic aorta (luminal diameter, Ø, 2000–2200 μm) were mounted in a myograph (model 410A; J.P. Trading, Aarhus, Denmark) for recording of isometric wall tension (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After a 15-min equilibration in temperated (37 °C), oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, rings were contracted with phenylephrine (10 μm; Sigma), and the relaxant response to cumulative concentrations of ANP, CNP (both obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), acetylcholine (both from Sigma), or 8-para-chlorophenylthio-cGMP (8p-CPT-cGMP; from Biolog, Bremen, Germany) was tested. ANP was tested in the presence and absence of the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor,Nw-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (100 μm L-NAME; Sigma). To determine the expression levels of eNOS, sGC, and PKG I, frozen aortas were homogenized and analyzed by Western blot. Samples (20 μg of protein/lane) were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were first incubated with specific antisera against PKG I (19Markert T. Vaandrager A.B. Gambaryan S. Pohler D. Hausler C. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. J. Clin.

For quantitative analysis, the blots were scanned and quantified using Amersham Biosciences ImageQuant software. The antibody against PKG I was a generous gift from Dr. Suzanne Lohmann (19Markert T.

Aortic rings were incubated in temperated (37 °C) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 1 mm). After 15 min, rings were treated with either vehicle (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) or the NO donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, 10 or 100 μm; Sigma) for an additional 5 min. Thereafter, rings were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized, and cGMP was extracted with ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. After centrifugation (13000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatants were dried in a speed vacuum concentrator, resuspended in sodium acetate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0), and acetylated, and then the cGMP contents were quantified by radioimmunoassay (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 20Pierkes M.

The pellets of the ethanol extracts were used for determination of protein content according to the method of Bradford (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B.

Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) according to Li et al. (22Li D. Zhou N. Johns R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L841-L847PubMed Google Scholar). Individual aortas were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 ×g (4 °C) (23Zabel U. Kleinschnitz C. Oh P. Nedvetsky P. Smolenski A. Müller H. Kronich P. Kugler P. Walter U. Schnitzer J.E. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To initiate cyclase activity, supernatants (4 μg of protein) were incubated in assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm IBMX, 1 mm GTP, 7.5 mmcreatine phosphate, and 200 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (185 units/mg) at 37 °C in the presence of the NO donor SIN-1 (10 μm). At 5 min of incubation, the reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold 100% (v/v) ethanol (final concentration, 70%), and cGMP was extracted and measured as described above. The animals were housed under a 12-h day/night cycle and fed a standard diet containing 0.6% NaCl (normal salt conditions). Floxed GC-A mice (n = 10) and SMC GC-A KO littermates (n = 9) were treated with the inhibitor of NO synthase, L-NAME (∼100 mg/kg/day), via drinking water for 21 days according to published studies (24Kojda G. Laursen J.B. Ramasamy S. Kent J.D. Kurz S. Burchfield J. Shesely E.G. Harrison D.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured in conscious mice by tail-cuff plethysmography (Softron, Tokyo) as described previously (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 25Lopez M.J. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23064-23068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), before and during oral L-NAME treatment. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. (n = number of animals). The EC50 for agent-induced relaxation in aortic rings was calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of mean contraction (% of relaxation)versus log [agent] (GraphPad Prism 1.00; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Statistical comparison of floxed GC-A mice (as controls) and SMC GC-A KO mice was performed by unpaired Student's ttest. The serial changes in arterial blood pressure and heart rate before (control period) and after L-NAME treatment were analyzed by a repeated measures analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparisons test (GraphPad InStat software). pvalues of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The contracting responses of aortic rings to phenylephrine (10 μm) were not different between genotypes. ANP (100 pm to 1 μm) induced the complete relaxation of preconstricted aortic rings obtained from floxed GC-A mice (controls, with normal GC-A expression levels) but had only marginal relaxing effects on arteries from SMC GC-A KO mice (Emax, 88 ± 3% versus 26 ± 5%) (Fig. 1). Pretreatment of aortic rings with the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (100 μm) completely abolished the small relaxing responses to ANP observed in aortas from SMC GC-A KO mice, whereas relaxations in floxed GC-A mice were unaffected. The EC50 for ANP relaxation in floxed GC-A aortas was 6.9 ± 1.4 nm in the absenceversus 4.8 ± 1.4 nm in the presence of L-NAME (no significant difference) (Fig. 1). L-NAME pretreatment totally prevented the relaxing responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (1 nm to 10 μm) in both genotypes (Emax for acetylcholine, 7 ± 3% in the presenceversus 66 ± 4% in the absence of L-NAME,p < 0.05). Relaxations in response to acetylcholine (1 nm to 10 μm) and to the NO donor SNP (100 pm to 10 μm) were both significantly greater in aortas from SMC GC-A KO mice as compared with floxed GC-A mice (Fig.2). The EC50 for acetylcholine relaxation in floxed GC-A mice was 346 ± 60 nm, and in SMC GC-A KO mice, it was 158 ± 21 nm (p < 0.05). The EC50 for SNP was 17.4 ± 3.8 in floxed GC-A and 6.5 ± 1.3 in SMC GC-A KO mice (p < 0.05). In contrast, CNP (100 pm to 1 μm) and the PKG-activator 8p-CPT-cGMP (100 nm to 100 μm) had similar effects in aortas from both genotypes (Fig. 2). The EC50 for CNP was 93.2 ± 19 nm in floxed GC-A and 136 ± 23 nm in SMC GC-A KO mice, and for 8p-CPT-cGMP, it was 33.7 ± 13 μmversus 32.6 ± 6.6 μm (no significant difference). The lower potency of CNP relative to that of ANP is similar to previous reports (25Lopez M.J. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23064-23068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanisms mediating the enhanced vasorelaxing responses to SNP and acetylcholine, downstream effectors were studied. As shown in Fig.3, the expression levels of both sGC subunits α1 and β1 were significantly enhanced in aortas from SMC GC-A KO mice as compared with floxed GC-A mice. In contrast, the expression levels of eNOS and of a downstream target for cGMP, PKG I, were not different between genotypes (Fig.3). The basal cGMP content in aortic rings was slightly greater in floxed GC-A as compared with SMC GC-A KO mice (235 ± 17 versus 179 ± 14 pmol/mg of protein, n = 5; p < 0.05). Incubation with SIN-1 increased cGMP content in aortic rings from floxed GC-A (at 100 μm SIN-1) and SMC GC-A KO mice (at 10 and 100 μm SIN-1) (Fig. 4). When compared with the respective basal cGMP content of each individual aorta, the increases of cGMP in response to SIN-1 were significantly greater in SMC GC-A KO (6.6 ± 0.7-fold increase at 100 μm SIN-1 versus untreated controls) as compared with floxed GC-A mice (3.4 ± 0.5-fold increase at 100 μm SIN-1; n = 5; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). First, to test the linearity of the assay, SIN-1-stimulated sGC activity was compared in samples containing 1, 2, or 4 μg of protein extracted from wild-type mouse aortas. As shown in Fig. 5A, doubling the protein content of the samples (and thereby the amount of sGC protein) resulted in a proportional increase of SIN-1-stimulated cGMP formation (n = 3). Fig. 5B demonstrates that SIN-1 (10 μm)-stimulated sGC activity in protein extracts from SMC GC-A KO aortas was significantly higher than in floxed GC-A aortas by ∼ 170% (n = 5; p < 0.05). To ascertain whether increased sensitivity to endothelial NO affects chronic blood pressure levels, conscious homozygous floxed GC-A (n = 10) and SMC GC-A KO mice (n = 9) were treated with the NOS-inhibitor L-NAME. Systolic blood pressure was measured in awake mice by tail-cuff plethysmography. As reported previously (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), initial blood pressures and heart rates were not significantly different between floxed GC-A and SMC GC-A KO mice (Fig.6). L-NAME (100 mg/kg of body weight/day, orally) provoked a significant rise in systolic blood pressure levels by 13 ± 3.7 mm Hg in floxed GC-A mice (from 118 ± 2.6 mm Hg at baseline to 131 ± 3.8* mm Hg after L-NAME) and by 28 ± 3.3 mm Hg in SMC GC-A KO mice (113 ± 2.7 mm Hg at baseline; 141 ± 1.6* mm Hg after L-NAME; *, p < 0.05 versus baseline). This was associated with a significant decrease in heart rate (floxed GC-A mice, 623 ± 12 bpm at baseline and 541 ± 17* bpm after L-NAME; SMC GC-A KO mice, 632 ± 18 bpm at baseline and 549 ± 21* bpm after L-NAME; *,p < 0.05 versus baseline). As shown in Fig.6, the hypertensive but not the bradycardic response to L-NAME was significantly greater in SMC GC-A KO mice as compared with floxed GC-A mice. In the present study, we demonstrate that mice with selective deletion of the ANP receptor in vascular smooth muscle exhibit an increased sensitivity to nitrovasodilators and endothelial NO but not to downstream targets of the cGMP pathway (PKG I) and other cGMP-mediated vasodilators, such as CNP. The results indicate a close interaction between the ANP/GC-A and NO/sGC pathways, which does not affect the CNP/GC-B pathway. Using the Cre/loxP gene recombination strategy, we recently generated mice with selective deletion of the ANP receptor, guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A), in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC GC-A KO mice) and reported that chronic blood pressure was completely normal in spite of clear abolition of the direct vasodilating effects of ANP (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). This was unexpected because the decisive role of the ANP/GC-A system in the chronic regulation of arterial blood pressure has been clearly shown by the hypertensive phenotype of mice with generalized GC-A gene deletion (14Lopez M.J. Wong S.K. Kishimoto I. Dubois S. Mach V. Friesen J. Garbers D.L. Beuve A. Nature. 1995; 378: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 15Oliver P.M. Fox J.E. Kim R. Rockman H.A. Kim H.S. Reddick R.L. Pandey K.N. Milgram S.L. Smithies O. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14730-14735Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the chronic reduction of blood pressure by ANP might be mainly mediated by the other known endocrine actions of the hormone such as the inhibition of the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin-aldosteron systems as well as the stimulation of renal function (2Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocrine Rev. 1994; 15: 135-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Alternatively other vasodilating systems might be able to compensate for the missing vasodilating effects of ANP when all other cardiovascular actions of the peptide are preserved. To address this possibility, in the current study, we compared the vascular expression levels of eNOS as well as the responsiveness of floxed GC-A mice (which exhibit normal GC-A expression levels) and SMC GC-A KO mice to different cGMP-mediated vasodilators. As shown, the vascular expression levels of eNOS were similar in both genotypes. Also, the vasorelaxing responses to CNP and to the membrane-permeable cGMP analog, 8p-CPT-cGMP, were identical in aortas of floxed GC-A and SMC GC-A KO mice. However, the latter exhibited an increased vasorelaxing sensitivity to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine, and to the NO donor, SNP. ANP may alter the NO-sGC-cGMP transduction cascade in several ways, affecting the release of endothelial NO (10Ravichandran L.V. Johns R.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or the expression as well as the activity of sGC and targets further downstream. Since the vasorelaxing responses to CNP and to 8p-CPT-cGMP were identical in aortas with and without deletion of GC-A in smooth muscle cells, alterations of downstream effectors or modulators of cGMP, such as PKG I or phosphodiesterases (6Lincoln T.M. Corwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 7Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.-X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), are excluded as a cause for the increased NO sensitivity in SMC GC-A KO mice. Indeed, Western blot analysis showed that the vascular expression levels of PKG I, a common downstream target for all cGMP-dependent vasodilators (6Lincoln T.M. Corwell T.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar,7Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.-X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), are not different in floxed GC-A and SMC GC-A KO mice. In contrast, the vascular expression levels of the sGC α1 and β1 subunit proteins were significantly enhanced in aortas from SMC GC-A KO as compared with floxed GC-A mice. This was concordant with an increased effect of the NO donor, SIN-1, on both the cGMP content of aortic rings and the enzymatic activity of sGC in aortic homogenates from SMC GC-A KO mice. Thus, deletion of the GC-A gene in SMC leads to increased expression of sGC, which renders the arteries more susceptible to increases in cGMP and to vasodilation by NO. Notably, despite the 2-fold increase in vascular sGC expression levels, basal cGMP contents in aortas from SMC GC-A KO mice were slightly lower as compared with floxed GC-A littermates. However, basal cGMP levels in vascular tissues are regulated by the activity of both soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclases (GC-A and GC-B). Therefore, it is likely that the deletion of GC-A in smooth muscle cells accounts for the lower cGMP levels observed in unstimulated aortic rings from SMC GC-A KO mice under in vitro conditions. The increased protein expression of sGC was also observed in aortas obtained from younger, 6–8-week-old SMC GC-A KO mice (not shown), indicating that the compensatory changes in the NO/sGC/cGMP pathway are present already at early stages. To determine whether the studies with isolated arteries reflectedin vivo effects on blood pressure, adult (4-month-old) mice were subjected to chronic treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME. As shown, L-NAME significantly increased the blood pressure levels of floxed GC-A and SMC GC-A KO littermates. Remarkably, the magnitude of blood pressure increases was significantly more pronounced in the latter group, suggesting that increased vasodilator responsiveness to endogenous, endothelial NO indeed contributes to the maintenance of physiological arterial blood pressure levels in mice with abolished vasodilator responses to ANP. Our observations somehow differ from the results by Melo et al. (26Melo L.G. Veress A.T. Ackermann U. Sonnenberg H. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1826-H1833PubMed Google Scholar) in ANP-deficient mice (ANP−/−). In this study, the hypertensive responses to L-NAME were not different in ANP−/− and wild-type mice, suggesting that the synthesis of or responsiveness to endothelial NO was not enhanced by chronic ANP deficiency. The following are possible explanations for the divergent results: absence of ANP (ANP−/−) may result in an increased expression of vascular SMC GC-A, and the consequent increase in basal activity of this receptor may prevent compensatory changes of the NO/sGC system; also, circulating BNP levels may still activate vascular GC-A receptors in ANP−/− mice. Why did the deletion of SMC GC-A enhance the vasorelaxing responsiveness to NO and not to CNP? We cannot exclude that the CNP/GC-B system was up-regulated at the level of the local, endothelial synthesis and/or secretion of CNP (11Nazario B. Hu R.M. Pedram A. Prins B. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, we and others have shown previously that the potency of CNP for vasodilation or reduction of blood pressure is much lower as compared with ANP (2Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lopez M.J. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 205: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Even more, CNP-deficient mice do not exhibit arterial hypertension (28Chusho H. Tamura N. Ogawa Y. Yasoda A. Suda M. Miyazawa T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Kurihara T. Komatsu Y. Itoh H. Tanaka K. Saito Y. Katsuki M. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4016-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). 2Y. Ogawa, personal communication. Taken together, these data might indicate that the CNP/GC-B system is not as crucial as the ANP/GC-A and NO/sGC systems in the regulation of vascular tone. Within the vascular system, not only SMC but also endothelial cells are rich in GC-A and respond to ANP with increased production of cGMP (8Leitman D.C. Andresen J.W. Kuno T. Kamisaki Y. Chang J.K. Murad F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11650-11655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,9Leitman D.C. Murad F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 885: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In cultured endothelial cells, elevation of cGMP levels inhibits endothelin-1 (29Emori T. Hirata Y. Imai T. Eguchi S. Kanno K. Marumo F. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2474-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and stimulates NO (10Ravichandran L.V. Johns R.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and CNP synthesis (11Nazario B. Hu R.M. Pedram A. Prins B. Levin E.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been reported that ANP-induced vasodilation is partly mediated by the endothelial release of NO (30Brunner F. Wölkart G. Microvasc. Res. 2001; 61: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By selective disruption of GC-A in smooth muscle cells (17Holtwick R. Gotthardt M. Skryabin B. Steinmetz M. Potthast R. Zetsche B. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Kuhn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7142-7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we generated an elegant mouse model allowing us to dissect the specific endothelial effects of ANP in intact vessel preparations. As shown, the vasorelaxing effect of ANP was almost completely abolished in SMC GC-A-deficient aortas. We observed a small relaxation at higher ANP concentrations, which was totally prevented by the inclusion of L-NAME in the organ chambers, indicating that these responses were mediated by the ANP/GC-A-stimulated release of endothelial NO. However, the NO-mediated vasorelaxing effect of ANP observed in SMC GC-A KO arteries was rather small as compared with ANP effects on arteries with intact SMC GC-A expression levels. Even more, inhibition of endothelial NO synthesis by L-NAME did not affect the vasorelaxing responses of the latter, floxed GC-A arteries to ANP. Taken together, these observations indicate that under normal conditions, the contribution of endothelial NO to the vasodilating effects of ANP is minor, if any. Thus, the role of the endothelium in the maintenance of blood pressure and volume homeostasis by ANP remains intriguing. Many studies have shown that ANP modulates endothelial permeability (31Yonemaru M. Ishii K. Murad F. Raffin T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L363-L369PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that might be essential for the physiological regulation of blood volume. In our future studies, we will take advantage of this new mouse model with SMC-specific deletion of GC-A to elucidate how the endothelial GC-A receptor contributes to the known actions of ANP on vascular permeability and, overall, to the regulatory effects of this peptide on blood volume homeostasis. In summary, we demonstrated that isolated arteries from SMC GC-A KO mice exhibit a higher sensitivity to nitrovasodilators and endothelial NO as compared with arteries with normal GC-A expression levels. This effect can be attributed to an enhanced expression of sGC, whereas the expression and/or activity levels of eNOS and of downstream cGMP-effector pathways are not involved. Increased vasodilating responsiveness to endogenous endothelial NO contributes to compensate for the missing vasodilating effect of ANP in SMC GC-A KO mice. Our study adds an important piece of information to the local, reciprocal interactions between the ANP/GC-A and NO/sGC systems within the vascular wall. Given that blood pressure is elevated in mice with generalized deletion of ANP (13John S.W.M. Veress A.T. Honrath U. Chong C.K. Peng L. Smithies O. Sonnenberg H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: R109-R114PubMed Google Scholar), GC-A (14Lopez M.J. Wong S.K. Kishimoto I. Dubois S. Mach V. Friesen J. Garbers D.L. Beuve A. Nature. 1995; 378: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), or eNOS (12Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Kim H.S. Desai K.M. Krege J.H. Laubach V.E. Sherman P.A. Sessa W.C. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13176-13181Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), neither system is able to fully compensate for the complete loss of the other. However, their mutual interactions may moderate the hypertensive phenotype and prevent an otherwise lethal form of hypertension.

This study analyzes the role of Gly-952 by characterizing the biochemical properties of Gly-952 mutants. Analysis of the nucleotide incorporation specificity of pol α G952A showed that this mutant incorporates nucleotides with extraordinarily low fidelity. In a steady-state kinetic assay to measure nucleotide misincorporation, pol α G952A incorporated incorrect nucleotides more efficiently than correct nucleotides opposite template C, G, and T. The fidelity of the G952A mutant polymerase was highest at template A, where the ratio of incorporation of dCMP to dTMP was as high as 0.37. Correct nucleotide insertion was 500- to 3500-fold lower for G952A than for wild type pol α, with up to 22-fold increase in pyrimidine misincorporation. The Km for G952A pol α bound to mismatched termini T:T, T:C, C:A, and A:C was 71- to 460-fold lower than to a matched terminus. Furthermore, pol α G952A preferentially incorporated pyrimidine instead of dAMP opposite an abasic site, cis-syn cyclobutane di-thymine, or (6–4) di-thymine photoproduct. These data demonstrate that Gly-952 is a critical residue for catalytic efficiency and error prevention in S. cerevisiae pol α."
