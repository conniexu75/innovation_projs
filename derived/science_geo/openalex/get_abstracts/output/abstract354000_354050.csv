https://openalex.org/W2049446122,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) comprise a promising tool for cellular therapy. These cells are usually culture expanded prior to their application. However, a precise molecular definition of MSC and the sequel of long-term in vitro culture are yet unknown. In this study, we have addressed the impact of replicative senescence on human MSC preparations. Within 43 to 77 days of cultivation (7 to 12 passages), MSC demonstrated morphological abnormalities, enlargement, attenuated expression of specific surface markers, and ultimately proliferation arrest. Adipogenic differentiation potential decreased whereas the propensity for osteogenic differentiation increased. mRNA expression profiling revealed a consistent pattern of alterations in the global gene expression signature of MSC at different passages. These changes are not restricted to later passages, but are continuously acquired with increasing passages. Genes involved in cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA repair are significantly down-regulated in late passages. Genes from chromosome 4q21 were over-represented among differentially regulated transcripts. Differential expression of 10 genes has been verified in independent donor samples as well as in MSC that were isolated under different culture conditions. Furthermore, miRNA expression profiling revealed an up-regulation of hsa-mir-371, hsa-mir-369-5P, hsa-mir-29c, hsa-mir-499 and hsa-let-7f upon in vitro propagation. Our studies indicate that replicative senescence of MSC preparations is a continuous process starting from the first passage onwards. This process includes far reaching alterations in phenotype, differentiation potential, global gene expression patterns, and miRNA profiles that need to be considered for therapeutic application of MSC preparations."
https://openalex.org/W2003599098,"Background Caenorhabditis elegans locomotion is a simple behavior that has been widely used to dissect genetic components of behavior, synaptic transmission, and muscle function. Many of the paradigms that have been created to study C. elegans locomotion rely on qualitative experimenter observation. Here we report the implementation of an automated tracking system developed to quantify the locomotion of multiple individual worms in parallel. Methodology/Principal Findings Our tracking system generates a consistent measurement of locomotion that allows direct comparison of results across experiments and experimenters and provides a standard method to share data between laboratories. The tracker utilizes a video camera attached to a zoom lens and a software package implemented in MATLAB®. We demonstrate several proof-of-principle applications for the tracker including measuring speed in the absence and presence of food and in the presence of serotonin. We further use the tracker to automatically quantify the time course of paralysis of worms exposed to aldicarb and levamisole and show that tracker performance compares favorably to data generated using a hand-scored metric. Conclusions/Signficance Although this is not the first automated tracking system developed to measure C. elegans locomotion, our tracking software package is freely available and provides a simple interface that includes tools for rapid data collection and analysis. By contrast with other tools, it is not dependent on a specific set of hardware. We propose that the tracker may be used for a broad range of additional worm locomotion applications including genetic and chemical screening."
https://openalex.org/W2063803115,"Variations in parental care predict the age of puberty, sexual activity in adolescence and the age at first pregnancy in humans. These findings parallel descriptions of maternal effects on phenotypic variation in reproductive function in other species. Despite the prevalence of such reports, little is known about potential biological mechanisms and this especially true for effects on female reproductive development. We examined the hypothesis that parental care might alter hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function and thus reproductive function in the female offspring of rat mothers that vary pup licking/grooming (LG) over the first week postpartum. As adults, the female offspring of Low LG mothers showed 1) increased sexual receptivity; 2) increased plasma levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and progesterone at proestrus; 3) an increased positive-feedback effect of estradiol on both plasma LH levels and gonadotropin releasing-hormone (GnRH) expression in the medial preoptic region; and 4) increased estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression in the anterioventral paraventricular nucleus, a system that regulates GnRH. The results of a cross-fostering study provide evidence for a direct effect of postnatal maternal care as well as a possible prenatal influence. Indeed, we found evidence for increased fetal testosterone levels at embryonic day 20 in the female fetuses of High compared to Low LG mothers. Finally, the female offspring of Low LG mothers showed accelerated puberty compared to those of High LG mothers. These data suggest maternal effects in the rat on the development of neuroendocrine systems that regulate female sexual behaviour. Together with studies revealing a maternal effect on the maternal behavior of the female offspring, these findings suggest that maternal care can program alternative reproductive phenotypes in the rat through regionally-specific effects on ERα expression."
https://openalex.org/W2017227464,"Despite the presence of genes that apparently encode NAD salvage-specific enzymes in its genome, it has been previously thought that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can only synthesize NAD de novo. Transcriptional analysis of the de novo synthesis and putative salvage pathway genes revealed an up-regulation of the salvage pathway genes in vivo and in vitro under conditions of hypoxia. [14C]Nicotinamide incorporation assays in M. tuberculosis isolated directly from the lungs of infected mice or from infected macrophages revealed that incorporation of exogenous nicotinamide was very efficient in in vivo-adapted cells, in contrast to cells grown aerobically in vitro. Two putative nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferases, PncB1 (Rv1330c) and PncB2 (Rv0573c), were examined by a combination of in vitro enzymatic activity assays and allelic exchange studies. These studies revealed that both play a role in cofactor salvage. Mutants in the de novo pathway died upon removal of exogenous nicotinamide during active replication in vitro. Cell death is induced by both cofactor starvation and disruption of cellular redox homeostasis as electron transport is impaired by limiting NAD. Inhibitors of NAD synthetase, an essential enzyme common to both recycling and de novo synthesis pathways, displayed the same bactericidal effect as sudden NAD starvation of the de novo pathway mutant in both actively growing and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. These studies demonstrate the plasticity of the organism in maintaining NAD levels and establish that the two enzymes of the universal pathway are attractive chemotherapeutic targets for active as well as latent tuberculosis.

These studies demonstrate the plasticity of the organism in maintaining NAD levels and establish that the two enzymes of the universal pathway are attractive chemotherapeutic targets for active as well as latent tuberculosis. Tuberculosis remains the leading killer in the world because of a single infectious pathogen. With a third of the world population estimated to be latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, new drugs are urgently required to shorten the duration of therapy, eradicate multiple drug-resistant strains, and target latent, nonreplicating bacilli (1Duncan K. Barry III, C.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Current therapeutic regimens require 6–9 months of chemotherapy and target aspects of cell wall biosynthesis, translation, transcription, or DNA topology. Current antitubercular drugs have diminished or even minimal effect against nonreplicating bacilli (2Gomez J.E. McKinney J.D. Tuberculosis (Edinb.). 2004; 84: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This diminished effect may reflect the decreased activity of the various target enzymes under in vivo or nonreplicating conditions. Although some metabolic pathways are presumed to be important for maintenance of viability under all conditions, even when the bacilli are nonreplicating, little is known about adaptation of M. tuberculosis metabolism to in vivo conditions (3Boshoff H.I. Barry III, C.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Cofactor biosynthesis is a rich source of potential drug targets because of the essential nature of these coenzymes throughout metabolism (4Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. D'Souza M. Bernal A. Baev M.V. Farrell M. Kurnasov O.V. Daugherty M.D. Mseeh F. Polanuyer B.M. Campbell J.W. Anantha S. Shatalin K.Y. Chowdhury S.A. Fonstein M.Y. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4555-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). NAD is an essential cofactor that is required for redox balance (5You K.S. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 17: 313-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and energy metabolism, as well as for the activity of the NAD-dependent DNA ligase in prokaryotes (6Wilkinson A. Day J. Bowater R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), protein ADP-ribosylases (7Dolan K.M. Lindenmayer G. Olson J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8266-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Ziegler M. Oei S.L. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), protein deacetylation (9Denu J.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2005; 9: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and as a substrate in cobalamin biosynthesis (10Maggio-Hall L.A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and for calcium homeostasis (11Vu C.Q. Coyle D.L. Tai H.H. Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 419: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NAD can be synthesized de novo in prokaryotes from aspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate in an oxygen-dependent pathway or it can be scavenged or recycled by a variety of pathways (12Begley T.P. Kinsland C. Mehl R.A. Osterman A. Dorrestein P. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 103-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Foster J.W. Moat A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 83-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For pathogens, this recycling pathway offers the possibility of obtaining this cofactor directly from their host. Recently it was also discovered that some prokaryotes synthesized NAD de novo from tryptophan (14Kurnasov O. Goral V. Colabroy K. Gerdes S. Anantha S. Osterman A. Begley T.P. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1195-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), a pathway that had previously been considered unique to eukaryotes. The Preiss-Handler pathway (15Preiss J. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 488-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a recycling pathway that occurs in many microorganisms and consists of nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.11 or PncB) as well as the two enzymes of the universal pathway, nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.18 or NaMNAT, encoded by nadD) and NAD synthetase (EC 6.3.5.1, encoded by nadE) (Fig. 1A). Some microbes depend on nicotinic acid for NAD synthesis because of the absence of some or all of the de novo pathway genes (16Katoh A. Hashimoto T. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nicotinic acid is formed by the activity of nicotinamidase (EC 3.5.1.19 or PncA) on nicotinamide. Nicotinamide and nicotinic acid can be scavenged from the environment but are also generated through the intracellular breakdown of NAD. NAD can be degraded by a variety of enzymes, including NAD glycohydrolase, DNA ligase, NAD pyrophosphatase, NAD(P)+ nucleosidase, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, and NAD pyrophosphatase (13Foster J.W. Moat A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 83-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an alternative nondeamidating salvage pathway, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (encoded by nadV) salvages nicotinamide directly with the resulting NMN subsequently converted to NAD by the NMN adenylyltransferase activity of NadR (17Merdanovic M. Sauer E. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4410-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A third recycling pathway includes the conversion of exogenously scavenged pyridine nucleotides to NAD (17Merdanovic M. Sauer E. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4410-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 18Singh S.K. Kurnasov O.V. Chen B. Robinson H. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33291-33299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In M. tuberculosis, the enzymatic machinery of the NAD de novo biosynthetic pathway has been identified (19Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J. Moule S. Murphy L. Oliver K. Osborne J. Quail M.A. Rajandream M.A. Rogers J. Rutter S. Seeger K. Skelton J. Squares R. Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6522) Google Scholar) and is likely to be essential in vitro based on Himar-transposon mutagenesis studies (20Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis is biochemically identified, in part, by a characteristic accumulation of nicotinic acid (21Kilburn J.O. Stottmeier K.D. Kubica G.P. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1968; 50: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 22Konno K. Kurzmann R. Bird K.T. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1957; 75: 529-537PubMed Google Scholar, 23Konno K. Kurzmann R. Bird K.T. Sbarra A. Am. Rev. Tuberc. 1958; 77: 669-674PubMed Google Scholar) and by the presence of a nicotinamidase (encoded by pncA) that has been implicated in the hydrolysis of the nicotinamide analog pyrazinamide, an important component of front-line M. tuberculosis chemotherapy (24Scorpio A. Zhang Y. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Thus far there is no direct evidence that pyrazinoic acid acts as a metabolic poison of any aspect of NAD metabolism (25Zhang Y. Scorpio A. Nikaido H. Sun Z. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2044-2049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the expression of this potent nicotinamidase, previous studies have indicated that the Preiss-Handler recycling pathway was not functional in this organism based on the apparent lack of nicotinate incorporation into NAD (13Foster J.W. Moat A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 83-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kasarov L.B. Moat A.G. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 600-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, pncA can readily be inactivated in clinical strains that acquire pyrazinamide resistance without the apparent loss of fitness (27O'Sullivan D.M. McHugh T.D. Gillespie S.H. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2005; 55: 674-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). NAD glycohydrolase activity has also been reported in M. tuberculosis cultures (26Kasarov L.B. Moat A.G. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 110: 600-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gopinathan K.P. Ramakrishnan T. Vaidyanathan C.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 113: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but the corresponding gene has not yet been identified. The NAD biosynthetic pathway is thought to be an ideal drug target (4Gerdes S.Y. Scholle M.D. D'Souza M. Bernal A. Baev M.V. Farrell M. Kurnasov O.V. Daugherty M.D. Mseeh F. Polanuyer B.M. Campbell J.W. Anantha S. Shatalin K.Y. Chowdhury S.A. Fonstein M.Y. Osterman A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4555-4572Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) with the steps shared by the de novo and recycling pathway posing candidate enzymes for therapeutic intervention. NAD, like most other phosphorylated compounds, cannot be transported across most bacterial cell envelopes, although there are notable exceptions (18Singh S.K. Kurnasov O.V. Chen B. Robinson H. Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33291-33299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Haferkamp I. Schmitz-Esser S. Linka N. Urbany C. Collingro A. Wagner M. Horn M. Neuhaus H.E. Nature. 2004; 432: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, in most bacteria, NAD is synthesized either de novo or is salvaged through the Preiss-Handler pathway. In this study we sought to determine the relative importance of de novo synthesis and nicotinamide scavenging from the host in M. tuberculosis under conditions similar to those likely to be encountered by the bacterium during disease in humans. Overall, the data show clearly that recycling of exogenously acquired nicotinamide is an important and functional pathway in M. tuberculosis; however, the organism shows considerable flexibility in switching between recycling and de novo synthesis of NAD suggesting that interrupting either one alone would be nonlethal. Therefore, only the two common enzymes shared by both pathways (NadD and NadE) are viable drug targets. Growth of Strains—Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria broth. Cloning and plasmid preparation were performed in E. coli DH5α, whereas proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. M. tuberculosis strains were cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth, which consisted of Middlebrook 7H9 broth base/albumin/dextrose/NaCl (ADC) enrichment, 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80. Middlebrook 7H11 agar consisted of Middlebrook 7H11 medium supplemented with oleic acid/ADC (OADC) enrichment and 0.4% glycerol. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations (Mycobacterium/E. coli): hygromycin 50 μg/ml/200 μg/ml, kanamycin 25 μg/ml/50 μg/ml, and gentamycin 10 μg/ml/10 μg/ml. Anaerobic and microaerophilic cultures of M. tuberculosis were set up as described by Wayne (30Wayne L.G. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 247-270Google Scholar) in Dubos medium, which consisted of Dubos broth base supplemented with Dubos ADC enrichment and 0.05% Tween 80. Synthesis of Inhibitors and Inhibition Assays—NAD synthetase inhibitors (Table 1) were synthesized as described previously, and analytical data consistent with the published data were obtained for the final purified products (31Velu S.E. Cristofoli W.A. Garcia G.J. Brouillette C.G. Pierson M.C. Luan C.H. DeLucas L.J. Brouillette W.J. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 3371-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For IC50 determination, the NAD synthetase reaction was conducted as described (32Bembenek M.E. Kuhn E. Mallender W.D. Pullen L. Li P. Parsons T. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2005; 3: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with a total volume of 50 μl in a 96-well white flat bottom ½-area plate. For the assay, 1 μl of compound (or solvent control) in 90% DMSO was incubated with 1 μm M. tuberculosis NadE enzyme in the assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm l-glutamine) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of 20 mm nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 10 μl of stop buffer (0.3 m EDTA, 1.25 m NaCl). Resorufin fluorescence was generated with addition of 10 μl of detection mixture (5 mm resazurin, 10 units/ml diaphorase, 0.1 m lactic acid, 100 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was detected using excitation and emission filters of 560 and 590 nm, respectively.TABLE 1Activities of NadE inhibitors Open table in a new tab MIC 3The abbreviations used are: MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; CFU, colony-forming unit; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription; WT, wild type. determinations were performed by the broth microdilution method (33Domenech P. Reed M.B. Barry III, C.E. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3492-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and the MIC was taken as the lowest concentration at which no growth was observed. Minimum bactericidal concentration was determined as the concentration that caused a >90% reduction in colony-forming units (CFU). To measure anaerobic bactericidal activity of the inhibitors, M. tuberculosis H37Rv was cultured in the self-generated oxygen-depletion model described in Ref. 30Wayne L.G. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 247-270Google Scholar using 19.5 × 145-mm tubes with a magnetic stirrer. Tubes were sealed with Teflon-lined caps and subsequently with paraplast and incubated for 3 weeks at 37 °C on a magnetic stirrer. The tubes were opened in an anaerobic chamber, diluted 10-fold into anaerobic Dubos medium, and 1-ml volumes treated with various concentrations of the NAD synthetase inhibitors in 24-well plates. Control cultures were treated with DMSO. The plates were sealed in anaerobic bags and incubated for 7 days at 37 °C. Serial dilutions were subsequently plated on 7H11 Middlebrook agar to monitor bacterial survival. To measure bactericidal activity of the inhibitors against starved cultures of M. tuberculosis, cells were washed and resuspended at 107 CFU/ml in PBST in roller bottles at 37 °C. After 3 weeks of incubation, cells were treated with various concentrations of the inhibitors or DMSO vehicle control for 28 days after which serial dilutions were plated for CFU enumeration. Whole Cell Labeling with [14C]Nicotinamide—Mid-logarithmic phase cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of 0.05 mm palmitate in minimal medium (0.5 g of casitone (Difco), 2 g of asparagine, 1 g of KH2PO4, 2.5 g of Na2HPO4, 10 mg of MgSO4·7H2O, 50 mg of ferric ammonium citrate, 0.5 mg of CaCl2, 0.1 mg of ZnSO4, 0.1 mg of CuSO4, and 0.05% Tween 80) containing 20 μCi of [14C]nicotinamide (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) to an A650 nm of 0.6. Cells were labeled for 2 days, harvested by centrifugation, and washed three times with 0.05% Tween 80 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST). Cell pellets were extracted with 50 μl of water and 300 μl of chloroform. For labeling of M. tuberculosis derived from infected macrophages, 108 J774 macrophages that had been infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 were lysed after 2 days of infection with 0.05% SDS. Eukaryotic genomic DNA was sheared by vortexing (30 s) and M. tuberculosis was harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in minimal medium and labeled as above. For labeling of M. tuberculosis derived from infected mouse lungs, 4-week infected mice (see below) were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and lungs were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) (5 ml per mouse lung) and filtered through a 40-μm filter to remove particulate material. The final volume was adjusted to 45 ml with PBST, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (2500 × g, 5 min). The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of PBST and SDS added to 0.05% final concentration to lyse eukaryotic cells. Genomic DNA was sheared by vortexing (three times for 30 s). M. tuberculosis cells were harvested by centrifugation (2500 × g, 10 min), washed once in 50 ml of PBST followed by a wash in 0.05 mm palmitate in minimal medium. Cells were labeled in 5 ml of 0.05 mm palmitate/minimal medium containing 20 μCi of [14C]nicotinamide for 24 h. Cell pellets were extracted with 100 μl of water and 300 μl of chloroform. For mouse lungs, a control uninfected mouse lung was run in parallel to ensure that no incorporation was derived from unlysed eukaryotic cells. To label microaerophilically adapted and anaerobically adapted M. tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis was grown for 4 or 8 days into NRP-1 (microaerophilic cells) or 3 and 8 weeks into NRP-2 (anaerobic cells) (30Wayne L.G. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 247-270Google Scholar) as described below. Tubes were briefly opened under aerobic conditions to add 20 μCi of [14C]nicotinamide after which the lids of the tubes were loosely closed and the NRP-1 tubes sealed in microaerophilic bags (type Cfj, BD Biosciences) and the NRP-2 tubes in anaerobic bags (type A, BD Biosciences). An aerobic culture of M. tuberculosis of initial similar cell number (108 CFU/ml) was labeled in parallel under aerobic conditions. Cells were harvested after 3 days of incubation, washed, and extracted as above. Analysis of [14C]Nicotinamide Incorporation—Pyridine nucleotides were visualized by TLC using Whatman LHPKDF silica gel 60A plates. TLC plates were developed in 4:6 1 m ammonium acetate, pH 5, ethanol, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 24–48 h. Migration positions of unlabeled NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, NMN, NaMN and nicotinamide standards (all from Sigma) were determined by UV shadowing. Generation of Recombinant Proteins—The M. tuberculosis nadE gene was amplified using the primers TAGGATCCAACTTTTACTCCGCCTACCAGCA and TAGCGGCCGCTAGCCCTTGGGCACCT cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of a Gateway expression system in fusion with an N-terminal His6 tag as described (34Leder L. Freuler F. Forstner M. Mayr L.M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2007; 10: 193-202PubMed Google Scholar). The protein expression was induced with 100 μm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at 18°C. Soluble recombinant NadE protein was purified on Novagen histidine-binding column, following the recommendations of the manufacturer. The fusion protein obtained was cleaved by PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) between the His6 sequence and the N terminus of the protein following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. pncB1 was cloned into pET30(b)+ (Novagen) using the primers GCCATGGTGGGGCCACCCCCAGCCGCC and GGGATCCTCAGGCCGGGATCGTGCGTG for PCR amplification (Pfx polymerase, Invitrogen) of the gene, which enabled cloning between the NcoI and BamHI sites (underlined) of the vector. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A650 nm of 0.6 and induction for 3 h. Cells were lysed, and histidine-tagged protein was purified on Qiagen nickel spin columns using the native protein purification protocol recommended by the manufacturer. pncB2 was amplified using the primers CAACCATGGCGATCCGCCAAC and GAAGCTTCTAGGGTCGTTTGGCCTTCGC which enabled cloning between the NcoI and HindIII sites (underlined) of pET 28(b)+ and pET30(b)+ (Novagen). Protein expression was induced as above. Histidine-tagged protein was purified as described above. Native nonfusion protein was assayed in cell lysates prepared by sonication in 0.18 m Tris, 0.18 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Control lysates were prepared from cells expressing pET28(b)+ vector. PncB Assay—Phosphoribosyltransferase assays were performed in an assay mix consisting of 20 mm Tris, 200 mm glutamate, pH 7.4, 7 mm MgSO4, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.017 μCi of [14C]nicotinamide or [14C]nicotinic acid and 1 μg of recombinant protein (or 10 μg of cell lysate) in a total volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 10 μl of chloroform, and reactions were spotted onto TLC plates and developed as described above. Assays were alternatively performed in a reaction mix consisting of 30 mm potassium phosphate, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, 3 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.017 μCi of [14C]nicotinamide or [14C]nicotinic acid, and 1 μg of recombinant protein (or 10 μg of cell lysate) in a total volume of 30 μl. Reactions were performed and analyzed as above. Generation of Mutant Strains—A knock-out mutant of the de novo NAD biosynthetic pathway (nad::hyg) was constructed as follows. A 5074-bp XbaI-ApaI cosmid DNA fragment spanning nadA–C was cloned into pcDNA2.1. A 775-bp SphI-Asp718 fragment was replaced with the hygromycin resistance gene leaving only 775 bp of the 5′ end of nadA and 1084 bp of the 3′ end of nadB. A PacI fragment containing the sacB and lacZ genes from pGOAL17 (35Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) was cloned into the EcoRV site of this plasmid to generate pcnadABKO, which was used for electroporation of M. tuberculosis. Electroporation and generation of double crossover strains were performed as described previously (35Parish T. Stoker N.G.

The resulting nad::hyg knock-out strain was routinely maintained in nicotinamide-supplemented (10 μg/ml) medium. For complementation the XbaI-ApaI fragment containing the entire nadA–C operon along with 288 bp of upstream sequence was cloned into pMV306K (37Mdluli K. Sherman D.R. Hickey M.J. Kreiswirth B.N.

Complemented mutants were selected on 7H11 Middlebrook agar supplemented with hygromycin and kanamycin but without nicotinamide. To generate the pncB1::aph knock-out mutant, a 5913-bp HindIII-BglII cosmid DNA fragment spanning pncB1 was cloned into pcDNA2.1. The aph gene was cloned into the EcoRV site of pncB1, which creates an insertion 317 bp from the start codon. A PacI fragment containing the sacB and lacZ genes from pGOAL17 (35Parish T. Stoker N.G.

A pncB2::hyg construct was generated by cloning a 3401-bp EcoRI-Asp-718 cosmid DNA fragment containing pncB2 into pcDNA2.1. A hygromycin resistance gene was cloned into the BglII site, which generates an insertion 854 bp from the start codon. The PacI fragment from pGOAL17 was cloned into the XbaI site to generate pc0573KO, which was used for electroporation into the pncB1::aph strain. For complementation of pncB1::aph/pncB2::hyg double knock-out mutants, pncB2 was amplified with the following primers, GGGCTGCAGGAATGAGCAAGGAGTAACCGGCAAC and GGGTCTAGACTAGGGTCGTTTGGCCTTCG, and the PCR product was cut using the primer-encoded PstI and XbaI sites (underlined). This fragment contains the ribosome-binding site of pncB2 and was cloned with the hsp60 promoter from pMV261 (37Mdluli K. Sherman D.R. Hickey M.J. Kreiswirth B.N. Morris S. Stover C.K.

Survival under Anaerobic Conditions—The nad::hyg mutant was set up in Wayne NRP cultures as described (30Wayne L.G. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 247-270Google Scholar) in 20 ml of Dubos medium containing 10 μg/ml nicotinamide in 19.5 × 145-mm glass tubes containing a magnetic stirrer bar and sealed with Teflon-lined caps. The tubes were further sealed with paraplast. One control culture was similarly set up except that the culture contained 0.5 μg/ml methylene blue. The methylene blue decolorized 2 weeks after initiation. Four weeks after initiation, the cultures (20 ml) were opened in an anaerobic chamber, and exogenous nicotinamide was removed by washing five times in 10 ml of Dubos medium. Half of the cells were resuspended in nicotinamide-free Dubos medium (1 ml) and half were resuspended in 10 μg/ml nicotinamide in Dubos medium (1 ml) and cultured at 37 °C in anaerobic bags (Bio-bag type A, BD Biosciences). One day after washing, nicotinamide-starved cells were harvested again by centrifugation under anaerobic conditions and washed once in 2 ml of Dubos medium to remove nicotinamide that had slowly equilibrated between the intra- and extracellular environments followed by resuspension in 1 ml of Dubos. The parallel culture in nicotinamide-containing medium was similarly washed and resuspended in 1 ml of 10 μg/ml nicotinamide in Dubos medium. Cell cultures were resealed in anaerobic bags and returned to 37 °C for 7 days after which serial dilutions were plated on 7H11 Middlebrook agar containing 10 μg/ml nicotinamide. A similar control experiment was performed for the WT parental strain to monitor kinetics o"

Loss of pVHL function results in constitutive activation of HIF-1 and HIF-2 and is associated with the development of highly vascularized tumors in multiple organs. We have used a conditional gene-targeting approach to investigate the relative contributions of HIF-1 and HIF-2 to VHL-associated vascular tumorigenesis in a mouse model of liver hemangiomas. Here we demonstrate genetically that conditional inactivation of HIF-2alpha suppressed the development of VHL-associated liver hemangiomas and that angiogenic gene expression in hepatocytes is predominantly regulated by HIF-2 and not by HIF-1. These findings suggest that HIF-2 is the dominant HIF in the pathogenesis of VHL-associated vascular tumors and that pharmacologic targeting of HIF-2 may be an effective strategy for their treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2103383398,"Burning of Boswellia resin as incense has been part of religious and cultural ceremonies for millennia and is believed to contribute to the spiritual exaltation associated with such events. Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) 3 is an ion channel implicated in the perception of warmth in the skin. TRPV3 mRNA has also been found in neurons throughout the brain; however, the role of TRPV3 channels there remains unknown. Here we show that incensole acetate (IA), a Boswellia resin constituent, is a potent TRPV3 agonist that causes anxiolytic-like and antidepressive-like behavioral effects in wild-type (WT) mice with concomitant changes in c-Fos activation in the brain. These behavioral effects were not noted in TRPV3(-/-) mice, suggesting that they are mediated via TRPV3 channels. IA activated TRPV3 channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells and in keratinocytes from TRPV3(+/+) mice. It had no effect on keratinocytes from TRPV3(-/-) mice and showed modest or no effect on TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV4, as well as on 24 other receptors, ion channels, and transport proteins. Our results imply that TRPV3 channels in the brain may play a role in emotional regulation. Furthermore, the biochemical and pharmacological effects of IA may provide a biological basis for deeply rooted cultural and religious traditions."
https://openalex.org/W1984754469,"Recent evidence indicates that glutamate homeostasis and neurotransmission are altered in major depressive disorder, but the nature of the disruption and the mechanisms by which it contributes to the syndrome are unclear. Glutamate can act via AMPA, NMDA, or metabotropic receptors. Using targeted mutagenesis, we demonstrate here that mice with deletion of the main AMPA receptor subunit GluR-A represent a depression model with good face and construct validity, showing behavioral and neurochemical features of depression also postulated for human patients. GluR-A(-/-) mice display increased learned helplessness, decreased serotonin and norepinephrine levels, and disturbed glutamate homeostasis with increased glutamate levels and increased NMDA receptor expression. These results correspond well with current concepts regarding the role of AMPA and NMDA receptors in depression, postulating that compounds that augment AMPA receptor signaling or decrease NMDA receptor functions have antidepressant effects. GluR-A(-/-) mice represent a model to investigate the pathophysiology underlying the depressive phenotype and to identify changes in neural plasticity and resilience evoked by the genetic alterations in glutamatergic function. Furthermore, GluR-A(-/-) mice may be a valuable tool to study biological mechanisms of AMPA receptor modulators and the efficacy of NMDA antagonists in reducing behavioral or biochemical changes that correlate with increased helplessness."
https://openalex.org/W2091473810,"Invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) and invasive lobular carcinomas (ILCs) are the two major pathological types of breast cancer. Epidemiological and histoclinical data suggest biological differences, but little is known about the molecular alterations involved in ILCs. We undertook a comparative large-scale study by both array-compared genomic hybridization and cDNA microarray of a set of 50 breast tumors (21 classic ILCs and 29 IDCs) selected on homogeneous histoclinical criteria. Results were validated on independent tumor sets, as well as by quantitative RT-PCR. ILCs and IDCs presented differences at both the genomic and expression levels with ILCs being less rearranged and heterogeneous than IDCs. Supervised analysis defined a 75-BACs signature discriminating accurately ILCs from IDCs. Expression profiles identified two subgroups of ILCs: typical ILCs ( approximately 50%), which were homogeneous and displayed a normal-like molecular pattern, and atypical ILCs, more heterogeneous with features intermediate between ILCs and IDCs. Supervised analysis identified a 75-gene expression signature that discriminated ILCs from IDCs, with many genes involved in cell adhesion, motility, apoptosis, protein folding, extracellular matrix and protein phosphorylation. Although ILCs and IDCs share common alterations, our data show that ILCs and IDCs could be distinguished on the basis of their genomic and expression profiles suggesting that they evolve along distinct genetic pathways."

We have used this approach to generate novel influenza vaccines that fuse the globular head domain of the protective hemagglutinin (HA) antigen with the potent TLR5 ligand, flagellin. These fusion proteins are efficiently expressed in standard E. coli fermentation systems and the HA moiety can be faithfully refolded to take on the native conformation of the globular head. In mouse models of influenza infection, the vaccines elicit robust antibody responses that mitigate disease and protect mice from lethal challenge. These immunologically potent vaccines can be efficiently manufactured to support pandemic response, pre-pandemic and seasonal vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2153213901,"Background Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is not only a cytokine which has a critical role in several inflammatory conditions but also has endocrine and enzymatic functions. MIF is identified as an intracellular signaling molecule and is implicated in the process of tumor progression, and also strongly enhances neovascularization. Overexpression of MIF has been observed in tumors from various organs. MIF is one of the genes induced by hypoxia in an hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-dependent manner. Methods/Principal Findings The effect of MIF on HIF-1 activity was investigated in human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. We demonstrate that intracellular overexpression or extracellular administration of MIF enhances activation of HIF-1 under hypoxic conditions in MCF-7 cells. Mutagenesis analysis of MIF and knockdown of 53 demonstrates that the activation is not dependent on redox activity of MIF but on wild-type p53. We also indicate that the MIF receptor CD74 is involved in HIF-1 activation by MIF at least when MIF is administrated extracellularly. Conclusion/Significance MIF regulates HIF-1 activity in a p53-dependent manner. In addition to MIF's potent effects on the immune system, MIF is linked to fundamental processes conferring cell proliferation, cell survival, angiogenesis, and tumor invasiveness. This functional interdependence between MIF and HIF-1α protein stabilization and transactivation activity provide a molecular mechanism for promotion of tumorigenesis by MIF."
https://openalex.org/W2096067265,"Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes of the constitutively dimeric molecular chaperone Hsp90 are integral to its molecular mechanism. Recent full-length crystal structures (Protein Data Bank codes 2IOQ, 2CG9, AND 2IOP) of Hsp90 homologs reveal large scale quaternary domain rearrangements upon the addition of nucleotides. Although previous work has shown the importance of C-terminal domain dimerization for efficient ATP hydrolysis, which should imply cooperativity, other studies suggest that the two ATPases function independently. Using the crystal structures as a guide, we examined the role of intra- and intermonomer interactions in stabilizing the ATPase activity of a single active site within an intact dimer. This was accomplished by creating heterodimers that allow us to differentially mutate each monomer, probing the context in which particular residues are important for ATP hydrolysis. Although the ATPase activity of each monomer can function independently, we found that the activity of one monomer could be inhibited by the mutation of hydrophobic residues on the trans N-terminal domain (opposite monomer). Furthermore, these trans interactions are synergistically mediated by a loop on the cis middle domain. This loop contains hydrophobic residues as well as a critical arginine that provides a direct linkage to the γ-phosphate of bound ATP. Small angle x-ray scattering demonstrates that deleterious mutations block domain closure in the presence of AMPPNP (5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate), providing a direct linkage between structural changes and functional consequences. Together, these data indicate that both the cis monomer and the trans monomer and the intradomain and interdomain interactions cooperatively stabilize the active conformation of each active site and help explain the importance of dimer formation.

Although the exact mechanism of how Hsp90 interacts with its substrate proteins (client proteins) remains unclear, the structure of the full-length apo protein from Escherichia coli reveals that each domain contributes hydrophobic elements into a large central cleft, and these elements are likely to be involved in client recognition (8Shiau A.K.

Inhibition of the ATPase of Hsp90 by either mutation or small molecule inhibitors results in the degradation of client proteins in vivo, demonstrating the central importance of the ATPase to the function of the chaperone (10Neckers L.

The NTD alone provides all of the structural requirements for nucleotide binding, including a catalytic glutamate, which activates the attacking water in the hydrolysis reaction (15Panaretou B.

However, when isolated, the NTD has very low activity (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Removal of the constitutive C-terminal dimerization domain reduces the ATPase activity 6-10-fold depending on the homolog (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol.

Replacing this domain with a disulfide bridge between the two monomers rescues activity, clearly demonstrating the requirement of dimerization for efficient ATP hydrolysis (19Wegele H. Muschler P. Bunck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, structural and biochemical data indicate that ATP binding leads to the transient association of the NTDs (13Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the multiple domain interactions and dimer requirements, it has been quite surprising that kinetic data provide no evidence for cooperativity in either nucleotide binding or hydrolysis (18McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).The structural determinants beyond the NTD that are required for ATPase activation are largely unknown. Mutation of several MD residues (Arg-376, Gln-380 in yeast Hsc82) has been shown to affect ATPase activity (17Meyer P. Prodromou C. Hu B. Vaughan C. Roe S.M. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol.

The recently solved full-length structure of the yeast Hsp90 (Hsp82) in complex with Sba1 and AMPPNP (9Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) most likely represents a prehydrolysis state (as Sba1 binding inhibits ATP hydrolysis (20Richter K. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)); however, it has proven a useful guide for understanding these mutations. For example, it shows that the Arg-380 (Arg-376 in Hsc82) side chain is within 3 Å of the γ-phosphate of the AMPPNP bound to the same monomer, suggesting its role in the completion of the active site.Our work is focused on discovering the key intra- and interdomain as well as the intra- and intermonomer interactions required to create a complete and functional ATPase active site (Fig. 1). Toward this end, we have developed a heterodimeric ATPase assay that allows us both to assess the importance of a particular residue to the Hsp90 ATP cycle and, for the first time, to determine whether its role is via an intra- or intermonomer interaction. We show that the MD loop containing Arg-376 interacts synergistically with a region of the NTD on the opposite monomer as well as the active site on the same NTD. Additionally, small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) of the mutants is used to provide a direct linkage between functional and structural consequences of mutation. Together, these data indicate the necessity of cooperative intra- and interdomain and intra- and intermonomer interactions and provides a clear structural rationale for the functional role of dimerization. It further suggests that there is a distinct NTD-MD conformation required for catalysis that must be somewhat different from the crystal structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Geldanamycin was purchased from Sigma.Hsc82 Constructs—Yeast hsc82 was cloned from a yeast cosmid containing hsc82 (ATCC). PCR was used to isolate the gene that was subsequently cloned into the Invitrogen vector pET151/D-TOPO, which includes a tobacco etch virus-cleavable N-terminal His tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using 20-nucleotide primers encoding for the mutated amino acid. Parental DNA was then digested using Dpn1 after the completed reaction, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into DH5α (Stratagene) cells. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing of the appropriate regions.Hsc82 Purification—Protein was purified from induced E. coli cultures using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin (Qiagen) followed by anion exchange and size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex S200 column (GE Healthcare). Protein was concentrated in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl using Ultrafree Biomax concentrators (Millipore) to a final concentration of 1-5 mg/ml based on UV280 absorption. Protein was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. If needed, His tags were removed by cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease, and uncleaved protein was removed via a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column.Mass Spectrometry—Hsc82 with and without its N-terminal His tag were diluted to 1 mg/ml from their stock concentrations. Based on the tagged:untagged ratios desired, each protein was mixed and equilibrated at 30 °C for 30 min after which the proteins were set on ice. Sinapinic acid at 10 mg/ml in 60% acetonitrile, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix. Protein and matrix were mixed in a 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 ratio and spotted onto a MALDI plate. A Voyager-DE STR (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer was used to analyze the mass ratios and to determine the relative amount of heterodimer formed.ATPase Activity—This assay was adapted from Felts et al.

For the assays using geldanamycin as a control, a final concentration of 200 μm was used. 20-min time points were taken over the course of an hour with the samples shaking and incubating at 37 °C. Separation of Pi from ATP was performed using the thin layer chromatography method as described (21Felts S.J. Owen B.A. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Donner D.B. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Visualization of the radiolabeled spots was performed on a Typhoon Imager (GE Healthcare), and quantification was performed using the program ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). The amount of ATP hydrolyzed at each time point was calculated by taking the ratio of Pi to ATP in solution. This ratio was then multiplied by the total amount of ATP added to the reaction and normalized by the total protein in solution. A linear fit of the time points gave the rate for each reaction.Heterodimer Assay—The total protein concentration in each reaction was kept at 2 μm. Depending on the ratio desired, homodimers of the appropriate constructs were mixed together and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and put on ice. The ATPase activity was then measured using the assay mentioned above.Predicted inter- and intramonomer rates were calculated by accounting for the activity contributions of each population in solution. To calculate the activity contributions of the two homodimers present in solution, we used a least squares fitting of the heterodimer activities measured and extrapolated the individual contributions (MATLAB), taking into account the fraction of each population in solution. Predicted activities were then calculated using the following equations given either an intermonomer or an intramonomer interaction.Intermonomer (trans) activity = αA11+βA22+0.5∗γ(A12+Awt) (Eq. 1) Intramonomer (cis) activity = αA11+βA22+0.5∗γ(A11+A22) (Eq. 2) where α, β, and γ represent the fraction homodimer 1, homodimer 2, and heterodimer in solution, and A11, A22, A12, and Awt represent the intrinsic ATPase activities of the homodimer 1, homodimer 2, the heterodimer, and wild-type proteins, respectively. α, β, and γ were calculated using the binomial theorem to simulate an equilibrium of mixing between two homodimers that have the same dimerization affinity. In the case of the intermonomer interaction, there are two contributions to the heterodimer activity: the activity of the double mutant (A12) and the WT ATPase activity (Awt). With respect to an intramonomer interaction, the two activity contributions arise from the activities of each of the original single mutations, A11 and A22. The heterodimer activity in each equation is multiplied by 0.5 since A11 and A22 are dimer activities.The predicted activity curves were calculated using MATLAB and graphed in Kaleidagraph. We determined whether our residue of interest was involved in an inter- or intramonomer interaction by comparing the profiles of our experimentally measured heterodimers over a variety of concentrations with our predicted activities.SAXS Data Collection and Data Analysis—Data reported here were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beamline 12.3.1 and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 4.2. To minimize aggregation, samples were spun in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 5 min before data collection. SAXS data were collected at 25 °C at 2-5 mg/ml. At the ALS, the samples were exposed for 6 and 60 s at a detector distance of 1.6 m. At the SSRL, samples were exposed for ten 30-s exposures at a detector distance of 2.5 m. Scattering data were recorded on a Mar165 CCD detector. The detector channels were converted to Q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2O is the scattering angle and λ is the wavelength, using a silver behenate sample as a calibration standard. The data were circularly averaged over the detector and normalized by the incident beam intensity. The raw scattering data were scaled, and the buffers were subtracted. Individual scattering curves were then merged to provide the final averaged scattering curve. The interatomic distance distribution functions (P(r)) were then calculated using the program GNOM (22Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). Dmax was determined by constraining rmin to equal zero and then varying rmax between 150 and 250 Å. Rmax was then chosen so that the P(r) curve smoothly approached zero at the upper limit. Small changes in rmax (±10 Å) did not affect the overall shape of the P(r) curve. Radii of gyration were calculated from the P(r). Comparable results were obtained from the scattering curves using the Guinier approximation as implemented in the program PRIMUS (23Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2301) Google Scholar); however, the calculated uncertainties were larger due to limitations in the low angle data.RESULTSCharacterization of Heterodimers in Solution—To dissect the intra-versus intermonomer roles of specific residues with respect to the overall ATPase activity of Hsc82, it was necessary to create asymmetric dimers harboring different mutations on each monomer (Fig. 2). Because the KD for subunit dimerization is in the nm range (7Harris S.F. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1087-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), heterodimers can be formed simply by mixing homodimers containing different point mutations (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). By placing a mutation in one monomer that abolishes ATP hydrolysis without blocking nucleotide binding (E33A) (15Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), the role of a test mutation in the other monomer can be assayed by the effect of increasing proportions of the test mutation on the ATPase rate. First, test mutations are chosen that will alter ATPase rates within homodimeric Hsc82. If the test mutation functions by altering interactions with the active site on its own subunit (an intramonomer or “cis” interaction), then the activity of its own active site will be compromised by the mutation. If, however, the test mutation alters interactions with the active site on the opposite subunit (an intermonomer or “trans” interaction), which is already compromised by the E33A mutation, then it will not have a deleterious effect, and its own active site should be fully functional (Fig. 2). We can calculate the predicted hydrolysis rate of any mixture of the two homodimer concentrations using standard equilibrium measurements and homodimer activities (see “Experimental Procedures”). The hydrolysis rate of differentially mixed dimers can then be measured and compared with our predicted rates, allowing us to determine the role of the test residue independent of the level of its residual activity.FIGURE 2Schematic of the heterodimer assay. Differentially mutated inactive homodimers are mixed together to form heterodimers. If the two residues mutated interact in an intermonomer interaction, a WT active site would form, and ATP hydrolysis would occur. If the residues interact in an intramonomer interaction, no activity would be measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although it has previously been shown that Hsc82 heterodimers could form (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), in our hands, proof of heterodimer formation upon mixing in vitro was shown both physically and enzymatically. Using differentially tagged constructs of Hsc82 as indicators (supplemental Fig. 1), tagged and untagged Hsc82 were mixed in a 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 ratio (untagged:tagged) and incubated at 30 °C for an hour. MALDI-time-of-flight was then used to probe the relative abundance of each dimer species in each of the reactions. As expected, three peaks are seen in the spectrum of the 1:1 ratio reaction corresponding to each of the pure homodimers and a peak between them representing the formation of heterodimer. When the untagged homodimer is in 3-fold excess, only two peaks are seen, corresponding to the excess untagged homodimer and the heterodimer. The converse result was obtained when the tagged homodimer was in excess. Although equilibrium calculations predict a small amount of the minor homodimer to be present in solution (12.5%), this species could not be observed in the experiment due to limited sensitivity when working with intact proteins of this size in a conventional MALDI instrument.To confirm that the heterodimers still possessed the ability to hydrolyze ATP, a fixed concentration of wild-type Hsc82 was incubated with increasing amounts of the catalytically dead E33A mutant (Glu-33 is required to coordinate the hydrolytic water). Activity levels of the two homodimers are shown in Fig. 3B. ATP hydrolysis rates were unaffected by the amount of added inactive mutant (supplemental Fig. 2). When combined with the mass spectrometric data, these results show that under our conditions, heterodimers can be formed in solution and are fully able to hydrolyze ATP, although one of the monomers is catalytically dead. This confirms the independent activation of the individual NTD ATPases. In contrast, the removal of one of the NTDs reduces, but does not abolish, ATP activity (14Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) in the context of heterodimers, demonstrating the structural requirement of having both NTDs present in the dimer to fully activate each ATPase.FIGURE 3Hydrolysis rates for hydrophobic mutants and the contribution of the middle domain arginine. A, five hydrophobic residues from both monomers come together and interact only in the ATP-bound closed state. One monomer is illustrated in brown, whereas the other monomer is shown in green. Two of the five residues lie on the same loop as Arg-376, which has been previously implicated in stabilizing the γ-phosphate of ATP. B, hydrolysis rates of each mutant used in this study. All rates have been normalized to the WT hydrolysis rate. C, heterodimer assay with R376A and E33A monomers. Ratios between the two homodimers were varied, whereas the total protein concentration was kept constant. Predicted inter- (black) and intramonomer (gray) interaction activities are shown with solid lines, and the closed circles represent the experimental data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Influence of the Middle Domain on the ATPase Activity of Hsc82—Investigation of the apo and AMPPNP structures shows a group of residues (Thr-22, Val-23, Tyr-24, Leu-372, Leu-374, and Arg-376) that come together from distant parts of the apo structure to form an interacting cluster in the ATP state (Fig. 3A). Arg-376 (Arg-380 in Hsp82) was previously shown to be important for hydrolysis, making this entire cluster an attractive starting point for dissecting inter- and intramonomer interactions. Unlike the E33A mutation, the homomeric R376A mutant significantly reduces, but does not abolish, ATPase activity when compared with the E33A mutation previously described (Fig. 3B).As a first test of our assay, we wanted to biochemically confirm that Arg-376 affects the ATPase of its own NTD, as suggested by the Hsp82/ATP/Sba1 structure. To do this, the mutant, R376A, was tested in our heterodimer assay in conjunction with the catalytically dead E33A mutation. Separately expressed and purified R376A and E33A were mixed in defined ratios while keeping the total protein concentration constant; after a period of incubation, their ATP hydrolysis rates were measured (Fig. 3C). Using the behaviors of the individual mutants as homodimers (Fig. 3B), the expected activity as a function of the mixture percentages can be readily predicted (Fig. 3C, trans = black, cis = gray; see also “Experimental Procedures”). From this, it is clear that Arg-376 has a required interaction with the NTD active site on the same monomer. Interestingly, we see no trans-like characteristics in these data, demonstrating that there is no catalytic cooperativity between the two NTDs, analogous to what was shown with human Hsp90 (18McLaughlin S.H. Ventouras L.A. Lobbezoo B. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Contribution of Hydrophobic Interactions to Complete Active Site Formation—As discussed above, the Hsp82/ATP/Sba1 structure revealed a cluster of interacting hydrophobic and polar amino acids derived from the NTD and MD domains that come together in the ATP state to form both intermonomer and intramonomer interactions (Fig. 3A). The residues involved in this interaction are Thr-22, Val-23, and Tyr-24 from the NTD of one monomer and Leu-372 and Leu-374 from the MD of the other. Since the two leucines are located on the same loop and pack against Arg-376 (above) and make cross-monomer interactions in the ATP but not apo states (data not shown), this entire cluster seems appropriate for investigation.To test whether these residues are involved in the hydrolysis of ATP, we systematically mutated each residue to alanine and measured the ATPase activity (Fig. 3B). All constructs were tested in the presence of the Hsp90 family specific inhibitor, geldanamycin, to confirm that the activity measured in these experiments was from Hsc82 and not from any contaminating ATPase activity (data not shown). Interestingly, as a homodimer, T22A showed no significant loss in activity when measured at 37 °C (data not shown); however, it has been previously shown that T22I is a temperature-sensitive mutation resulting in increased ATPase activity at elevated temperatures (24Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). To probe the importance of enhancing hydrophobicity at this site, we constructed the T22F mutation and saw a 3-fold increase in activity, proving that the hydrophobic nature of this interaction is important for its ATPase activity. Interestingly, when this mutation is modeled in the Hsp82/Sba1/AMPPNP crystal structure (PDB: 2CG9) (data not shown), steric clashes are observed, suggesting that the actual hydrolysis-competent structure must be somewhat different from the solved crystal structure.As homodimers, V23A and Y24A both showed a significant loss of activity, whereas the L372A and L374A mutations had little effect (data not shown). Given the experience with Thr-22, we also explored the impact of polar mutations, changing Leu to either Asn or Asp. Both mutations had very pronounced effects, indicating the importance of hydrophobic residues in this network.To determine the impact of these res"

From this approach, lists of hundreds of candidate genomic regions for positive selection have been assembled. These candidate regions are expected to contain variants that contribute to adaptive phenotypes, but few of these regions have been associated with phenotypic effects. Here we present evidence that a derived nonsynonymous substitution (370A) in EDAR, a gene involved in ectodermal development, was driven to high frequency in East Asia by positive selection prior to 10,000 years ago. With an in vitro transfection assay, we demonstrate that 370A enhances NF-kappaB activity. Our results suggest that 370A is a positively selected functional genetic variant that underlies an adaptive human phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1977681642,"Age-related maculopathy (ARM) is a common cause of visual impairment in the elderly populations of industrialized countries and significantly affects the quality of life of those suffering from the disease. Variants within two genes, the complement factor H (CFH) and the poorly characterized LOC387715 (ARMS2), are widely recognized as ARM risk factors. CFH is important in regulation of the alternative complement pathway suggesting this pathway is involved in ARM pathogenesis. Two other complement pathway genes, the closely linked complement component receptor (C2) and complement factor B (CFB), were recently shown to harbor variants associated with ARM.We investigated two SNPs in C2 and two in CFB in independent case-control and family cohorts of white subjects and found rs547154, an intronic SNP in C2, to be significantly associated with ARM in both our case-control (P-value 0.00007) and family data (P-value 0.00001). Logistic regression analysis suggested that accounting for the effect at this locus significantly (P-value 0.002) improves the fit of a genetic risk model of CFH and LOC387715 effects only. Modeling with the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction method showed that adding C2 to the two-factor model of CFH and LOC387715 increases the sensitivity (from 63% to 73%). However, the balanced accuracy increases only from 71% to 72%, and the specificity decreases from 80% to 72%.C2/CFB significantly influences AMD susceptibility and although accounting for effects at this locus does not dramatically increase the overall accuracy of the genetic risk model, the improvement over the CFH-LOC387715 model is statistically significant."
https://openalex.org/W2008542860,"Background Angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling, including matrix metalloproteinase type II (MMP2) activation, has been linked to an age-associated increase in migration capacity of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and to other proinflammatory features of arterial aging. Calpain-1 activation is required for MMP2 expression in fibroblasts and is induced in cardiomyocytes by Ang II. The consequences of engagement of calpain-1 with its substrates, however, in governing the age-associated proinflammatory status within the arterial wall, remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings The present findings demonstrate that transcription, translation, and activity of calpain-1 are significantly up-regulated in rat aortae or early-passage aortic VSMC from old (30-mo) rats compared to young (8-mo). Dual immunolabeling of the arterial wall indicates that colocalization of calpain-1 and Ang II increases within the aged arterial wall. To further explore the relationship of calpain-1 to Ang II, we chronically infused Ang II into young rats, and treated cultured aortic rings or VSMC with Ang II. We also constructed adenoviruses harboring calpain-1 (CANP1) or its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (CAST) and infected these into VSMC. Ang II induces calpain-1 expression in the aortic walls in vivo and ex vivo and VSMC in vitro. The Ang II mediated, age-associated increased MMP2 activity and migration in VSMC are both blocked by calpain inhibitor 1 or CAST. Over-expression of calpain-1 in young VSMC results in cleavage of intact vimentin, and an increased migratory capacity mimicking that of old VSMC, which is blocked by the MMP inhibitor, GM6001. Conclusions/Significance Calpain-1 activation is a pivotal molecular event in the age-associated arterial Ang II/MMP2 signaling cascade that is linked to cytoskeleton protein restructuring, and VSMC migration. Therefore, targeting calpain-1 has the potential to delay or reverse the arterial remodeling that underlies age-associated diseases i.e. atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2010565659,"Background Drug resistant typhoid fever is a major clinical problem globally. Many of the first line antibiotics, including the older generation fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, are failing. Objectives We performed a randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) versus azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) as a once daily oral dose for 7 days for the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever in children and adults in Vietnam. Methods An open-label multi-centre randomised trial with pre-specified per protocol analysis and intention to treat analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was fever clearance time, the secondary outcome was overall treatment failure (clinical or microbiological failure, development of typhoid fever-related complications, relapse or faecal carriage of S. typhi). Principal Findings We enrolled 358 children and adults with suspected typhoid fever. There was no death in the study. 287 patients had blood culture confirmed typhoid fever, 145 patients received gatifloxacin and 142 patients received azithromycin. The median FCT was 106 hours in both treatment arms (95% Confidence Interval [CI]; 94–118 hours for gatifloxacin versus 88–112 hours for azithromycin), (logrank test p = 0.984, HR [95% CI] = 1.0 [0.80–1.26]). Overall treatment failure occurred in 13/145 (9%) patients in the gatifloxacin group and 13/140 (9.3%) patients in the azithromycin group, (logrank test p = 0.854, HR [95% CI] = 0.93 [0.43–2.0]). 96% (254/263) of the Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and 58% (153/263) were multidrug resistant. Conclusions Both antibiotics showed an excellent efficacy and safety profile. Both gatifloxacin and azithromycin can be recommended for the treatment of typhoid fever particularly in regions with high rates of multidrug and nalidixic acid resistance. The cost of a 7-day treatment course of gatifloxacin is approximately one third of the cost of azithromycin in Vietnam. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN67946944"
https://openalex.org/W2014037052,"The human gene MUC4 encodes a transmembrane mucin, ligand of ErbB2, that is associated with pancreatic tumor progression. In the normal pancreas, MUC4 is not expressed, whereas activation of its expression is observed in the early steps of pancreatic carcinogenesis. The molecular mechanisms responsible for MUC4 gene activation are however still unknown. The MUC4 5′-flanking region being GC-rich and including two CpG islands, we hypothesized that epigenetic regulation may be involved and undertook to decipher the molecular phenomenons implied. By treating cancer cell lines with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza) and trichostatin A (TSA), we were able to restore MUC4 expression in a cell-specific manner. We showed by bisulfite-treated genomic DNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation that methylation of five CpG sites and establishment of a repressive histone code at the 5′-untranslated region were associated with MUC4 silencing and impaired its activation by Sp1. Direct involvement of DNMT3A, DNMT3B, HDAC1, and HDAC3 was demonstrated by RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, inhibition of histone deacetylation by TSA was associated with strong MUC4 repression in high-expressing cells. In conclusion, this work shows for the first time the importance of epigenetics in regulating MUC4 expression and may represent a new strategy to inhibit its expression in epithelial tumors—Vincent, A., Ducourouble, M.-P., Van Seuningen, I. Epigenetic regulation of the human mucin gene MUC4 in epithelial cancer cell lines involves both DNA methylation and histone modifications mediated by DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases.

AtlB and AtlC displayed N-acetylmuramidase activity, as demonstrated by tandem mass spectrometry analyses of peptidoglycan fragments generated by the purified enzymes.

The peptidoglycan network consists of glycan strands made of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 2The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramyl; BHI, brain heart infusion; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; rp-HPLC, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. and N-acetylmuramyl (MurNAc) residues that are cross-linked by short peptides of various compositions (2Vollmer W.

Peptidoglycan hydrolytic activities are required for digestion of the septum after division and the assembly of macromolecular structures such as pili (10Vollmer W. Joris B. Charlier P. Foster S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The activity of the peptidoglycan hydrolases is potentially lethal and is therefore tightly regulated by mechanisms that remain largely unknown (10Vollmer W. Joris B. Charlier P. Foster S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The enzymes are referred to as autolysins as they contribute to cell lysis in response to various stresses, including exposure to antibiotics. A wide variety of enzymes with peptidoglycan hydrolytic activities have been identified based on digestion of the intact peptidoglycan macromolecule. The most commonly used method, zymogram, involves separation of proteins from cell extracts by SDS-PAGE in gels containing peptidoglycan, followed by in situ enzyme renaturation (11Leclerc D. Asselin A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The chemical bond cleaved by the hydrolases has only been experimentally identified for a limited number of prototypic enzymes, and the specificity of the enzymes is most frequently inferred from sequence comparisons. Single gene inactivation is rarely associated with a phenotype, presumably because of production of redundant hydrolytic activities. This genetic redundancy has hampered analysis of the physiological function of the hydrolases, which remains poorly documented. In particular, little is known about the role of autolytic enzymes in the enterococci. Two peptidoglycan hydrolases, the Mur-1 N-acetylmuramidase and the Mur-2 N-acetylglucosaminidase, have been described in Enterococcus hirae ATCC9790, formerly called Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus faecium (12Chu C.P.

Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the physiological role of the peptidoglycan hydrolases, we have identified in this study all the autolytic activities detectable by zymogram in E. faecalis JH2-2. We report deletion of the corresponding genes in various combinations and extensive analysis of the impact of the deletions on cell morphology and peptidoglycan turnover. None of the detectable activities were essential for viability, although two enzymes, AtlA and AtlB, appeared to account almost completely for septum digestion and peptidoglycan turnover. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Details of plasmid and strain constructions are described in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. The bacteria were routinely grown at 37 °C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth or agar (Difco) unless otherwise stated. Detection of Peptidoglycan Hydrolases by Zymogram—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using gels containing 0.2% (w/v) autoclaved E. faecalis JH2-2 cells (17Jacob A.E. Hobbs S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were renatured by incubating the gel in 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 0.1% Triton at 37 °C. Partial Purification of EF0355 (AtlB)—The hyperlytic mutant 78E9, obtained by random mutagenesis of E. faecalis JH2-2, 3A. Rancé and S. Mesnage, unpublished results. was grown in 500 ml of BHI until the A600 reached 0.7. Cells were centrifuged and used to inoculate 6 liters of a synthetic medium containing (per liter): 6 g of Na2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 1 g of NH4Cl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% glucose, 20 mg of each amino acid, 100 mg of thiamine, 20 mg of pyridoxine, 20 mg of pantothenic acid, 20 mg of biotin, 2 mg of nicotinic acid, 2 mg of riboflavin, and 2 mg of folic acid. Cells were removed by centrifugation (8,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and 4.2 kg of ammonium sulfate was gradually added to the supernatant under stirring at 4 °C. Proteins were collected by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and dissolved in 33.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The autolytic activity was partially purified by two anion exchange chromatographies (HiTrap Q-Sepharose fast flow 5 ml and Mono Q HR5/5 columns; Amersham Biosciences) using NaCl gradients in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Autolytic activity in the fractions was determined spectrophotometrically by following the decrease in A450 produced by the hydrolysis of E. faecalis JH2-2 peptidoglycan, as described previously (16Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). N-terminal and MALDI-TOF Sequencing—For N-terminal sequencing, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and sequenced using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Procise 494 HT protein sequencer as described elsewhere (18Da Costa B. Chevalier C. Henry C. Huet J.C. Petit S. Lepault J. Boot H. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For MALDI-TOF sequencing, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and tryptic digestions were performed as follows: gel plugs were washed in 50% CH3CN in 50 mm NH4CO3 and desiccated under vacuum. The digestion was performed with 0.5 μg of modified trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade) in 25 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) for 18 h at 37 °C. A 0.5-μl aliquot was spotted directly onto the stainless steel MALDI plate. The sample was dried at room temperature before addition of 0.5 μl of 3 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager DE-STR+ time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm. For acquisition, the accelerating voltage used was 20 kV. Peptide spectra were recorded in the positive reflector mode and with a delayed extraction of 130 ns and a 62% grid voltage. The spectra were calibrated using an external calibration as described by Cencic et al. (19Cencic A. Henry C. Lefevre F. Huet J.C. Koren S. La Bonnar-diere C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2772-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Production and Purification of Histidine-tagged AtlB and AtlC—E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 °C in BHI broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cultures reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.7, production of the recombinant proteins was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation was continued for 4 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, and crude lysates were obtained by sonication (six times for 30 s, 20% output, Branson Sonifier 450). Inclusion bodies containing AtlB and AtlC were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and washed three times in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in buffer A (100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 m urea) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate-agarose resin (Qiagen). The resin was extensively washed with buffer A adjusted to pH 7.0 and eluted with buffer A adjusted to pH 4.5. Purified AtlB and AtlC were dialyzed against 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), containing 50 mm NaCl and 40% glycerol. Proteins were stored at -80 °C. Cell Wall Purification and Peptidoglycan Structural Analysis—Peptidoglycan was purified from exponentially growing cells as described previously (16Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), freeze-dried, and resuspended in distilled water at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. Peptidoglycan (5 mg) was digested overnight with 300 μg of purified AtlB or AtlC at 37 °C in 500 μl of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 50 mm NaCl. Soluble disaccharide peptides were recovered in the supernatant following ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C) and reduced with sodium borohydride as described previously (16Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reduced muropeptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (rp-HPLC) on a C18 column (3 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Interchrom, Montluçon, France) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 0-20% gradient applied between 10 and 90 min (buffer A, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water; buffer B, 0.035% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). Mass spectral data were collected with an electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometer operating in the positive mode (Qstar Pulsar I; Applied Biosystems). The data were acquired with a capillary voltage of 5,200 V and a declustering potential of 20 V. The mass scan range was from m/z 350 to 1,500, and the scan cycle was 1 s. Tandem mass spectrometry was carried out as described previously (20Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Monsempes C. Blanot D. Brouard J.P. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41546-41556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Strains were grown overnight with shaking at 180 rpm at 37 °C. Bacteria were diluted (1:100) into fresh broth and incubated with shaking until the A600 reached 0.2. Bacteria were diluted (1:100) in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry using a Beckman Coulter EPICS flow cytometer, as described elsewhere (21Russo-Marie F. Roederer M. Sager B. Herzenberg L.A. Kaiser D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8194-8198Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Light scatter data were obtained with logarithmic amplifiers for 20,000 events. Incorporation of [14C]GlcNAc by Exponentially Growing E. faecalis Strains—One ml of an exponentially growing culture (A600 = 0.3) was used to inoculate 5 ml of pre-warmed Luria Bertani medium containing [14C]GlcNAc (7.3 μm final; 2.1 GBq/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Aliquots (400 μl) were withdrawn; an equal volume of 0.1% SDS was added, and bacteria were centrifuged (15,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature). The pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of water, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in 4 ml of ACS II scintillation mixture (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Radioactivity Released in the Culture Medium—Exponentially growing E. faecalis were labeled with [14C]GlcNAc in the conditions described above, collected when the A600 reached 0.25, washed by centrifugation, and resuspended at the same cell density in Luria Bertani medium containing 1 mm GlcNAc. Aliquots were withdrawn; bacteria were centrifuged, and the amount of radioactivity released by the bacteria was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the supernatant. Autolytic Activities of E. faecalis JH2-2—Four protein bands displaying autolytic activities (72, 62, 50, and 47 kDa) were detected in crude extracts of the wild-type strain JH2-2 (Fig. 1A, lane 1). The profile obtained for the secreted proteins was similar to that of crude extracts, except that the 47-kDa band was absent and the 72-kDa band was slightly more intense (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Analyses of strains with deletion of the atlA gene (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2) indicated that the 72- and 62-kDa bands correspond to two forms of the major N-acetylglucosaminidase, as described previously (16Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The remaining 50- and 47-kDa bands were not detected in our previous study in which we used Micrococcus lysodeikticus instead of E. faecalis cells as the substrate. Identification of the Gene Encoding the 50-kDa Autolysin (AtlB) by Reverse Genetics—The 50-kDa secreted protein was purified from strain 78E9, a hyperlytic mutant of E. faecalis JH2-2 that overproduces this autolysin (Fig. 1, lane 3). The mutant 78E9 was grown in a synthetic medium, and proteins present in the culture supernatant were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The 50-kDa autolysin was partially purified by two successive anion exchange chromatographies (Fig. 2, A and B). The second chromatography increased the specific activity only 2-fold (Fig. 2C), but this step was crucial for protein identification because it allowed the separation of several polypeptides with molecular masses close to 50 kDa, which were poorly resolved by SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal sequence of the polypeptide at 50 kDa present in the protein fraction enriched in autolytic activity (Fig. 3A, arrow) was determined by Edman degradation. The sequence, AKG-DQGVD, matched the predicted N-terminal sequence of three putative secreted proteins encoded by the E. faecalis V583 genome after cleavage of their signal peptides (EF0355, EF1992, and EF2802). As depicted in Fig. 3B, EF0355 and EF2802 are nearly identical (97.5% identity), whereas EF1992 is more distant (∼69% identity). MALDI-TOF tandem-mass spectrometry of tryptic fragments was used to determine which of these three candidate genes encoded the 50-kDa protein band with autolytic activity. Three [M + H]+ ions at m/z 875.46, 1,424.74, and 2,459.22 matched the calculated mass of tryptic fragments of EF0355 (Fig. 3, B and C). Because digestion of EF1992 and EF2802 is not predicted to produce fragments of the same mass, this observation indicates that EF0355 was present in the 50-kDa protein band. Conversely, none of the fragments specific for EF1992 and EF2802 were detected suggesting that these proteins were not present in the 50-kDa protein band.FIGURE 3Identification of the 50-kDa autolysin by MALDI-TOF sequencing of tryptic fragments.

Complementation of the deletion with a plasmid encoding EF0355 with an additional histidine tag restored the parental autolytic profile except for a slightly reduced electrophoretic mobility because of the tag (Fig. 1, lane 6). These results indicate that EF0355 encodes an autolysin, which we named AtlB. These results also confirmed that a single autolysin is present in the 50-kDa protein band, as inferred from MALDI-TOF sequencing (see above). Deletion of altB alone (Fig. 1, lane 4) or in combination with atlA (lane 9) revealed that E. faecalis JH2-2 produced a third autolysin of 47 kDa that we named AtlC. Inactivation of the Gene Encoding AtlC—Because the calculated mass of the secreted EF1992 (42,967 Da, Fig. 3B) was close to 47 kDa, the corresponding gene was inactivated in E. faecalis JH2-2. The deletion suppressed production of the 47-kDa autolysin (Fig. 1, lane 5) indicating that EF1992 encodes AtlC. Complementation analysis was performed in a double ΔatlBC mutant as the 47-kDa activity could be clearly detected in the absence of AtlB (50 kDa) (Fig. 1). The triple ΔatlABC mutant did not display any autolytic activity (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that three enzymes, AtlA, AtlB, and AtlC, account for all the autolytic activities detected by zymogram using E. faecalis peptidoglycan as the substrate. Both AtlB and AtlC Display N-Acetylmuramidase Activity—We have previously shown that AtlA is an N-acetylglucosaminidase (16Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To identify the peptidoglycan bond cleaved by AtlB and AtlC, the autolysins were produced in E. coli as recombinant proteins lacking the signal peptide and harboring a C-terminal histidine tag (Fig. 4A, inset). The peptidoglycan of E. faecalis JH2-2 was digested with the purified proteins. The resulting disaccharide peptides were reduced by sodium borohydride and separated by rp-HPLC (Fig. 4A and data not shown). Mass spectrometry analysis of the main monomer generated by AtlB (Fig. 4A, arrow) gave an [M + H]+ ion at m/z 1,110.6 that matched the calculated mass of a reduced disaccharide pentapeptide substituted by an l-Ala-l-Ala side chain JH2-2 (AA) (Fig. 4B). Thus, AtlB cleaved the glycan strands. To distinguish between N-acetylglucosaminidase and N-acetylmuramidase activity, the sugar harboring the reducing end (GlcNAc or MurNAc) was identified by tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 4C). The fragmentation pattern of the ion at m/z 1,110.6 showed that GlcNAc was not reduced as shown by [M + H]+ ions at m/z 204.1 (GlcNAc) and 907.5 (loss of GlcNAc) and was therefore typical of a disaccharide peptide generated by an N-acetylmuramidase activity. Further fragmentations gave additional ions characteristic of the structure described for the E. faecalis peptidoglycan monomer (Fig. 4) (20Arbeloa A. Hugonnet J.E. Sentilhes A.C. Josseaume N. Dubost L. Monsempes C. Blanot D. Brouard J.P. Arthur M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41546-41556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The same approach revealed that AtlC is also an N-acetylmuramidase (data not shown). Role of AtlA, AtlB, and AtlC in Cell Separation—Cultures of enterococci, including E. faecalis JH2-2 (22Baptista M. Rodrigues P. Depardieu F. Courvalin P. Arthur M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), contain mostly diplococci with rare short chains (typically 4-8 cells). The impact of deletion of atlA, atlB, and atlC on the distribution of these different forms was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). The wild-type distribution of forward scattered light gave a sharp peak characteristic of a homogeneous population mostly consisting of diplococci both in the exponential and stationary growth phases. Analysis of exponentially growing cells of the ΔatlA mutant revealed a broad peak that was shifted toward higher forward scattered light intensities. Formation of long chains by the ΔatlA mutant indicated that AtlA was required for digestion of the septum after cell division. Because the difference between the ΔatlA mutant and the parental strain disappeared after 24 h of incubation, the septum was digested independently from AtlA in the stationary phase. Deletion of atlB and atlC, alone or in combination, had no impact on cell morphology. Combination of the atlA and atlB mutations increased bacterial chain length both in exponentially growing cells and after 24 h of incubation. Thus, AtlB contributed to digestion of the septum in the absence of AtlA. Comparison of cultures incubated 24 and 96 h indicated that the septum was very slowly digested in the ΔatlAB double mutant. The residual activity was not because of AtlC because similar results were obtained for the double ΔatlAB and triple ΔatlABC mutants. To further investigate the contribution of E. faecalis autolysins to cell separation, we analyzed the dispersion of chains by purified AtlA and AtlB (Fig. 6). Complementation of the ΔatlA mutation was observed with both autolysins. AtlA appeared more active than AtlB in this assay because higher enzyme concentrations of AtlB (∼10-fold) were required for chain dispersion. These results indicate that externally added autolysins are active in the digestion of the septum and confirm that AtlA is the major enzyme responsible for cell separation after division. Contribution of AtlA, AtlB, and AtlC to Peptidoglycan Metabolism—Incorporation and release of [14C]GlcNAc was analyzed according to the procedures previously developed for Bacillus subtilis (23Bisicchia P. Noone D. Lioliou E. Howell A. Quigley S. Jensen T. Jarmer H. Devine K.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 180-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Comparison of the parental strain JH2-2 and the triple ΔatlABC mutant (Fig. 7A) indicated that the three autolysins were not required for a wild-type rate of incorporation of GlcNAc into peptidoglycan under the experimental conditions tested. To evaluate the release of peptidoglycan fragments, bacteria labeled with [14C]GlcNAc were washed and resuspended in pre-warmed medium containing a 140-fold molar excess of unlabeled GlcNAc (Fig. 7B). After four generations of exponential growth, only 15% of the radioactivity was released in the culture medium by the parental strain JH2-2. Under similar conditions, 80% of the radioactivity was previously found to be released in three generations by B. subtilis (23Bisicchia P. Noone D. Lioliou E. Howell A. Quigley S. Jensen T. Jarmer H. Devine K.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 180-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results indicate that peptidoglycan turnover is much lower in E. faecalis than in B. subtilis. During the stationary phase, radioactivity was released at a slow and constant rate by JH2-2 to reach 83% at 48 h. Release of radioactivity was not associated with cell lysis because A600 did not decrease during this time period. Thus, release of radioactivity should be attributed to a partial hydrolysis that did not compromise cell wall integrity. Individual deletion of atlA, atlB, and atlC had little or no impact on the release of radioactivity during the exponential phase of growth (10, 14, and 17% versus 15%, respectively, for JH2-2). During the stationary phase, the release of radioactivity was diminished for the ΔatlA (26%) and ΔatlB (29%) mutants in comparison to JH2-2 (83%) or to the ΔatlC mutant (95%). Combination of the ΔatlA and B mutations suppressed the release of radioactivity, except in the late stationary phase (9% between 24 and 48 h). Together, these results indicate that the hydrolytic activities of AtlA and AtlB account for production of virtually all peptidoglycan fragments that are released by E. faecalis in the culture medium during both the exponential and stationary phases of growth. AtlA and AltB appear to compensate for each other only during the exponential phase of growth. Genome sequencing revealed that the complement of genes encoding putative peptidoglycan hydrolases is complex in most bacteria because it typically includes 10-30 candidate genes. Redundancy is often observed for the same cleavage specificity, and the relative contribution of the different enzymes to peptidoglycan metabolism remains largely unknown except in the model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis (10Vollmer W. Joris B. Charlier P. Foster S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 259-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 24Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons with known autolysins (data not shown) revealed that the E. faecalis genome encodes 20 putative peptidoglycan hydrolases, including 6 glucosaminidases, 7 muramidases, 2 amidases, 2 endopeptidases, and 3 proteins related to lytic transglycosylases. Among these putative enzymes, AtlA was previously shown to be an N-acetylglucosaminidase (16Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, gene inactivation (Fig. 1) and reverse genetics (Figs. 2 and 3) led to the identification of two additional autolysins (AtlB and AtlC). Both enzymes were produced in E. coli, and their N-acetylmuramidase (lysozyme) activity was demonstrated by tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the peptidoglycan digestion products (Fig. 4). Construction of a triple mutant (ΔatlABC) revealed that AtlA, AtlB, and AtlC were not essential for growth and accounted for all the autolytic activities detectable by zymogram in E. faecalis JH2-2 (Fig. 1). The absence of any autolytic band in the zymogram of the triple mutant (data not shown) implied that serial deletions of atlA, atlB, and atlC did not result in the activation of any autolysin that could have been cryptic in the wild-type strain. The impact of the atlA, atlB, and atlC mutations on cell morphology was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5). This method was recently developed to quantify the cellular dimensions of E. coli PBP mutants (25Meberg B.M. Paulson A.L. Priyadarshini R. Young K.D. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Formation of bacterial chains by the ΔatlA mutant during the exponential phase of growth indicated that AtlA is the major autolysin responsible for septum hydrolysis following cell division. During the stationary phase, the distribution of cell length returned to normal in 24 h in the ΔatlA mutant but not in the ΔatlAB mutant, indicating that AtlB cleaved the septum in the absence of AtlA. Purified AtlA and AtlB were able to digest the septum, although higher concentrations of the latter protein were required (Fig. 6) suggesting that AtlB is less efficient than AtlA for septum cleavage. Both AtlA and AtlB harbor a domain organization typical for autolysins, i.e. a catalytic domain fused to a cell wall binding domain (24Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although both AtlA and AtlB harbor a LysM peptidoglycan domain, these domains are composed of a different number of LysM repeats (six for AtlA and two for AtlB) and display a very different pI (10.1 for AtlA and 5.5 for AtlB). The distinct properties of the AtlA and AtlB LysM domains may account for the fact that AtlA is specifically targeted to the septum. Preferential cleavage of the septum by AtlA could also depend upon local differences in the chemical composition of peptidoglycan, which could affect the catalytic activity of the autolysin. Cell separation was observed in the absence of AtlA and AtlB upon prolonged incubation (96 h), suggesting that the septum was slowly cleaved. This additional activity cannot be attributed to AtlC because deletion of atlC did not result in any detectable modification of cell morphology. This conclusion is supported by deletions of the atlA, atlB, and atlC genes in all possible combinations (Fig. 5B). In E. coli and B. subtilis, peptidoglycan hydrolases release fragments from the wall during growth, a process termed peptidoglycan turnover (26Archibald A.R. Hancock I.C. Harwood C.R. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1993: 381-410Google Scholar, 27Vollmer W. Holtje J.V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we show that peptidoglycan turnover is much lower in E. faecalis than in B. subtilis because only 15% of radiolabeled GlcNAc was released in four generations (Fig. 7). As inferred from our zymogram analyses (Fig. 1) and from assays using purified peptidoglycan (Fig. 4) (16Eckert C. Lecerf M. Dubost L. Arthur M. Mesnage S. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the autolytic activities of AtlA, AtlB, and AtlC are readily detectable in vitro. This is in contrast with the yet unexplained, particularly low, turnover rate in E. faecalis. This paradox implies that autolysins, which are potentially lethal enzymes, are tightly controlled during cell growth by mechanisms that remain to be discovered. The activity of AtlA and AtlB fully accounted for this low turnover during exponential growth. This observation implies that peptidoglycan synthesis in the double ΔatlAB mutant was not associated with any significant release of peptidoglycan fragments and raises the question previously mentioned (27Vollmer W. Holtje J.V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) of whether autolysins are essential for enlargement of the cell. AtlA and AtlB also accounted for the release of peptidoglycan fragments in the culture medium during the stationary phase (Fig. 7B). The activity of these enzymes was efficiently controlled because cell lysis was not detected. The peptidoglycan fragments released in the medium are likely to originate, at least in part, from digestion of the septum by AtlA and AtlB as documented by flow cytometry (Fig. 6). In contrast to atlA, the atlB and atlC genes are located in putative prophages, designated 01 and 04, respectively (28Lepage E. Brinster S. Caron C. Ducroix-Crepy C. Rigottier-Gois L. Dunny G.

The location of atlB and atlC suggests that the autolysins participate in a lytic cycle, although the functionality of these genetic elements as phages is unknown. We have shown that AtlB and AtlC are produced by JH2-2 (Fig. 1) in the absence of cell lysis or production of phage progeny. AtlB contains a canonical signal peptide of 22 residues, and N-terminal sequencing revealed cleavage at the predicted site (Fig. 3). Thus, AtlB appears to be secreted independently from any phage-encoded function, despite the presence of a putative holin gene upstream from atlB. An impact of AtlB production on cell morphology has been detected in a ΔatlA background revealing that that AtlB could act as a surrogate for AtlA. Together, these results suggest that AtlB, and perhaps AtlC, may have been hijacked by E. faecalis to contribute to peptidoglycan metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2043281233,"Vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) catalyzes ATP synthesis and hydrolysis coupled with proton translocation across membranes via a rotary motor mechanism. Here we report biochemical and biophysical catalytic properties of V-ATPase from Thermus thermophilus. ATP hydrolysis of V-ATPase was severely inhibited by entrapment of Mg-ADP in the catalytic site. In contrast, the enzyme was very active for ATP synthesis (approximately 70 s(-1)) with the K(m) values for ADP and phosphate being 4.7 +/- 0.5 and 460 +/- 30 microm, respectively. Single molecule observation showed V-ATPase rotated in a 120 degrees stepwise manner, and analysis of dwelling time allowed the binding rate constant k(on) for ATP to be estimated ( approximately 1.1 x 10(6) m(-1) s(-1)), which was much lower than the k(on) (= V(max)/K(m)) for ADP ( approximately 1.4 x 10(7) m(-1) s(-1)). The slower k(on)(ATP) than k(on)(ADP) and strong Mg-ADP inhibition may contribute to prevent wasteful consumption of ATP under in vivo conditions when the proton motive force collapses."
https://openalex.org/W2085212468,"We have earlier shown that clumping factor A (ClfA), a fibrinogen binding surface protein of Staphylococcus aureus, is an important virulence factor in septic arthritis. When two amino acids in the ClfA molecule, P336 and Y338, were changed to serine and alanine, respectively, the fibrinogen binding property was lost. ClfAP336Y338 mutants have been constructed in two virulent S. aureus strains Newman and LS-1. The aim of this study was to analyze if these two amino acids which are vital for the fibrinogen binding of ClfA are of importance for the ability of S. aureus to generate disease. Septic arthritis or sepsis were induced in mice by intravenous inoculation of bacteria. The clfAP336Y338 mutant induced significantly less arthritis than the wild type strain, both with respect to severity and frequency. The mutant infected mice developed also a much milder systemic inflammation, measured as lower mortality, weight loss, bacterial growth in kidneys and lower IL-6 levels. The data were verified with a second mutant where clfAP336 and Y338 were changed to alanine and serine respectively. When sepsis was induced by a larger bacterial inoculum, the clfAP336Y338 mutants induced significantly less septic death. Importantly, immunization with the recombinant A domain of ClfAP336SY338A mutant but not with recombinant ClfA, protected against septic death. Our data strongly suggest that the fibrinogen binding activity of ClfA is crucial for the ability of S. aureus to provoke disease manifestations, and that the vaccine potential of recombinant ClfA is improved by removing its ability to bind fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1997215803,"It may be assumed that patterns of clinical malaria in children of similar age under the same level of exposure would follow a Poisson distribution with no over-dispersion. Longitudinal studies that have been conducted over many years suggest that some children may experience more episodes of clinical malaria than would be expected. The aim of this study was to identify this group of children and investigate possible causes for this increased susceptibility.Using Poisson regression, we chose a group of children whom we designated as 'more susceptible' to malaria from 373 children under 10 years of age who were followed up for between 3 to 5 years from 1998-2003. About 21% of the children were categorized as 'more susceptible' and although they contributed only 23% of the person-time of follow-up, they experienced 55% of total clinical malaria episodes. Children that were parasite negative at all cross-sectional survey were less likely to belong to this group [AOR = 0.09, (95% CI: 0.14-0.61), p = 0.001].The pattern of clinical malaria episodes follows a negative binomial distribution. Use of lack of a clinical malaria episode in a certain time period as endpoints for intervention or immunological studies may not adequately distinguish groups who are more or less immune. It may be useful in such studies, in addition to the usual endpoint of the time to first episode, to include end points which take into account the total number of clinical episodes experienced per child."
https://openalex.org/W2064942214,"The Arf6-specific exchange factor EFA6 coordinates membrane trafficking with actin cytoskeleton remodeling. It localizes to the plasma membrane where it catalyzes Arf6 activation and induces the formation of actin-based membrane ruffles. We have shown previously that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of EFA6 was responsible for its membrane localization. In this study we looked for the partners of the PH domain at the plasma membrane. Mutations of the conserved basic residues suspected to be involved in the binding to phosphoinositides redistribute EFA6-PH to the cytosol. In addition, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) breakdown also leads to the solubilization of EFA6-PH. Direct binding measured by surface plasmon resonance gives an apparent affinity of ∼0.5 μm EFA6-PH for PI(4,5)P2. Moreover, we observed in vitro that the catalytic activity of EFA6 is strongly increased by PI(4,5)P2. These results indicate that the plasma membrane localization of EFA6-PH is based on its interaction with PI(4,5)P2, and this interaction is necessary for an optimal catalytic activity of EFA6. Furthermore, we demonstrated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and Triton X-100 detergent solubility experiments that in addition to the phophoinositides, EFA6-PH is linked to the actin cytoskeleton. We observed both in vivo and in vitro that EFA6-PH interacts directly with F-actin. Finally, we demonstrated that EFA6 could bind simultaneously filamentous actin and phospholipids vesicles.

Our results explain how the exchange factor EFA6 via its PH domain could coordinate at the plasma membrane actin cytoskeleton organization with membrane trafficking. The ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) family, which includes six isoforms, plays a key role in the intracellular vesicular transport (for review, see Ref. 1D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Arf proteins are known to regulate the membrane recruitment to specific compartments of different protein coats necessary to generate membrane curvature and vesicle formation. In addition, they control the activation of phospholipid modifying enzyme also involved in membrane vesicle formation. The specific function of each Arf isoform remains largely unknown. At least it results partly from the localization of each Arf isoform to specific intracellular compartment. The signals responsible for the membrane targeting of the soluble and highly diffusing inactive Arf proteins are the objects of intensive search. Honda et al. (2Honda A. Al-Awar O.S. Hay J.C. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1039-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have elegantly demonstrated that the Golgi localization of Arf1 was due to its interaction with membrin, an endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment receptor) protein. Regarding Arf6, Claing et al. (3Claing A. Chen W. Miller W.E. Vitale N. Moss J. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42509-42513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) have shown that the GDP-bound form binds to β-arrestin, an AP-2/clathrin adaptor involved in the internalization of G-protein-coupled receptors. This interaction is probably important for the function of Arf6 in G-protein-coupled receptor endocytosis. Likewise, the binding of GDP-bound Arfs to their guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PLC, phospholipase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. 2The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PLC, phospholipase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP. is critical to localize the Arf proteins to their proper membrane (for review, see Ref. 4Casanova J.E. Traffic. 2007; 8: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The Arf specific GEF family, also referred to as the Sec7 family, comprises 15 members divided in two classes, the large and the small GEFs, which are responsible for the activation of 6 Arf isoforms. This larger number of GEFs suggests that each Arf is under the control of several ArfGEFs. Growing evidence indicates that the ArfGEFs are targeted to specific compartments where they will activate a cognate Arf. Little is known about how the large GEFs, GBF1, Big1, and Big2 are targeted to their working compartments, respectively cis-Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate (5Zhao X. Claude A. Chun J. Shields D.J. Presley J.F. Melancon P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3743-3753Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and trans-Golgi network (6Shinotsuka C. Waguri S. Wakasugi M. Uchiyama Y. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, the small Arf-GEF family members (Arno/Cytohesin, EFA6, and BRAG/GEP100 subfamilies) contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain adjacent to the catalytic Sec7 domain that is required for their cellular localization. PH domains are structural modules of about 110 amino acids important for membrane association of proteins involved in cellular signaling, membrane trafficking, phospholipid modification, and cytoskeleton organization. Their structural architecture is particularly well conserved. They have a core of seven-stranded β-sandwich structure closed off at one end by a C-terminal α-helix. Several PH domains recognize particular phosphoinositides with high affinity. For example, the PH domain of PLCδ has been shown to interact strongly and specifically with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). In addition to phosphoinositides, there exists evidence that some PH domains can mediate protein-protein interactions (7Lemmon M.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). For example, the PH domain of GRK2 interacts with both PI(4,5)P2 and Gβγ subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex (8Carman C.V. Barak L.S. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. Onorato J.J. Kennedy S.P.

In the case of Arno/Cytohesin isoforms, their PH domain has been shown to specifically interact with PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 according to the presence or not of a third glycine in the β1/β2 loop (14Klarlund J.K.

In addition to phosphoinositides, it has recently been demonstrated that the PH domain of Arno interacts also with the GTP-bound form of Arf6 and Arl4 proteins (15Cohen L.A. Honda A. Varnai P.

EFA6 is an Arf6-specific exchange factor that coordinates endocytotic events with actin cytoskeleton reorganization (17Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the protein localizes essentially to the plasma membrane because of the presence of a PH domain; however, the nature of the targeting signals at the plasma membrane is unknown. In the present study we have looked for partners of this PH domain at the plasma membrane to determine how the cellular localization of EFA6 is regulated. We demonstrate that EFA6 via its PH domain interacts specifically and with a high affinity with PI(4,5)P2. This interaction is strictly required for the plasma membrane localization and for an efficient nucleotide exchange activity of EFA6. In addition, we show that the EFA6-PH domain directly binds the F-actin and targets EFA6 at the plasma membrane into F-actin-enriched structures. Finally, we demonstrate that EFA6 could simultaneously bind phospholipid membranes and filamentous actin. This finding might explain for the first time how EFA6 could coordinate membrane trafficking with actin cytoskeleton organization. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Antibodies—Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK) were grown in BHK-21 medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against VSV-G epitope (clone P5D4, Roche Diagnostics), rabbit antiserum against GFP (Clontech, Takara Bio Europe), anti-actin mAb AC40 (Sigma), and anti-Arf6 mAb 8A6.2 (provided by S. Bourgoin, Sainte-Foy, Canada). Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin was from Molecular Probes, and fluorescein isothiocyanate and Texas Red-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Azolectin, ionomycin, unlabeled nucleotides, cytochalasin D, and egg phosphatidylcholine were from Sigma. Liver phosphatidylethanolamine, brain phosphatidylserine, liver phosphatidylinositol (PI), brain phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, PI(4,5)P2, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL), [35S]GTPγS was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Preparation of Phospholipid Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles of azolectin were prepared as described elsewhere (18Szoka Jr., F. Papahadjopoulos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4194-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar) and extruded through a 0.4 μm pore size polycarbonate filter (Isopore, Millipore). Vesicles of defined composition were prepared as previously described (19Macia E. Paris S. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Myristoylated Arf6 wild-type (Myr-Arf6) was expressed and purified as previously described (20Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Chavrier P. Franco M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recombinant EFA6.A (referred in the study as EFA6) with an N-terminal hexahistidine (His-EFA6) tag was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The isolated PH (residues 351-522) and PH+C (351-645) protein domains of EFA6.A fused to GST were purified from bacteria according to manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Except for the GST-PH protein, which was kept at 4 °C and used within 2 days after purification, all the other proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol, frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—Myr-Arf6 (0.8 μm) was incubated at 30 °C with [35S]GTPγS (10 μm, ∼2000 cpm/pmol) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 120 mm NaCl with or without His-tagged EFA6 (20 nm), and 0.5 mg/ml vesicles made of equal proportions of neutral phospholipids phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, 30% phosphatidylserine, and supplemented or not with 2% of various phosphoinositides. At the indicated times aliquots of 25 μl were pipetted out and filtered, and the radioactivity was measured as described previously (20Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Chavrier P. Franco M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of F-actin on EFA6 nucleotide exchange activity (Fig. 7), myr-Arf6 (0.8 μm) was incubated at 37 °C with [35S]GTPγS (10 μm, ∼2000 cpm/pmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 50 μm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml azolectin vesicles with or without His-EFA6 (20 nm), and F-actin (3 μm). Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—Lateral diffusion coefficients and the mobile fraction were measured by FRAP using the Zeiss LSM Meta 510 confocal microscope as previously described (22Causeret M. Taulet N. Comunale F. Favard C. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2168-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). FRAP recoveries were acquired at room temperature on GFP-EFA6-PH or GFP-PLCδ1-PH-expressing BHK cells plated on glass coverslips. For cytochalasin D experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 2 μm cytochalasin D in BHK-21 medium then replaced by fresh medium for FRAP experiments. The 488-nm line of the Ar+ laser was used for excitation of the GFP. Cells were observed using a 63× water immersion objective (NA 1.2) with a fully opened pinhole. After 20 prebleach scans (one scan every 115 ms), a region of interest with w = 1 μm (w = 2 μm for cytochalasin D experiments) was bleached, and fluorescence recovery was then sampled for 20 s at the same scan frequency. Bleaching time length was carefully adjusted to be less than one-tenth of the t½ to achieve correct determination of diffusion coefficients. Experimental recoveries were normalized and corrected for cell z-position fluctuation using another region of interest as an internal standard. Half recovery times (t½) and mobile fractions were determined by Levenberg-Marquadt fit of the normalized recovery curves using a 20th-order limited development of a modified equation given in Axelrod (23Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Diffusion coefficients (D) were then calculated using the equation D = βw2/4t½. Here, β takes into account the depth of the bleaching (24Soumpasis D.M. Biophys. J. 1983; 41: 95-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Our method was validated by performing FRAP experiments on l-α -dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine:12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-phosphatidylcholine (99:1, mol:mol) multilamellar lipid vesicles at 25 °C, giving values for diffusion coefficients of 2.0 ± 0.2 μm2·s-1 and for mobile fraction of 0.97 ± 0.05 (5 experiments), in total agreement with previously published values (for review, see Ref. 25Tocanne J.F. Dupou-Cezanne L. Lopez A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 203-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—Surface plasmon resonance was measured using a Biacore 2000 instrument. The experiments were performed essentially as described elsewhere (26Mortier E. Wuytens G. Leenaerts I. Hannes F. Heung M.Y. Degeest G. David G. Zimmermann P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2556-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The L1 chip was cleaned by a 4-min injection with 1% octylglycoside and by a 4-min injection with 0.5% SDS at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Before injection of the lipid vesicles, each flow cell was conditioned with 1% octylglycoside for 1 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The L1 chip was coated with lipid vesicles at a concentration of 1.5 mm for 11 min at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The immobilized vesicles were washed with 10 mm NaOH at 100 μl/min flow rate for 12 s to remove unattached vesicles. Purified proteins were diluted in Hepes-buffered saline running buffer to the concentration indicated and perfused at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The proteins were allowed to associate for 4 min and then allowed to dissociate for at least 4 min. The sensor surface was regenerated by short pulses of 10 mm NaOH. The lipid layers were removed by injecting 1% octylglycoside. Cell Fractionation, Triton X-100 Solubilization, and Immunoblotting—106 BHK cells were transfected with EGFP-EFA6-PH-or EGFP-PCLδ-PH-expressing vectors and washed in phosphate buffer 40 h later. For cytosol/membrane fractionation, the cells were then homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, with proteases inhibitors. The post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation of the cell lysate at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant was further centrifuged for 45 min at 100,000 × g to separate membrane and cytosolic fractions. For Triton X-100 solubilization, the cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 with proteases inhibitors for 10 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged 30 min at 15,000 × g to separate the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. Aliquots of the pellet and supernatant (⅙ of the pellet for Triton X-100 solubilization experiment) fractions were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblot using an anti-GFP antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation—BHK-21 cells (2 × 106 cells in 10-cm tissue culture dishes) were transfected with different EGFP-EFA6 constructs or EGFP alone. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a tablet of proteases inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and aliquots of each supernatant were saved for later analysis. Then 5 μg of anti-GFP antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL4B were added and further incubated for 4 h at4°C. The beads were then washed in lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—BHK cells plated on 11-mm round glass coverslips were transiently transfected with pCDNA3 or pEGFP-N1/C1 constructs using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Unless otherwise stated, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection, then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (27Franco M.

Confocal microscopy analysis was carried out with a Leica TCS-SP5 microscope (Leica Microsystems). Actin Sedimentation—Monomeric G-actin purified from rabbit muscle was stored at 4 °C in G buffer (5 mm Tris/HCl, 0.2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.5). Actin polymerization was performed as described (28Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin was polymerized for 5 h at room temperature by the addition of 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EGTA (KME buffer) to G-actin. For the sedimentation assay, EFA6 constructs at the indicated concentrations were incubated with F-actin for 10 min at room temperature (final volume, 70 μlin G + KME buffer) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 70,000 rpm in TL100.1. Pellets were resuspended in the same buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the co-sedimentation assay the procedure was the same as above except than F-actin and GST-EFA6 were incubated with azolectin-cholate micelles (29Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24531-24534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl))-phosphatidylethanolamine. Pellets aliquots were visualized and analyzed in a Fuji LAS-3000 fluorescence imaging system. Electron Microscopy—Samples containing F-actin (5 μm) were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with azolectin vesicles (1 g/liter) in G-KME buffer with or without GST-EFA6 (2 μm). Samples were deposited on glow discharge carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. They were observed with a Philips CM12 TEM (Eindhoven). Acquisitions were made with a Morada digital camera (Olympus SIS). The PH Domain Is Responsible for the Plasma Membrane Localization of EFA6—EFA6 is an Arf6-specific nucleotide exchange factor that is constituted of several structural domains. Adjacent to the catalytic Sec7 domain, EFA6 contains a PH domain and in its C terminus part a coiled-coil domain and two proline-rich regions (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that EFA6 localizes to the plasma membrane. We also observed that the deletion of the C terminus part including the PH domain and the coiled-coil motif led to a protein that was mostly detected in the cytosolic fraction (17Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To determine precisely which domain was involved in the plasma membrane localization, we expressed different mutants of EFA6 in BHK cells and analyzed their localization by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Deletion of the 124 C-terminal amino acids (ΔC) that does not remove the PH domain does not affect the plasma membrane localization of EFA6. In contrast, deletion of the 241 last residues that contain both the PH and the C terminus domains led to the solubilization of the protein. It indicated that the PH domain is responsible for the plasma membrane localization. This was confirmed by expressing the isolated PH domain fused to GFP, which localized to the plasma membrane similarly to the full-length EFA6. The PI(4,5)P2 Is Responsible for the Plasma Membrane Localization of EFA6—Next, we looked for partners of the PH domain at the plasma membrane. Several PH domains recognize particular phosphoinositides with high affinity and specificity. This binding results at least for a part from the presence of basic residues in the β1/β2 loop region (30Lemmon M.A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The alignment of the primary sequences of several PH domains revealed that EFA6 bears some of the conserved basic residues involved in the binding of the phosphoinositides (Fig. 2A). Independent mutation of two of these few basic residues in aspartic acid (R386E and K387E) led to a PH domain that was no longer localized at the plasma membrane as observed by confocal microscopy analysis (Fig. 2B). This result suggested that EFA6-PH localizes at the plasma membrane by interacting with phosphoinositides. Given that EFA6 acts on endocytosis and actin reorganization (17Franco M. Peters P.J. Boretto J. van Donselaar E. Neri A. D'Souza-Schorey C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1480-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 31Luton F. Klein S. Chauvin J.P. Le Bivic A. Bourgoin S. Franco M. Chardin P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1134-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the PI(4,5)P2 plays a key role in both processes (32Di Paolo G. De Camilli P. Nature. 2006; 443: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar), we asked whether EFA6-PH could bind specifically to the PI(4,5)P2. We reasoned that if the PI(4,5)P2 recruited the EFA6-PH domain to the plasma membrane, a PI(4,5)P2 breakdown would lead to the appearance of the protein in the cytosol. It had been reported that treatment of the cells with ionomycin in the presence of millimolar external calcium results in the activation of PLC isozymes (33Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). This PLC activation leads to a massive hydrolysis of the PI(4,5)P2. We observed that ionomycin treatment of the cells solubilized the PLCδ-PH used as a model for PI(4,5)P2-specific binding PH domain (34Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, a very similar effect was observed on EFA6-PH localization, indicating that EFA6-PH binds to PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 2B). We then tested if the PI(4,5)P2 breakdown could also affect the localization of the full-length EFA6. Indeed, a few minutes after the addition of ionomycin, EFA6 fused to GFP was mostly found in the cytosol, indicating that the PI(4,5)P2 was necessary to localize EFA6 at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C). This process was reversible as subsequent chelation of external Ca2+ by EGTA led to the reappearance of the protein at the plasma membrane (not shown). These results suggest that the interaction between the PH domain and the PI(4,5)P2 is critical for the plasma membrane localization of EFA6. The EFA6-PH Domain Interacts Strongly and Specifically with the PI(4,5)P2—To confirm a specific and direct interaction between EFA6 and PI(4,5)P2, we tested in vitro the effect of the addition of phospholipid vesicles of different compositions on the nucleotide exchange activity of EFA6 on Arf6. As shown in Fig. 3A, we observed that the addition of 2% PI(4,5)P2 into the lipid vesicles strongly increased the EFA6-catalyzed activation of Arf6. EFA6 was about three times less active when PI(4,5)P2 was replaced by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate or PI (Fig. 3A). Then we tested the effect of the addition of PI(3,4,5)P3 and measured about the same EFA6 activity as that in the presence of PI(4,5)P2. This suggests that in addition to PI(4,5)P2, EFA6 could be activated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. However, we observed that in quiescent (serum-starved) BHK cells, the PI(3,4,5)P3-specific PH domains of Akt and of the two glycine version of Arno are cytosolic in contrast to EFA6-PH domain (data not shown). This suggests that the PI(3,4,5)P3 level is very low in BHK cells. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin did not modify the plasma membrane localization of the EFA6-PH domain (data not shown). Moreover, even in stimulated cells, PI(4,5)P2 is more abundant than PI(3,4,5)P3 (35Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that PI(4,5)P2 recruits EFA6 to the plasma membrane where it activates Arf6. To demonstrate that the direct interaction between EFA6 and PI(4,5)P2 was mediated by the PH domain, we used purified GST fusion of EFA6-PH and pure lipid vesicles. In a set of surface plasmon resonance experiments, we observed that the EFA6-PH domain bound strongly to lipid layers containing 10% PI(4,5)P2, whereas it bound weakly to PI-containing vesicles (Fig. 3B). To quantify the affinity of the EFA6-PH/PI(4,5)P2 interaction, we performed the experiment at different PH domain concentrations (Fig. 3C). We calculated an apparent Kd of about 0.5 μm very similar to the one of the PLCδ-PH (0.2 μm) determined by the same approach (26Mortier E. Wuytens G. Leenaerts I. Hannes F. Heung M.Y. Degeest G.

https://openalex.org/W2051349302,"Overexpression in Escherichia coli of a tau (U) class glutathione transferase (GST) from maize (Zea mays L.), termed ZmGSTU1, caused a reduction in heme levels and an accumulation of porphyrin precursors. This disruption was highly specific, with the expression of the closely related ZmGSTU2 or other maize GSTs having little effect. Expression in E. coli of a series of chimeric ZmGSTU1/ZmGSTU2 proteins identified domains responsible for disrupting porphyrin metabolism. In addition to known heme precursors, expression of ZmGSTU1 led to the accumulation of a novel glutathione conjugate of harderoporphyrin(ogen) (2,7,12,18-tetramethyl-3-vinylporphyrin-8,13,17-tripropionic acid). Using the related protoporphyrinogen as a substrate, conjugation could be shown to occur on one vinyl group and was actively catalyzed by the ZmGSTU. In plant transgenesis studies, the ZmGSTUs did not perturb porphyrin metabolism when expressed in the cytosol of Arabidopsis or tobacco. However, expression of a ZmGSTU1-ZmGSTU2 chimera in the chloroplasts of tobacco resulted in the accumulation of the harderoporphyrin(ogen)-glutathione conjugate observed in the expression studies in bacteria. Our results show that the well known ability of GSTs to act as ligand binding (ligandin) proteins of porphyrins in vitro results in highly specific interactions with porphyrinogen intermediates, which can be demonstrated in both plants and bacteria in vivo."

TRPM6 and its closest homologue, TRPM7, both combine a cation channel with an α-kinase domain. However, the role of this α-kinase domain in TRPM6 channel activity remains elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of TRPM6 channel activity by intracellular ATP and the involvement of its α-kinase domain. We demonstrated that intracellular Na- and Mg-ATP decreased the TRPM6 current in HEK293 cells heterogeneously expressing the channel, whereas Na-CTP or Na-GTP had no effect on channel activity. Whole cell recordings in TRPM6-expressing HEK293 cells showed that deletion of the α-kinase domain prevented the inhibitory effect of intracellular ATP without abrogating channel activity. Mutation of the conserved putative ATP-binding motif GXG(A)XXG (G1955D) in the α-kinase domain of TRPM6 inhibited the ATP action, whereas this effect remained preserved in the TRPM6 phosphotransferase-deficient mutant K1804R. Mutation of the TRPM6 autophosphorylation site, Thr1851, into either an alanine or an aspartate, resulted in functional channels that could still be inhibited by ATP.

Although the physiological activation mechanism of TRPM6 remains unknown, there is evidence of a constitutive activity in heterologous expression systems. TRPM6 displays a nonselective cation current conducted by divalent ions inwardly and monovalent ions outwardly and exhibits a steep outwardly rectifying current-voltage relation (12Voets T. Nilius B.

A recent study reported that epidermal growth factor hormone acts as an autocrine/paracrine magnesiotropic hormone, specifically stimulating TRPM6 current via engagement of its receptor at the basolateral membrane of distal convoluted tubule cells (13Groenestege W.M.

Subsequent studies reported critical amino acids in the pore regions of TRPM7 (Glu1047/Glu1052) and TRPM6 (Glu1024/Glu1029) that play a role in Mg2+ and pH sensitivity (17Li M. Du J. Jiang J.

The functional α-kinase domain at the carboxyl terminus of TRPM7 has been structurally characterized by x-ray crystallography (4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In contrast to the classical kinases, the α-kinase domain displays unique features including a zinc finger domain as well as a region involved in the catalysis of ATP-triggered reactions (18Ryazanov A.G. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R43-R45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this information, the role of intracellular ATP on the regulation of channel activity remains controversial (19Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. Biophys.

The current consensus is that ATP acts as an intracellular Mg2+ chelator, which decreases the concentration of intracellular free Mg2+, resulting in increased TRPM7-mediated conductance (19Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 922-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gwanyanya A. Sipido K. Vereecke J. Mubagwa K. Am. J.

These observations were challenged by a study demonstrating that both Mg2+ and Mg2+-nucleotides act in synergy to inhibit TRPM7 activity via two distinct binding sites located within the carboxyl terminus (22Demeuse P. Penner R. Fleig A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Another debated aspect concerns the role of the α-kinase in modulation of channel activity. Some studies reported that phosphotransferase-deficient TRPM7 mutants showed a reduced sensitivity for intracellular Mg2+ (11Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R.

Yue L. Clapham D.E. Science. 2001; 291: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), whereas others found that TRPM7 lacking the α-kinase domain displayed similar Mg2+ sensitivity compared with the wild-type channel (24Matsushita M. Kozak J.A. Shimizu Y. McLachlin D.T. Yamaguchi H. Wei F.Y. Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Chait B.T. Cahalan M.D. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20793-20803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast to the TRPM7 α-kinase domain little is known about the TRPM6 α-kinase domain. Recently, TRPM6 activity has been shown to be controlled by RACK1 via its interaction with the α-kinase (25Cao G. Thebault S. van der Wijst J. van der Kemp A. Lasonder E. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 168-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An additional study reported that the α-kinase of TRPM6 is capable of cross-phosphorylation of TRPM7 but not vice versa, underlying the functional nonredundancy of these two chanzymes (26Schmitz C.

(27Li M. Jiang J. Yue L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TRPM6, TRPM7, and TRPM6/7 are three distinct ion channels that exhibit different functional characteristics, thereby showing unequivocally that TRPM6 can form by itself functional channels without TRPM7 co-expression. Although the previously reported data suggested that the ATP effect on TRPM7 is independent of α-kinase activity, there are no potential domains identified outside of the α-kinase domain mediating a direct interaction with ATP. Notably, renal distal convoluted tubule cells contain a large number of mitochondria per unit length of any cell along the nephron, underling a dynamic capacity of intracellular ATP (28Madsen K.M. V. J. Tisher C.C. J. Electron. Microsc. Tech. 1988; 9: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Given the predominant expression pattern of TRPM6 in the distal convoluted tubule (12Voets T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism of ATP-regulated TRPM6 channel activity was investigated. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio Whittaker-Europe, Verviers, Belgium) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 μg/ml ciproxin at 37 °C in a humidity-controlled incubator with 5% (v/v) CO2. The cells were transiently transfected with the respective constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), as described previously (29Trouet D. Nilius B. Voets T. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and electrophysiological recordings were performed 48 h after transfection. The transfected cells were identified by their green fluorescence when illuminated at 480 nm. Nontransfected (GFP-negative) cells from the same batch were used as controls. DNA Constructs—The bicistronic expression vector pCINeo-IRES-GFP containing the full-length cDNA of aminoterminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human TRPM6 (GenBank™ accession number NM_017662, 1 μg of plasmid DNA/million cells (12Voets T.

Δkinase (L1749X), ATP-TRPM6 (G1955D), TRPM6 phosphotransferase-deficient (K1804R and D1933A), TRPM6-T1851A (T1851A) and TRPM6-T1851D (T1851D) were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following mutagenesis, the mutated pCINeo-IRES-GFP-hTRPM6 constructs were digested with EcoRI, resulting in a ∼1-kb fragment containing the mutation that was subcloned with its corresponding region in the original pCINeo-IRES-GFP-hTRPM6 construct. The wild-type α-kinase domain of TRPM6 as well as the G1955D mutants were subcloned in GST vectors using PCR. All of the constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. The primer sequences used are: Δkinase (forward, 5′-gaggagagttccccttaaaaccttgataaaagc-3′; backward, 5′-gcttttatcaaggttttaaggggaactctcctc-3′), K1804R (forward, 5′-ggacaagttttcattgtcaggtcctttcttcctgaggtt-3′; backward, 5′-aacctcaggaagaaaggacctgacaatgaaaacttgtcc-3′), D1933A (forward, 5′-gagaaaatttgacagctccatctgttataaaac-3′; backward, 5′-gttttataacagatggagctgtcaaattttctc-3′), T1851(A/D) (forward, 5′-ccaagtgaaaccacaagccataccctacacacc-3′; backward, 5′-ggtgtgtagggtatggcttgtggtttcacttgg-3′), and ATP-TRPM6 (forward, 5′-ggaccggccaatttggacgaagatgcaattaga-3′; backward, 5′-tctaattgcatcttcgtccaaattggccggtcc-3′). Electrophysiology and Solutions—Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight seal whole cell configuration at room temperature (20–25 °C) using an EPC-10 patch clamp amplifier computer controlled by PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes had resistances between 2 and 5 mΩ after filling with the standard intracellular solution. The cells were held at 0 mV, and voltage ramps of 200-ms duration ranging from –100 to +100 mV were applied every 2 s. Extracting the current amplitudes at –80 and +80 mV from individual ramp current records assessed the temporal development of membrane currents. Current densities were obtained by normalizing the current amplitude to the cell membrane capacitance. The extracellular solutions contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm CaCl2 (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH). The standard pipette solution contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na-EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES (titrated to pH 7.2 with NaOH). In experiments testing nucleotide effect, intracellular solutions were supplemented with Na-ATP, Mg-ATP, Na-GTP, or Na-CTP as indicated in the legends. In some experiments, Na-EDTA was replaced by Na-HEDTA (10 mm). CaBuf software (by G. Droogmans, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) was used to estimate the free Mg2+ concentration. The osmolarity of the solutions was adjusted to ∼310 mOsm/kg with mannitol. All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Immunoblotting—72 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were lysed, and protein samples were denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in Laemmli buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE (50 μg/lane). Immunoblots were incubated with the mouse anti-HA (Sigma) antibody. Subsequently, the blots were incubated with sheep horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and then visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—72 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were lysed for 1 h on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 adjusted by NaOH, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 including the protease inhibitors leupeptin (0.01 mg/ml), pepstatin (0.05 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)). After centrifugation of the lysates, supernatants were incubated with anti-HA antibody immobilized on protein A-agarose beads (Kem-En-Tec A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) for 3 h at room temperature. Following three washing steps with lysis buffer, the beads were incubated in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted by KOH, 4 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 μm ATP) and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. After 30 min of TRPM6 phosphorylation the reaction was terminated by three washing steps with phosphorylation washing buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted by KOH, 4 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2). Phosphorylation was analyzed after gel electrophoresis by autoradiography. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-fused proteins were expressed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). To purify the GST fusion proteins, the cell pellets were lysed in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 adjusted by NaOH, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme including the protease inhibitors leupeptin (0.01 mg/ml), pepstatin (0.05 mg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)) for 40 min and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was added directly to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for purification. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and detected by Coomassie staining. ATP Binding Assay—GST and GST-kinase fusion proteins were purified as described above, and subsequently ∼100 ng was incubated with 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 μl of ATP binding buffer (45 mm HEPES (13Groenestege W.M. Thebault S. van der Wijst J. van den Berg D. Janssen R. Tejpar S. van den Heuvel L.P. van Cutsem E. Hoenderop J.G. Knoers N.V. Bindels R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2260-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), 10 mm EDTA, 0.9 mm EGTA, 0.14 mm KCl, 9% v/v glycerol, 0.018% v/v Nonidet P-40, and 0.12 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C. After three wash steps with ATP binding buffer in the absence of [γ-32P]ATP, the samples were analyzed by scintillation counting. Sequence Analysis and Structure Modeling—A structural model of the TRPM6 α-kinase domain was built based on the crystal structure of the TRPM7 α-kinase domain (4Yamaguchi H. Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1047-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1IA9 (AMP·PNP complex)) using the WHAT IF/Yasara Twinset (31Krieger E. Koraimann G. Vriend G. Proteins. 2002; 47: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). The standard parameter settings were used. The sequence alignment and all other relevant modeling information is available online (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Data Analysis—In all experiments, the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In case of significance, differences between the means of two groups were analyzed by unpaired t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Effect of Intracellular ATP on TRPM6 Channel Activity—To investigate the functional properties of TRPM6, electrophysiological measurements were performed on transiently transfected HEK293 cells expressing HA-TRPM6. These cells developed large whole cell currents that reached their maximal amplitude (260 ± 30 and –10 ± 1.5 pA/pF at +80 and –80 mV, respectively) within a 200-s time period. These currents were not observed in mock transfected cells (Fig. 1A). TRPM6 displayed a characteristic outwardly rectifying current-voltage relation (Fig. 1B). Moreover, as already described (12Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), outwardly rectifying currents were also observed in mock transfected HEK293 cells dialyzed with a Mg2+-free pipette solution (containing 10 mm EDTA). However, when compared with TRPM6-transfected cells, these currents developed over a longer time period and reached maximal amplitudes that are ∼10 times smaller (Fig. 1A). Next, in the presence of 10 mm Na-ATP and no added Mg2+ in the patch pipette solution, TRPM6 currents activated slowly and reached its maximal amplitude after 200 s (Fig. 1, C and D, 102 ± 25 and –5.9 ± 1.5 pA/pF at +80 and –80 mV, respectively). This maximal amplitude was 2.5-fold reduced in comparison with the wild-type current. Perfusion of higher Na-ATP concentrations (12 mm) abrogated its development (Fig. 1, C and D). Because ATP is well known to sequester free intracellular Mg2+ (32Wang M. Tashiro M. Berlin J.R. J. Physiol. 2004; 555: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it was essential to determine whether the inhibitory Na-ATP effect results from Mg2+ buffering or from direct inhibition of channel activity. Considering that TRPM6 is inhibited by increased intracellular Mg2+ levels (12Voets T. Nilius B. Hoefs S. van der Kemp A.W. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), the inhibitory effect of ATP cannot be due to its Mg2+ chelator property. However, to clarify this point, we performed the experiments in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, a strong Mg2+ chelator (free [Mg2+]i, ∼0 mm as calculated with CaBuf program). Importantly, the addition of Na-ATP (2 mm) in the presence of 10 mm EDTA significantly reduced the TRPM6-mediated current at both +80 and –80 mV (Fig. 1, E and F, –46 ± 6% and –53 ± 2%, respectively, p < 0.05, n = 17–22 cells). Furthermore, replacing EDTA with HEDTA in the patch pipette solution did not affect TRPM6 activity (supplemental Fig. S3). As summarized in Fig. 1G, after breaking the membrane (0 s), TRPM6 current amplitude was increased in the presence of EDTA compared with Na-ATP. In the presence of 10 mm EDTA, the addition of either 2 mm Na-ATP 10 mm Na-ATP or 12 mm Na-ATP in the patch pipette reduced TRPM6 current development in comparison with recordings with only 10 mm EDTA. These data indicate that free ATP inhibits TRPM6 activity independently of the intracellular Mg2+ concentration. To further confirm this hypothesis, we substituted Na-ATP with Mg-ATP, a physiological form of ATP in the patch pipette solution. In these experiments the intracellular Mg2+ concentration was clamped at micromolar concentrations with 10 mm EDTA. Our data showed that Na-ATP and Mg-ATP inhibit TRPM6 currents in a similar dose-dependent manner with a comparable IC50 of ∼1.3 mm (Fig. 1H). Specificity and Reversibility of the ATP Effect on TRPM6—To evaluate the specificity of intracellular ATP on TRPM6 activity, TRPM6-transfected HEK293 cells were perfused with Na+-nucleotide trisphosphates. Neither Na-GTP nor Na-CTP was able to affect the TRPM6 current compared with the nucleotide-free controls, whereas Na-ATP inhibited the current at +80 and –80 mV (Fig. 2). Na+-nucleotides trisphosphates did not affect the current in mock transfected cells. Relevance of the α-Kinase Domain for TRPM6 Channel Activity—To investigate the role of α-kinase domain in the inhibitory ATP effect, the α-kinase domain was truncated by introducing a stop codon at position 1749 (Δkinase; see Fig. 4A). This Δkinase mutant was subsequently analyzed for its auto-phosphorylation activity. In vitro phosphorylation experiments revealed that truncation of the α-kinase domain abolished kinase activity in contrast to the wild-type channel (Fig. 3A, top panel). Immunoblot analysis indicated equal expression of both TRPM6 and Δkinase (Fig. 3A, lower panel). Next, the Δkinase mutant was functionally characterized and its sensitivity to Na-ATP was studied. HEK293 cells expressing Δkinase displayed currents with lower amplitude compared with the wild-type channel at both +80 and –80 mV (55 ± 14% of the wild type remained, p < 0.05, n = 16–19 cells) but with similar activation kinetics (Fig. 3, B and C). The current-voltage relation of Δkinase is comparable with wild-type TRPM6 (Figs. 1B and 3F). Na-ATP (2 mm) did not affect either the current amplitude at 200 s (Fig. 3, D and E) or the current-voltage relation of the Δkinase mutant (Fig. 3F), indicating the importance of the α-kinase in the inhibitory ATP effect. Subsequently, the role of this domain was studied by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4A). First, based on sequence homology, the mutations rendering TRPM7 phosphotransferase-deficient (K1648A and D1775A (11Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar)) were introduced in TRPM6 (positions 1804 and 1933 for K1804R and D1933A, respectively). Second, the Thr1851 that has been recently identified as an autophosphorylated amino acid residue within the α-kinase (25Cao G. Thebault S. van der Wijst J. van der Kemp A. Lasonder E. Bindels R.J. Hoenderop J.G. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 168-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was either point-mutated into an alanine, resulting in a putative nonphosphorylated mutant (T1851A) or into an aspartate, mimicking a constitutive auto-phosphorylated mutant (T1851D). Using in vitro phosphorylation experiments, the phosphotransferase-deficient mutants, D1933A and K1804R showed an abolished α-kinase activity in contrast to the wild-type channel (Fig. 4B, top panel). Furthermore, the T1851A and T1851D mutants exhibited reduced auto-phosphorylation in comparison with the wild-type channel (Fig. 4B, top panel). Immunoblot analysis indicated comparable expression of the (mutated) TRPM6 proteins (Fig. 4B, bottom panels). Next, all of the mutants were functionally characterized in whole cell recordings. HEK293 cells expressing the phosphotransferase-deficient mutant K1804R exhibited current amplitudes similar to the wild-type channel, whereas the phosphotransferase-deficient D1933A mutant had no activity (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition, both T1851A (nonphosphorylated) and T1851D (constitutively phosphorylated) mutants resulted in active channels with comparable current amplitudes as wild-type TRPM6 (Fig. 4, C and D). Subsequently, Na-ATP was tested on the functional TRPM6 mutants. Na-ATP perfusion reduced both inward and outward K1804R-, T1851A-, and T1851D-mediated currents (37 ± 4, 36 ± 7, and 55 ± 6% of the current remained at +80 mV, respectively; Fig. 5, A–F). No effect of Na-ATP was observed on the current-voltage relations (Fig. 5, G–I).FIGURE 3Effect of ATP on TRPM6 Δ kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2089115715,"Allele-specific gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) is therapeutically useful for specifically inhibiting the expression of disease-associated alleles without suppressing the expression of corresponding wild-type alleles. To realize such allele-specific RNAi (ASP-RNAi), the design and assessment of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes conferring ASP-RNAi is vital; however, it is also difficult. In a previous study, we developed an assay system to assess ASP-RNAi with mutant and wild-type reporter alleles encoding the Photinus and Renilla luciferase genes. In line with experiments using the system, we realized that it is necessary and important to enhance allele discrimination between mutant and corresponding wild-type alleles. Here, we describe the improvement of ASP-RNAi against mutant alleles carrying single nucleotide variations by introducing base substitutions into siRNA sequences, where original variations are present in the central position. Artificially mismatched siRNAs or short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against mutant alleles of the human Prion Protein (PRNP) gene, which appear to be associated with susceptibility to prion diseases, were examined using this assessment system. The data indicates that introduction of a one-base mismatch into the siRNAs and shRNAs was able to enhance discrimination between the mutant and wild-type alleles. Interestingly, the introduced mismatches that conferred marked improvement in ASP-RNAi, appeared to be largely present in the guide siRNA elements, corresponding to the ‘seed region’ of microRNAs. Due to the essential role of the ‘seed region’ of microRNAs in their association with target RNAs, it is conceivable that disruption of the base-pairing interactions in the corresponding seed region, as well as the central position (involved in cleavage of target RNAs), of guide siRNA elements could influence allele discrimination. In addition, we also suggest that nucleotide mismatches at the 3′-ends of sense-strand siRNA elements, which possibly increase the assembly of antisense-strand (guide) siRNAs into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), may enhance ASP-RNAi in the case of inert siRNA duplexes. Therefore, the data presented here suggest that structural modification of functional portions of an siRNA duplex by base substitution could greatly influence allele discrimination and gene silencing, thereby contributing to enhancement of ASP-RNAi."

Site-directed mutations at the glycan sites impaired the cell surface localization of Opalin.

GeneChip microarray analysis showed that the rat homologue is up-regulated during the differentiation of oligodendrocyte cultures (27Dugas J.C. Tai Y.C. Speed T.P. Ngai J. Barres B.A. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10967-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our previous study also indicated that Opalin gene expression specific to oligodendrocytes is regulated, at least in part, by intronic enhancer elements including the binding sites for myelin transcription factor 1 and cAMP-response element-binding protein (24Aruga J. Yoshikawa F. Nozaki Y. Sakaki Y. Toyoda A. Furuichi T. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1533-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These previous studies suggested that Opalin protein plays a unique role in mammalian myelin. However, the structure and function of Opalin protein and its expression in the brain have been largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the structural features, developmental expression, and cellular localization of mouse Opalin. We showed that the level of Opalin was drastically increased at the postnatal myelination stage and that it predominantly distributes throughout the myelin-rich regions of the CNS, but not the PNS of mice. Opalin is a type 1 transmembrane protein consisting of a short N-terminal extracellular domain and a long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The native myelin Opalin contained large glycan moieties in the N-terminal domain. We identified two Asn residues for N-glycosylation and one Thr residue for O-glycosylation by enzymatic deglycosylation and site-directed amino acid substitution experiments. Interestingly, the O-glycans, at least, contained negatively charged sialic acids. Heterologous expression of mutated Opalin lacking these glycans suggested that glycosylation is required for the specific cell surface localization of Opalin. Moreover, we demonstrated that Opalin is specifically localized to the membranes of paranodal and inner loops. Our study suggests a role of the sialylglyco-transmembrane protein Opalin in an inter-membranous function of the paranodal loops of mammalian CNS myelin. Animals—Mice (ICR and C57BL/6J), rabbits (New Zealand White), and rats (Wistar) were purchased from Nihon SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) and used according to protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of RIKEN and the Iwate Medical University. Cloning and Sequencing of Opalin cDNA—The first clone (clone ID number CD02046, see the CDT-DB; DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number BP428301) was isolated by fluorescent differential display analysis of the cerebellar transcriptome of mice during the postnatal developmental stages, as described in a previous study (28Shiraishi Y. Mizutani A. Bito H. Fujisawa K. Narumiya S. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8389-8400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length Opalin cDNAs were cloned by screening full-length cDNA libraries, generated from poly(A)+ mRNAs isolated from mouse cerebella at P21 using the oligo-capping method (29Suzuki Y. Yoshitomo-Nakagawa K. Maruyama K. Suyam A. Sugano S. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 200: 149-156Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar), for sequence homology to clone CD02046. The full-length cDNA sequence was determined using the dideoxynucleotide termination method with a DNA sequencer (ABI 3730xl, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Opalin cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pEGFP-N3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) to generate site-directed glycosylation mutants and C-terminal epidermal growth factor protein fusion constructs, respectively. Venus, a YFP derivative (30Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar), was used to study the expression of Opalin in primary oligodendrocyte cultures. Site-directed mutagenesis of Opalin was performed by means of a two-step PCR, as described previously (31Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—cDNAs were prepared from total RNAs obtained from mouse cerebella at embryonic day 18 and postnatal days (P)0, P3, P7, P12, P21, and P56, to analyze expression patterns during postnatal cerebellar development, and from whole brain, thymus, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and testis at P21, to analyze tissue distribution patterns. PCRs were performed in a PCR system (GeneAmp PCR system 9700, ABI). The forward and reverse primers used for the amplification of each gene were: Opalin, 5′-CTGCCTCTCACTCAACATCA-3′ and 5′-GCTGGATCAAAGTAAACAGC-3′, respectively; PLP/DM20, 5′-GGCAGATCTTTGGCGACTAC-3′ and 5′-AGCATTCCATGGGAGAACAC-3′, respectively; MBP, 5′-CTTCGCCACAATAACGTGAG-3′ and 5′-TGCTTCTGTCCAGCCATACT-3′, respectively; myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), 5′-GCAGGTCTCTGTAGGCCTTG-3′ and 5′-CAGTTGAGGGAGGGAAATCA-3′, respectively; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GCCATCAACGACCCCTTCATTGACCTC-3′ and 5′-GCCATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′, respectively. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization brain histochemistry was performed as described in previous studies (32Sadakata T. Mizoguchi A. Sato Y. Katoh-Semba R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Huang J. Sakai R. Furuichi T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3187-3196Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Paraffin sections (6 μm) through P21 mouse brains were hybridized with 2 μg/ml Opalin riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Diagnostics) at 60 °C overnight, and hybridization signals were detected using a digoxygenin detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). Antibodies—An anti-mouse Opalin antibody was raised in female New Zealand White rabbits (Nihon-SLC) by subcutaneous injection of an antigenic synthetic peptide consisting of the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues (from amino acid 128 to 143, ERRRGLWWLVPSLSLE) of Opalin following an N-terminal Cys residue, which was used to conjugate this peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (catalog number H7017, Sigma). The Opalin antibody was purified by affinity chromatography on an antigenic peptide-coupled column (HiTrap NHS-activated HP column, catalog number 17-0716-01, GE Healthcare), and used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. The specificity of the anti-Opalin antibody was proven by a preabsorption test with the antigenic peptide, specific recognition of expressed recombinant proteins, and similarity in the developmental, cellular, and tissue distribution patterns between immunoreactive protein and mRNA (for example, Western blot patterns versus RT-PCR patterns; immunohistochemistry patterns versus in situ hybridization patterns). The following antibodies were also used: anti-calbindin D-28K (1:1000) (mouse monoclonal CB-955, catalog number C9848), anti-neurofilament 160 (1:500) (mouse monoclonal NN18, catalog number N-5264), and anti-pan voltage-dependent Na+ channel (1:250) (mouse monoclonal K58/35, catalog number S8809) from Sigma; anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (1:250) (mouse monoclonal, catalog number MAB1567), anti-O4 (1:200) (mouse monoclonal, catalog number MAB345), and anti-ZO-1 (1:250) (mouse monoclonal, catalog number MAB1520) from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); anti-MBP (1:1000) (rabbit polyclonal, catalog number 16141) from IBL (Gunma, Japan); anti-E-cadherin (1:250) (mouse monoclonal, catalog number C20820) from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); and anti-caspr (1:250) (mouse monoclonal) was a kind gift from Dr. E. Peles (34Poliak S. Gallan L. Martinez R. Custer A. Einheber S. Salzer J.L. Trimmer J.S. Shrager P. Peles E. Neuron. 1999; 24: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The secondary antibodies used in Western blot analyses were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:2000) (catalog number NA9340, GE Healthcare UK Ltd.) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:2000) (catalog number NA9310, GE Healthcare UK Ltd.). The secondary antibodies used in immunohistochemical analyses were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (1:1000) (catalog numbers A11029 and A11005, respectively; Molecular Probes). Subcellular Fractionation—Under deep anesthesia with diethyl ether, brains were dissected from the mice (ICR, Nihon-SLC) and homogenized in an ice-cold Teflon-glass Potter homogenizer containing 9 volumes (w/v) of homogenizing buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin)) as described previously (35Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 328-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain precipitate fraction 1 (ppt1). The supernatants were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain precipitate fractions 2 + 3 (ppt2 + 3), and the supernatant (sup3) was used as the cytosolic fraction. ppt1 and ppt2 + 3 were re-suspended in suspension buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture), and the protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The crude myelin fraction and pure myelin fraction were prepared essentially as described (36Norton W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse brains were homogenized with the Dounce homogenizer in 14 volumes (w/v) of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and protease inhibitor mixture (1× Complete, EDTA-free; Roche Diagnostics). The homogenates (15 ml) were layered over 20 ml of 0.85 m sucrose and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in a Beckman Coulter SW28 rotor and centrifuged for 30 min at 75,000 × g at 4 °C. The crude myelin layer at the interface of the two sucrose solution was collected (∼5 ml), resuspended with ice-cold deionized water to a final volume of 30 ml, and recentrifuged in a SW28 rotor at 75,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended and homogenized with the Dounce homogenizer in 40 ml of ice-cold deionized water, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 13 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet was again homogenized and recentrifuged at 12,000 × g as described above. The crude myelin membrane pellet was homogenized in 15 ml of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), layered over 20 ml of 0.85 m sucrose and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and centrifuged in a SW28 rotor at 75,000 × g as described above. The resultant pellet was again homogenized and recentrifuged in a SW28 rotor as described above. The pure myelin membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and protease inhibitor mixture. Western Blot Analysis—Protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filter membranes (Hybond-ECL, catalog number RPN2020D, GE Healthcare) as described previously (35Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 328-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The blots were processed at room temperature by immersing for 1 h in blocking buffer consisting of 5% (w/v) skim milk (Snow Brand, Sapporo, Japan) in 1× PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS-T), then exposing them to primary antibody in PBS-T for 1 h, and, finally, exposing them to HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing with PBS-T, bound antibody was detected using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagent (catalog number RPN2106, GE Healthcare) and x-ray film (MXJB Film, catalog number 864–8651, Eastman Kodak). Immunohistochemistry—C57BL/6J mice (Nihon SLC) anesthetized with diethyl ether were transcardially perfused with PBS and then with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Their brains were dissected out, postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h, and cryoprotected by immersion in 15% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After embedding in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan), the brains were frozen in dry ice powder and cut into 10–16 μm sagittal sections at –18 °C using a cryostat (CM1850; Leica Microsystems). The sections were then air-dried for 1 h, rinsed three times in PBS, and treated with methanol at –20 °C for 20 min followed by three washes with PBS at 4 °C for 10 min each. After blocking with 10% normal donkey serum (catalog number D9663, Sigma) in 0.2% Triton X-100 and PBS, the sections were reacted with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, then rinsed in 0.2% Triton and PBS, and allowed to react with Alexa Fluor- or HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in 5% serum, 0.2% Triton, and PBS at room temperature for 1 h, before being rinsed again in PBS. To visualize actin filaments, sections were also stained with Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin (1:50 dilution, catalog number A22287, Invitrogen). Immunostained sections were mounted using Vectorshield mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and examined using an epifluorescence microscope (Eclipse E800; Nikon) equipped with a cooled CCD camera (Spot; Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI), or a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software. Electron Microscopy—Immunogold electron microscopy of sections stained with anti-Opalin antibody was carried out essentially as described previously (37Akagi T. Ishida K. Hanasaka T. Hayashi S. Watanabe M. Hashikawa T. Tohyama K. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 153: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the optic nerves of two-week-old ICR mice (Nihon SLC) were fixed with PLP fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 10 mm sodium periodate, 7.5 mm lysine-HCl, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and then infused with 20% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 1.8 m sucrose in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7 h at room temperature, then overnight at 4 °C. The infused specimens were frozen at –185 °C in a rapid-freezing apparatus (KF-80, Leica) and cut on an ultramicrotome (UCT or UC6, Leica) equipped with a cryo-attachment (FCS or FC6, Leica). The resulting ultrathin sections were mounted on carbon-coated grids according to methods described previously (38Tokuyasu K.T. Histochem. J. 1989; 21: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar); after immunoreacting sections with 1 μg/ml anti-Opalin antibody for 24 h at 4 °C, they were incubated with colloidal gold (5 nm)-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at room temperature (37Akagi T. Ishida K. Hanasaka T. Hayashi S. Watanabe M. Hashikawa T. Tohyama K. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 153: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Immunogold-labeled sections were examined using an electron microscope (H-7100 or H-7650, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Enzymatic Deglycosylation—Protein samples were incubated in 1% SDS, 144 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture at 37 °C for 30 min before treatment with glycosidase(s) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.5% Non-idet P-40, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the protease inhibitor mixture as follows. N-Glycosidase F (from Flavobacterium meningosepticum), O-Glycosidase (from Diplococcus pneumoniae), and neuraminidase (from Arthrobacter ureafaciens) were purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmbH. Deglycosylation was performed essentially according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. N-Linked glycans were removed by treatment with 30 units/ml N-glycosidase F overnight at 37 °C. O-Linked glycans were removed by incubation with 20 milliunits/ml O-glycosidase, overnight at 37 °C. Sialic acids were removed by incubation with 0.4 units/ml neuraminidase overnight at 37 °C. To remove all of these glycans, proteins were treated with 30 units/ml N-glycosidase F, 20 milliunits/ml O-glycosidase, and 0.4 units/ml neuraminidase overnight at 37 °C. Each of these reactions was performed in sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.2). In Vitro Transcription/Translation—In vitro transcription/translation of Opalin was performed using TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Cell Culture and Transfection—Transfection of COS7, HeLa, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was carried out using Lipofectoamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), essentially as described in a previous report (32Sadakata T. Mizoguchi A. Sato Y. Katoh-Semba R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Primary cultures of oligodendrocytes were prepared from embryonic rat cerebra, essentially as described previously (39Itoh K. Brain Res. Prot. 2002; 10: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Opalin Expression Is Up-regulated in White Matter-rich Regions during Postnatal Mouse Brain Development—The cloned mouse Opalin full-length cDNA comprises 892 nucleotide residues with an open reading frame of 143 amino acids (aa) (calculated molecular mass = ∼15,833 Da, pI = 4.88) (Fig. 1A). The predicted Opalin protein has a transmembrane domain (31–53 aa) flanked by a short N-terminal domain (1–30 aa) with two N-linked glycosylation consensus sites (Asn-6 and Asn-12), and a long C-terminal domain (54–143 aa) with six consensus sites for protein phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). A DNA data base search indicated that Opalin is identical to the gene-encoding transmembrane protein 10 (Tmem10), and that homologues are present only in mammals (24Aruga J. Yoshikawa F. Nozaki Y. Sakaki Y. Toyoda A. Furuichi T. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1533-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Opalin in all eight mammalian species analyzed (mouse, rat, pig, cattle, dog, orangutan, chimpanzee, and human) was evolutionarily well conserved, especially the two N-linked glycosylation sites and the putative transmembrane domain, although there was a mouse-specific insertion (Asp-66 in mouse Opalin) and a primate-specific deletion (Ser/Gly-21 in non-primate Opalin) (supplemental Fig. S1). Developmental expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that the level of Opalin mRNA increased steeply after the first postnatal week in mouse cerebellum, comparable with the expression profile of the myelin-related genes PLP/DM20, MBP, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (Fig. 1B). Tissue expression analysis by RT-PCR indicated that Opalin mRNA was selectively expressed in the mouse brain at P21, and not expressed in any of the other tissues tested (thymus, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and testis) (Fig. 1C). In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Opalin mRNA was predominantly expressed in white matter-rich regions of P21 mouse brains, including the optic chiasm, corpus callosum, fornix, anterior commissure, and cerebellar white matter layer (Fig. 1D). The cellular localization pattern of mouse Opalin mRNA in P21 brains was similar to that in P56 brains registered in the Allen Brain Atlas in situ hybridization data base. Opalin Is Specifically Localized in CNS Myelin—To examine the expression of mouse Opalin protein in the nervous system, we generated an in situ hybridization specificity, se"
https://openalex.org/W2168801918,"The vacuolar (H+)-ATPases (V-ATPases) are ATP-dependent proton pumps that operate by a rotary mechanism in which ATP hydrolysis drives rotation of a ring of proteolipid subunits relative to subunit a within the integral V(0) domain. In vivo dissociation of the V-ATPase (an important regulatory mechanism) generates a V(0) domain that does not passively conduct protons. EM analysis indicates that the N-terminal domain of subunit a approaches the rotary subunits in free V(0), suggesting a possible mechanism of silencing passive proton transport. To test the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain inhibits passive proton flux by preventing rotation of the proteolipid ring in free V(0), factor Xa cleavage sites were introduced between the N- and C-terminal domains of subunit a (the Vph1p isoform in yeast) to allow its removal in vitro after isolation of vacuolar membranes. The mutant Vph1p gave rise to a partially uncoupled V-ATPase complex. Cleavage with factor Xa led to further loss of coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis. Removal of the N-terminal domain by cleavage with factor Xa and treatment with KNO3 and MgATP did not, however, lead to an increase in passive proton conductance by free V(0), suggesting that removal of the N-terminal domain is not sufficient to facilitate passive proton conductance through V(0). Photoactivated cross-linking using the cysteine reagent maleimido benzophenone and single cysteine mutants of subunit a demonstrated the proximity of specific sites within the N-terminal domain and subunits E and G of the peripheral stalk. These results suggest that a localized region of the N-terminal domain (residues 347-369) is important in anchoring the peripheral stator in V1V0."
https://openalex.org/W1968987187,"There is compelling evidence that G protein-coupled receptors exist as homo- and heterodimers, but the way these assemblies function at the molecular level remains unclear. We used here the purified leukotriene B(4) receptor BLT1 stabilized in its dimeric state to analyze how a receptor dimer activates G proteins. For this, we produced heterodimers between the wild-type BLT1 and a BLT1/ALXR chimera. The latter is no longer activated by leukotriene B(4) but is still activated by ALXR agonists. In this heterodimer, agonist binding to either one of the two protomers induced asymmetric conformational changes within the receptor dimer. Of importance, no G protein activation was observed when using a dimer where the ligand-loaded protomer was not able to trigger GDP/GTP exchange due to specific mutations in its third intracellular loop, establishing that the conformation of the agonist-free protomer is not competent for G protein activation. Taken together, these data indicate that although ligand binding to one protomer in the heterodimer is associated with cross-conformational changes, a trans-activation mechanism where the ligand-free subunit would trigger GDP/GTP exchange cannot be considered in this case for G protein activation. This observation sheds light into the way GPCR dimers, in particular heterodimers, could activate their cognate G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2090406070,"Abnormal amplification of centrosomes, which occurs frequently in cancers, leads to high frequencies of mitotic defect and chromosome segregation error, profoundly affecting the rate of tumor progression. Centrosome amplification results primarily from overduplication of centrosomes, and p53 is involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication partly through controlling the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2-cyclin E, a kinase complex critical for the initiation of centrosome duplication. Thus, loss or mutational inactivation of p53 leads to an increased frequency of centrosome amplification. Moreover, the status of cyclin E greatly influences the frequency of centrosome amplification in cells lacking functional p53. Here, we dissected the roles of CDK2-associating cyclins, namely cyclins E and A, in centrosome amplification in the p53-negative cells. We found that loss of cyclin E was readily compensated by cyclin A for triggering the initiation of centrosome duplication, and thus the centrosome duplication kinetics was not significantly altered in cyclin E-deficient cells. It has been shown that cells lacking functional p53, when arrested in either early S-phase or late G2 phase, continue to reduplicate centrosomes, resulting in centrosome amplification. In cells arrested in early S phase, cyclin E, but not cyclin A, is important in centrosome amplification, whereas in the absence of cyclin E, cyclin A is important for centrosome amplification. In late G2-arrested cells, cyclin A is important in centrosome amplification irrespective of the cyclin E status. These findings advance our understandings of the mechanisms underlying the numeral abnormality of centrosomes and consequential genomic instability associated with loss of p53 function and aberrant expression of cyclins E and A in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1969883652,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein, a critical modulator of cellular stress responses, is activated through diverse mechanisms that result in its stabilization and transcriptional activation. p53 activity is controlled by transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation. The major mechanisms of p53 regulation occur primarily through interactions with HDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that leads to p53 nuclear export and degradation. Here, we demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress elicits down-regulation of HDM2. c-Abl mediates down-regulation of HDM2, leading to an increase of p53 level. Moreover, Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5), a proline-directed Ser/Thr kinase, additionally increases p53 stability via post-translational modification of p53 in response to hydrogen peroxide. The p53 protein stabilized by c-Abl and Cdk5 is transcriptionally active; however, transcription of its target gene is differentially regulated with selective binding of p53 on promoter regions of its target genes by c-Abl. In addition, c-Abl modulates Cdk5 activity via phosphorylation of tyrosine 15 in cooperation with cleavage of p35 to p25. Our results show that c-Abl and Cdk5 cooperatively regulate maximal activation of p53, resulting in neuronal death in response to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide.

Upon a variety of stresses, p53 stability is increased and accumulates in the nucleus, where it is activated as a transcription factor, resulting in cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in many cell types, including neurons. The accumulation and activation of p53 largely relies on post-translational events, such as phosphorylation and acetylation (6Pluquet O. Hainaut P. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Bode A.M. Dong Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 793-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p53 at multiple sites increases p53 stability through uncoupling p53 from HDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylation-driven acetylation of p53 on C-terminal regions activates its binding on specific promoter regions, resulting in transcription-dependent apoptosis. E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HDM2 is also modulated by various cellular proteins via posttranslational modification, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination (8Dias S.S. Milne D.M. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6666-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the inhibitory activities of HDM2 are neutralized by the action of binding partners, such as ARF, MdmX, and deubiquitinase (HAUSP) (8Dias S.S. Milne D.M. Meek D.W.

Although accumulating evidence suggests the signaling pathway, resulting stabilization, and activation of p53, the mechanisms related to p53 activation still require further analysis. c-Abl, a member of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family, is a ubiquitously expressed protein that mediates cellular signals in response to stimuli. Because of its cellular homologue of the transforming element of Abelson murine leukemia virus, c-Abl has been studied in the context of oncogenesis, and its participation in neuronal functions has been recently discussed (10Jones S.B. Lu H.Y. Lu Q. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8510-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Moresco E.M. Koleske A.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). c-Abl has been implicated in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, through multiple protein-protein interactions and its tyrosine kinase activity (12Goldberg Z.

Upon exposure to stress, such as DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates and activates c-Abl, leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis. The apoptotic activity of c-Abl is mediated by p73, a member of the p53 family, and through a p53-dependent pathway. c-Abl phosphorylates p73 at the tyrosine residue and drives it to the nucleus, where p73 can activate p53-responsive genes and induce apoptosis (14Yang A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34475-34482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). c-Abl can also regulate the p53 protein levels, possibly by phosphorylating HDM2 and neutralizing the inhibitory effect of HDM2 on p53 (8Dias S.S.

Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5), a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, is regulated through association with its specific activator, including p35, p39, and p67. Ubiquitously expressed Cdk5 is mostly active in the central nervous system due to the selective localization of its activator proteins (16Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In addition to its regulatory roles in neuronal processes, such as neuronal differentiation, migration, axon outgrowth, and synaptogenesis (18Lee J.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Smith D.S. Greer P.L. Tsai L.H. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 277-283PubMed Google Scholar, 20Barclay J.W. Aldea M.

Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; 50: pe36Google Scholar, 22Cheung Z.H. Fu A.K. Ip N.Y. Neuron. 2006; 50: 13-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Abnormal activation of Cdk5 has detrimental effects on neurons, leading to apoptosis under either physiological or pathological conditions, suggesting a pivotal role of Cdk5 in the molecular events during the pathological progression (23Shelton S.B. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Exposure of neurons to various insults, like ischemia and oxidative stress, leads to hyperactivation of Cdk5 with consequent neuronal apoptosis. Although accumulating evidence suggests the essential role of Cdk5 in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis, the mechanisms by which active Cdk5 facilitates apoptosis remain to be established. Here, we provide conclusive molecular evidence to demonstrate the important role of cooperative action of c-Abl and Cdk5 on oxidative stress-induced cell death. c-Abl and Cdk5 cooperatively regulate the stability and activity of p53 and subsequently induce apoptotic cell death. HDM2 is down-regulated upon oxidative stress in a process requiring c-Abl, resulting in increased p53 stabilization. In addition, Cdk5 also efficiently stabilizes p53 via its phosphorylation of N-terminal regions. p53 stabilized by the action of c-Abl and Cdk5 is transcriptionally active; however, transcription of its target gene is differentially regulated through selective enhancement of p53 DNA binding. Moreover, we show that c-Abl cooperated with p25 formation to help activate Cdk5 via phosphorylation at tyrosine 15. Thus, the present findings define an important molecular mechanism of c-Abl- and Cdk5-mediated p53 stabilization and activation underlying apoptotic cell death induced by oxidative stress.

Cell Cultures and Transfection of cDNA and siRNA Experiments—Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum with 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The DsRed-p53(R175H) expression construct was generated by cloning into the EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites of the pDsRed1-C1 plasmid. A constitutively active form of c-Abl-PP and a dominant negative mutant of c-Abl(K290R) were kindly provided by Dr. Daniela Barilà (Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Rome, Italy). Transient transfection with siRNA targeting Cdk5, p53, and c-Abl (SMARTpool™ containing four pooled SMARTselected siRNA duplexes) or scrambled control siRNA and plasmids was carried out by using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The medium was changed with fresh medium 24 h after transfection, and then cells were collected for immunoblotting or treated with the indicated drugs for further experiments. Western Blotting and Cdk5 Kinase Assay—Cells were treated with the indicated drugs, washed with chilled PBS, and then lysed for 45 min on ice, using Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C until use. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the following procedures were performed as previously described (18Lee J.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, bands were visualized using the Western blot detection kit (Pohang, Korea). For the Cdk5 kinase assay, immunoprecipitated endogenous Cdk5 was mixed with 8 μg of histone H1 peptide as a substrate in kinase reaction buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 μm Na3VO4, 500 μm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min as described previously (24Harada T. Morooka T. Ogawa S. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and radioactivity was measured by autoradiography. Immunocytochemical Analysis—SH-SY5Y cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated with blocking solution (2.5% bovine serum albumin and 2.5% equine serum in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs. Slides were mounted and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Axioplan2; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Cell Viability Assay and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—To evaluate cell survival, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed with a modification (25Kubo T. Enokido Y. Yamada M. Oka T. Uchiyama Y. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1996; 733: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, cultures were incubated with a final concentration of 1 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tetrazolium salt at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of lysis buffer containing 20% SDS and 50% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.5; samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C; and absorbance was measured photometrically at 570 nm. Apoptotic cells were further visualized using the modified TUNEL assay offered by the DeadEnd colorimetric detection system (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For quantitative real time RT-PCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed by using the iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detection and quantification, the MyiQ™ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) was used. GAPDH mRNA served as a control for relative quantification. PCRs were performed using the iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad). PCR was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl using a 0.5 μm concentration of each primer, cDNA, and 10 μl of the supplied enzyme mixture containing the DNA double strand-specific SYBR Green I dye to detect PCR products. PCR was performed with a 3-min preincubation at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. PCR products were verified by melting curve analysis, agarose gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing. The following primers were used: GAPDH, forward (5′-GCCATCAATGACCCCTTCATT-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTCCTGGAAGATGGTGATGG-3′); p53, forward (5′-GAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGC-3′) and reverse (5′-GTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTCTGTCTTG-3′); BAX, forward (5′-AGAGGATGATTGCCGCCGTGGACAC-3′) and reverse (5′-CAACCACCCTGGTCTTGGATCCAGC-3′); HDM2, forward (5′-GCCATTGAACCTTGTGTGATTTGTC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAAATAAGTTAGCACAATCATTTG-3′). The relative value of gene expression was analyzed using the 2T−ΔΔC method (18Lee J.H. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 634-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—We performed a ChIP assay using a previously published method (26Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with drugs and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 20 min, nuclei were collected, and the chromatin were sonicated to an average length of 700 bp. Five percent of the total lysate was used as an “input DNA” control. The remaining sheared chromatin was precleared with protein G-Sepharose that was blocked previously with 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA and was used for immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of an affinity-purified monoclonal antibody against p53. Immunoprecipitated DNA was subjected to semiquantitative PCR with specific primers (HDM2, forward (5′-GGGAGTTCAGGGTAAAGGTCA-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTTTTACTGCAGTTTCG-3′); BAX, forward (5′-ACGTGACTGTCCAATGAGCATCTCC-3′) and reverse (5′-ACGTCCTGCCTGGAAGCATGCTATT-3′)) to amplify a fragment of the human HDM2 or BAX promoter region. Each PCR band was purified and verified by DNA sequence analysis. Statistical Analysis—All experiments, including the immunoblots and kinase assay, were independently repeated at least three times. All assays and blots presented are representative of more than three separate experiments. All quantitative data are presented as means ± S.D. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed via Student's t test, and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. p53 Stabilization Occurs Post-translationally via HDM2 Down-regulation in Response to H2O2 Treatment—To examine the contribution of p53 to oxidative stress-induced neuronal death, we examined the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a well known oxidative stress inducer, on cell viability and found that H2O2-induced oxidative stress caused both concentration- and time-dependent cell death in human neuroblastoma, SH-SY5Y cells supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, TUNEL assay and Hoechst staining showed morphological characteristics of apoptosis, such as DNA fragmentation and nuclei condensation caused by hydrogen peroxide supplemental Fig. 1C). Given the well known function of p53 in apoptotic cell death (1Culmsee C. Mattson M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 761-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we investigated whether p53 was essential for H2O2-induced neuronal death by suppressing its activity with dominant-negative p53(R175H). Dominant-negative p53(R175H) markedly decreased TUNEL staining, whereas ∼57% of the H2O2-treated control cells were TUNEL-positive supplemental Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained in Western blotting analysis showing that suppression of p53 expression with siRNA abrogated caspase-3 cleavage, which is involved in mechanisms of apoptotic signaling supplemental Fig. 1E). These results collectively suggest that p53 is an important cellular factor involved in oxidative stress-triggered neuronal death. To test the p53 response to oxidative stress, p53 protein levels were monitored by Western blot and immunocytochemical analysis. A significant induction of endogenous p53 was detected in SH-SY5Y cells when H2O2 was treated (Fig. 1A). Immunocytochemical analysis also showed that p53 is mainly accumulated specifically in the nuclear region supplemental Fig. 2A). Given that p53 regulation is largely dependent on the activity of HDM2, we also determined HDM2 expression. Compared with p53, hydrogen peroxide led to a rapid drop in the HDM2 protein level, which then increased again at later time points. To investigate whether protein expression of p53 and HDM2 was primarily induced by an increase of transcript levels, the mRNA transcript levels were determined by quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis. In contrast to the changes observed in protein expression, the p53 mRNA level remained unchanged, suggesting that the p53 increase is likely to occur post-translationally. HDM2 mRNA levels were not down-regulated at early times, suggesting that the decreased level is not the result of down-modulation of HDM2 mRNA. However, HDM2 transcript levels increased at later times, indicating that protein induction is possibly subsequent to the mRNA increase, in contrast to p53 transcript levels (Fig. 1B). HDM2 is a p53 target gene, so increased HDM2 mRNA at later times might be the result of p53 stabilization. To further examine whether p53 and HDM2 regulation occur at the post-translational level, we determined their degradation rates in the presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide when de novo protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide. The rate of p53 degradation significantly decreased in the presence of H2O2 compared with the vehicle, strongly suggesting that oxidative stress increases the p53 level by stabilization without transcriptional modulation. However, HDM2 levels significantly decreased in the presence of H2O2 compared with the vehicle, indicating that oxidative stress decreases the stability of the HDM2 protein (Fig. 1C). These results also support the notion that p53 stabilization upon oxidative stress is mediated by HDM2 down-regulation at least in the early response phase. We also investigated whether stabilization of p53 is related to the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. To explore the involvement of proteasomal pathway, p53 levels were measured following oxidative stress in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2B, the basal level of p53 was increased by pretreatment with MG132; however, its levels were not further up-regulated by hydrogen peroxide, indicating that the proteasome-dependent degradation machinery is responsible for the H2O2-mediated p53 stabilization. c-Abl Regulates Down-regulation of HDM2 and Subsequent p53 Stabilization—It has been recently reported that c-Abl phosphorylates HDM2 at tyrosine residues and is activated by oxidative stress (8Dias S.S. Milne D.M. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6666-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Goldberg Z. Vogt Sionov R. Berger M. Zwang Y. Perets R. Van Etten R.A. Oren M. Taya Y. Haupt Y.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 8085-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based upon these studies, we investigated how c-Abl acts in the down-regulation of HDM2 under oxidative stress, and we analyzed HDM2 stability in cells given STI571 prior to oxidative stress. Blockage of c-Abl activity with STI571 markedly inhibited the down-regulation of HDM2 triggered by hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2A). Consistently, down-regulation of c-Abl activity with the dominant negative c-Abl mutant c-Abl(K290R) or suppressed expression of c-Abl with siRNA showed similar inhibitory effects (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 3A). However, basal expression of HDM2 was not affected by c-Abl(K290R) and siRNA against c-Abl in the absence of H2O2. As a result, c-Abl inhibition with STI571 or suppression of c-Abl expression with siRNA also markedly blocked the oxidative stress-induced increase in p53 abundance, suggesting that stress-dependent destabilization of HDM2 might be important for p53 induction and that c-Abl mediates these activities (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 3B). It is important to note that p53 was not totally eliminated by c-Abl inhibition. Considerable amounts of p53 were still detected, suggesting that c-Abl is not the only factor capable of inducing p53 stabilization in response to oxidative stress. c-Abl Mediates Selective Transactivation of p53—The consequence of p53 stabilization is transcriptional activation (28Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Given that p53 enhances transcription of its target genes in response to cellular stress (29Morrison R.S. Kinoshita Y. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 868-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we investigated whether c-Abl could affect p53 transactivation in addition to its stabilization. We analyzed mRNA levels of p53 target genes, HDM2 and BAX, by quantitative real time RT-PCR. Oxidative stress triggered an increase in HDM2 and BAX transcript levels, whereas suppression of c-Abl expression with siRNA significantly impaired the induction of HDM2. However, mRNA levels of BAX were not affected by suppression of c-Abl, suggesting selective transcriptional activation of p53 by c-Abl (Fig. 3A). A recent study demonstrated that c-Abl selectively stimulate binding of p53 on the promoters of its target genes (30Wei G. Li A.G. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12271-12278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether c-Abl regulates specific DNA binding of p53 in vivo in response to oxidative stress, we performed a ChIP assay using promoters of HDM2 and BAX. An IgG was used as a negative control. As illustrated in Fig. 3B, cells treated with hydrogen peroxide yielded a strongly amplified product, indicating increased p53 binding to the HDM2 and BAX promoter regions. However, inhibition of c-Abl activity significantly reduced binding of p53 on the HDM2 promoter region but had no effect on p53 binding to the BAX promoter. These data imply that the p53 protein stabilized by oxidative stress is transcriptionally active; however transcription of its target gene is differentially regulated by c-Abl through selective enhancement of DNA binding of p53. Cdk5 Mediates Stabilization of p53 via Phosphorylation—We recently reported that Cdk5 increased p53 stabilization via N-terminal phosphorylation (31Lee J.H. Kim H.S. Lee S.J. Kim K.T. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2259-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In view of the finding that p53 was not totally eliminated by c-Abl inhibition (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. 3B), we investigated whether Cdk5 also mediates p53 stabilization upon H2O2 treatment. Down-regulation of Cdk5 activity with the Cdk2/5 inhibitor N4-(6-aminopyrimidin-4-yl)-sulfanilamide or suppressed expression of Cdk5 with siRNA showed similar inhibitory effects on p53 stabilization induced by oxidative stress (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 4A). However, basal expression of p53 was not affected by the Cdk2/5 inhibitor or siRNA against Cdk5 in the absence of H2O2. To further define p53 regulation by Cdk5, we determined the degradation rate of p53 in the presence or absence of the Cdk5 inhibitor when de novo protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide. Cellular extracts were prepared at different times after the cycloheximide addition, and the p53 level was determined by immunoblot analysis. The blot data show a rapid decline in the degradation rate of p53 in the presence of Cdk5 inhibitor in contrast to that of the untreated control, strongly suggesting Cdk5-mediated sustained p53 stabilization (Fig. 4B). Since phosphorylation is an important element of p53 regulation, and our previous reports showed that Cdk5 induced p53 phosphorylation, we next investigated whether Cdk5 also affects p53 through phosphorylation upon H2O2 treatment by using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies. Hydrogen peroxide caused significantly increased phosphorylation at N-terminal regions; however, these phosphorylations were dramatically reduced when Cdk5 was blocked with inhibitor or suppressed with siRNA (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 4B). These data demonstrate that Cdk5 is also responsible for p53 phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization in response to oxidative stress. Next, we explored whether Cdk5 also affects transactivation of p53 by quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis. In contrast to c-Abl siRNA, the transcript levels of both HDM2 and BAX were affected as a result of reduced Cdk5 expression by siRNA, although the inhibition of HDM2 expression by Cdk5 suppression was not as dramatic as the inhibition of c-Abl (Fig. 4D). This result suggests that transcriptional acti"
https://openalex.org/W2090417409,"The homeodomain protein Distal-less-3 (Dlx3) plays a crucial role during embryonic development. This transcription factor is known to be essential for placental formation and to be involved in skin and skeletal organogenesis. In humans, a frameshift mutation in the coding sequence of the DLX3 gene results in an ectodermal dysplasia called Tricho-Dento-Osseous syndrome (TDO). The main features of this autosomal dominant disorder are defects in hair, teeth, and bone. To investigate the functional alterations caused by the mutated DLX3(TDO) isoform ex vivo, we used tetracycline-inducible osteoblastic and keratinocyte cell lines and calvarial derived osteoblasts in which the expression of DLX3(WT) and/or DLX3(TDO) could be regulated and monitored. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that both DLX3(WT) and DLX3(TDO) recombinant proteins are targeted to the nucleus. However, as demonstrated by electrophoresis mobility shift assay, DLX3(TDO) is not able to bind to the canonical Dlx3 binding site. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the frameshifted C-terminal domain in DLX3(TDO) is accountable for the loss of DNA binding activity because the C-terminal domain in DLX3(WT) is not required for DNA binding activity. Although DLX3(TDO) alone cannot bind to a Dlx3 responsive element, when DLX3(WT) and DLX3(TDO) are co-expressed they form a complex that can bind DNA. Concomitant with the inability to bind DNA, DLX3(TDO) has a defective transcriptional activity. Moreover, the transcriptional activity of DLX3(WT) is significantly reduced in the presence of the mutated isoform, indicating that DLX3(TDO) has a dominant negative effect on DLX3(WT) transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2115310879,"In verbal communication, not only the meaning of the words convey information, but also the tone of voice (prosody) conveys crucial information about the emotional state and intentions of others. In various studies right frontal and right temporal regions have been found to play a role in emotional prosody perception. Here, we used triple-pulse repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to shed light on the precise time course of involvement of the right anterior superior temporal gyrus and the right fronto-parietal operculum. We hypothesized that information would be processed in the right anterior superior temporal gyrus before being processed in the right fronto-parietal operculum. Right-handed healthy subjects performed an emotional prosody task. During listening to each sentence a triplet of TMS pulses was applied to one of the regions at one of six time points (400–1900 ms). Results showed a significant main effect of Time for right anterior superior temporal gyrus and right fronto-parietal operculum. The largest interference was observed half-way through the sentence. This effect was stronger for withdrawal emotions than for the approach emotion. A further experiment with the inclusion of an active control condition, TMS over the EEG site POz (midline parietal-occipital junction), revealed stronger effects at the fronto-parietal operculum and anterior superior temporal gyrus relative to the active control condition. No evidence was found for sequential processing of emotional prosodic information from right anterior superior temporal gyrus to the right fronto-parietal operculum, but the results revealed more parallel processing. Our results suggest that both right fronto-parietal operculum and right anterior superior temporal gyrus are critical for emotional prosody perception at a relatively late time period after sentence onset. This may reflect that emotional cues can still be ambiguous at the beginning of sentences, but become more apparent half-way through the sentence."
https://openalex.org/W1964443195,"Accumulating epidemiological evidence points to the role of genetic background as a modulator of the capacity of adverse early experiences to give rise to mental illness. However, direct evidence of such gene-environment interaction in the context of substance abuse is scarce. In the present study we investigated whether the impact of early life experiences on cocaine intake in adulthood depends on genetic background. In addition, we studied other behavioral dimensions associated with drug abuse, i.e. anxiety- and depression-related behaviors.For this purpose, we manipulated the maternal environment of two inbred mouse strains, the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J by fostering them with non-related mothers, i.e. the C3H/HeN and AKR strains. These mother strains show respectively high and low pup-oriented behavior. As adults, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J were tested either for cocaine intravenous self-administration or in the elevated plus-maze and forced swim test (FST). We found that the impact of maternal environment on cocaine use and a depression-related behavior depends upon genotype, as cocaine self-administration and behavior in the FST were influenced by maternal environment in DBA/2J, but not in C57BL/6J mice. Anxiety was not influenced by maternal environment in either strain.Our experimental approach could contribute to the identification of the psychobiological factors determining the susceptibility or the resilience of certain individuals to develop psychopathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2023566361,"Chemical openers for KCNQ potassium channels are useful probes both for understanding channel gating and for developing therapeutics. The five KCNQ isoforms (KCNQ1 to KCNQ5, or Kv7.1 to Kv7.5) are differentially localized. Therefore, the molecular specificity of chemical openers is an important subject of investigation. Native KCNQ1 normally exists in complex with auxiliary subunits known as KCNE. In cardiac myocytes, the KCNQ1-KCNE1 (IsK or minK) channel is thought to underlie the IKs current, a component critical for membrane repolarization during cardiac action potential. Hence, the molecular and pharmacological differences between KCNQ1 and KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels have been important topics. Zinc pyrithione (ZnPy) is a newly identified KCNQ channel opener, which potently activates KCNQ2, KCNQ4, and KCNQ5. However, the ZnPy effects on cardiac KCNQ1 potassium channels remain largely unknown. Here we show that ZnPy effectively augments the KCNQ1 current, exhibiting an increase in current amplitude, reduction of inactivation, and slowing of both activation and deactivation. Some of these are reminiscent of effects by KCNE1. In addition, neither the heteromultimeric KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels nor native IKs current displayed any sensitivity to ZnPy, indicating that the static occupancy by a KCNE subunit desensitizes the reversible effects by a chemical opener. Site-directed mutagenesis of KCNQ1 reveals that residues critical for the potentiation effects by either ZnPy or KCNE are clustered together in the S6 region overlapping with the critical gating determinants. Thus, the convergence of potentiation effects and molecular determinants critical for both an auxiliary subunit and a chemical opener argue for a mechanistic overlap in causing potentiation.

Thus, the convergence of potentiation effects and molecular determinants critical for both an auxiliary subunit and a chemical opener argue for a mechanistic overlap in causing potentiation. Voltage-gated potassium channels are critical for membrane excitability. In cardiac tissue, potassium currents are important elements responsible for the repolarization of action potential. Among the different potassium current components, IKs and IKr are two key determinants for the duration of cardiac action potential (1Zeng J. Laurita K.R. Rosenbaum D.S. Rudy Y. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 140-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Molecular and genetic studies have shown that the IKs component is likely formed by the heteromultimeric assembly of subunits encoded by KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) and KCNE1 (IsK or minK) (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 3Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar), whereas the current encoded by hERG (human ether-ago-go related gene) is responsible for IKr (4Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C.

Genetic mutations of genes encoding these subunits commonly resulted in reduction of channel expression or conductance that causes congenital long QT syndrome (1Zeng J. Laurita K.R. Rosenbaum D.S.

In addition, IKr and, to some extent, IKs are common targets of unintended block by non-cardiac drugs causing acquired long QT syndrome (9Roden D.M. Lazzara R. Rosen M. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J.

Both forms of long QT syndrome are life-threatening cardiac conditions with a shared feature of current reduction (9Roden D.M. Lazzara R. Rosen M. Schwartz P.J. Towbin J. Vincent G.M.

Unlike channel blockers, the chemical activators for hERG and KCNQ1 are rare but valuable probes. Understanding of channel activation and investigation of channel openers are of considerable interest both in terms of gating mechanisms and in terms of developing therapeutic intervention. Voltage-gated potassium channels consist of pore-forming α subunits and auxiliary regulatory β subunits that contribute to diverse physiological functions, e.g. Kvβ subunits (12Xu J. Li M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). KCNE proteins are auxiliary subunits of at least five members, KCNE1 to KCNE5 (13Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I.

All five KCNE members (KCNE1 to KCNE5) are capable of coassembly with KCNQ1 (15Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A. Mol. Interv. 2001; 1: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bendahhou S. Marionneau C. Haurogne K.

In the case of KCNQ1 with KCNE1, the resultant heteromultimeric current is similar to IKs in cardiac tissue. Both KCNE1 and KCNE3 increase the maximum conductance of KCNQ1, whereas the association with KCNE2, KCNE4, and KCNE5 results in inhibition (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M.

Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The effects of KCNE1 on KCNQ1 include increasing overall current, slowing the activation and deactivation kinetics, and removal of inactivation (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar, 3Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). There is also evidence suggesting an increase in the single channel conductance of KCNQ1 (18Pusch M. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 437: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Sesti F. Goldstein S.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20Yang Y.

KCNE3 stabilizes KCNQ1 in the open state and augments current amplitude to a level comparable with that by KCNE1 (17Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Several residues in the KCNQ1 S6 domain (e.g. Ser338, Phe339, and Phe340) critical for the augmentation by KCNE1 and KCNE3 have been identified (21Panaghie G. Tai K.K. Abbott G.W. J.

Recently, several KCNQ-activating compounds have been identified, some of which are in clinical trials for anti-convulsive applications (24Blackburn-Munro G. Dalby-Brown W. Mirza N.R. Mikkelsen J.D. Blackburn-Munro R.E. CNS Drug Rev. 2005; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Fatope M.O. Drugs. 2001; 4: 93-98PubMed Google Scholar, 26Miceli F. Soldovieri M.V. Martire M.

Neurology. 2007; 68: 1197-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These compounds are interesting in several ways. First, their structures are sufficiently distinct and appear to affect different aspects of channel properties that lead to more active channels (29Peretz A. Degani N. Nachman R. Uziyel Y. Gibor G. Shabat D. Attali B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 30Xiong Q. Gao Z. Wang W. Li M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Second, mutagenesis studies revealed that they indeed recognize different “agonistic” sites on KCNQ channels (31Schenzer A. Friedrich T. Pusch M. Saftig P. Jentsch T.J. Grotzinger J. Schwake M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 5051-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 32Wuttke T.V. Seebohm G. Bail S. Maljevic S. Lerche H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1009-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one KCNQ channel complex is capable of interacting with more than one class of chemical openers. As a result, the tripartite complex displays a hybrid response, tunable by different concentrations and/or ratios of the chemical openers (33Xiong Q. Sun H. Zhang Y. Nan F. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 3128-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Specificity for either isoform or subunit composition is a topic critical for the molecular understanding of these cation channel openers. Because the KCNQ2–5 subunits are more commonly found in the nervous system, whereas KCNQ1 is predominantly localized in cardiac and other non-excitable tissues where they are in complex with KCNE subunits, it is particularly relevant to investigate subunit specificity among KCNQ1, KCNQ1-KCNE, and KCNQ2–5 channels. We have reported that bis(1-hydroxy-2(1H)-pyridineselonato-O,S) zinc, commonly known as zinc pyrithione (ZnPy), 2The abbreviations used are:ZnPyzinc pyrithioneCHOChinese hamster ovary. is a potent activator of KCNQ 1, 2, 4, and 5 channels but not KCNQ3 (34Xiong Q. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The effects of ZnPy on neuronal KCNQ channels include both a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and an increase in current amplitude. Of particular interest, mutagenesis studies have revealed that KCNQ2(A306T) in the S6 segment significantly reduced current augmentation of ZnPy (34Xiong Q. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The corresponding region of KCNQ2(A306T) in KCNQ1 was implicated for interactions with KCNE1 (21Panaghie G. Tai K.K. Abbott G.W. J. Physiol. 2006; 570: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Melman Y.F. Um S.Y. Krumerman A. Kagan A. McDonald T.V.

We thus hypothesized that the coassembly of KCNQ1 with KCNE1 subunits may lead to a distinct molecular specificity or pharmacological response, which would be relevant to finding compounds specific for either neuronal or cardiac KCNQ channels. Using a combination of electrophysiological analyses and site-directed mutagenesis, we have evaluated channel properties affected by ZnPy, tested whether KCNE auxiliary subunits affect ZnPy sensitivity, and investigated the molecular determinants critical for KCNE modulation and KCNQ1 pharmacology to chemical openers. zinc pyrithione Chinese hamster ovary. cDNAs and Mutagenesis—KCNQ1 and KCNE1 cDNA were gifts from Dr. M. C. Sanguinetti (University of Utah). KCNE3 cDNA was a gift from Dr. T. V. McDonald (Albert Einstein School of Medicine). Point mutations in the KCNQ1 channel were introduced by using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in 50/50 Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 (Cellgro, Manassas, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). To express KCNQ1 and KCNQ1-KCNE1, cells were split at 24 h before transfection, plated in 60-mm dishes, and transfected with Lipofectamine2000™. After transfection, cells were split and replated onto coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich). Plasmid expressing CD4 as a marker was cotransfected. Prior to recording, anti-CD4 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were added to the medium to allow for identification of the transfected cells. To coexpress KCNQ1 and KCNE3, cells were electroporated with a Nucleofector™ kit for CHO-K1 cells (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A green fluorescent protein cDNA (Amaxa) was cotransfected to allow identification of the transfected cells with the fluorescent microscope. The cDNA concentration of KCNQ1 or KCNE was 200 ng/μl, and the molar ratio of KCNE/KCNQ1 was 1:1. Electrophysiological Recording in CHO Cells—Whole-cell voltage clamp recording was carried out using cultured CHO cells at room temperature by an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). When filled with the intracellular solution, the electrodes have resistances of 3–5 MΩ. Pipette solution contained (in mm) 145 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 5 MgATP (pH 7.3 with KOH). During the recording, constant perfusion of extracellular solution was maintained using a B-channel valve BPS-8 model perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westburg, NY). Extracellular solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Signals were filtered at 1 KHz and digitized using a DigiData 1322A with pClamp 9.2 software (Molecular Devices). Series resistance was compensated by 60–80%. In the present study, three types of voltage protocols were used. The holding potential was −80 mV in all voltage protocols. To record the KCNQ1 current, the cells were stimulated by a series of 1,500-ms depolarizing steps from −70 mV to +50 mV in 10-mV increments. A testing step to −120 mV was applied to obtain tail currents. To record KCNQ1-KCNE1 currents, longer depolarizing steps (3,000 ms) were used to elicit the currents, and a −50-mV testing step was used to obtain tail currents. To record the KCNQ1-KCNE3 current, slightly different voltage protocols were used. The currents were elicited by a series of depolarizing steps from −100 to +80 mV in 20-mV increments. The tail current testing step was −50 mV. Isolation of Cardiac Myocytes and Native IKs Recording—Single myocytes were isolated from the left ventricle of adult guinea pig in a Langerdorff perfusion system as described previously (35Akao M. Ohler A. O’Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hearts were removed quickly via midline thoracotomy and perfused with a Ca2+-free Tyrode’s solution containing collagenase (6 mg/ml) and protease (0.1 mg/ml) for ∼5–6 min. Then the hearts were switched to Kraft-Bruhe solution perfusion for 5 min, and the ventricles were minced and gently triturated to single cells. The cells were stored at 4 °C in Kraft-Bruhe solution until use. Kraft-Bruhe solution contained the following (in mm): 50 l-glutamic acid, 80 KOH, 40 KCl, 3 MgSO4, 25 KH2PO4, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 20 taurine, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). Before recording, the myocytes were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with Tyrode’s solution. Both Itotal and IKs were recorded with conventional configuration of patch-clamp technique using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments). When filled with the intracellular solution containing (in mm) 120 KCl, 10 KH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.2 with KOH), the pipettes have resistances of 3–5 MΩ. Itotal was elicited by 3-s depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80mV to various test potentials between −70 and +70 mV in 10-mV increments in Tyrode’s solution perfusion. Tyrode’s solution contained (in mm) 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 5 HEPES, and 5 glucose (pH 7.4 with NaOH) and was oxygenated with 100% O2. To isolate for IKs, the external solution was switched to Na+-free solution containing (in mm) 132 N-methyl-d-glucamine (for sodium ion replacement), 1.0 CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 5 glucose, 0.05 lanthanum chloride to block IKr, and 0.005 nifedipine to block L-type calcium current (pH 7.4 with HCl). Modeling—Three-dimensional structural models for the KCNQ1 S5 and S6 domains were generated using the solved crystal structure of Kv1.2 (Protein Data Bank code 2A79) as a template. The corresponding domains between KCNQ1 and Kv1.2 were aligned with the DNASTAR MegAlign program using standard parameters. The KCNQ1 models were constructed using DeepView/SWISS-PDBViewer (36Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9690) Google Scholar). The structural representation was performed with the POV-Ray program. Data and Statistical Analysis—Patch-clamp data were processed using Clampfit 9.2 (Molecular Devices) and then analyzed in GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The activation curve was fitted by the Boltzmann Sigmoidal equation: G = Gmin+ (Gmax - Gmin)/(1 + exp(V - V½)/S)), where Gmax is the maximum conductance, Gmin is the minimum conductance, V½ is the voltage for reaching 50% of maximum conductance, and S is the slope factor. The dose-response curve was fitted by the Hill equation: E = Emax/(1 + (EC50/C)P), where EC50 is the drug concentration producing half of the maximum response, and P is the Hill coefficient. The activation and deactivation trace were fitted by the standard (or power) exponential equation using Clampfit 9.2. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Significance was estimated using a paired two-tailed Student’s t test. Augmentation of KCNQ1 Channels by ZnPy—To examine ZnPy modulation on the KCNQ1 current, we first expressed the KCNQ1 cDNA in CHO cells and recorded the channel activity with a whole-cell voltage clamp. KCNQ1 displayed a characteristic outward current with visible inactivation (Fig. 1A). In the presence of 5 μm ZnPy, steady-state currents at different depolarizing voltages were greatly potentiated, and inactivation was no longer readily detectable during the depolarizing phase (Fig. 1A). The ZnPy-mediated potentiation was fully reversible upon removal of ZnPy (Fig. 1B), consistent with the idea of modulating channel activity instead of protein density on cell surface. Examination of current amplitude increase using steady-state currents at different concentrations of ZnPy revealed a half-maximal value (EC50) of 3.5 ± 1.1 μm (n > 3) (Fig. 1C). Previous work has shown that ZnPy-mediated potentiation of neuronal KCNQ2 channels involves both a hyperpolarizing shift of half-maximal activation voltage (V½) and an increase in overall conductance (Gmax) (34Xiong Q. Sun H. Li M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine the ZnPy effects on the KCNQ1 homomultimer, we examined the G-V curve in the presence or absence of 5 μm ZnPy, which causes an ∼80% potentiation. In the absence of ZnPy, the V½ value was −23.2 ± 1.1 mV, similar to the value of the earlier reports (3Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, 37Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Richard P. Denjoy I. Hainque B. Romey G. Drici M.D. Guicheney P. Barhanin J. Cardiovasc.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6439-6444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Further experiments with a range of ZnPy concentrations revealed no significant change of V½ either (Fig. 1E). Hence, ZnPy increases overall conductance of KCNQ1 without affecting voltage dependence. Modulation of Kinetic Properties of KCNQ1 by ZnPy—To investigate ZnPy-mediated modulation on the close-open transition of the KCNQ1 channel, effects on both activation and deactivation were examined. The currents induced by depolarizing from −70 mV to +50 mV displayed a rapid activation followed by characteristic inactivation. In the presence of 5 μm ZnPy, the time constant of activation was slowed from 23.4 ± 2.4 ms to 74.0 ± 12.5 ms (n = 3; p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). This effect was seen in a range of depolarizing voltages (Fig. 2B). In addition, ZnPy also induced slowing of deactivation in hyperpolarizing voltages (Fig. 2, C and D). The reduction of deactivation rate is consistent with the overall increase of current amplitude or Gmax. If ZnPy affects both activation and deactivation through the same interaction that causes the increase of current amplitude, one should see similar EC50 values. Indeed, when plotting the change of time constants for activation or deactivation against concentrations of ZnPy, we found EC50 values of 3.2 ± 0.2 μm (n > 3) for activation and 3.6 ± 0.1 μm (n > 3) for deactivation (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, the EC50 values measured for current amplitude, activation, and deactivation time constants are essentially the same, providing evidence for the notion that one class of interaction (or binding site) is responsible for the activation and deactivation changes and for the current potentiation (Fig. 1C). Among different KCNQ channels, inactivation is a distinctive feature for KCNQ1. The overall increase in current amplitude could be contributed in part through inhibition of inactivation (Fig. 1A). Using the voltage pulse protocols outlined in Fig. 3A, the inactivation kinetics in the presence or absence of ZnPy was evaluated. In the absence of drug treatment, noticeable inactivation was observed (Fig. 3, A and B). However, in the presence of 5 μm of ZnPy, the inactivation was largely diminished. At a higher concentration of 10 μm, a similar effect was observed (data not shown). When examining the recovery from inactivation, the effect was rather minimal (n > 4; p > 0.1) (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, the inhibition of inactivation by ZnPy is a contributing factor for an overall increase of current amplitude. Coassembly with KCNE1 Desensitizes ZnPy-mediated Augmentation—Coassembly of KCNQ1 with KCNE1 is thought to form the native IKs (2Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G.

Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). The modulation of KCNQ1 by KCNE1 displays considerable similarity to ZnPy-induced effects. Both KCNE1 and ZnPy increase current amplitude, decrease inactivation, and slow activation and deactivation (Table 1), although their effects on the G-V curve are different. To test any potential alteration of sensitivity to ZnPy, we coexpressed KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (Fig. 4C). In the presence of 10 μm ZnPy, there were no obvious effects of drug-induced further potentiation (Fig. 4, C and E). It is known that the heteromultimeric KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels have a depolarizing V½ shift of 38.5 ± 1.5 mV compared with homomultimeric KCNQ1 channels (Fig. 4D). In the presence of different concentrations of ZnPy, the V½ values remain unchanged (Fig. 4F). In addition, no changes were detected for deactivation in the presence of ZnPy (Fig. 4G).TABLE 1Comparision of ZnPy, KCNE1, and KCNE3 effects on KCNQ1 G is the channel conductance in the presence of either ZnPy or auxiliary subunits, whereas G0 is the conductance of KCNQ1 without ZnPy or any auxiliary subunits (KCNE1 or KCNE3). Both ZnPy and KCNE increase the conductance ∼4-fold; ZnPy and KCNE1 slow the activation and deactivation, whereas KCNE3 accelerates the deactivation. In addition, ZnPy inhibits KCNQ1 inactivation, whereas KCNE completely abolishes the inactivation. Significance was estimated by using a paired t-test; n > 4.

Therefore, if KCNE1 indeed abolishes the KCNQ1 sensitivity to ZnPy, native IKs should display no sensitivity. To examine this possibility, ventricular cardiac myocytes from guinea pig were acutely isolated. Using the previously reported conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), the IKs component was isolated and showed a characteristic inhibition by 100 μm chromanol 293B (Fig. 5, A–C) (39Busch A.E.

In the presence of ZnPy, the IKs displayed no detectable change in macroscopic currents, voltage sensitivity, or deactivation kinetics (Fig. 5, D–G). Hence, neither recombinant KCNQ1-KCNE1 nor native IKs displays the sensitivity to ZnPy. This is in further agreement with KCNE1-mediated desensitization. The five known KCNE subunits may be divided according to their effects. Both KCNE1 and KCNE3 display potentiation when coassembled with pore-forming α subunits. In contrast, the other KCNE subunits display inhibitory effects. KCNE3 has a 35% identity with KCNE1. Coas"
https://openalex.org/W2004781384,"While Blood vessel epicardial substance (Bves) confers adhesive properties, the molecular mechanism of regulating this activity is unknown. No predicted functional motifs in this highly conserved integral membrane protein, other than the transmembrane domain, have been identified. Here, we report for the first time that Bves interacts with itself through an intracellular interaction domain that is essential for its intercellular adhesion activity. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and SPOTs analyses mapped this domain to amino acids 268-274 in the intracellular C-terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that lysines 272 and 273 are essential for homodimerization and cell adhesion. Human corneal cells transfected with wild-type Bves trafficked the protein to the cell surface, assembled junction complexes and formed epithelial sheets. In contrast, cells expressing Bves mutated at these positions did not form continuous epithelial sheets or maintain junctional proteins such as ZO-1 and E-cadherin at the membrane. A dramatic reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance was also observed indicating a functional loss of tight junctions. Importantly, expression of mutated Bves in epithelial cells promoted the transformation of cells from an epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype. This study is the first to demonstrate the essential nature of any domain within Bves for maintenance of epithelial phenotype and function."
https://openalex.org/W2130272450,"Conjugation to SUMO is a reversible post-translational modification that regulates several transcription factors involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and disease. The p53 tumor suppressor can be modified by SUMO-1 in mammalian cells, but the functional consequences of this modification are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the Drosophila homolog of human p53 can be efficiently sumoylated in insect cells. We identify two lysine residues involved in SUMO attachment, one at the C terminus, between the DNA binding and oligomerization domains, and one at the N terminus of the protein. We find that sumoylation helps recruit Drosophila p53 to nuclear dot-like structures that can be marked by human PML and the Drosophila homologue of Daxx. We demonstrate that mutation of both sumoylation sites dramatically reduces the transcriptional activity of p53 and its ability to induce apoptosis in transgenic flies, providing in vivo evidence that sumoylation is critical for Drosophila p53 function."
https://openalex.org/W2091409116,"ErbB3 is a transmembrane growth factor receptor that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancer. After finding that a truncated form of ErbB3 was present and upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer cells in lymph nodes and bone, we explored the pathophysiological functions of this unusual form of ErbB3 in the context of mouse calvaria as well as osteoblasts in vitro and the femur microenvironment in vivo. Here we demonstrate that prostate cancer cells expressed an alternatively spliced transcript that encodes a 45-kDa glycosylated protein (p45-sErbB3). The recombinant p45-sErbB3 purified from conditioned medium stimulated calvarial bone formation and induced osteoblast differentiation. Overexpression of p45-sErbB3 in the osteolytic prostate cancer cell line PC-3 converted its phenotype from bone lysing to bone forming upon injection into the femurs of immunodeficient mice. Further, we detected sErbB3 in plasma samples from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis. These observations establish that p45-sErbB3 is a structurally and functionally unique gene product of ErbB3 and suggest that p45-sErbB3 is likely one of the factors involved in the osteoblastic bone metastases of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2025596092,"Several oncogenic proteins and tumour suppressors target the RNA polymerase I and interfere with rRNA synthesis. Here, we show that the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β, which phosphorylates the tumour suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10), is selectively enriched in nucleoli of RAS-transformed cells. Immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays performed on epithelial and endothelial cells transformed with oncogenic RAS show that GSK3β and PTEN are part of the same complex and associate with promoter and coding region of the rDNA. An active GSK3β mutant abolished nucleolar BrUTP incorporation and associated with the member of the selectivity factor 1 complex TAFI110. Finally, GSK3β inhibition upregulated 45S, 18S and 28S rRNA synthesis in RAS-transformed epithelial cells as revealed by semiquantitative real-time PCR and promoted cellular proliferation. Our results underscore a repressive function for GSK3β in rRNA biogenesis supporting its role as a tumour supressor."
https://openalex.org/W2078606824,"The inducible cyclooxygenase isoform (COX-2) is associated with inflammation, tumorigenesis, as well as with physiological events. Despite efforts deployed in order to understand the biology of this multi-faceted enzyme, much remains to be understood. Nucleobindin (Nuc), a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein, possesses a putative COX-binding domain. In this study, we investigated its expression and subcellular localization in human neutrophils, its affinity for COX-2 as well as its possible impact on PGE2 biosynthesis. Complementary subcellular localization approaches including nitrogen cavitation coupled to Percoll fractionation, immunofluorescence, confocal and electron microscopy collectively placed Nuc, COX-2, and all of the main enzymes involved in prostanoid synthesis, in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum of human neutrophils. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated a high affinity between Nuc and COX-2. Addition of human recombinant (hr) Nuc to purified hrCOX-2 dose-dependently caused an increase in PGE2 biosynthesis in response to arachidonic acid. Co-incubation of Nuc with COX-2-expressing neutrophil lysates also increased their capacity to produce PGE2. Moreover, neutrophil transfection with hrNuc specifically enhanced PGE2 biosynthesis. Together, these results identify a COX-2-associated protein which may have an impact in prostanoid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2069128028,"The zinc insulin hexamer undergoes allosteric reorganization among three conformational states, designated T(6), T(3)R(3)(f), and R(6). Although the free monomer in solution (the active species) resembles the classical T-state, an R-like conformational change is proposed to occur upon receptor binding. Here, we distinguish between the conformational requirements of receptor binding and the crystallographic TR transition by design of an active variant refractory to such reorganization. Our strategy exploits the contrasting environments of His(B5) in wild-type structures: on the T(6) surface but within an intersubunit crevice in R-containing hexamers. The TR transition is associated with a marked reduction in His(B5) pK(a), in turn predicting that a positive charge at this site would destabilize the R-specific crevice. Remarkably, substitution of His(B5) (conserved among eutherian mammals) by Arg (occasionally observed among other vertebrates) blocks the TR transition, as probed in solution by optical spectroscopy. Similarly, crystallization of Arg(B5)-insulin in the presence of phenol (ordinarily a potent inducer of the TR transition) yields T(6) hexamers rather than R(6) as obtained in control studies of wild-type insulin. The variant structure, determined at a resolution of 1.3A, closely resembles the wild-type T(6) hexamer. Whereas Arg(B5) is exposed on the protein surface, its side chain participates in a solvent-stabilized network of contacts similar to those involving His(B5) in wild-type T-states. The substantial receptor-binding activity of Arg(B5)-insulin (40% relative to wild type) demonstrates that the function of an insulin monomer can be uncoupled from its allosteric reorganization within zinc-stabilized hexamers."
https://openalex.org/W2086228840,"It is not known whether prolonged exposure to perceived and imagined complex visual images produces similar shifts in subsequent perception through selective adaptation. This question is important because a positive finding would suggest that perception and imagery of visual stimuli are mediated by shared neural networks. In this study, we used a selective adaptation procedure designed to induce high-level face-identity aftereffects—a phenomenon in which extended exposure to a particular face facilitates recognition of subsequent faces with opposite features while impairing recognition of all other faces. We report here that adaptation to either real or imagined faces produces a similar shift in perception and that identity boundaries represented in real and imagined faces are equivalent. Together, our results show that identity information contained in imagined and real faces produce similar behavioral outcomes. Our findings of high-level visual aftereffects induced by imagined stimuli can be taken as evidence for the involvement of shared neural networks that mediate perception and imagery of complex visual stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2005925391,"Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, often by gain-of-function mutations of RAS or RAF, is observed in many human cancers. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is required for the proliferation of cancer cell lines harboring activating BRAF or, to a lesser extent, activating RAS mutations. It is still unclear, however, whether the pathway is required in vivo for tumor development, particularly in tumors in which B-Raf is not mutationally activated. During embryonic development, B-Raf is essential for angiogenesis in the placenta. To address the question of whether B-Raf contributed to tumor angiogenesis in vivo we conditionally ablated B-Raf in a model of pancreatic islet carcinoma driven by the functional inactivation of tumor suppressors (RIP1Tag2), which critically depends on angiogenesis for growth. We find that B-Raf is dispensable for the proliferation of tumor cells in culture, but necessary for ERK activation and for the expression of angiogenic factors by tumor cells in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, these defects result in the formation of hollow tumors with decreased vessel density and strongly reduced proliferation. The progression from adenoma to carcinoma is also significantly impaired. Thus, endogenous B-Raf contributes to the development of RIP1Tag2 tumors by supporting the stromal response and tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2026815028,"Random peptide libraries displayed on the ribosome are becoming a new tool for the in vitro selection of biologically relevant macromolecules, including epitopes, antagonists, enzymes, and cell-surface receptors. Ribosome display is a cell-free system of coupling individual nascent proteins (phenotypes) to their corresponding mRNA (genotypes) by the formation of stable protein-ribosome-mRNA complexes and permitting the selection of a functional nascent protein by iterative cycles of panning and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification in vitro. The complexity of the random peptide library is critical for the success of a panning experiment; greater the diversity of sequences within the library, the more likely it is that the library comprises sequences that can bind a given target with specific affinity. Here, we have used the cell-free system Escherichia coli S30 lysate to construct high-complexity random peptide libraries (>1014 independent members) by introducing strategies that are different from the methods described by Mattheakis et al. and Lamla et al. The key step in our method is to produce nanomole (nmol) amounts of DNA elements that are necessary for in vitro transcription/translation by using PCR but not plasmid DNA. Library design strategies and protocols that facilitate rapid identification are also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2079007555,"Background The evolutionary history of Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrates from the Arabian Peninsula is virtually unknown. Despite vast exposures of rocky outcrops, only a handful of fossils have yet been described from the region. Here we report a multi-taxon dinosaur track assemblage near Madar village, 47 km north of Sana'a, Republic of Yemen. This represents the first dinosaur tracksite from the Arabian Peninsula, and the only multi-taxon dinosaur ichnosite in the Middle East. Methodology/Findings Measurements were taken directly from trackway impressions, following standard ichnological conventions. The presence of bipedal trackmakers is evidenced by a long series of pes imprints preserving smoothly rounded posterior margins, no evidence of a hallux, bluntly rounded digit tips and digital divarication angles characteristic of ornithopod dinosaurs. Nearby, eleven parallel quadrupedal trackways document a sauropod herd that included large and small individuals traveling together. Based on the morphology of manus impressions along with a narrow-gauged stance, the quadrupedal trackways were made by non-titanosauriform neosauropods. Additional isolated tracks and trackways of sauropod and ornithopod dinosaurs are preserved nearby. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these discoveries present the most evocative window to date into the evolutionary history of dinosaurs of the Arabian Peninsula. Given the limited Mesozoic terrestrial record from the region, this discovery is of both temporal and geographic significance, and massive exposures of similarly-aged outcrops nearby offer great promise for future discoveries."
https://openalex.org/W2084101755,"Identifying among nephroblastoma those with a high propensity for distant metastases using cell cycle markers: cyclin E as a regulator of progression through the cell cycle and Ki-67 as a tumor proliferation marker, since both are often deregulated in many human malignancies.A staining index (SI) was obtained by immunohistochemistry using anti-cyclin E and anti-Ki-67 antibodies in paraffin sections of 54 postchemotherapy nephroblastoma including 42 nephroblastoma without metastasis and 12 with metastases. Median cyclin E and Ki-67 SI were 46% and 33% in blastemal cells, 30% and 10% in stromal cells, 37% and 29.5% in epithelial cells. The highest values were found for anaplastic nephroblastoma. A correlation between cyclin E and Ki-67 SI was found for the blastemal component and for the epithelial component. Univariate analysis showed prognostic significance for metastases with cyclin E SI in stromal cells, epithelial cells and blastemal cells (p = 0.03, p = 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively) as well as with Ki-67 SI in blastema (p<10(-4)). The most striking data were that both cyclin E SI and blastemal Ki-67 SI discriminated between patients with metastases and patients without metastasis among intermediate-risk nephroblastoma.Our findings show that a high cyclin E SI in all components of nephroblastoma is correlated with tumor aggressiveness and metastases, and that assessment of its expression may have prognostic value in the categorization of nephroblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W1967675037,"Background Vertebrate bloodfeeding is a critical component of a mosquito's ability to transmit pathogens that cause diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and viral encephalitis. Due to degradation by the digestive process, current methods to identify mosquito bloodmeal sources are only useful for approximately 36 hours post-feeding. A critical need exists for technologies to extend this window and gain a more complete picture of mosquito feeding behavior for epidemiological studies. Stable isotopes are useful for investigating organism feeding behavior because the isotopic ratio of an organism's tissues reflects that of the material it ingests. Methodology/Principal Findings Proof-of-principle data indicates that after bloodfeeding, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes acquire diagnostic Carbon and Nitrogen stable isotope profiles from their vertebrate hosts that can be accurately identified one week post-feeding, approximately 4 days after the entire bloodmeal has been digested. Total C/N ratio served as a biomarker marker for bloodfeeding (P<0.02), while δN was the most informative variable which could distinguish between unfed, chicken-fed and human-fed mosquitoes (P<0.01). By plotting C/N vs. δN, all feeding treatments could be identified in a double-blind analysis. Conclusions/Significance These proof-of-principle experiments indicate that analysis of stable isotopes can be used to distinguish bloodfed from unfed mosquitoes, and also distinguish between different vertebrate bloodmeal sources even after all blood has been digested. The development of stable isotope-based assays for mosquito bloodmeal identification may be a powerful tool to investigate mosquito feeding ecology and the dynamics of vector-borne pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2015106368,"Spotting a prey or a predator is crucial in the natural environment and relies on the ability to extract quickly pertinent visual information. The experimental counterpart of this behavior is visual search (VS) where subjects have to identify a target amongst several distractors. In difficult VS tasks, it has been found that the reaction time (RT) is influenced by salience factors, such as the target-distractor similarity, and this finding is usually regarded as evidence for a guidance of attention by preattentive mechanisms. However, the use of RT measurements, a parameter which depends on multiple factors, allows only very indirect inferences about the underlying attentional mechanisms. The purpose of the present study was to determine the influence of salience factors on attentional guidance during VS, by measuring directly attentional allocation. We studied attention allocation by using a dual covert VS task in subjects who had 1) to detect a target amongst different items and 2) to report letters briefly flashed inside those items at different delays. As predicted, we showed that parallel processes guide attention towards the most relevant item by virtue of both goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors, and we demonstrated that this attentional selection is a prerequisite for target detection. In addition, we show that when the target is characterized by two features (conjunction VS), the goal-directed effects of both features are initially combined into a unique salience value, but at a later stage, grouping phenomena interact with the salience computation, and lead to the selection of a whole group of items. These results, in line with Guided Search Theory, show that efficient and rapid preattentive processes guide attention towards the most salient item, allowing to reduce the number of attentional shifts needed to find the target."
https://openalex.org/W2008721773,"One challenging question in neurogenesis concerns the identification of cues that trigger axonal growth and pathfinding to form stereotypic neuronal networks during the construction of a nervous system. Here, we show that in Drosophila, Engrailed (EN) and Gooseberry-Neuro (GsbN) act together as cofactors to build the posterior commissures (PCs), which shapes the ventral nerve cord. Indeed, we show that these two proteins are acting together in axon growth and midline crossing, and that this concerted action occurs at early development, in neuroblasts. More precisely, we identified that their expressions in NB 6-4 are necessary and sufficient to trigger the formation of the PCs, demonstrating that segmentation genes such as EN and GsbN play a crucial role in the determination of NB 6-4 in a way that will later influence growth and guidance of all the axons that form the PCs. We also demonstrate a more specific function of GsbN in differentiated neurons, leading to fasciculations between axons, which might be required to obtain PC mature axon bundles."
https://openalex.org/W2084727378,"The accumulation of filamentous alpha-synuclein (alpha-S) is associated with Parkinson's disease. It remains controversial as to the mode (antiparallel or parallel) of alpha-S self-assembly and whether an exact alignment of the central hydrophobic region is essential. In the present study, we performed in vitro assembly using alpha-S with or without the attachment of artificial leucine zippers (Zips) capable of forming either parallel or antiparallel coiled coils and included a spacer in one derivative. Results showed that Zips accelerate filament assembly in both the parallel and antiparallel fashions, that a precise alignment of the central hydrophobic region is not essential, and that the antiparallel pairs displayed the highest thioflavin T signals. More importantly, cells expressing Zip-fused alpha-S, but not alpha-S alone, formed alpha-S immunopositive and thioflavin S-positive inclusions in 7 days. The results suggest that alpha-S can assemble in both parallel and antiparallel modes but have a higher tendency to assemble in the latter mode and that cells overexpressing Zip-fused alpha-S may be used to screen alpha-S assembly inhibitors due to enhanced ability to form inclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2049959607,"The 243-residue E1A protein of adenovirus induces cellular proliferation, at least partly by regulating the transcription of cellular genes. This E1A function requires E1A N-terminal region and conserved regions 1 and 2 (CR1 and CR2), which interact with histone acetyl transferases, p400 chromatin-modifying complex and the Rb family proteins. A PLDLS motif at the E1A C-terminal (CR4) region, interacts with the C-terminal binding proteins (CtBP1 and CtBP2), and antagonizes some E1A functions. In this report, we discovered that the transcriptional activation function of E1A was specifically repressed by a short N-terminal domain unique to CtBP2. The CtBP2-mediated repression of E1A transcriptional activation activity is independent of histone deacetylases, which can be recruited by CtBP1/2 proteins to inhibit transcription. Fusion of the CtBP2 N-terminal 20 residues to the E1A C-terminal region rendered E1A to be inactive in transcriptional activation without interfering with E1A's ability to interact with major cofactors such as pRb, p400 and p300. Substitution of the N-terminal domain of CtBP1 for the CtBP2 domain in E1A-CtBP2 fusion partially restored the transactivation activity of E1A. In a cell-proliferation model utilizing primary baby rat kidney cells and retrovirally expressed E1A, the ability of E1A to induce cellular proliferation was strongly inhibited when the CtBP2 N-terminal region was fused to E1A. These results are consistent with a hypothesis that CtBP2 may inhibit E1A induced cell proliferation by antagonizing the transcriptional activation function controlled by the N-terminal region of E1A."
https://openalex.org/W2007451734,"The synaptic integration in individual central neuron is critically affected by how active conductances are distributed over dendrites. It has been well known that the dendrites of central neurons are richly endowed with voltage- and ligand-regulated ion conductances. Nonspiking interneurons (NSIs), almost exclusively characteristic to arthropod central nervous systems, do not generate action potentials and hence lack voltage-regulated sodium channels, yet having a variety of voltage-regulated potassium conductances on their dendritic membrane including the one similar to the delayed-rectifier type potassium conductance. It remains unknown, however, how the active conductances are distributed over dendrites and how the synaptic integration is affected by those conductances in NSIs and other invertebrate neurons where the cell body is not included in the signal pathway from input synapses to output sites. In the present study, we quantitatively investigated the functional significance of active conductance distribution pattern in the spatio-temporal spread of synaptic potentials over dendrites of an identified NSI in the crayfish central nervous system by computer simulation. We systematically changed the distribution pattern of active conductances in the neuron's multicompartment model and examined how the synaptic potential waveform was affected by each distribution pattern. It was revealed that specific patterns of nonuniform distribution of potassium conductances were consistent, while other patterns were not, with the waveform of compound synaptic potentials recorded physiologically in the major input-output pathway of the cell, suggesting that the possibility of nonuniform distribution of potassium conductances over the dendrite cannot be excluded as well as the possibility of uniform distribution. Local synaptic circuits involving input and output synapses on the same branch or on the same side were found to be potentially affected under the condition of nonuniform distribution while operation of the major input-output pathway from the soma side to the one on the opposite side remained the same under both conditions of uniform and nonuniform distribution of potassium conductances over the NSI dendrite."
