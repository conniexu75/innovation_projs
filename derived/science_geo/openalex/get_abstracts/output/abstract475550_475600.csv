(p. 871 ; see the cover) analyzed complete mitochondrial genomes from present-day dogs and wolves, as well as 18 fossil canids dating from 1000 to 36,000 years ago from the Old and New Worlds. The data suggest that an ancient, now extinct, central European population of wolves was directly ancestral to domestic dogs. Furthermore, several ancient dogs may represent failed domestication events."

Staphylococcus aureus evades NETs by degrading the DNA into deoxyadenosine (dAdo). Thammavongsa et al. (p. 863 ) found that dAdo also promotes immune cell death, which appears to ensure the exclusion of macrophages from the center of abscesses within which the bacteria survive."

To this end, Hazel et al. (p. 853 ) and Good et al. (p. 856 ) developed microfluidic systems in which cytoplasmic extracts are encapsulated in compartments with definable size. The size of mitotic spindles assembled within cell-free extracts scaled with the volume of the compartment within which the spindle assembled. The findings suggest that the diminished availability of cytoplasmic components, notably tubulin, concomitant with cell size reduction, prescribes a smaller spindle size."

The prevalence of neuroenhancement among Swiss university students is unknown. Investigating the prevalence of neuroenhancement among students is important to monitor problematic use and evaluate the necessity of prevention programs. Study aim To describe the prevalence of the use of prescription medications and drugs of abuse for neuroenhancement among Swiss university students. Method In this cross-sectional study, students at the University of Zurich, University of Basel, and Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich were invited via e-mail to participate in an online survey. Results A total of 28,118 students were contacted, and 6,275 students completed the survey. Across all of the institutions, 13.8% of the respondents indicated that they had used prescription drugs (7.6%) or drugs of abuse including alcohol (7.8%) at least once specifically for neuroenhancement. The most frequently used prescription drugs for neuroenhancement were methylphenidate (4.1%), sedatives (2.7%), and beta-blockers (1.2%). Alcohol was used for this purpose by 5.6% of the participants, followed by cannabis (2.5%), amphetamines (0.4%), and cocaine (0.2%). Arguments for neuroenhancement included increased learning (66.2%), relaxation or sleep improvement (51.2%), reduced nervousness (39.1%), coping with performance pressure (34.9%), increased performance (32.2%), and experimentation (20%). Neuroenhancement was significantly more prevalent among more senior students, students who reported higher levels of stress, and students who had previously used illicit drugs. Although “soft enhancers”, including coffee, energy drinks, vitamins, and tonics, were used daily in the month prior to an exam, prescription drugs or drugs of abuse were used much less frequently. Conclusions A significant proportion of Swiss university students across most academic disciplines reported neuroenhancement with prescription drugs and drugs of abuse. However, these substances are rarely used on a daily basis and more sporadically used prior to exams."

Using our recently developed live-cell aggregation sensor in neuron-like cells, we demonstrate that different variants of exogenous monomeric Tau, namely full-length Tau (hTau40) and the Tau-derived construct K18 comprising the repeat domain, initially accumulate in endosomal compartments, where they form fibrillar seeds that subsequently induce the aggregation of endogenous Tau. Using superresolution imaging, we confirm that fibrils consisting of endogenous and exogenous Tau are released from cells and demonstrate their potential to spread Tau pathology. Our data indicate a greater pathological risk and potential toxicity than hitherto suspected for extracellular soluble Tau."
https://openalex.org/W2041800481,"Human and animal studies strongly suggest that dietary gluten could play a causal role in the etiopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the mechanisms have not been elucidated. Recent reports indicate that the intestinal microbiome has a major influence on the incidence of T1D. Since diet is known to shape the composition of the intestinal microbiome, we investigated using non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice whether changes in the intestinal microbiome could be attributed to the pro- and anti-diabetogenic effects of gluten-containing and gluten-free diets, respectively. NOD mice were raised on gluten-containing chows (GCC) or gluten-free chows (GFC). The incidence of diabetes was determined by monitoring blood glucose levels biweekly using a glucometer. Intestinal microbiome composition was analyzed by sequencing 16S rRNA amplicons derived from fecal samples. First of all, GCC-fed NOD mice had the expected high incidence of hyperglycemia whereas NOD mice fed with a GFC had significantly reduced incidence of hyperglycemia. Secondly, when the fecal microbiomes were compared, Bifidobacterium, Tannerella, and Barnesiella species were increased (p = 0.03, 0.02, and 0.02, respectively) in the microbiome of GCC mice, where as Akkermansia species was increased (p = 0.02) in the intestinal microbiomes of NOD mice fed GFC. Thirdly, both of the gluten-free chows that were evaluated, either egg white based (EW-GFC) or casein based (C-GFC), significantly reduced the incidence of hyperglycemia. Interestingly, the gut microbiome from EW-GFC mice was similar to C-GFC mice. Finally, adding back gluten to the gluten-free diet reversed its anti-diabetogenic effect, reduced Akkermansia species and increased Bifidobacterium, Tannerella, and Barnesiella suggesting that the presence of gluten is directly responsible for the pro-diabetogenic effects of diets and it determines the gut microflora. Our novel study thus suggests that dietary gluten could modulate the incidence of T1D by changing the gut microbiome."

Projectiles therefore provided a significant advantage over thrusting spears. Composite projectile technologies are considered indicative of complex behavior and pivotal to the successful spread of Homo sapiens. Direct evidence for such projectiles is thus far unknown from >80,000 years ago. Data from velocity-dependent microfracture features, diagnostic damage patterns, and artifact shape reported here indicate that pointed stone artifacts from Ethiopia were used as projectile weapons (in the form of hafted javelin tips) as early as >279,000 years ago. In combination with the existing archaeological, fossil and genetic evidence, these data isolate eastern Africa as a source of modern cultures and biology."
https://openalex.org/W1969862288,"Uganda scaled-up Early HIV Infant Diagnosis (EID) when simplified methods for testing of infants using dried blood spots (DBS) were adopted in 2006 and sample transport and management was therefore made feasible in rural settings. Before this time only 35% of the facilities that were providing EID services were reached through the national postal courier system, Posta Uganda. The transportation of samples during this scale-up, therefore, quickly became a challenge and varied from facility to facility as different methods were used to transport the samples. This study evaluates a novel specimen transport network system for EID testing.A retrospective study was done in mid-2012 on 19 pilot hubs serving 616 health facilities in Uganda. The effect on sample-result turnaround time (TAT) and the cost of DBS sample transport on 876 sample-results was analyzed.The HUB network system provided increased access to EID services ranging from 36% to 51%, drastically reduced transportation costs by 62%, reduced turn-around times by 46.9% and by a further 46.2% through introduction of SMS printers.The HUB model provides a functional, reliable and efficient national referral network against which other health system strengthening initiatives can be built to increase access to critical diagnostic and treatment monitoring services, improve the quality of laboratory and diagnostic services, with reduced turn-around times and improved quality of prevention and treatment programs thereby reducing long-term costs."
https://openalex.org/W2047094777,"Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XP-C) is a rare human syndrome characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light and a dramatic predisposition to skin neoplasms. XP-C cells are deficient in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a complex process involved in the recognition and removal of DNA lesions. Several XPC mutations have been described, including a founder mutation in North African patients involving the deletion of a TG dinucleotide (ΔTG) located in the middle of exon 9. This deletion leads to the expression of an inactive truncated XPC protein, normally involved in the first step of NER. New approaches used for gene correction are based on the ability of engineered nucleases such as Meganucleases, Zinc-Finger nucleases or TALE nucleases to accurately generate a double strand break at a specific locus and promote correction by homologous recombination through the insertion of an exogenous DNA repair matrix. Here, we describe the targeted correction of the ΔTG mutation in XP-C cells using engineered meganuclease and TALEN™. The methylated status of the XPC locus, known to inhibit both of these nuclease activities, led us to adapt our experimental design to optimize their in vivo efficacies. We show that demethylating treatment as well as the use of TALEN™ insensitive to CpG methylation enable successful correction of the ΔTG mutation. Such genetic correction leads to re-expression of the full-length XPC protein and to the recovery of NER capacity, attested by UV-C resistance of the corrected cells. Overall, we demonstrate that nuclease-based targeted approaches offer reliable and efficient strategies for gene correction."
https://openalex.org/W2065095992,"Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) is an extracellular protein and one of the principal ligands of Tie2 receptor that is involved in the regulation of vascular integrity, quiescence, and inflammation. The mode of secretion of Ang2 has never been established, however. Here, we provide evidence that Ang2 is secreted from endothelial cells via exosomes and that this process is inhibited by the PI3K/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling pathway, whereas it is positively regulated by the syndecan-4/syntenin pathway. Vascular defects in Akt1 null mice arise, in part, because of excessive Ang2 secretion and can be rescued by the syndecan-4 knock-out that reduces extracellular Ang2 levels. This novel mechanism connects three critical signaling pathways: angiopoietin/Tie2, PI3K/Akt/eNOS, and syndecan/syntenin, which play important roles in vascular growth and stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2104997836,"Hemodialysis aims at removing uremic toxins thus decreasing their concentrations. The present study investigated whether Kt/Vurea, used as marker of dialysis adequacy, is correlated with these concentrations. Predialysis blood samples were taken before a midweek session in 71 chronic HD patients. Samples were analyzed by colorimetry, HPLC, or ELISA for a broad range of uremic solutes. Solute concentrations were divided into four groups according to quartiles of Kt/Vurea, and also of different other parameters with potential impact, such as age, body weight (BW), Protein equivalent of Nitrogen Appearance (PNA), Residual Renal Function (RRF), and dialysis vintage. Dichotomic concentration comparisons were performed for gender and Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Analysis of Variance in quartiles of Kt/Vurea did not show significant differences for any of the solute concentrations. For PNA, however, concentrations showed significant differences for urea (P<0.001), uric acid (UA), p-cresylsulfate (PCS), and free PCS (all P<0.01), and for creatinine (Crea) and hippuric acid (HA) (both P<0.05). For RRF, concentrations varied for β2-microglobulin (P<0.001), HA, free HA, free indoxyl sulfate, and free indole acetic acid (all P<0.01), and for p-cresylglucuronide (PCG), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPF), free PCS, and free PCG (all P<0.05). Gender and body weight only showed differences for Crea and UA, while age, vintage, and diabetes mellitus only showed differences for one solute concentration (UA, UA, and free PCS, respectively). Multifactor analyses indicated a predominant association of concentration with protein intake and residual renal function. In conclusion, predialysis concentrations of uremic toxins seem to be dependent on protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance and residual renal function, and not on dialysis adequacy as assessed by Kt/Vurea. Efforts to control intestinal load of uremic toxin precursors by dietary or other interventions, and preserving RRF seem important approaches to decrease uremic solute concentration and by extension their toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2109070719,"Thawing permafrost in the Canadian Arctic tundra leads to peat erosion and slumping in narrow and shallow runnel ponds that surround more commonly studied polygonal ponds. Here we compared the methane production between runnel and polygonal ponds using stable isotope ratios, 14C signatures, and investigated potential methanogenic communities through high-throughput sequencing archaeal 16S rRNA genes. We found that runnel ponds had significantly higher methane and carbon dioxide emissions, produced from a slightly larger fraction of old carbon, compared to polygonal ponds. The methane stable isotopic signature indicated production through acetoclastic methanogenesis, but gene signatures from acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Archaea were detected in both polygonal and runnel ponds. We conclude that runnel ponds represent a source of methane from potentially older C, and that they contain methanogenic communities able to use diverse sources of carbon, increasing the risk of augmented methane release under a warmer climate."
https://openalex.org/W2054446204,"The etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is still unclear. The immuno-pathogenic phenomena leading to neurodegeneration are thought to be triggered by environmental (viral?) factors operating on predisposing genetic backgrounds. Among the proposed co-factors are the Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and the potentially neuropathogenic HERV-W/MSRV/Syncytin-1 endogenous retroviruses. The ascertained links between EBV and MS are history of late primary infection, possibly leading to infectious mononucleosis (IM), and high titers of pre-onset IgG against EBV nuclear antigens (anti-EBNA IgG). During MS, there is no evidence of MS-specific EBV expression, while a continuous expression of HERV-Ws occurs, paralleling disease behaviour. We found repeatedly extracellular HERV-W/MSRV and MSRV-specific mRNA sequences in MS patients (in blood, spinal fluid, and brain samples), and MRSV presence/load strikingly paralleled MS stages and active/remission phases. Aim of the study was to verify whether HERV-W might be activated in vivo, in hospitalized young adults with IM symptoms, that were analyzed with respect to expression of HERV-W/MSRV transcripts and proteins. Healthy controls were either EBV-negative or latently EBV-infected with/without high titers of anti-EBNA-1 IgG. The results show that activation of HERV-W/MSRV occurs in blood mononuclear cells of IM patients (2Log10 increase of MSRV-type env mRNA accumulation with respect to EBV-negative controls). When healthy controls are stratified for previous EBV infection (high and low, or no anti-EBNA-1 IgG titers), a direct correlation occurs with MSRV mRNA accumulation. Flow cytometry data show increased percentages of cells exposing surface HERV-Wenv protein, that occur differently in specific cell subsets, and in acute disease and past infection. Thus, the data indicate that the two main links between EBV and MS (IM and high anti-EBNA-1-IgG titers) are paralleled by activation of the potentially neuropathogenic HERV-W/MSRV. These novel findings suggest HERV-W/MSRV activation as the missing link between EBV and MS, and may open new avenues of intervention."

Receptor-cargo docking occurs at the membrane-associated protein Pex14. In human cells, this interaction is mediated by seven conserved diaromatic penta-peptide motifs (WXXX(F/Y) motifs) in the N-terminal half of Pex5 and the N-terminal domain of Pex14. A systematic screening of a Pex5 peptide library by ligand blot analysis revealed a novel Pex5-Pex14 interaction site of Pex5. The novel motif composes the sequence LVAEF with the evolutionarily conserved consensus sequence LVXEF. Replacement of the amino acid LVAEF sequence by alanines strongly affects matrix protein import into peroxisomes in vivo. The NMR structure of a complex of Pex5-(57–71) with the Pex14-N-terminal domain showed that the novel motif binds in a similar α-helical orientation as the WXXX(F/Y) motif but that the tryptophan pocket is now occupied by a leucine residue. Surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed 33 times faster dissociation rates for the LVXEF ligand when compared with a WXXX(F/Y) motif. Surprisingly, substitution of the novel motif with the higher affinity WXXX(F/Y) motif impairs protein import into peroxisomes. These data indicate that the distinct kinetic properties of the novel Pex14-binding site in Pex5 are important for processing of the peroxisomal targeting signal 1 receptor at the peroxisomal membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2024958380,"To investigate the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in osteoclastogenesis in vivo, we eliminated BMPRII in osteoclasts by creating a BMPRII(fl/fl);lysM-Cre mouse strain. Conditional knock-out (cKO) mice are osteopetrotic when compared with WT controls due to a decrease in osteoclast activity. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) isolated from cKO mice are severely inhibited in their capacity to differentiate into mature osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand. We also show that BMP noncanonical (MAPK) and canonical (SMAD) pathways are utilized at different stages of osteoclast differentiation. BMP2 induces p38 phosphorylation in pre-fusion osteoclasts and increases SMAD phosphorylation around osteoclast precursor fusion. Phosphorylation of MAPKs was decreased in differentiated BMMs from cKO animals. Treating BMMs with the SMAD inhibitor dorsomorphin confirms the requirement for the canonical pathway around the time of fusion. These results demonstrate the requirement for BMP signaling in osteoclasts for proper bone homeostasis and also explore the complex signaling mechanisms employed by BMP signaling during osteoclast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2040419687,"This study assessed, for the first time, prevalence estimates for physical and cognitive doping within a single collective of athletes using the randomized response technique (RRT). Furthermore, associations between the use of legal and freely available substances to improve physical and cognitive performance (enhancement) and illicit or banned substances to improve physical and cognitive performance (doping) were examined.An anonymous questionnaire using the unrelated question RRT was used to survey 2,997 recreational triathletes in three sports events (Frankfurt, Regensburg, and Wiesbaden) in Germany. Prior to the survey, statistical power analyses were performed to determine sample size. Logistic regression was used to predict physical and cognitive enhancement and the bootstrap method was used to evaluate differences between the estimated prevalences of physical and cognitive doping.2,987 questionnaires were returned (99.7%). 12-month prevalences for physical and cognitive doping were 13.0% and 15.1%, respectively. The prevalence estimate for physical doping was significantly higher in athletes who also used physical enhancers, as well as in athletes who took part in the European Championship in Frankfurt compared to those who did not. The prevalence estimate for cognitive doping was significantly higher in athletes who also used physical and cognitive enhancers. Moreover, the use of physical and cognitive enhancers were significantly associated and also the use of physical and cognitive doping.The use of substances to improve physical and cognitive performance was associated on both levels of legality (enhancement vs. doping) suggesting that athletes do not use substances for a specific goal but may have a general propensity to enhance. This finding is important for understanding why people use such substances. Consequently, more effective prevention programs against substance abuse and doping could be developed."
https://openalex.org/W2052723502,"Although HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) via early antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven to reduce transmissions among HIV-serodiscordant couples, its full implementation in developing countries remains a challenge. In this study, we determine whether China's current HIV treatment program prevents new HIV infections among discordant couples in rural China.A prospective, longitudinal cohort study was conducted from June 2009 to March 2011, in rural Yunnan. A total of 1,618 HIV-discordant couples were eligible, 1,101 were enrolled, and 813 were followed for an average of 1.4 person-years (PY). Routine ART was prescribed to HIV-positive spouses according to eligibility (CD4<350 cells/µl). Seroconversion was used to determine HIV incidence.A total of 17 seroconversions were documented within 1,127 PY of follow-up, for an overall incidence of 1.5 per 100 PY. Epidemiological and genetic evidence confirmed that all 17 seroconverters were infected via marital secondary sexual transmission. Having an ART-experienced HIV-positive partner was associated with a lower rate of seroconvertion compared with having an ART-naïve HIV-positive partner (0.8 per 100 PY vs. 2.4 per 100 PY, HR = 0.34, 95%CI = 0.12-0.97, p = 0.0436). While we found that ART successfully suppressed plasma viral load to <400 copies/ml in the majority of cases (85.0% vs. 19.5%, p<0.0001 at baseline), we did document five seroconversions among ART-experienced subgroup.ART is associated with a 66% reduction in HIV incidence among discordant couples in our sample, demonstrating the effectiveness of China's HIV treatment program at preventing new infections, and providing support for earlier ART initiation and TasP implementation in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2157524147,"Understanding relationships among species is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through next generation sequencing and related technologies enable phylogeny reconstruction by providing unprecedented numbers of characters for analysis. One approach to SNP-based phylogeny reconstruction is to identify SNPs in a subset of individuals, and then to compile SNPs on an array that can be used to genotype additional samples at hundreds or thousands of sites simultaneously. Although powerful and efficient, this method is subject to ascertainment bias because applying variation discovered in a representative subset to a larger sample favors identification of SNPs with high minor allele frequencies and introduces bias against rare alleles. Here, we demonstrate that the use of hybridization intensity data, rather than genotype calls, reduces the effects of ascertainment bias. Whereas traditional SNP calls assess known variants based on diversity housed in the discovery panel, hybridization intensity data survey variation in the broader sample pool, regardless of whether those variants are present in the initial SNP discovery process. We apply SNP genotype and hybridization intensity data derived from the Vitis9kSNP array developed for grape to show the effects of ascertainment bias and to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among Vitis species. We demonstrate that phylogenies constructed using hybridization intensities suffer less from the distorting effects of ascertainment bias, and are thus more accurate than phylogenies based on genotype calls. Moreover, we reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus Vitis using hybridization data, show that North American subgenus Vitis species are monophyletic, and resolve several previously poorly known relationships among North American species. This study builds on earlier work that applied the Vitis9kSNP array to evolutionary questions within Vitis vinifera and has general implications for addressing ascertainment bias in array-enabled phylogeny reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W1614254789,"Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) has various splicing variants and different subcellular localizations. nNOS can be found also in the nucleus; however, its exact role in this compartment is still not completely defined. In this report, we demonstrate that the PDZ domain allows the recruitment of nNOS to nuclei, thus favoring local NO production, nuclear protein S-nitrosylation, and induction of mitochondrial biogenesis. In particular, overexpression of PDZ-containing nNOS (nNOSα) increases S-nitrosylated CREB with consequent augmented binding on cAMP response element consensus sequence on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator (PGC)-1α promoter. The resulting PGC-1α induction is accompanied by the expression of mitochondrial genes (e.g., TFAM, MtCO1) and increased mitochondrial mass. Importantly, full active nNOS lacking PDZ domain (nNOSβ) does not localize in nuclei and fails in inducing the expression of PGC-1α. Moreover, we substantiate that the mitochondrial biogenesis normally accompanying myogenesis is associated with nuclear translocation of nNOS. We demonstrate that α-Syntrophin, which resides in nuclei of myocytes, functions as the upstream mediator of nuclear nNOS translocation and nNOS-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis. Overall, our results indicate that altered nNOS splicing and nuclear localization could be contributing factors in human muscular diseases associated with mitochondrial impairment."

A variety of tumor-derived factors (TDFs) can suppress DC maturation and function, resulting in defects in the tumor-specific immune response. To identify unknown TDFs that may suppress DCs maturation and function, we established a high-throughput screening technology based on a human liver tumor T7 phage cDNA library and screened all of the proteins derived from hepatoma cells that potentially interact with immature DCs. Growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) was detected and chosen for further study. By incubation of DCs cultures with GDF-15, we demonstrate that GDF-15 can inhibit surface protrusion formation during DC maturation; suppress the membrane expression of CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR on DCs; enhance phagocytosis by DCs; reduce IL-12 and elevate TGF-β1 secretion by DCs; inhibit T cell stimulation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation by DCs. By building tumor-bearing mouse models, we demonstrate that GDF-15 can inhibit the ability of DCs to stimulate a tumor-specific immune response in vivo. These results indicate that GDF-15 may be one of the critical molecules that inhibit DC maturation and function and are involved in tumor immune escape. Thus, GDF-15 may be a novel target in tumor immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2002689931,"Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is a potent and context-dependent regulator of tumor progression. TGFβ promotes the lung metastasis of basal-like (but not the luminal-like) breast cancer. Here, we demonstrated that fascin, a pro-metastasis actin bundling protein, was a direct target of the canonical TGFβ-Smad4 signaling pathway in basal-like breast cancer cells. TGFβ and Smad4 induced fascin overexpression by directly binding to a Smad binding element on the fascin promoter. We identified GATA3, a transcription factor crucial for mammary gland morphogenesis and luminal differentiation, as a negative regulator of TGFβ- and Smad4-induced fascin overexpression. When ectopically expressed in basal-like breast cancer cells, GATA-3 abrogated TGFβ- and Smad4-mediated overexpression of fascin and other TGFβ response genes, invadopodium formation, cell migration, and invasion, suggesting suppression of the canonical TGFβ-Smad signaling axis. Mechanistically, GATA3 abrogated the canonical TGFβ-Smad signaling by abolishing interactions between Smad4 and its DNA binding elements, potentially through physical interactions between the N-terminal of GATA3 and Smad3/4 proteins. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how TGFβ-mediated cell motility and invasiveness are differentially regulated in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2059964813,"Field experiments have shown that observing other people littering, stealing or lying can trigger own misconduct, leading to a decay of social order. However, a large extent of norm violations goes undetected. Hence, the direction of the dynamics crucially depends on actors' beliefs regarding undetected transgressions. Because undetected transgressions are hardly measureable in the field, a laboratory experiment was developed, where the complete prevalence of norm violations, subjective beliefs about them, and their behavioral dynamics is measurable. In the experiment, subjects could lie about their monetary payoffs, estimate the extent of liars in their group and make subsequent lies contingent on information about other people's lies. Results show that informed people who underestimate others' lying increase own lying more than twice and those who overestimate, decrease it by more than half compared to people without information about others' lies. This substantial interaction puts previous results into perspective, showing that information about others' transgressions can trigger dynamics in both directions: the spreading of normative decay and restoring of norm adherence."

Approaches to manipulate protein levels post-translationally are powerful tools to study protein-off effects especially in the haploid malaria parasite where genetic knockouts of essential genes are lethal. We investigated if the auxin-inducible degron system is functional in P. falciparum and found that degron-tagged yellow fluorescent protein levels were efficiently reduced upon addition of auxin which otherwise had no effect on parasite viability. The genetic components required in this conditional approach were co-expressed in P. falciparum by applying the small peptide 2A. 2A is a self-processing peptide from Foot-And-Mouth Disease virus that allows the whole conditional system to be accommodated on a single plasmid vector and ensures stoichiometric expression levels."
https://openalex.org/W1994819810,"Populus species are currently being domesticated through intensive time- and resource-dependent programs for utilization in phytoremediation, wood and paper products, and conversion to biofuels. Poplar leaf rust disease can greatly reduce wood volume. Genetic resistance is effective in reducing economic losses but major resistance loci have been race-specific and can be readily defeated by the pathogen. Developing durable disease resistance requires the identification of non-race-specific loci. In the presented study, area under the disease progress curve was calculated from natural infection of Melampsora ×columbiana in three consecutive years. Association analysis was performed using 412 P. trichocarpa clones genotyped with 29,355 SNPs covering 3,543 genes. We found 40 SNPs within 26 unique genes significantly associated (permutated P<0.05) with poplar rust severity. Moreover, two SNPs were repeated in all three years suggesting non-race-specificity and three additional SNPs were differentially expressed in other poplar rust interactions. These five SNPs were found in genes that have orthologs in Arabidopsis with functionality in pathogen induced transcriptome reprogramming, Ca2+/calmodulin and salicylic acid signaling, and tolerance to reactive oxygen species. The additive effect of non-R gene functional variants may constitute high levels of durable poplar leaf rust resistance. Therefore, these findings are of significance for speeding the genetic improvement of this long-lived, economically important organism."

The presence of the capping protein CapG in podosomes has not yet been investigated. We used an innovative approach to investigate the role of these proteins in macrophage podosomes by means of nanobodies or Camelid single domain antibodies. Nanobodies directed against distinct domains of gelsolin, L-plastin or CapG were stably expressed in macrophage-like THP-1 cells. CapG was not enriched in podosomes. Gelsolin nanobodies had no effect on podosome formation or function but proved very effective in tracing distinct gelsolin populations. One gelsolin nanobody specifically targets actin-bound gelsolin and was effectively enriched in podosomes. A gelsolin nanobody that blocks gelsolin-G-actin interaction was not enriched in podosomes demonstrating that the calcium-activated and actin-bound conformation of gelsolin is a constituent of podosomes. THP-1 cells expressing inhibitory L-plastin nanobodies were hampered in their ability to form stable podosomes. Nanobodies did not perturb Ser5 phosphorylation of L-plastin although phosphorylated L-plastin was highly enriched in podosomes. Furthermore, nanobody-induced inhibition of L-plastin function gave rise to an irregular and unstable actin turnover of podosomes, resulting in diminished degradation of the underlying matrix. Altogether these results indicate that L-plastin is indispensable for podosome formation and function in macrophages."

At the molecular level, circadian output is controlled by a molecular clock composed of positive and negative feedback loops in transcriptional and post-translational processes. CLOCK is a transcription factor known as a central component of the molecular clock feedback loops generating circadian oscillation. Although CLOCK is known to undergo multiple post-translational modifications, the knowledge of their entities remains limited. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a proline-directed serine-threonine kinase that is involved in various neuronal processes. Here, we report that Cdk5 is a novel regulator of CLOCK protein. Cdk5 phosphorylates CLOCK at the Thr-451 and Thr-461 residues in association with transcriptional activation of CLOCK. The Cdk5-dependent regulation of CLOCK function is mediated by alterations of its stability and subcellular distribution. These results suggest that Cdk5 is a novel regulatory component of the core molecular clock machinery.

Mice were housed at a constant temperature and maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. Institute for Cancer Research (CrljBgi:CD-1) mice were purchased from Taconic. Genotype of p35 mice (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv) was analyzed as described previously (22Ohshima T. Ogawa M. Veeranna Hirasawa M.

All procedures were approved by the Pohang University of Science and Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Human CLOCK cDNA cloned in pEGFP-C3 vector and human BMAL1 cDNA in pEGFP-C3, pCDNA 3.1 Myc-His, and mRFP-N1 plasmid vector were used. Site-directed mutagenesis of CLOCK was performed using PCR-based methods, and the PCR primers used were as follows: 5′-gaaagtgattcattatttccagaatatttaaaa-3′ for T181F; 5′-ggggtcgacatgcttttcctcagttcatcaaggaaatg-3′ for T259F; 5′-gaaaggtttgatcacgccccaaccccttctgcc-3′ for S427A; 5′-tttgatcacagcccatttccttctgcctcttct-3′ for T429F; 5′-tcagacccttcctcatttccaaccaagatcccg-3′ for T451F; 5′-ggggcggccgcattcaagctggtaaat gctgcctgggtggaaagctcgt-3′ for T461F; 5′-ccttcctcagaaccaaccaag-3′ for T451E; and 5′-gatacgagcgaaccaccca gg-3′ for T461E. Human Cdk5 and p35 cDNA under CMV promoters were subcloned in pcDNA 3.1 vector to make a bicistronic expression construct. Recombinant GST-fused CLOCK protein fragments were expressed and purified from the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli using glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare). Each purified protein was incubated in the presence or absence of immunoprecipitates from mouse whole brain extracts using an anti-p35 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reactions were carried out in a reaction buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) containing [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) at room temperature for 1 h and then terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling for 10 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and dried, and then phosphorylated CLOCK fragments were detected by autoradiography. The purified recombinant N-terminal His6-tagged human Cdk5 (14–516) and N-terminal GST-tagged human p25 (14–516) were purchased from Millipore. HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. NIH3T3 cells were treated with 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma) for 2 h in culture medium. For stable cell line, transiently transfected cells were selected using G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen). For neuronal cultures, primitive cortices were dissected from E15 mouse embryos in Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Cells were dissociated by treating with DNase I (0.1%) and trypsin (0.25%) for 5 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were diluted in plating medium (Neurobasal, Invitrogen) with 1 m HEPES (pH 7.4) and 10% horse serum and then plated onto 12-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin. After 3 h from plating, plating medium was replaced with culture medium (Neurobasal supplemented with 0.02% B27, 10% glutamine, and antibiotics). Anti-CLOCK (H-276), anti-BMAL1 (N-20), anti-α-tubulin (DM1A), anti-Cdk5 (DC17), anti-p35 (C-19), anti-Lamin-B (G-14), anti-GAPDH (6C5), anti-GFP (B-2), and anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-pThr-Pro (9391) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Cell and brain extracts were prepared with the ELB lysis buffer (250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 15 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. For immunoblot analyses, protein samples in 2× SDS sample buffer were boiled for 10 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. Densitometric analyses were carried out using NIH ImageJ software. Immunoprecipitation was performed on cell and mouse forebrain lysates in ELB lysis buffer. 1 μg of anti-CLOCK or anti-p35 antibodies was added to the lysates and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were purified using protein A-agarose. After 2 h, supernatants were carefully discarded and washed three times with lysis buffer, and SDS sample buffer was added for subsequent SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. For immunofluorescence imaging, cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and blocked with PBS containing 2% goat serum and 1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated and visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 568, and Fluor Alexa 647 (Invitrogen), respectively. Hoechst dye was used for nuclear staining. Images were captured using confocal microscopy (Olympus, FluoView-1000). Cells were trypsinized and harvested in PBS and then resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT). After homogenization with 40 strokes of dounce homogenizer and a brief centrifugation (228 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was collected as a “cytoplasmic fraction.” The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (250 μm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture), on which buffer C (880 μm sucrose, 500 μm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) was carefully layered. The pellet from centrifugation (2800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) was used as the “nuclear fraction.” Cells were plated in 12-well plates 24 h before transfection. They were transiently transfected with pGL3 backbone constructs encoding hPer1 or mPer1-promoter (2.2 kb, containing three E-box elements) fused with a destabilized firefly luciferase and pRL-β-actin constructs (to normalize the efficiency of transfection) with the indicated plasmid DNA. Luciferase activity was measured 36 h later using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA of mouse brain and cultured cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). SuperScript III (Invitrogen) or ImProm-II reverse transcription system (Promega) was used for reverse transcription. Synthesized cDNA was subjected to quantitative PCR with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) using gene-specific primers. The primers were 5′-gccaagaaagatccgtcgtcag-3′ and 5′-tcatgatgatgtccgactccggg-3′ for mPer1, 5′-aggatgtggcaggtaacagg-3′ and 5′-atgctccaaaccacgtaagg-3′ for mPer2, and 5′-cactagagggcatcttgg-3′ and 5′-ttactccttggaggccatg-3′ for GAPDH. The levels of mPer1 and mPer2 mRNA were normalized to those of GAPDH mRNA. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were conducted using one-way ANOVA followed by a Bonferonni post hoc test or a two-tailed t test. All data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software for Windows (version 5). Statistical significance is indicated as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; and ns, not significant. From a bioinformatics screening using the consensus sequence for Cdk5 phosphorylation, (S/T)PX(K/H/R), we detected CLOCK as a potential substrate for Cdk5. Five threonines and one serine residue of CLOCK protein are highly conserved across various vertebrate species (Fig. 1A). To confirm whether Cdk5 can phosphorylate CLOCK, we carried out an immunoprecipitation (IP)-linked in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1C, panel i) (22Ohshima T. Ogawa M. Veeranna Hirasawa M. Longenecker G.

Cdk5 is involved in BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth in hippocampal neurons.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), CLOCK protein was separated into two fragments based on the potential phosphorylation sites and the predicted secondary structure (Fig. 1B), and the residues were mutated to Ala or Phe by site-directed mutagenesis. In the in vitro kinase assay, both two fragments showed phosphorylation signals, and the purified recombinant CLOCK fragment, GST-CLOCK258–477, showed a stronger phosphorylation signal than GST-CLOCK23–244 (Fig. 1C, panel ii). Treatment of roscovitine, a Cdk5 inhibitor, significantly decreased phosphorylation signal (Fig. 1D, panel i). We also tested LiCl, an inhibitor of GSK3 because an interaction between GSK3 and Cdk5 has been reported (32Plattner F. Angelo M. Giese K.P. The roles of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and glycogen synthase kinase 3 in tau hyperphosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25457-25465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). LiCl did not affect the phosphorylation signal, supporting a relative specificity of Cdk5/p35-mediated in vitro phosphorylation of CLOCK (Fig. 1D, panel i). To remove possible contamination of unknown kinase pulled down in the p35 IP process, we also tried in vitro kinase assay using purified recombinant Cdk5 and could observe consistent result with IP-linked in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1D, panel ii). Remarkably, substitutions of the Thr-451 and Thr-461 residues with Phe caused dramatic decreases in the phosphorylation signal, whereas the other residues did not show significant changes, indicating that Thr-451 and Thr-461 are major target residues for the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 1E). As a next step, we tested whether CLOCK is phosphorylated by Cdk5 in more physiological settings. Consistent with the result of in vitro kinase assays, co-expression of Cdk5/p35 significantly increased proline-directed phospho-Thr (pThr-Pro) signal of wild-type CLOCK, whereas T451F/T461F mutation abolished the effect of Cdk5/p35 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, in synchronized cells, the phosphorylation of proline-directed Thr on endogenous CLOCK occurred rhythmically (Fig. 2B), and roscovitine treatment significantly decreased pThr-Pro signal at peak time point (Fig. 2C). To further confirm the phosphorylation of CLOCK protein by Cdk5 in more physiological conditions, we used heterozygote p35 KO mice (22Ohshima T. Ogawa M. Veeranna Hirasawa M. Longenecker G. Ishiguro K. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Mikoshiba K. Synergistic contributions of cyclin-dependant kinase 5/p35 and Reelin/Dab1 to the positioning of cortical neurons in the developing mouse brain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 2764-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Consistently, pThr-Pro signal of CLOCK was significantly decreased in the heterozygote p35 KO mouse brain (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicate that CLOCK can be phosphorylated by Cdk5 in physiological conditions. To further examine the functional link between Cdk5 and CLOCK, we investigated whether CLOCK forms a complex with Cdk5/p35 because many of the Cdk5 substrates show physical interactions (30Li B.S.

In co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, Cdk5 and p35 were detected in the CLOCK immunoprecipitates, suggesting their physical interaction in the cellular environment (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, co-expression of all of these proteins remarkably decreased CLOCK protein. Furthermore, treatment of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, significantly increased Cdk5 and p35 levels in co-immunoprecipitates, suggesting that the interaction is likely to be mediated by p35 and is susceptible to Cdk5 activity-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation (20Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. A decade of CDK5.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Moreover, significant co-localization of CLOCK, Cdk5, and p35 was observed, further supporting their physical interaction (Fig. 3B). Consistently, the association of CLOCK and Cdk5/p35 in the mouse brain extract was also observed by the co-IP experiment (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these results indicate that Cdk5 directly interacts with and phosphorylates CLOCK. As a way to assess the roles for the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of CLOCK, we tested its impact on transcriptional activity of CLOCK. We analyzed CLOCK/BMAL1-dependent transcriptional activation by using the luciferase reporter construct carrying the hPer1 promoter (35Hida A. Koike N. Hirose M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Tei H. The human and mouse Period1 genes: five well-conserved E-boxes additively contribute to the enhancement of mPer1 transcription.Genomics. 2000; 65: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CLOCK and BMAL1 caused a significant increase in transcriptional activity of the hPer1 promoter and the co-expression of Cdk5/p35 further enhanced the effect (Fig. 4A). Importantly, the substitution of Thr-451/461 residues with Phe in CLOCK effectively abolished the effect of Cdk5/p35 co-expression. On the other hand, the phosphorylation mimic mutant CLOCK, T451/461E, showed significantly increased hPer1 promoter-dependent luciferase activity even without the co-expression of Cdk5/p35. We further tested whether endogenous mPer1 mRNA expression is altered by expression or inhibition of Cdk5/p35. The overexpression of Cdk5/p35 significantly increased endogenous mPer1 mRNA, presumably reflecting enhanced transcriptional activity of endogenous CLOCK, and the treatment with roscovitine effectively abrogated the effect (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested to see whether this phenomenon is recapitulated in cortical neurons where indispensable roles for Cdk5 was defined (20Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. A decade of CDK5.Nat. Rev."
https://openalex.org/W1967008558,"Pheromones mediate social interactions among individuals in a wide variety of species, from yeast to mammals. In social insects such as honey bees, pheromone communication systems can be extraordinarily complex and serve to coordinate behaviors among many individuals. One of the primary mediators of social behavior and organization in honey bee colonies is queen pheromone, which is produced by multiple glands. The types and quantities of chemicals produced differ significantly between virgin and mated queens, and recent studies have suggested that, in newly mated queens, insemination volume or quantity can affect pheromone production. Here, we examine the long-term impact of different factors involved during queen insemination on the chemical composition of the mandibular and Dufour's glands, two of the major sources of queen pheromone. Our results demonstrate that carbon dioxide (an anesthetic used in instrumental insemination), physical manipulation of genital tract (presumably mimicking the act of copulation), insemination substance (saline vs. semen), and insemination volume (1 vs. 8 µl) all have long-term effects on mandibular gland chemical profiles. In contrast, Dufour's gland chemical profiles were changed only upon insemination and were not influenced by exposure to carbon dioxide, manipulation, insemination substance or volume. These results suggest that the chemical contents of these two glands are regulated by different neuro-physiological mechanisms. Furthermore, workers responded differently to the different mandibular gland extracts in a choice assay. Although these studies must be validated in naturally mated queens of varying mating quality, our results suggest that while the chemical composition of Dufour's gland is associated with mating status, that of the mandibular glands is associated with both mating status and insemination success. Thus, the queen appears to be signaling both status and reproductive quality to the workers, which may impact worker behavior and physiology as well as social organization and productivity of the colony."
https://openalex.org/W2164703024,"Mycobacterium marinum is a waterborne pathogen responsible for tuberculosis-like infections in ectotherms and is an occasional opportunistic human pathogen. In the environment, M. marinum also interacts with amoebae, which may serve as a natural reservoir for this microorganism. However, the description of mycobacterial determinants in the early interaction with macrophages or amoebae remains elusive. Lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) are cell surface-exposed glycolipids capable of modulating the host immune system, suggesting that they may be involved in the early interactions of M. marinum with macrophages. Herein, we addressed whether LOS composition affects the uptake of M. marinum by professional phagocytes. Mutants with various truncated LOS variants were generated, leading to the identification of several previously uncharacterized biosynthetic genes (wbbL2, MMAR_2321, and MMAR_2331). Biochemical and structural approaches allowed resolving the structures of LOS precursors accumulating in this set of mutants. These strains with structurally defined LOS profiles were then used to infect both macrophages and Acanthamoebae. An inverse correlation between LOS completeness and uptake of mycobacteria by phagocytes was found, allowing the proposal of three mutant classes: class I (papA4), devoid of LOS and highly efficiently phagocytosed; class II, accumulating only early LOS intermediates (wbbL2 and MMAR_2331) and efficiently phagocytosed but less than class I mutants; class III, lacking LOS-IV (losA, MMAR_2319, and MMAR_2321) and phagocytosed similarly to the control strain. These results indicate that phagocytosis is conditioned by the LOS pattern and that the LOS pathway used by M. marinum in macrophages is conserved during infection of amoebae."

The molecular mechanisms that account for conversion of mono- to dimethyl H3K4 (H3K4me1,2) are not well understood. In this investigation, we report that the suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, trithorax (SET) domains from human MLL1 and Drosophila Trithorax undergo robust intramolecular automethylation reactions at an evolutionarily conserved cysteine residue in the active site, which is inhibited by unmodified histone H3. The location of the automethylation in the SET-I subdomain indicates that the MLL1 SET domain possesses significantly more conformational plasticity in solution than suggested by its crystal structure. We also report that MLL1 methylates Ash2L in the absence of histone H3, but only when assembled within a complex with WDR5 and RbBP5, suggesting a restraint for the architectural arrangement of subunits within the complex. Using MLL1 and Ash2L automethylation reactions as probes for histone binding, we observed that both automethylation reactions are significantly inhibited by stoichiometric amounts of unmethylated histone H3, but not by histones previously mono-, di-, or trimethylated at H3K4. These results suggest that the H3K4me1 intermediate does not significantly bind to the MLL1 SET domain during the dimethylation reaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the MLL1 core complex assembled with a catalytically inactive SET domain variant preferentially catalyzes H3K4 dimethylation using the H3K4me1 substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2056778820,"Gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is a gut derived peptide with multiple emerging physiological actions. Effects of pregnancy and lactation on GIP secretion and related gene expression were studied in Wistar rats. Pregnancy moderately increased feeding (p<0.05), whilst lactation substantially increased food intake (p<0.01 to p<0.001). Circulating GIP was unchanged during pregnancy, but non-fasting plasma glucose was significantly (p<0.01) decreased and insulin increased (p<0.05). Lactation was associated with elevated circulating GIP concentrations (p<0.001) without change of glucose or insulin. Oral glucose resulted in a significantly (p<0.001) decreased glycaemic excursion despite similar glucose-induced GIP and insulin concentrations in lactating rats. Pregnant rats had a similar glycaemic excursion but exhibited significantly lowered (p<0.05) GIP accompanied by elevated (p<0.001) insulin levels. Pregnant rats exhibited increased (p<0.001) islet numbers and individual islet areas were enlarged (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in islet alpha-cell areas, but all groups of rats displayed co-expression of glucagon and GIP in alpha-cells. Lactating rats exhibited significantly (p<0.01) increased intestinal weight, whereas intestinal GIP stores were significantly (p<0.01) elevated only in pregnant rats. Gene expression studies in lactating rats revealed prominent (p<0.01 to p<0.001) increases in mammary gland expression of genes involved in energy turnover, including GIP-R. GIP was present in intestines and plasma of 17 day old foetal rats, with substantially raised circulating concentrations in neonates throughout the period of lactation/suckling. These data indicate that changes in the secretion and action of GIP play an important role in metabolic adaptations during pregnancy and especially lactation."
https://openalex.org/W2059096125,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an unconventional membrane-permeable messenger molecule that has been shown to play various roles in the nervous system. How NO modulates ion channels to affect neuronal functions is not well understood. In gastropods, NO has been implicated in regulating the feeding motor program. The buccal motoneuron, B19, of the freshwater pond snail Helisoma trivolvis is active during the hyper-retraction phase of the feeding motor program and is located in the vicinity of NO-producing neurons in the buccal ganglion. Here, we asked whether B19 neurons might serve as direct targets of NO signaling. Previous work established NO as a key regulator of growth cone motility and neuronal excitability in another buccal neuron involved in feeding, the B5 neuron. This raised the question whether NO might modulate the electrical activity and neuronal excitability of B19 neurons as well, and if so whether NO acted on the same or a different set of ion channels in both neurons. To study specific responses of NO on B19 neurons and to eliminate indirect effects contributed by other cells, the majority of experiments were performed on single cultured B19 neurons. Addition of NO donors caused a prolonged depolarization of the membrane potential and an increase in neuronal excitability. The effects of NO could mainly be attributed to the inhibition of two types of calcium-activated potassium channels, apamin-sensitive and iberiotoxin-sensitive potassium channels. NO was found to also cause a depolarization in B19 neurons in situ, but only after NO synthase activity in buccal ganglia had been blocked. The results suggest that NO acts as a critical modulator of neuronal excitability in B19 neurons, and that calcium-activated potassium channels may serve as a common target of NO in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2157445694,"Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis is a highly virulent pathogen for humans especially if inhaled. Consequently, it is considered to be a potential biothreat agent. An experimental vaccine, F. tularensis live vaccine strain, derived from the less virulent subsp. holarctica, was developed more than 50 years ago, but remains unlicensed. Previously, we developed a novel live vaccine strain, by deleting the chaperonin clpB gene from F. tularensis subsp. tularensis strain, SCHU S4. SCHU S4ΔclpB was less virulent for mice than LVS and a more effective vaccine against respiratory challenge with wild type SCHU S4. In the current study, we were interested to determine whether a similar mutant on the less virulent subsp. holarctica background would also outperform LVS in terms of safety and efficacy. To this end, clpB was deleted from clinical holarctica strain, FSC200. FSC200ΔclpB had a significantly higher intranasal LD50 than LVS for BALB/c mice, but replicated to higher numbers at foci of infection after dermal inoculation. Moreover, FSC200ΔclpB killed SCID mice more rapidly than LVS. However, dermal vaccination of BALB/c mice with the former versus the latter induced greater protection against respiratory challenge with SCHU S4. This increased efficacy was associated with enhanced production of pulmonary IL-17 after SCHU S4 challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2061981992,"Hyperphosphatemia is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with CKD are advised to consume a low phosphate diet and are often prescribed phosphate-lowering drug therapy. However, commercially processed food and drinks often contain phosphate compounds, but the phosphate level is not usually provided in the ingredient list, which makes it difficult for CKD patients to choose a correct diet. We conducted a survey of the awareness of food/beverages containing artificially added phosphate among CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis. The subjects were 153 patients (77 males and 76 females; average age 56±11 years) who were randomly selected from the Dialysis Center of Hirosaki City, Japan. The subjects were provided with a list of questions. The survey results showed that 93% of the subjects were aware of the presence of high sugar content in soda, whereas only 25% were aware of the presence of phosphate (phosphoric acid) in such drinks. Despite 78% of the subjects being aware of the detrimental effects of consumption of a high phosphate diet, 43% drank at least 1 to 5 cans of soda per week and about 17% consumed ""fast food"" once each week. We also assessed the immediate effects of high-phosphate containing carbonated soda consumption by determining urinary calcium, phosphate, protein and sugar contents in overnight fasted healthy volunteers (n = 55; average age 20.7±0.3 years old, 20 males and 35 females). Significantly higher urinary calcium (adjusted using urinary creatinine) excretion was found 2 h after consuming 350 ml of carbonated soda compared to the fasting baseline level (0.15±0.01 vs. 0.09±0.01, p = 0.001). Our survey results suggest that CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis are not adequately aware of the hidden source of phosphate in their diet, and emphasize the need for educational initiatives to raise awareness of this issue among CKD patients."

The inhibitors such as imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib are effective drugs but are resistant to some BCR-ABL mutations. The pan-BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor ponatinib exhibits potent activity against native, T315I, and all other clinically relevant mutants, and showed better inhibition than the previously known inhibitors. We have studied the molecular dynamics simulations and calculated solvated interaction energies of native and fourteen mutant BCR-ABL kinases (M244V, G250E, Q252H, Y253F, Y253H, E255K, E255V, T315A, T315I, F317L, F317V, M351T, F359V and H396P) complexed with ponatinib. These studies revealed that the interactions between ponatinib and individual residues in BCR-ABL kinase are also affected due to the remote residue mutations. We report that some residues, Met244, Lys245, Gln252, Gly254, Leu370 and Leu298 do not undergo any conformational changes, while the fluctuations in residues from P-loop, β3-, β5- strands and αC- helix are mainly responsible for ponatinib binding to native and all mutant BCR-ABL kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2060401615,"In the present study, we formally describe Liparis pingxiangensis as a new species from Guangxi, China on the basis of morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses. It is easily distinguished from closely related species by strongly curved column without column wings, and broadly rhombic-elliptic lip with 2 uncinate calli at the base. In particular, it differs most markedly from its congeners in possessing two pollinia attached by long and prominent caudicles (not stipes), to a distinct sticky disc. This type of pollinarium, as far as we know, is not found in any other species of Liparis, and is also unique among the orchids with waxy pollinia. We then proceeded to a phylogenetic analysis to ascertain the systematic position of this enigmatic species. Molecular study based on nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid matK DNA sequence data supports L. pingxiangensis as a distinct species, which forms an independent lineage sister to L. nervosa and its allies (93% BS, 1.00 BPP). In the light of previous work, the findings have important implications for a better understanding of the well-supported pattern mainly based on vegetative features in Malaxideae."

Among 25 altered protein spots that were differentially expressed by at least 2-fold, we confirmed that arsenical pump-driving ATPase, optineurin, and peripherin were cleaved by calpain using in vitro and in vivo cleavage assays. Furthermore, we found that all of these substrates were cleaved in MN9D cells treated with either ionomycin or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, both of which cause a calcium-mediated calpain activation. Their cleavage was blocked by calcium chelator or calpain inhibitors. In addition, calpain-mediated cleavage of these substrates and its inhibition by calpeptin were confirmed in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model of cerebral ischemia, as well as a stereotaxic brain injection model of Parkinson disease.

https://openalex.org/W1982830906,"The effect of coastal upwelling on the recruitment and connectivity of coastal marine populations has rarely been characterized to a level of detail to be included into sound fishery management strategies. The gooseneck barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) fishery at the Cantabrian Coast (Northern Spain) is located at the fringes of the NW Spanish Upwelling system. This fishery is being co-managed through a fine-scale, interspersed set of protected rocks where each rock receives a distinct level of protection. Such interspersion is potentially beneficial, but the extent to which such spacing is consistent with mean larval dispersal distances is as yet unknown. We have simulated the spread of gooseneck barnacle larvae in the Central Cantabrian Coast using a high-resolution time-series of current profiles measured at a nearshore location. During a year of high upwelling activity (2009), theoretical recruitment success was 94% with peak recruitment predicted 56 km west of the emission point. However, for a year of low upwelling activity (2011) theoretical recruitment success dropped to 15.4% and peak recruitment was expected 13 km east of the emission point. This is consistent with a positive correlation between catch rates and the Integrated Upwelling Index, using a 4-year lag to allow recruits to reach commercial size. Furthermore, a net long-term westward larval transport was estimated by means of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences for five populations in the Cantabrian Sea. Our results call into question the role of long distance dispersal, driven by the mesoscale processes in the area, in gooseneck barnacle populations and point to the prevalent role of small-scale, asymmetric connectivity more consistent with the typical scale of the co-management process in this fishery."
https://openalex.org/W2110162353,"Mouse dendritic cells (DCs) can rapidly extend their Class II MHC-positive late endosomal compartments into tubular structures, induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) triggering. Within antigen-presenting DCs, tubular endosomes polarize toward antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells, which are considered beneficial for their activation. Here we describe that also in human DCs, TLR triggering induces tubular late endosomes, labeled by fluorescent LDL. TLR triggering was insufficient for induced tubulation of transferrin-positive endosomal recycling compartments (ERCs) in human monocyte-derived DCs. We studied endosomal remodeling in human DCs in co-cultures of DCs with CD8(+) T cells. Tubulation of ERCs within human DCs requires antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell interaction. Tubular remodeling of endosomes occurs within 30 min of T cell contact and involves ligation of HLA-A2 and ICAM-1 by T cell-expressed T cell receptor and LFA-1, respectively. Disintegration of microtubules or inhibition of endosomal recycling abolished tubular ERCs, which coincided with reduced antigen-dependent CD8(+) T cell activation. Based on these data, we propose that remodeling of transferrin-positive ERCs in human DCs involves both innate and T cell-derived signals."

These subfamilies differ in structure and mode of regulation. All members of the PLC family exhibit a multidomain structure that comprises the catalytic X and Y domains, the protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2) domain, EF-hand domain, and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (except for the sperm-specific PLCζ, which does not have a PH domain). In addition to the core conserved regions, some isoforms also contain subfamily-specific domains that contribute to their specific regulatory mechanisms.

Phospholipase C δ1 (PLC δ1), widely expressed in various cell types (6Suh P.G. Park J.I. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Peak J.C. Katan M. Fukami K. Kataoka T. Yun S. Ryu S.H. Multiple roles of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C isozymes.BMB Rep. 2008; 41: 415-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is one of the smallest PLC isoforms that contain all the core conserved domains (Fig. 1). The crystal structures of the isolated PH domain and the PH domain deletion variant of PLC δ1 have been solved separately (7Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L.

The PH domain of PLC δ1 specifically binds to PIP2 and its headgroup IP3 (9Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J.

U.S.A. 1995; 92: 10472-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and the affinity for the former allows the PH domain to tether the PLC enzyme to the plasma membrane, where the catalysis is carried out in a processive manner (10Lomasney J.W.

The C2 domain of PLC δ1 has been shown to form a ternary complex with calcium and phosphatidylserine (PS), which activates the enzyme (10Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Roffler S.R. King K.

The EF-hand domain of PLC δ1 consists of four consecutive EF-hand motifs, pairwise distributed in two lobes, exhibiting a characteristic helix-loop-helix topology (7Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Crystal structure of a mammalian phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase Cδ.Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The EF-hand motifs, found in all PLC isoforms, are necessary to express full PLC activity, as evidenced by the abolition of PLC activity resulting from the deletion of EF-hand residues (11Ellis M.V.

Based on the structural similarities between the PLC δ1 EF-hand and other calcium-binding EF-hand proteins such as calmodulin, it has been suggested that the EF-hand domain of PLC δ1 might serve a regulatory role through calcium binding. Elsewhere, interactions of the EF-hand domain with free fatty acids have also been suggested (13Kobayashi M. Gryczynski Z. Lukomska J. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Lakowicz J.R. Lomasney J.W.

Additionally, numerous EF-hand motif-containing proteins have been reported to be involved in lipid binding. For example, diacylglycerol kinase-α, a multidomain enzyme, contains the EF-hand motifs and is regulated by lipids and calcium (15Jiang Y. Qian W. Hawes J.W. Walsh J.P. A domain with homology to neuronal calcium sensors is required for calcium-dependent activation of diacylglycerol kinase α.J. Biol.

In this report, we characterize the interactions of the isolated EF-hand domain of PLC δ1 with model membranes. Mutagenesis of specific cationic and hydrophobic residues in the separate EF-hand domain has modest effects on vesicle binding but significant effects on the activity of full-length PLC δ1. The results suggest that the EF-hand domain, particularly the first EF-hand unit, aids the interfacial binding step where substrate occupies the active site. Conserved residues in other PLC EF-hand domains suggest this may be the primary function of this structural unit in all mammalian PLC enzymes. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine,1,2-dimyristoyl-d54-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (d54-DMPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS), l-α-phosphatidylinositol (bovine liver) (PI), l-α-phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (porcine brain) (PIP2), porcine brain sphingomyelin (SM), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissaminerhodamine B sulfonyl) (rhodamine-PE, or Rho-PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.

All mutations of the PLC genes were carried out by QuikChange methodology, using the site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and complementary primers from Operon. The mutated gene sequences were confirmed by Genewiz. The plasmids (either containing the gene for PLCδ1 or the isolated EF-hand domain) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-Codonplus (DE3)-RIL cells. Overexpression of the proteins followed protocols used for a bacterial PI-PLC (18Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F.

After addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.8 mm), the cell suspension was incubated for 20 h at 16 °C. Cells harvested by centrifugation were either stored at −20 °C for later use or lysed immediately after resuspension in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, by sonication on ice. The PLC proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare). After application of the crude E. coli lysate to the column and washing with PBS buffer to remove nonspecifically bound impurities, thrombin was added to the resin, and the mixture was gently shaken at 4 °C for ∼18 h to cleave the GST tag. The PLC protein was eluted from the resin with PBS buffer. The concentration of the proteins was determined by the absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient calculated by the ProtParam software or by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). rEF (19.1 kDa) and mutated rEF proteins were well folded and exhibited similar CD profiles (data not shown). CD spectra were acquired on an AVIV 420 spectrometer (Biomedical Inc.) as described previously (13Kobayashi M. Gryczynski Z. Lukomska J. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Lakowicz J.R. Lomasney J.W. Spectroscopic characterization of the EF-hand domain of phospholipase C δ1: identification of a lipid interacting domain.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 440: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Purified rEF or mutants with a single cysteine (C148S and C188S) were stored at 8–10 mg/ml in PBS buffer with 2 mm DTT, pH 7.4. Prior to reaction with MTSL, the solutions were passed through a Micro Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with PBS to remove the DTT. The protein was mixed with ∼5-fold excess of MTSL compared with the total number of cysteines. Excess MTSL was removed by three consecutive Micro Bio-Spin 6 columns equilibrated with 10 mm borate, pH 7.8 (in D2O for 1H NMR experiments). CD analysis of the spin-labeled proteins showed that they were the same as unlabeled rRF in terms of secondary structure and thermal stability. Dry films prepared from organic stocks of the desired component lipids were lyophilized for at least 3 h, rehydrated with buffer, and then dispersed by vortexing. LUVs were prepared by at least 20 passages of the lipid solution through polycarbonate membranes (0.1 μm pore diameter) using a Mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.). SUVs were prepared by intermittent probe sonication (20–30 s per interval) of the lipid solution in an ice bath using a Branson Sonifier Cell Disrupter until the vesicle solution became translucent. SUV samples ranging from 0.025 to 6 mm total lipid were mixed with a fixed amount of rEF (14–16 μm) in 20 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, in the absence or presence of 0.15 m NaCl. The same amount of rEF in the absence of vesicles served as a control. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the protein/SUV mixtures were centrifuged through an Amicon Ultra 0.5-ml centrifugal filter with a molecular mass cutoff of 100 kDa (Millipore). Free protein eluted through the membrane was quantified by SDS-PAGE or by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The gels were imaged by EAGLE EYE from Stratagene, and the rEF intensities were quantified by ImageJ. The fraction of free protein (Ef/ET, where ET is the total amount of protein, obtained from the control incubated without vesicles) at each SUV concentration was calculated. The fraction of EF protein bound to vesicles, Eb/ET, was then calculated as (1 − Ef/ET), and the apparent dissociation constant (KD) was estimated as follows: Eb/ET = fmax[PL]/([PL] + KD), where fmax is the maximum fraction bound. FRET was used to monitor binding of 6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)hexanoate)-labeled PLC δ1 (labeled on the N-terminal amino group with succinimidyl 6-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)hexanoate) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The protein had a labeling ratio of 90 ± 20%, determined by comparing the absorption of the protein at 280 nm with that of the probe at 465 nm. The PLC δ1 was kept at a fixed concentration (0.5 μm), and vesicles containing the phospholipids POPC/DOPMe or POPC/DOPG (1:1 and 7:3), with ∼0.5 mol % Rho-PE, were titrated into the protein solution at 25 °C. The excitation was set at 465 nm with a 2-mm slit width, and the fluorescence emission was measured at 535 nm with a slit width of 5 nm. The decrease in donor fluorescence (Fd − Fda)/Fd, where Fd and Fda are the fluorescence intensities of the donor PLCδ1 in the absence and presence of Rho-PE-labeled vesicles, was used to estimate an apparent KD. The specific activity of PLC δ1 toward PI was measured by monitoring myo-inositol 1,2-(cyclic)-phosphate (cIP) and inositol 1-phosphate (I-1-P) generation at fixed time points using 31P NMR spectroscopy (at 242.8 MHz on a Varian VNMRS 600 spectrometer without 1H decoupling). The substrate PI was embedded in physiological membrane mimicking LUVs (19Landgraf K.E. Malmberg N.J. Falke J.J. Effect of PIP2 binding on the membrane docking geometry of PKCR C2 domain: an EPR site-directed spin-labeling and relaxation study.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 8301-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with a total lipid concentration of 10 or 0.5 mm. The amount of PLC δ1 added (1–2 μg) was adjusted so that less than 20% of the PI was hydrolyzed within 30 min. The reaction was carried out in 50 mm HEPES buffer with 0.5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.5, unless otherwise specified. When the total lipid concentration was 5 or 10 mm, 300 or 400 μl of enzyme/vesicle mixture was incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 10 vol % acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA, and a few drops of Triton X-100. Samples were then stored at −20 °C before NMR analysis. Prior to NMR measurement, samples were subjected to the following treatment: (i) additional Triton X-100 was added when necessary to clarify the solution, ensuring solubilization of all phospholipid components; (ii) the sample pH was adjusted to 6.1–6.5 by adding NaOH, so that the 31P peak for bulk phosphodiester (PE, PC, SM, PS, and PI that was not hydrolyzed) was well resolved from the I-1-P peak (whose chemical shift varies depending on pH); (iii) 200 μl of D2O was added to each sample. The cIP and I-1-P peaks were integrated and compared with the integral for the phosphodiester peak. When the total lipid concentration was 0.5 mm, 5 ml of the enzyme/LUV mixture with 0.1 μmol of glucose 6-phosphate added as an internal standard was extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) to remove lipids (PE, PC, SM, CH, and PI that was not hydrolyzed). The aqueous solution, containing products cIP and I-1-P, as well as internal standard, was frozen and lyophilized overnight. The dried solids were dissolved in D2O. The cIP and I-1-P peaks were integrated and compared with the standard. In all the PLC δ1 assays, both the intermediate product cIP and the final product I-1-P were observed. The specific activity was calculated based on the sum of both products. EF proteins (rEF or spin-labeled rEF, C148S, or C188S) were titrated into POPC or POPC/DOPA (1:1) SUVs in 10 mm borate, pH 7.8, in D2O, and 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 37 °C on a Varian VNMRS 600 spectrometer. Line widths of the acyl chain bulk methylenes (1.4 ppm) and terminal methyl groups (1.0 ppm) were measured at half-height. Errors in measuring the line widths for those two resonances were typically ±2 Hz in a given titration experiment. The line widths for the same resonances when titrated with unlabeled rEF were consistent with a measurement error of that magnitude. The exact concentrations of the proteins were determined after the NMR experiments using DC protein assay. The apparatus for carrying out high resolution field cycling spin-lattice relaxation (R1 is the spin-lattice relaxation rate and is equal to 1/T1) studies has been described in detail (20Redfield A.G. High resolution NMR field-cycling device for full-range relaxation and structural studies of biopolymers on a shared commercial instrument.J. Biomol. NMR. 2012; 52: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the current system is capable of moving the sample, attached to a push-rod that is driven by a linear motor, to a position up to the top of the main magnet and back down to the probe in ∼350 ms. The magnetic fields at positions between the probe and above the superconducting magnet vary from 10 T to nearly zero. This device allows us to prime the spins in the probe for 2–4 s, then shuttle the sample to a defined lower field where the nuclear spins can relax for a variable time, and then shuttle it back into the probe for application of a pulse and read-out of the magnetization lost as a function of the delay time at the lower field. High field read-out is critical for maintaining chemical shift differences when there are multiple nuclei of interest, in this case 31P for DOPA and POPC in the same SUV. For phospholipids, the dipolar contribution of nearby protons to relaxation of 31P is small at high fields but is easily measured below 2 T. Theory describing the field dependence of R1 provides a way to extract correlation times and limiting relaxation rates for different types of motions (21Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. High resolution 31P field cycling as a probe of phospholipid dynamics.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 13765-13777Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Roberts M.F. Redfield A.G. Phospholipid bilayer surface configuration probed quantitatively by 31P field-cycling NMR.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17066-17071Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the field cycling experiments reported here, electron spin labels, each containing an unpaired electron spin radical that can be a potent contributor to the R1 rate, are introduced onto the protein. Their effects on the 31P nuclei are much larger than nearby protons and can be measured over distances to 25 Å or more (depending on protein and phospholipid concentrations). The closer the spin label is to the 31P, the stronger the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The magnetic interaction between 31P and unpaired electron is modulated by the tumbling of the vesicles in solution, and this is sensed at low magnetic fields, less than 0.03 T for small unilamellar vesicles. R1 for the phospholipids in the vesicles at different low fields is measured in the absence and again in the presence of spin-labeled rEF. If the phospholipid and the protein stay associated for about 1–2 μs, then there will be a distance-dependent PRE. This can vary for different phospholipids in a mixture if the protein has discrete binding sites for the different lipids (23Pu M. Orr A. Redfield A.G. Roberts M.F. Defining specific lipid binding sites for a peripheral membrane protein in situ using subtesla field-cycling NMR.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 26916-26922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The field dependence of the extra paramagnetic relaxation enhancement or PRE is fit to Equation 1, ΔR1(ωP)=RP•e(0)/(1+ωP2τP•e2)+C(Eq. 1) where RP-e(0) is the low field limit of ΔR1; ωP is the angular frequency of 31P; τP-e is the correlation time of the dipolar relaxation of 31P by the nitroxide unpaired electron. The c term represents either a limiting chemical shift anisotropy contribution or a faster discrete dipolar interaction when at the lower fields (ωP2τP-e2 <1). For a single spin label attached to a protein, an estimate of the distance between the 31P and the spin label can be obtained (23Pu M. Orr A. Redfield A.G. Roberts M.F.

Field cycling profiles and evaluating the ΔR1 attributed to the presence of the spin label can be used to evaluate a distance for the phospholipids with the single cysteine mutants, either C148S or C188S, of the EF-hand domain. The isolated EF-hand domain of PLC δ1 has previously been expressed and shown to interact with free fatty acids (13Kobayashi M. Gryczynski Z. Lukomska J. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Lakowicz J.R. Lomasney J.W. Spectroscopic characterization of the EF-hand domain of phospholipase C δ1: identification of a lipid interacting domain.Arch. Biochem.

Identification of hydrophobic interactions between proteins and lipids: free fatty acids activate phospholipase C δ1 via allosterism.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7522-7533Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To further explore its binding partners, interaction of rEF with various phospholipid species was examined by a centrifugation-filtration vesicle binding assay. Initial binding experiments using intrinsic fluorescence changes or a FRET assay were compromised by light scattering at the higher phospholipid concentrations so that the bulk partitioning assay using centrifugation-filtration to separate free and bound rEF was deemed the best choice. rEF has virtually no affinity for POPC SUVs (Fig. 2A). However, with POPA in the vesicles, the amount of the free rEF decreased proportional to the amount of SUVs present (Fig. 2B). The same trend was observed when SUVs containing other anionic phospholipids (PS or PG) were mixed with rEF. The variation in the amount of rEF partitioned onto SUVs was fit with a hyperbolic curve to generate an apparent dissociation constant, KD (two examples are given in Fig. 2C). This is not a true dissociation constant but an apparent KD value that provides a way of comparing affinities of rEF for various model membrane surfaces. As listed in Table 1, rEF bound to SUVs containing a 0.5-mol fraction anionic phospholipid (PA, PS, and PG) with moderate KD values (on the order of 0.1–0.2 mm) (Table 1). In the presence of 0.15 m NaCl, the KD values were decreased slightly compared with those in the absence of NaCl, indicating that the binding of rEF to SUVs containing anionic phospholipids is not solely electrostatic but that there is a hydrophobic component as well. The affinity of rEF for LUVs of POPA/POPC (1:1), although less accurate, was comparable with that for SUVs.TABLE 1Apparent dissociation constants for EF-hand domain binding to anionic phospholipid-containing SUVs in the absence or presence of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.5 mm CaCl2SUVsNaClCaCl2Apparent KDaThis is the total concentration of phospholipids present for half of maximum binding.

The presence of 0.5 mm Ca2+ did not dramatically affect binding of rEF to SUVs containing PS (Table 1). However, there was loss of binding to PC/PA SUVs with Ca2+ present. No calcium ion is found associated with the EF-hand domain that is visible in crystal structures of PLC δ1, even though the enzyme is soaked in calcium or its analogs (7Essen L.O. Perisic O.

Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced by certain E. faecalis clinical isolates, and it is active against other E. faecalis strains. Our genetic analyses demonstrated that the extracellular products of the bacL1 and bacA genes, which are encoded in the Bac41 operon, coordinately express the bacteriocin activity against E. faecalis. In this study, we investigated the molecular functions of the BacL1 and BacA proteins. Immunoblotting and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that BacL1 and BacA are secreted without any processing. The coincidental treatment with the recombinant BacL1 and BacA showed complete bacteriocin activity against E. faecalis, but neither BacL1 nor BacA protein alone showed the bacteriocin activity. Interestingly, BacL1 alone demonstrated substantial degrading activity against the cell wall fraction of E. faecalis in the absence of BacA. Furthermore, MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that BacL1 has a peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity via a NlpC/P60 homology domain. These results collectively suggest that BacL1 serves as a peptidoglycan hydrolase and, when BacA is present, results in the lysis of viable E. faecalis cells.

Tagg J.R. Ray B. Bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria.Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 171-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Meanwhile, bacteriocin-producing bacteria also have specific immunity factors that protect the producer strain from being killed by the cognate bacteriocin. The production of bacteriocin is thought to provide a competitive advantage to the producer strain in an ecological niche that has closely related strains present. Many clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis have been reported to produce various bacteriocins (2Clewell D.B. Plasmids, drug resistance, and gene transfer in the genus Streptococcus.Microbiol. Rev. 1981; 45: 409-436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ike Y. Hashimoto H. Clewell D.B. High incidence of hemolysin production by Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis strains associated with human parenteral infections.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1987; 25: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enterococcal bacteriocins are often encoded on a pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid (4Tomita H. Kamei E. Ike Y.

The β-hemolysin/bacteriocin (cytolysin), which belongs to class 1-type bacteriocins, shows not only bactericidal activity but also hemolytic activity against mammalian cells, and it is associated with virulence in an animal model (9Ike Y.

Class 2 is active against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including E. faecalis, the other Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The class 2 bacteriocins contain the peptide antibiotics AS-48 (12Martínez-Bueno M. Maqueda M. Gálvez A. Samyn B. Van Beeumen J. Coyette J. Valdivia E.

Our subsequent epidemiologic study showed that more than 50% of E. faecalis clinical strains, but not laboratory strains, produce Bac41 (17Zheng B. Tomita H. Inoue T. Ike Y.

Agents Chemother. 2009; 53: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our previous genetic analysis revealed several features of Bac41. Bac41 is specifically active only against E. faecalis and has no activity against Enterococcus faecium. The determinant of Bac41 is encoded in the EcoRI fragments A (12.6 kbp) and H (3.5 kbp) of pYI14 and consists of six genes, including bacL1, bacL2, bacA, and bacI. The bacteriocin activity of Bac41 is complementarily expressed by two extracellular components: the bacL1- and bacA-encoded proteins, BacL1 and BacA. ORF bacL2 is required for the expression of bacL1 and bacL2 itself (18Tomita, H., Todokoro, D., Ike, Y., (2010) Genetic analysis of the bacteriocin 41 encoded on the Enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pYI14. 3rd International ASM Conference on Enterococci, Abstr. 30B, pp. 37–38, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

BacL1 is a 595-amino acid protein (64.5 kDa) consisting of two domains located in the 3–140 and 163–315 amino acid regions of the amino acid sequence. The domains show homology to the bacteriophage-type peptidoglycan hydrolase and the NlpC/P60 family peptidoglycan hydrolase, respectively (19Pecenková T. Benes V. Paces J. Vlcek C. Paces V.

BacA is a 726-amino acid protein (79.1 kDa) showing a significant degree of homology to YbfG and YkuF of Bacillus subtilis (23Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V.

The functions of YbfG and YkuF are unknown, but a putative peptidoglycan-binding domain and a domain similar to the GH25 family peptidoglycan hydrolase are detected in the 81–140 and 208–491 amino acid regions of BacA, respectively (4Tomita H.

The N termini of BacL1 and BacA are predicted to have a signal peptide, presumed to be secreted in a sec-dependent manner (4Tomita H. Kamei E. Ike Y.

These investigations suggest that BacL1 and BacA are cell wall lytic enzymes able to induce the bacteriolytic killing of target cells. However, the precise molecular functions of BacL1 and BacA remain elusive. In this report, we demonstrate the biochemical analysis of BacL1 and BacA and reveal that BacL1 has the enzymatic activity of a peptidoglycan hydrolase. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table 1. The oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table 2. A standard plasmid DNA methodology was used (25Sambrook J.J. Russell D.D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). E. faecalis and Escherichia coli strains were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (THB; Difco) and Luria-Bertani medium (LB; Difco) at 37 °C, respectively (26Dunny G.M. Craig R.A. Carron R.L. Clewell D.B.

E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. The antibiotic concentrations for the selection of Escherichia coli were as follows: ampicillin, 100 μg ml−1; chloramphenicol, 30 μg ml−1. The concentration of chloramphenicol for the selection of E. faecalis was 20 μg ml−1. All antibiotics were obtained from Sigma. Anti-BacL1 and -BacA sera were prepared by immunization of rabbits with recombinant BacL1-His and BacA-His proteins, respectively (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA).

The constructed plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the desired sequence had been inserted. Overnight cultures of E. faecalis strains were inoculated into fresh THB broth and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time. The bacterial pellet was resuspended with distilled water, and the culture supernatant was filtered (0.22 μm; Millipore (Billerica, MA)). Trichloroacetic acid was then added to each sample at a final concentration of 10%. After incubation on ice for 15 min, the supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The precipitated protein samples were neutralized with 2 m Tris-base and dissolved in sample buffer. The resulting protein samples were separated with SDS-PAGE and then subjected to CBB staining or immunoblot analysis. An overnight culture of E. faecalis expressing the recombinant protein was inoculated into 500 ml of fresh THB and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The E. coli BL21 Rosetta strains expressing recombinant protein were inoculated into 500 ml of fresh LB and cultured at 37 °C with shaking until an optical density of 0.5–0.7 at 600 nm was obtained. Then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for induction, following an additional incubation at 30 °C with shaking for 3 h. The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mg ml−1 lysozyme, pH 8.0) with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Complete MINI EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) to be enzymatically lysed at 37 °C for 30 min. The bacterial suspension was further lysed by sonication on ice using a sonicator (Ultrasonic Disruptor UD-201; TOMY, Tokyo, Japan) set at power level 6, at 40% duty, for 20 min and then clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting soluble lysate was added to 1 ml of 50% Ni-NTA nickel chromatography resin (Ni-NTA purification system; Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer, and the column was washed with 40 ml of wash buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The His6-tagged protein was eluted with elution buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The eluent containing the His6-tagged protein was subjected to ultracentrifugation using Amicon Ultra (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and resuspended in PBS. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay kit) using BSA (Sigma) as the standard. An overnight culture of E. faecalis expressing the recombinant protein was inoculated to 500 ml of fresh THB and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The culture supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 1,300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and filtered (0.22 μm; Millipore). The supernatant sample was added to 1 ml of 50% Ni-NTA nickel chromatography resin (Ni-NTA purification system; Invitrogen), and the His6-tagged protein was eluted as described above. The His6-tagged protein prepared from the supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.2-μm pore nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore) and stained with CBB. The target band was excised and subjected to Edman degradation amino acid sequence analysis to determine its N-terminal structure (GENOSTAFF, Tokyo, Japan). The soft agar assay for bacteriocin activity was performed as described previously (27Ike Y. Clewell D.B. Segarra R.A. Gilmore M.S. Genetic analysis of the pAD1 hemolysin/bacteriocin determinant in Enterococcus faecalis. Tn917 insertional mutagenesis and cloning.J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of the bacterial culture supernatant or recombinant protein sample was spotted onto THB soft agar (0.75%) containing the indicator strain and was then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. For the liquid phase bactericidal assay, an overnight culture of indicator strain was diluted with fresh THB and adjusted to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2, and then the recombinant proteins were added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C. The change in optical density at 600 nm was monitored by a spectrometer (DU730, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). For the morphological analysis, the bacterial suspension that had been treated with recombinant protein was sampled and subjected to Gram-staining (Faber G, Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) and then analyzed by microscopy (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The zymogram gel was prepared by adding a sample of autoclaved indicator strain, E. faecalis OG1S, to a final optical density of 0.4 at 600 nm. The protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using the zymogram gel prepared above. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100 at room temperature with gentle shaking for 1 h and then incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 36 h (28Sugai M.

https://openalex.org/W2037861688,"Paleoindian unifacial stone tools frequently exhibit distinct, sharp projections, known as ""spurs"". During the last two decades, a theoretically and empirically informed interpretation-based on individual artifact analysis, use-wear, tool-production techniques, and studies of resharpening-suggested that spurs were sometimes created intentionally via retouch, and other times created incidentally via resharpening or knapping accidents. However, more recently Weedman strongly criticized the inference that Paleoindian spurs were ever intentionally produced or served a functional purpose, and asserted that ethnographic research ""demonstrates that the presence of so called 'graver' spurs does not have a functional significance."" While ethnographic data cannot serve as a direct test of the archaeological record, we used Weedman's ethnographic observations to create two quantitative predictions of the Paleoindian archaeological record in order to directly examine the hypothesis that Paleoindian spurs were predominantly accidents occurring incidentally via resharpening and reshaping. The first prediction is that the frequency of spurs should increase as tool reduction proceeds. The second prediction is that the frequency of spurs should increase as tool breakage increases. An examination of 563 unbroken tools and 629 tool fragments from the Clovis archaeological record of the North American Lower Great Lakes region showed that neither prediction was consistent with the notion that spurs were predominately accidents. Instead, our results support the prevailing viewpoint that spurs were sometimes created intentionally via retouch, and other times, created incidentally via resharpening or knapping accidents. Behaviorally, this result is consistent with the notion that unifacial stone tools were multifunctional implements that enhanced the mobile lifestyle of Pleistocene hunter-gatherers."
https://openalex.org/W2089577287,"To investigate the effect of sheep dung on soil carbon (C) sequestration, a 152 days incubation experiment was conducted with soils from two different Inner Mongolian grasslands, i.e. a Leymus chinensis dominated grassland representing the climax community (2.1% organic matter content) and a heavily degraded Artemisia frigida dominated community (1.3% organic matter content). Dung was collected from sheep either fed on L. chinensis (C3 plant with δ¹³C = -26.8‰; dung δ¹³C = -26.2‰) or Cleistogenes squarrosa (C₄ plant with δ¹³C = -14.6‰; dung δ¹³C = -15.7‰). Fresh C₃ and C₄ sheep dung was mixed with the two grassland soils and incubated under controlled conditions for analysis of ¹³C-CO₂ emissions. Soil samples were taken at days 17, 43, 86, 127 and 152 after sheep dung addition to detect the δ¹³C signal in soil and dung components. Analysis revealed that 16.9% and 16.6% of the sheep dung C had decomposed, of which 3.5% and 2.8% was sequestrated in the soils of L. chinensis and A. frigida grasslands, respectively, while the remaining decomposed sheep dung was emitted as CO₂. The cumulative amounts of C respired from dung treated soils during 152 days were 7-8 times higher than in the un-amended controls. In both grassland soils, ca. 60% of the evolved CO₂ originated from the decomposing sheep dung and 40% from the native soil C. Priming effects of soil C decomposition were observed in both soils, i.e. 1.4 g and 1.6 g additional soil C kg⁻¹ dry soil had been emitted as CO₂ for the L. chinensis and A. frigida soils, respectively. Hence, the net C losses from L. chinensis and A. frigida soils were 0.6 g and 0.9 g C kg⁻¹ soil, which was 2.6% and 7.0% of the total C in L. chinensis and A. frigida grasslands soils, respectively. Our results suggest that grazing of degraded Inner Mongolian pastures may cause a net soil C loss due to the positive priming effect, thereby accelerating soil deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W1971745589,"The aim of this study was to establish the sputum inflammatory profile and changes in levels of leukotriene B₄ (LTB₄) and a panel of Th1/Th2 cytokines in subjects with suspected occupational asthma (OA) following specific inhalation challenge (SIC) to high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) agents.Fifty-one consecutive subjects undergoing SIC for suspected OA were enrolled. Sputum induction was performed the day before and 24 h after exposure to the offending agent. Total and differential cell counts were assessed. LTB₄ and a 10 Th1/Th2 cytokines were measured in sputum supernatant.Thirty-four patients tested positive to SIC and were diagnosed with OA (in 10 due to HMW agents and in 24 to LMW agents). SIC was negative in 17 subjects. As compared to baseline an increase was found in the percentage of sputum eosinophils and neutrophils, and in IL-10 concentration after SIC (p = 0.0078, p = 0.0195, and p = 0.046, respectively), and a decrease was seen in LTB₄ level (p = 0.0078) in patients with OA due to HMW agents. An increase in the percentage of sputum neutrophils after SIC (p = 0.0040) was observed in subjects without OA exposed to LMW agents. IL-8 levels after SIC were higher in patients without OA compared with patients with OA (p = 0.0146).When conducting airway inflammation studies in OA, patients should be divided according to the causal agent (HMW or LMW). In OA patients exposed to HMW agents, an increase in the number of neutrophils can be found in parallel to the increase of eosinophils, although this does not contradict an IgE-mediated mechanism. Exposure to LMW agents can result in increased neutrophilic inflammation in patients with airway diseases unrelated to OA. There is variability in the responses observed in patients with OA exposed to LMW agents."
https://openalex.org/W2023610937,"Self-standing biocompatible films have yet to be prepared by physical or chemical vapor deposition assisted by plasma polymerization because gaseous monomers have thus far been used to create only polymer membranes. Using a nongaseous monomer, we previously found a simple fabrication method for a free-standing thin film prepared from solution by plasma polymerization, and a nano-suit made by polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate can render multicellular organisms highly tolerant to high vacuum. Here we report thin films prepared by plasma polymerization from various monomer solutions. The films had a flat surface at the irradiated site and were similar to films produced by vapor deposition of gaseous monomers. However, they also exhibited unique characteristics, such as a pinhole-free surface, transparency, solvent stability, flexibility, and a unique out-of-plane molecular density gradient from the irradiated to the unirradiated surface of the film. Additionally, covering mosquito larvae with the films protected the shape of the organism and kept them alive under the high vacuum conditions in a field emission-scanning electron microscope. Our method will be useful for numerous applications, particularly in the biological sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2040951253,"Fabry disease is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by defects in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene, and heterogeneous mutations lead to quantitative and/or qualitative defects in GLA protein in male patients with Fabry disease. Random X-chromosomal inactivation modifies the clinical and biochemical features of female patients with Fabry disease. Functional polymorphisms have been frequently reported in recent times, and these increase the difficulty of understanding the pathogenetic basis of the disease. To date, GLA protein level has been measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, ELISA is not highly sensitive due to the high background noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel application of the immuno-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method (termed Multiple Simultaneous Tag [MUSTag]) for measurement of the GLA protein level in blood samples. We compared the sensitivities of the MUSTag method with plates or magnetic beads with those of ELISA for recombinant human GLA and found that the apparent maximal sensitivity was higher for the former than for the latter. We then measured the GLA concentrations in serum and plasma from male patients with classic Fabry disease (Male Fabry), females with Fabry disease (Female Fabry), male subjects harboring the functional polymorphism p.E66Q (E66Q), and control (Control) subjects. Our results revealed that compared to the MUSTag plate and ELISA, the MUSTag beads assay afforded a clearer estimation of the GLA protein levels in the serum and plasma with minimal or no background noise, although all the methods could differentiate between the Male Fabry, E66Q, and Control groups. The Female Fabry group showed characteristic heterogeneity, which was consistent with the X-linked inheritance. This novel method is expected to be useful for the sensitive determination of GLA level in blood and elucidation of the pathogenetic basis of Fabry disease."
https://openalex.org/W2060318934,"Phosphorylation is the most common mechanism for the propagation of intracellular signals. Protein phosphatases and protein kinases play a dynamic antagonistic role in protein phosphorylation. Protein phosphatases make up a significant fraction of eukaryotic proteome. In this article, we report the identification and analysis of protein phosphatases in the intracellular parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Based on an in silico analysis, we classified 250 non-redundant protein phosphatases in E. histolytica. The phosphotome of E. histolytica is 3.1% of its proteome and 1.3 times of the human phosphotome. In this extensive study, we identified 42 new putative phosphatases (39 hypothetical proteins and 3 pseudophosphatases). The presence of pseudophosphatases may have an important role in virulence of E. histolytica. A comprehensive phosphotome analysis of E. histolytica shows spectacular low similarity to human phosphatases, making them potent candidates for drug target."
https://openalex.org/W2041532041,"The large Surinamese migrant population in the Netherlands is a major risk group for urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection. Suriname, a former Dutch colony, also has a high prevalence of C. trachomatis. Surinamese migrants travel extensively between the Netherlands and Suriname. Our objective was to assess whether the Surinamese migrants in the Netherlands form a bridge population facilitating transmission of C. trachomatis between Suriname and the Netherlands. If so, joint prevention campaigns involving both countries might be required. Between March 2008 and July 2010, participants were recruited at clinics in Paramaribo, Suriname and in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants were grouped as native Surinamese, native Dutch, Surinamese migrant, Dutch migrant, or Other, based on country of residence and country of birth of the participant and of their parents. Risk behavior, such as sexual mixing between ethnic groups, was recorded and C. trachomatis positive samples were typed through multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A minimum spanning tree of samples from 426 participants showed four MLST clusters. The MLST strain distribution of Surinamese migrants differed significantly from both the native Surinamese and Dutch populations, but was not an intermediate state between these two populations. Sexual mixing between the Surinamese migrants and the Dutch and Surinamese natives occurred frequently. Yet, the MLST cluster distribution did not differ significantly between participants who mixed and those who did not. Sexual mixing occurred between Surinamese migrants in Amsterdam and the native populations of Suriname and the Netherlands. These migrants, however, did not seem to form an effective bridge population for C. trachomatis transmission between the native populations. Although our data do not seem to justify the need for joint campaigns to reduce the transmission of C. trachomatis strains between both countries, intensified preventive campaigns to decrease the C. trachomatis burden are required, both in Suriname and in the Netherlands."
https://openalex.org/W2061618728,"Mutations in ITGA2B and ITGB3 cause Glanzmann thrombasthenia, an inherited bleeding disorder in which platelets fail to aggregate when stimulated. Whereas an absence of expression or qualitative defects of αIIbβ3 mainly affect platelets and megakaryocytes, αvβ3 has a widespread tissue distribution. Little is known of how amino acid substitutions of β3 comparatively affect the expression and structure of both integrins. We now report computer modelling including molecular dynamics simulations of extracellular head domains of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 to determine the role of a novel β3 Pro189Ser (P163S in the mature protein) substitution that abrogates αIIbβ3 expression in platelets while allowing synthesis of αvβ3. Transfection of wild-type and mutated integrins in CHO cells confirmed that only αvβ3 surface expression was maintained. Modeling initially confirmed that replacement of αIIb by αv in the dimer results in a significant decrease in surface contacts at the subunit interface. For αIIbβ3, the presence of β3S163 specifically displaces an α-helix starting at position 259 and interacting with β3R261 while there is a moderate 11% increase in intra-subunit H-bonds and a very weak decrease in the global H-bond network. In contrast, for αvβ3, S163 has different effects with β3R261 coming deeper into the propeller with a 43% increase in intra-subunit H-bonds but with little effect on the global H-bond network. Compared to the WT integrins, the P163S mutation induces a small increase in the inter-subunit fluctuations for αIIbβ3 but a more rigid structure for αvβ3. Overall, this mutation stabilizes αvβ3 despite preventing αIIbβ3 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2023528341,"Jumping on trampolines is a popular backyard recreation. In some trampoline games (e.g., ""seat drop war""), when two people land on the trampoline with only a small time-lag, one person bounces much higher than the other, as if energy has been transferred from one to the other. First, we illustrate this energy-transfer in a table-top demonstration, consisting of two balls dropped onto a mini-trampoline, landing almost simultaneously, sometimes resulting in one ball bouncing much higher than the other. Next, using a simple mathematical model of two masses bouncing passively on a massless trampoline with no dissipation, we show that with specific landing conditions, it is possible to transfer all the kinetic energy of one mass to the other through the trampoline - in a single bounce. For human-like parameters, starting with equal energy, the energy transfer is maximal when one person lands approximately when the other is at the bottom of her bounce. The energy transfer persists even for very stiff surfaces. The energy-conservative mathematical model exhibits complex non-periodic long-term motions. To complement this passive bouncing model, we also performed a game-theoretic analysis, appropriate when both players are acting strategically to steal the other player's energy. We consider a zero-sum game in which each player's goal is to gain the other player's kinetic energy during a single bounce, by extending her leg during flight. For high initial energy and a symmetric situation, the best strategy for both subjects (minimax strategy and Nash equilibrium) is to use the shortest available leg length and not extend their legs. On the other hand, an asymmetry in initial heights allows the player with more energy to gain even more energy in the next bounce. Thus synchronous bouncing unstable is unstable both for passive bouncing and when leg lengths are controlled as in game-theoretic equilibria."
