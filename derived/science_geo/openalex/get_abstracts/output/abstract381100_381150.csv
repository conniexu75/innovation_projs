https://openalex.org/W1984939442,"Variability of gene expression in human may link gene sequence variability and phenotypes; however, non-genetic variations, alone or in combination with genetics, may also influence expression traits and have a critical role in physiological and disease processes.To get better insight into the overall variability of gene expression, we assessed the transcriptome of circulating monocytes, a key cell involved in immunity-related diseases and atherosclerosis, in 1,490 unrelated individuals and investigated its association with >675,000 SNPs and 10 common cardiovascular risk factors. Out of 12,808 expressed genes, 2,745 expression quantitative trait loci were detected (P<5.78x10(-12)), most of them (90%) being cis-modulated. Extensive analyses showed that associations identified by genome-wide association studies of lipids, body mass index or blood pressure were rarely compatible with a mediation by monocyte expression level at the locus. At a study-wide level (P<3.9x10(-7)), 1,662 expression traits (13.0%) were significantly associated with at least one risk factor. Genome-wide interaction analyses suggested that genetic variability and risk factors mostly acted additively on gene expression. Because of the structure of correlation among expression traits, the variability of risk factors could be characterized by a limited set of independent gene expressions which may have biological and clinical relevance. For example expression traits associated with cigarette smoking were more strongly associated with carotid atherosclerosis than smoking itself.This study demonstrates that the monocyte transcriptome is a potent integrator of genetic and non-genetic influences of relevance for disease pathophysiology and risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2035774221,"Background Telomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of nucleotides on the ends of chromosomes. Rare loss of function mutations in the gene that encodes the protein component of telomerase (TERT) have been described in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here we examine the telomere lengths and pulmonary fibrosis phenotype seen in multiple kindreds with heterozygous TERT mutations. Methods and Findings We have identified 134 individuals with heterozygous TERT mutations from 21 unrelated families. Available medical records, surgical lung biopsies and radiographs were evaluated retrospectively. Genomic DNA isolated from circulating leukocytes has been used to measure telomere lengths with a quantitative PCR assay. We find that telomere lengths of TERT mutation carriers decrease in an age-dependent manner and show progressive shortening with successive generations of mutation inheritance. Family members without TERT mutations have a shorter mean telomere length than normal, demonstrating epigenetic inheritance of shortened telomere lengths in the absence of an inherited TERT mutation. Pulmonary fibrosis is an age-dependent phenotype not seen in mutation carriers less than 40 years of age but found in 60% of men 60 years or older; its development is associated with environmental exposures including cigarette smoking. A radiographic CT pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which is consistent with a diagnosis of IPF, is seen in 74% of cases and a pathologic pattern of UIP is seen in 86% of surgical lung biopsies. Pulmonary fibrosis associated with TERT mutations is progressive and lethal with a mean survival of 3 years after diagnosis. Overall, TERT mutation carriers demonstrate reduced life expectancy, with a mean age of death of 58 and 67 years for males and females, respectively. Conclusions A subset of pulmonary fibrosis, like dyskeratosis congenita, bone marrow failure, and liver disease, represents a “telomeropathy” caused by germline mutations in telomerase and characterized by short telomere lengths. Family members within kindreds who do not inherit the TERT mutation have shorter telomere lengths than controls, demonstrating epigenetic inheritance of a shortened parental telomere length set-point."
https://openalex.org/W2137020248,"Humans follow the example of prestigious, high-status individuals much more readily than that of others, such as when we copy the behavior of village elders, community leaders, or celebrities. This tendency has been declared uniquely human, yet remains untested in other species. Experimental studies of animal learning have typically focused on the learning mechanism rather than on social issues, such as who learns from whom. The latter, however, is essential to understanding how habits spread. Here we report that when given opportunities to watch alternative solutions to a foraging problem performed by two different models of their own species, chimpanzees preferentially copy the method shown by the older, higher-ranking individual with a prior track-record of success. Since both solutions were equally difficult, shown an equal number of times by each model and resulted in equal rewards, we interpret this outcome as evidence that the preferred model in each of the two groups tested enjoyed a significant degree of prestige in terms of whose example other chimpanzees chose to follow. Such prestige-based cultural transmission is a phenomenon shared with our own species. If similar biases operate in wild animal populations, the adoption of culturally transmitted innovations may be significantly shaped by the characteristics of performers."
https://openalex.org/W2128302033,"Keratoplasty is the most effective treatment for corneal blindness, but suboptimal medical conditions and lack of qualified medical personnel and donated cornea often prevent the performance of corneal transplantation in developing countries. Our study aims to develop alternative treatment regimens for congenital corneal diseases of genetic mutation.Human mesenchymal stem cells isolated from neonatal umbilical cords were transplanted to treat thin and cloudy corneas of lumican null mice. Transplantation of umbilical mesenchymal stem cells significantly improved corneal transparency and increased stromal thickness of lumican null mice, but human umbilical hematopoietic stem cells failed to do the same. Further studies revealed that collagen lamellae were re-organized in corneal stroma of lumican null mice after mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. Transplanted umbilical mesenchymal stem cells survived in the mouse corneal stroma for more than 3 months with little or no graft rejection. In addition, these cells assumed a keratocyte phenotype, e.g., dendritic morphology, quiescence, expression of keratocyte unique keratan sulfated keratocan and lumican, and CD34. Moreover, umbilical mesenchymal stem cell transplantation improved host keratocyte functions, which was verified by enhanced expression of keratocan and aldehyde dehydrogenase class 3A1 in lumican null mice.Umbilical mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment for congenital corneal diseases involving keratocyte dysfunction. Unlike donated corneas, umbilical mesenchymal stem cells are easily isolated, expanded, stored, and can be quickly recovered from liquid nitrogen when a patient is in urgent need."
https://openalex.org/W2063192548,"Down syndrome (DS, trisomy 21) is the most common chromosomal disorder and the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability in humans. In DS, triplication of chromosome 21 invariably includes the APP gene (21q21) encoding the Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid precursor protein (APP). Triplication of the APP gene accelerates APP expression leading to cerebral accumulation of APP-derived amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), early-onset AD neuropathology, and age-dependent cognitive sequelae. The DS phenotype complex also includes distinctive early-onset cerulean cataracts of unknown etiology. Previously, we reported increased Abeta accumulation, co-localizing amyloid pathology, and disease-linked supranuclear cataracts in the ocular lenses of subjects with AD. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that related AD-linked Abeta pathology underlies the distinctive lens phenotype associated with DS. Ophthalmological examinations of DS subjects were correlated with phenotypic, histochemical, and biochemical analyses of lenses obtained from DS, AD, and normal control subjects. Evaluation of DS lenses revealed a characteristic pattern of supranuclear opacification accompanied by accelerated supranuclear Abeta accumulation, co-localizing amyloid pathology, and fiber cell cytoplasmic Abeta aggregates (approximately 5 to 50 nm) identical to the lens pathology identified in AD. Peptide sequencing, immunoblot analysis, and ELISA confirmed the identity and increased accumulation of Abeta in DS lenses. Incubation of synthetic Abeta with human lens protein promoted protein aggregation, amyloid formation, and light scattering that recapitulated the molecular pathology and clinical features observed in DS lenses. These results establish the genetic etiology of the distinctive lens phenotype in DS and identify the molecular origin and pathogenic mechanism by which lens pathology is expressed in this common chromosomal disorder. Moreover, these findings confirm increased Abeta accumulation as a key pathogenic determinant linking lens and brain pathology in both DS and AD."
https://openalex.org/W2015044035,"Proper hedgehog (Hh) signaling is crucial for embryogenesis and tissue regeneration. Dysregulation of this pathway is associated with several types of cancer. The monoclonal antibody 5E1 is a Hh pathway inhibitor that has been extensively used to elucidate vertebrate Hh biology due to its ability to block binding of the three mammalian Hh homologs to the receptor, Patched1 (Ptc1). Here, we engineered a murine:human chimeric 5E1 (ch5E1) with similar Hh-binding properties to the original murine antibody. Using biochemical, biophysical, and x-ray crystallographic studies, we show that, like the regulatory receptors Cdon and Hedgehog-interacting protein (Hhip), ch5E1 binding to Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is enhanced by calcium ions. In the presence of calcium and zinc ions, the ch5E1 binding affinity increases 10–20-fold to tighter than 1 nm primarily because of a decrease in the dissociation rate. The co-crystal structure of Shh bound to the Fab fragment of ch5E1 reveals that 5E1 binds at the pseudo-active site groove of Shh with an epitope that largely overlaps with the binding site of its natural receptor antagonist Hhip. Unlike Hhip, the side chains of 5E1 do not directly coordinate the Zn2+ cation in the pseudo-active site, despite the modest zinc-dependent increase in 5E1 affinity for Shh. Furthermore, to our knowledge, the ch5E1 Fab-Shh complex represents the first structure of an inhibitor antibody bound to a metalloprotease fold.

https://openalex.org/W1975081311,"Background Plants have evolved various sophisticated mechanisms to respond and adapt to changes of abiotic factors in their natural environment. Light is one of the most important abiotic environmental factors and it regulates plant growth and development throughout their entire life cycle. To monitor the intensity and spectral composition of the ambient light environment, plants have evolved multiple photoreceptors, including the red/far-red light-sensing phytochromes. Methodology/Principal Findings We have developed an integrative mathematical model that describes how phytochrome B (phyB), an essential receptor in Arabidopsis thaliana, controls growth. Our model is based on a multiscale approach and connects the mesoscopic intracellular phyB protein dynamics to the macroscopic growth phenotype. To establish reliable and relevant parameters for the model phyB regulated growth we measured: accumulation and degradation, dark reversion kinetics and the dynamic behavior of different nuclear phyB pools using in vivo spectroscopy, western blotting and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technique, respectively. Conclusions/Significance The newly developed model predicts that the phyB-containing nuclear bodies (NBs) (i) serve as storage sites for phyB and (ii) control prolonged dark reversion kinetics as well as partial reversibility of phyB Pfr in extended darkness. The predictive power of this mathematical model is further validated by the fact that we are able to formalize a basic photobiological observation, namely that in light-grown seedlings hypocotyl length depends on the total amount of phyB. In addition, we demonstrate that our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with quantitative data concerning phyB levels and the corresponding hypocotyl lengths. Hence, we conclude that the integrative model suggested in this study captures the main features of phyB-mediated photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2083069189,"CD133 is a membrane molecule that has been, controversially, reported as a CSC marker in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we sought to clarify the expression and role of CD133 in CRC. Initially the size of the CD133−expressing (CD133+) population in eight well-described CRC cell lines was measured by flow cytometry and was found to range from 0% to >95%. The cell line HT29 has a CD133+ population of >95% and was chosen for functional evaluation of CD133 after gene knockdown by RNA interference. A time course assay showed that CD133 inhibition had no significant effect on cell proliferation or apoptosis. However, CD133 knockdown did result in greater susceptibility to staurosporine-induced apoptosis (p = 0.01) and reduction in cell motility (p<0.04). Since gene knockdown may cause “off-target” effects, the cell line SW480 (which has a CD133+ population of 40%) was sorted into pure CD133+ and CD133− populations to allow functional comparison of isogenic populations separated only by CD133 expression. In concordance with the knockdown experiments, a time course assay showed no significant proliferative differences between the CD133+/CD133− populations. Also greater resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis (p = 0.008), greater cell motility (p = 0.03) and greater colony forming efficiency was seen in the CD133+ population than the CD133− population in both 2D and 3D culture (p<0.0001 and p<0.003 respectively). Finally, the plasticity of CD133 expression in tumour cells was tested. Quantitative PCR analysis showed there was transcriptional repression in the CD133− population of SW480. Prolonged culture of a pure CD133− population resulted in re-emergence of CD133+ cells. We conclude that CD133 expression in CRCs is associated with some features attributable to stemness and that there is plasticity of CD133 expression. Further studies are necessary to delineate the mechanistic basis of these features."
https://openalex.org/W2126837058,"Background In one small group of dinoflagellates, photosynthesis is carried out by a tertiary endosymbiont derived from a diatom, giving rise to a complex cell that we collectively refer to as a ‘dinotom’. The endosymbiont is separated from its host by a single membrane and retains plastids, mitochondria, a large nucleus, and many other eukaryotic organelles and structures, a level of complexity suggesting an early stage of integration. Although the evolution of these endosymbionts has attracted considerable interest, the plastid genome has not been examined in detail, and indeed no tertiary plastid genome has yet been sequenced. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe the complete plastid genomes of two closely related dinotoms, Durinskia baltica and Kryptoperidinium foliaceum. The D. baltica (116470 bp) and K. foliaceum (140426 bp) plastid genomes map as circular molecules featuring two large inverted repeats that separate distinct single copy regions. The organization and gene content of the D. baltica plastid closely resemble those of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The K. foliaceum plastid genome is much larger, has undergone more reorganization, and encodes a putative tyrosine recombinase (tyrC) also found in the plastid genome of the heterokont Heterosigma akashiwo, and two putative serine recombinases (serC1 and serC2) homologous to recombinases encoded by plasmids pCf1 and pCf2 in another pennate diatom, Cylindrotheca fusiformis. The K. foliaceum plastid genome also contains an additional copy of serC1, two degenerate copies of another plasmid-encoded ORF, and two non-coding regions whose sequences closely resemble portions of the pCf1 and pCf2 plasmids. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that while the plastid genomes of two dinotoms share very similar gene content and genome organization with that of the free-living pennate diatom P. tricornutum, the K. folicaeum plastid genome has absorbed two exogenous plasmids. Whether this took place before or after the tertiary endosymbiosis is not clear."
https://openalex.org/W2091163647,"Background miRNAs are a class of non-coding, small RNAs that are approximately 22 nucleotides long and play important roles in the translational level regulation of gene expression by either directly binding or cleaving target mRNAs. The red alga, Porphyra yezoensis is one of the most important marine economic crops worldwide. To date, only a few miRNAs have been identified in green unicellar alga and there is no report about Porphyra miRNAs. Methodology/Principal Findings To identify miRNAs in Porphyra yezoensis, a small RNA library was constructed. Solexa technology was used to perform high throughput sequencing of the library and subsequent bioinformatics analysis to identify novel miRNAs. Specifically, 180,557,942 reads produced 13,324 unique miRNAs representing 224 conserved miRNA families that have been identified in other plants species. In addition, seven novel putative miRNAs were predicted from a limited number of ESTs. The potential targets of these putative miRNAs were also predicted based on sequence homology search. Conclusions/Significance This study provides a first large scale cloning and characterization of Porphyra miRNAs and their potential targets. These miRNAs belong to 224 conserved miRNA families and 7 miRNAs are novel in Porphyra. These miRNAs add to the growing database of new miRNA and lay the foundation for further understanding of miRNA function in the regulation of Porphyra yezoensis development."
https://openalex.org/W2168998399,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, a human pathogen, recruits complement regulator factor H to its bacterial cell surface. The bacterial PspC protein binds Factor H via short consensus repeats (SCR) 8–11 and SCR19–20. In this study, we define how bacterially bound Factor H promotes pneumococcal adherence to and uptake by epithelial cells or human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) via a two-step process. First, pneumococcal adherence to epithelial cells was significantly reduced by heparin and dermatan sulfate. However, none of the glycosaminoglycans affected binding of Factor H to pneumococci. Adherence of pneumococci to human epithelial cells was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies recognizing SCR19–20 of Factor H suggesting that the C-terminal glycosaminoglycan-binding region of Factor H mediates the contact between pneumococci and human cells. Blocking of the integrin CR3 receptor, i.e. CD11b and CD18, of PMNs or CR3-expressing epithelial cells reduced significantly the interaction of pneumococci with both cell types. Similarly, an additional CR3 ligand, Pra1, derived from Candida albicans, blocked the interaction of pneumococci with PMNs. Strikingly, Pra1 inhibited also pneumococcal uptake by lung epithelial cells but not adherence. In addition, invasion of Factor H-coated pneumococci required the dynamics of host-cell actin microfilaments and was affected by inhibitors of protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In conclusion, pneumococcal entry into host cells via Factor H is based on a two-step mechanism. The first and initial contact of Factor H-coated pneumococci is mediated by glycosaminoglycans expressed on the surface of human cells, and the second step, pneumococcal uptake, is integrin-mediated and depends on host signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) colonize as harmless commensals the mucosal epithelium of the human upper respiratory tract. However, pneumococci are also harmful pathogens causing severe infections in humans that are associated with high mortality rates and death. In addition to their ability to cause severe local infections such as otitis media and sinusitis, pneumococci cause life-threatening invasive diseases, including community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis (1.Austrian R.

Factor H also binds dermatan sulfate (DS), which is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan and constituent of various proteoglycans that are present on eukaryotic cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix (32.Iozzo R.V.

Moreover, Factor H and Factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), which is encoded by an alternatively spliced transcript and consists of the first seven SCR, bind via an RGD sequence in SCR4 to host cells (36.Hellwage J. Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The integrin CR3, also referred to as CD11b/CD18 or αM/β2, of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) was identified as the cellular receptor recognizing Factor H (37.DiScipio R.G. Daffern P.J. Schraufstätter I.U. Sriramarao P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4057-4066PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that Factor H binds to the pneumococcal PspC via two regions that are localized in SCR8–11 and SCR19–20 of Factor H (17.Hammerschmidt S. Agarwal V. Kunert A. Haelbich S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5848-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, we indicated that pneumococcal-bound Factor H promotes bacterial adhesion and facilitates uptake thereby increasing the numbers of intracellular pneumococci. Although the function of Factor H as a bridging molecule is intriguing, the host cellular receptor(s) and induced signal cascades have not yet been addressed. In this study, we explored the molecular mechanisms that facilitate ingestion of pneumococci by epithelial cells via the Factor H mechanism. We suggest a two-step mechanism for Factor H-mediated pneumococcal invasion into host cells. First, Factor H binds to pneumococci, and bound Factor H is oriented in a way that it can interact with polyanionic molecules on the surface of host cells. This facilitates pneumococcal adhesion, and second, pneumococci exploit a Factor H-integrin complex for invasion into epithelial cells. This invasion process via Factor H requires the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and kinase activities of signal transduction molecules. S. pneumoniae (NCTC10319, serotype 35A, PspC3.3) were cultured on blood agar plates (Oxoid, Wesel, Germany) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 or in Todd-Hewitt broth (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (THY) to a density of 5 × 108 colony-forming units ml−1 (A600 of ∼0.5). Binding of Factor H to pneumococci is a general phenomenon, and previous data showed that NCTC10319 can be used to demonstrate the effects (17.Hammerschmidt S. Agarwal V. Kunert A. Haelbich S.

Pneumococcal host cell adherence and invasion assays were performed as described previously (17.Hammerschmidt S. Agarwal V. Kunert A. Haelbich S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5848-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 104 in plain medium either on 24-well tissue culture plates (Greiner, Germany) or on glass coverslips (diameter, 12 mm) when assayed by immunofluorescence and cultivated for 48 h. Confluent monolayers were washed thoroughly and infected for 3 h with pneumococci in 500 μl of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/HEPES (DMEM/HEPES; PAA) supplemented with 1% FBS at 37 °C using a multiplicity of infection of 50 bacteria per cell. The role of human Factor H for adherence was analyzed by incubating (1 × 107) pneumococci for 20 min with 2 μg of Factor H in a total volume of 100 μl of DMEM/HEPES with 1% FBS at 37 °C prior to host cell infections, and the infection assays were carried out in a total volume of 500 μl after adding the preincubated bacteria, without washing off the unbound Factor H. Post-infection cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound bacteria. The total number of adherent and invasive bacteria was monitored after detachment and lysis of cells with saponin (1% w/v) and plating the bacteria on blood agar. The number of viable intracellular bacteria was quantified by employing the antibiotic protection assay (40.Pracht D. Elm C. Gerber J. Bergmann S. Rohde M. Seiler M. Kim K.S. Jenkinson H.F. Nau R. Hammerschmidt S. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 2680-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, epithelial cells were infected with pneumococci (multiplicity of infection of 50), and thereafter, the infected and washed host cells were incubated for 1 h with DMEM/HEPES containing 100 μg ml−1 gentamicin and 100 units ml−1 penicillin G at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to kill extracellular and nonadherent pneumococci. Invasive and viable pneumococci were recovered from the intracellular compartments of the host cells by a saponin-mediated host cell lysis (1.0% w/v), and the total number of invasive pneumococci was monitored after plating sample aliquots on blood agar plates, followed by colony formation and enumeration. In inhibition experiments, infection assays were carried out in the presence of soluble heparin, dermatan sulfate, and antibodies or after pretreatment of host cells with 10 milliunits ml−1 heparinase III or with various pharmacological inhibitors as described recently (38.Bergmann S. Lang A. Rohde M. Agarwal V. Rennemeier C. Grashoff C. Preissner K.T. Hammerschmidt S. J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 47.Agarwal V. Hammerschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19427-19436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cells were pretreated for 3 h with heparinase III, which cleaves heparan sulfate but does not cleave unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparins. Thereafter, the cells were thoroughly washed prior to bacterial infections as described recently (39.Rennemeier C. Hammerschmidt S. Niemann S. Inamura S. Zähringer U. Kehrel B.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3118-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and results were expressed as mean ± S.D. Pneumococci attached to host epithelial cells were stained using a polyclonal pneumococcal antibodies (IgG) in combination with a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or Alexa Fluor 568 (red) (MoBiTec) (47.Agarwal V. Hammerschmidt S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19427-19436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Post-infection nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% FBS, and before incubating the cells with pneumococcal antibodies (1:100), the infected cell layer was thoroughly washed with PBS. Bound antibodies were detected with an Alexa Fluor-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugate (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany). The glass coverslips were embedded “upside down” in Mowiol, sealed with nail polish, and stored at 4 °C. A confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP5 AOBS) and the appropriate CLSM software (LAS AF SP5) were used for the image acquisition. Binding of Factor H to viable pneumococci was measured using flow cytometry. Bacteria (1 × 107), cultivated in THY, were incubated in 100 μl of PBS with Factor H in the absence or presence of heparin, which was used as competitor. The suspensions were incubated at 37 °C, and after 30 min the bacteria were washed three times. Factor H bound to pneumococci was then detected by incubating the washed bacteria for 30 min at 37 °C with anti-Factor H antibodies followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-goat Ig antibody (MoBiTec) resulting in fluorescent bacteria. Finally, bacteria were washed, and the fluorescence intensity was analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCanto (BD Biosciences). FITC-labeled heparin was used to examine binding of heparin to pneumococci or to Factor H-coated pneumococci. Bacteria were detected using log-forward and log-side scatter dot plot, and a gating region was set to exclude debris and larger aggregates of bacteria. 10,000 bacteria (events) were analyzed for fluorescence using log scale amplifications. The mean fluorescence intensity multiplied by the percentage of PMNs in complex with fluorescent-labeled bacteria was recorded as a measure for binding activity. Human PMNs were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (Department of Transfusion Medicine, University of Greifswald; oral informed consent was obtained) as described previously (39.Rennemeier C. Hammerschmidt S. Niemann S. Inamura S. Zähringer U. Kehrel B.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3118-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 PMNs were incubated for 30 min in 100 μl of PBS, 1% FBS with 1 × 106 pneumococci pretreated with or without Factor H. Following bacterial incubations, PMNs were washed once with ice-cold PBS, 0.5% FBS by centrifugation at 280 × g for 5 min. The PMNs were then resuspended in 1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-pneumococcal IgG and then kept on ice for 30 min. The suspension was washed once with ice-cold PBS, 0.5% FBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min on ice. Finally, PMNs were fixed with 200 μl of PBS, 0.5% FBS, 1% paraformaldehyde. Binding of bacteria (PMN-pneumococci associates) was assessed by flow cytometry using a FACSCanto flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The geometric mean fluorescence intensity multiplied with the percentage of gated labeled cells was recorded as a measure for pneumococcal binding and uptake. The binding experiments and infection experiments were performed at least three times, each in duplicate, and the data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences in adherence or invasion were analyzed by the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. In all analyses, a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. As Factor H binds heparin and DS, we investigated the role of the glycosaminoglycans heparin and DS on Factor H-mediated adherence of pneumococci to human lung epithelial cells A549. Competitive inhibition experiments were performed in the presence of soluble heparin (50 units/ml), DS (100 μg/ml), or after pretreatment of epithelial cells with heparinase III. Heparin and also DS inhibited Factor H-mediated pneumococcal adherence to A549 cells significantly, although the basal level of adherence in the absence of Factor H was not altered by these two inhibitors (Fig. 1A). In contrast, treatment of the lung epithelial cells with heparinase III, which specifically cleaves heparin sulfate without affecting the low molecular weight heparins, did not affect Factor H-mediated pneumococcal adherence (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence microscopy of adherent pneumococci confirmed the inhibitory effect of heparin and DS (Fig. 1B). In addition to impairing pneumococcal adherence, both heparin and DS significantly reduced Factor H-initiated pneumococcal invasion into epithelial cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Again, treatment of epithelial cells with heparinase III had, similar to adherence, no effect on pneumococcal invasion (Fig. 1D). These data imply that heparin and DS interfered with Factor H-mediated pneumococcal invasion into epithelial cells. However, this effect is not directly linked with invasion as the degree of reduction is the consequence of the diminished ability of pneumococci to adhere to epithelial cells when glycosaminoglycans were added to the infection assays. To identify the region or SCR of Factor H that mediates pneumococcal attachment to the surface of eukaryotic cells, do"
https://openalex.org/W2089352857,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene are associated with body mass index (BMI) in populations of European descent. The FTO rs9939609 variant, first detected in a genome-wide association study of diabetes, conferred an increased disease risk that was abolished after adjustment for BMI, suggesting that the association may be due to variation in adiposity. The relationship between diabetes, four previously identified FTO polymorphisms that span a 19.6-kb genomic region, and obesity was therefore evaluated in the biracial population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study with the goal of further refining the association by comparing results between the two ethnic groups. The prevalence of diabetes and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) was established at baseline, and diabetes was determined by either self-report, a fasting glucose level ≥126 mg/dL, or non-fasting glucose ≥200 mg/dL. There were 1,004 diabetes cases and 10,038 non-cases in whites, and 670 cases and 2,780 non-cases in African-Americans. Differences in mean BMI were assessed by a general linear model, and multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the risk of diabetes and obesity. For white participants, the FTO rs9939609 A allele was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, p<0.001) and obesity (OR = 1.22, p<0.001) under an additive genetic model that was similar for all of the SNPs analyzed. In African-Americans, only the rs1421085 C allele was a determinant of obesity risk (OR = 1.17, p = 0.05), but was found to be protective against diabetes (OR = 0.79, p = 0.03). Adjustment for BMI did not eliminate any of the observed associations with diabetes. Significant statistical interaction between race and the FTO variants suggests that the effect on diabetes susceptibility may be context dependent."
https://openalex.org/W2093929687,"It is postulated that chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) became domesticated from wild junglefowls in Southeast Asia nearly 10,000 years ago. Based on 19 individual samples covering various chicken breeds, red junglefowl (G. g. gallus), and green junglefowl (G. varius), we address the origin of domestic chickens, the relative roles of ancestral polymorphisms and introgression, and the effects of artificial selection on the domestic chicken genome. DNA sequences from 30 introns at 25 nuclear loci are determined for both diploid chromosomes from a majority of samples. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the DNA sequences of chickens, red and green junglefowls formed reciprocally monophyletic clusters. The Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation further reveals that domestic chickens diverged from red junglefowl 58,000±16,000 years ago, well before the archeological dating of domestication, and that their common ancestor in turn diverged from green junglefowl 3.6 million years ago. Several shared haplotypes nonetheless found between green junglefowl and chickens are attributed to recent unidirectional introgression of chickens into green junglefowl. Shared haplotypes are more frequently found between red junglefowl and chickens, which are attributed to both introgression and ancestral polymorphisms. Within each chicken breed, there is an excess of homozygosity, but there is no significant reduction in the nucleotide diversity. Phenotypic modifications of chicken breeds as a result of artificial selection appear to stem from ancestral polymorphisms at a limited number of genetic loci."

For the period of April 20 to October 15, 2009, a total of 1,205 cases of pH1N1-confirmed cases were reported, 966 (80%) among males and over one-half (58%) under 25 years of age. Overall VE for service members was found to be 45% (95% CI, 33 to 55%). Immunization with prior season's TIV (VE = 44%, 95% CI, 32 to 54%) as well as LAIV (VE = 24%, 95% CI, 6 to 38%) were both found to be associated with protection.

https://openalex.org/W1977071100,"Outbreaks of white spot disease have had a large negative economic impact on cultured shrimp worldwide. However, the pathogenesis of the causative virus, WSSV (whit spot syndrome virus), is not yet well understood. WSSV is a large enveloped virus. The WSSV virion has three structural layers surrounding its core DNA: an outer envelope, a tegument and a nucleocapsid. In this study, we investigated the protein-protein interactions of the major WSSV structural proteins, including several envelope and tegument proteins that are known to be involved in the infection process.In the present report, we used coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays to elucidate and/or confirm all the interactions that occur among the WSSV structural (envelope and tegument) proteins VP51A, VP19, VP24, VP26 and VP28. We found that VP51A interacted directly not only with VP26 but also with VP19 and VP24. VP51A, VP19 and VP24 were also shown to have an affinity for self-interaction. Chemical cross-linking assays showed that these three self-interacting proteins could occur as dimers.From our present results in conjunction with other previously established interactions we construct a 3D model in which VP24 acts as a core protein that directly associates with VP26, VP28, VP38A, VP51A and WSV010 to form a membrane-associated protein complex. VP19 and VP37 are attached to this complex via association with VP51A and VP28, respectively. Through the VP26-VP51C interaction this envelope complex is anchored to the nucleocapsid, which is made of layers of rings formed by VP664. A 3D model of the nucleocapsid and the surrounding outer membrane is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2021856574,"Nodulin 26 (nod26) is a major intrinsic protein that constitutes the major protein component on the symbiosome membrane (SM) of N2-fixing soybean nodules. Functionally, nod26 forms a low energy transport pathway for water, osmolytes, and NH3 across the SM. Besides their transport functions, emerging evidence suggests that high concentrations of major intrinsic proteins on membranes provide interaction and docking targets for various cytosolic proteins. Here it is shown that the C-terminal domain peptide of nod26 interacts with a 40-kDa protein from soybean nodule extracts, which was identified as soybean cytosolic glutamine synthetase GS1β1 by mass spectrometry. Fluorescence spectroscopy assays show that recombinant soybean GS1β1 binds the nod26 C-terminal domain with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Kd = 266 nm). GS1β1 also binds to isolated SMs, and this binding can be blocked by preincubation with the C-terminal peptide of nod26. In vivo experiments using either a split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system or bimolecular fluorescence complementation show that the four cytosolic GS isoforms expressed in soybean nodules interact with full-length nod26. The binding of GS, the principal ammonia assimilatory enzyme, to the conserved C-terminal domain of nod26, a transporter of NH3, is proposed to promote efficient assimilation of fixed nitrogen, as well as prevent potential ammonia toxicity, by localizing the enzyme to the cytosolic side of the symbiosome membrane.

IntroductionThe formation of legume-rhizobia N2-fixing symbioses in root nodules leads to the development of a novel organelle known as the “symbiosome,” which houses the endosymbiotic rhizobia bacteroids. In mature nodules, the host infected cells are occupied by thousands of symbiosomes, which constitute the major organelle within this specialized cell type. The symbiosome is delimited by the symbiosome membrane (SM), 2The abbreviations used are: SMsymbiosome membranenod26nodulin 26GSglutamine synthetaseMIPmajor intrinsic proteinORFopen reading frameNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidBiFCbimolecular fluorescence complementationNBDnitrobenzoxadiazoleYFPyellow fluorescent proteinMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flightCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. which controls the transport of all metabolites between the symbiont and the plant host. These transport activities include the efflux of the primary metabolic product of nitrogen fixation (NH3/NH4+) and the uptake of dicarboxylates as an energy source to support bacterial N2 fixation (1Udvardi M.K. Day D.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 493-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Day D.A. Poole P.S. Tyerman S.D. Rosendahl L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because of the unique role of the SM, a number of host nodulin (“nodule-enhanced”) proteins are synthesized and localized to this membrane (3Fortin M.G. Zelechowska M. Verma D.P.S. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3041-3046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fortin M.G. Morrison N.A. Verma D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), where they serve transport and regulatory functions in the symbiosis.Early studies revealed that nodulin 26 (nod26), a member of the major intrinsic protein (MIP)/aquaporin superfamily, is among the ensemble of soybean SM nodulins produced during symbiosome biogenesis (4Fortin M.G.

Acta. 2006; 1758: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Since the original identification of nod26 over 20 years ago (4Fortin M.G. Morrison N.A. Verma D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the role of this channel in the symbiosis has been debated. Functional analyses show that nod26 is a multifunctional “aquaglyceroporin” that transports multiple substrates including water, formamide, and glycerol (6Rivers R.L. Dean R.M. Chandy G. Hall J.E.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As a symbiosome-specific aquaglyceroporin, nod26 has been proposed to serve as a low energy transport pathway for water as well as osmolytes within the infected cell, potentially to aid in cell volume regulation and to facilitate infected cell adaptation to osmotic stresses (6Rivers R.L.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). nod26 has also been proposed to transport ammonia gas (10Niemietz C.M. Tyerman S.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and may serve a metabolic function as a facilitated transport pathway for fixed NH3 efflux from the symbiosome to the plant cytosol for assimilation.Similar to a number of MIPs, nod26 is the most abundant protein on its resident membrane (4Fortin M.G. Morrison N.A. Verma D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and constitutes more than 10% of the total SM protein (6Rivers R.L. Dean R.M. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Roberts D.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16256-16261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Due to the high concentration of MIPs on their resident membrane, an alternative function for these proteins as interaction and membrane-docking targets for other cytosolic proteins has emerged. For example, the cytosolic C-terminal region of mammalian AQP2 interacts with a multicomponent motor protein complex (11Noda Y. Horikawa S. Furukawa T. Hirai K. Katayama Y. Asai T. Kuwahara M.

The homologous C-terminal region of AQP0, the most abundant protein in lens fiber membranes, interacts with multiple lens proteins including regulatory and cytoskeletal proteins (16Girsch S.J.

Vis. 2005; 11: 76-87PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, nod26 was investigated as a potential SM-docking target for proteins in the nodule cytosol. It is shown that the C-terminal domain of nod26 serves as a site for the association of cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS) with the SM, suggesting novel roles for nod26 in ammonia transport and assimilation.DISCUSSIONThe SM is a unique symbiotic interface between legume hosts and endosymbiotic rhizobia bacteria in N2-fixing symbioses. Biogenesis of the SM occurs early in the rhizobia infection process and is accompanied by the biosynthesis of a variety of nodulin proteins. Several of these proteins become integral components of the mature SM and mediate transport and regulatory processes associated with metabolite exchange between the symbiotic partners (1Udvardi M.K. Day D.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 493-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Day D.A. Poole P.S. Tyerman S.D. Rosendahl L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Among these proteins is nod26, which is a major component of the mature symbiosome (4Fortin M.G. Morrison N.A. Verma D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M.

In the present study, evidence is provided for an additional function of nod26 as a site for the interaction of cytosolic nodule GS.GS (EC 6.3.1.2) is the critical enzyme for assimilation of environmental ammonia as well as endogenous ammonia produced metabolically. Plant GSs are divided into two isoform classes that are distinguished by their subcellular location, with GS1 found in the cytosol, whereas GS2 resides in plastids (39Forde B.G. Day H.M. Turton J.F. Shen W.J. Cullimore J.V. Oliver J.E. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 391-401PubMed Google Scholar, 40Miflin B.J. Habash D.Z. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 41Bernard S.M. Habash D.Z. New Phytol. 2009; 182: 608-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Plant cytosolic GS1 is encoded by a small, highly conserved gene family in angiosperms (41Bernard S.M. Habash D.Z. New Phytol. 2009; 182: 608-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), with three GS1 isoform classes (designated α, β, and γ) typically present in legumes (23Morey K.J. Ortega J.L. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Gebhardt C. Oliver J.E. Forde B.G. Saarelainen R. Miflin B.J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1429-1435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gmgln-α, Gmgln-β, and Gmgln-γ show differential expression during development and in response to environmental and metabolic cues. In mature N2-fixing soybean nodules, four GS1 isoforms (β1, β2, γ1, γ2) exhibit high expression (23Morey K.J. Ortega J.L. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The β isoforms are characterized as the “constitutive” GS1 subclass that exhibit a broad expression pattern in soybean tissues but show particularly high expression in nodules and are inducible by high levels of ammonia (23Morey K.J. Ortega J.L. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 43Temple S.J. Heard J. Ganter G. Dunn K. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The γ isoforms are selectively expressed as nodulin proteins in a developmentally regulated fashion in soybean nodules (23Morey K.J. Ortega J.L. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 44Temple S.J. Kunjibettu S. Roche D. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 1723-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and other legumes (39Forde B.G. Day H.M. Turton J.F. Shen W.J. Cullimore J.V. Oliver J.E. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 391-401PubMed Google Scholar, 43Temple S.J. Heard J. Ganter G. Dunn K. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 45Stanford A.C. Larsen K. Barker D.G. Cullimore J.V. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The expression of the four GS1 isoforms during soybean nodule development coincides with the onset of nitrogen fixation (23Morey K.J. Ortega J.L. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), consistent with a role as the major enzymes responsible for the ATP-dependent assimilation of fixed ammonia transported from the symbiosome to the cytosolic compartment. The expression of GS1 (occurring at approximately day 10 in nodule development (23Morey K.J. Ortega J.L. Sengupta-Gopalan C. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) also parallels the appearance of nod26 protein in developing nodules (9Guenther J.F. Chanmanivone N. Galetovic M.P. Wallace I.S. Cobb J.A. Roberts D.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).From a structural perspective, questions remain regarding the composition and binding determinants for the association of the nod26·GS complex. The four soybean GS1 isoforms expressed in nodules share more than 85% amino acid sequence identity (supplemental Fig. 1), and the observation that all interact with nod26 suggests that these proteins contain a conserved interaction site for the nod26 C-terminal domain. Thus, any isoform could conceivably form a complex with nod26 in vivo. X-ray crystallography of plant cytosolic GS (46Unno H. Uchida T. Sugawara H. Kurisu G. Sugiyama T. Yamaya T. Sakakibara H. Hase T. Kusunoki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29287-29296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) shows a homodecameric structure of two stacked pentameric subunit rings with catalytic sites shared between adjacent monomeric subunits. The finding of a one-to-one binding stoichiometry suggests that each GS monomer possesses a binding site for the nod26 C-terminal domain. The high apparent affinity (Kd = 266 nm) for the interaction of C-terminal nod26 domain for GS1β1, combined with the observation that both nod26 (as high as 15% of the symbiosome membrane protein (6Rivers R.L. Dean R.M. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Roberts D.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16256-16261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) and GS (2% of the nodule cytosolic protein (47McParland R.H. Guevara J.G. Becker R.R. Evans H.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 153: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) are major components of the soybean infected cell, strongly suggest that cytosolic GS binds to the nod26 C terminus at biologically relevant concentrations. This is supported by the yeast split ubiquitin and BiFC experiments.Analysis of the effects of the nod26 CK-25 peptide on the activity and kinetics of GS (supplemental Fig. 3) suggests that the interaction exhibits a modest effect on enzyme activity with a 25% increase in Vmax and no significant effect on the Km for NH4+. Although the actual site of interaction on the GS decamer remains to be elucidated, the findings suggest that interaction with nod26 could serve principally to localize GS to the surface of the SM rather than exerting an effect on enzyme activity.The potential symbiotic significance of nod26 interaction with GS can be understood from the perspective of the known transporters and pumps on the SM (1Udvardi M.K. Day D.A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 493-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2Day D.A. Poole P.S. Tyerman S.D. Rosendahl L. Cell. Mol.

Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the inherent toxicity of ammonia/ammonium transport across energized membranes (53Britto D.T. Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D. Kronzucker H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4255-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and it is summarized in Fig. 6. N2 fixation by rhizobium bacteroids results in the production of NH3, which diffuses across the bacteroid membrane into the symbiosome space. Efflux of NH3/NH4+ from the symbiosome space to the cytosol can occur by 1) directional transport of NH4+ cation to the cytosol by an inwardly rectified, voltage-activated cation channel (48Tyerman S.D. Whitehead L.F. Day D.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 629-632Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 49Roberts D.M. Tyerman S.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 50Obermeyer G. Tyerman S.D. Plant Physiol. 2005; 139: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or 2) passive diffusion of uncharged NH3 through the SM (52Udvardi M.K. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with facilitated diffusion of NH3 through nod26 potentially providing a low energy efflux pathway (10Niemietz C.M. Tyerman S.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of these pathways remain a subject of debate and depend upon the pH of the symbiosome space and the resting potential of the SM, both of which are primarily controlled by an energizing H+-pumping ATPase on the SM (51Udvardi M.K. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An interaction between nod26 and GS would localize this critical assimilatory enzyme to the surface of the symbiosome, the site of fixed NH3/NH4+ release into the infected cell cytosol. Direct interaction of GS with nod26 could facilitate rapid assimilation of reduced nitrogen in the form of unprotonated NH3 transported through the nod26 channel, potentially as a “metabolic funnel” (Fig. 6). Additionally, because nod26 is the most abundant SM protein, interaction with GS would increase the local concentration of the enzyme at the symbiosome surface, which would enhance the rate of assimilation of NH3/NH4+ that leaves the symbiosome through other efflux pathways.An additional advantage of the nod26-GS association may stem from the observation that high levels of ammonium are toxic to plants, which is potentially the result of wasteful “ammonia futile cycling” (53Britto D.T. Siddiqi M.Y. Glass A.D. Kronzucker H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 4255-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In the case of the symbiosome, such a process could operate due to the acidic pH of the symbiosome space and the high concentrations of ammonium that accumulate during active nitrogen fixation (54Streeter J.G. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B). Entry of NH4+ into the more alkaline plant cytosol would result in a loss of a proton generating NH3, which could reenter the symbiosome space, possibly through nod26, which could represent the lowest energy pathway for NH3 in the SM. The result would be a net transport of a proton from the symbiosome space to the cytosol, which would dissipate the proton motive force generated by the SM H+-ATPase (51Udvardi M.K. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 982-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and lead to hydrolysis of ATP and futile cycling. As stated above, the interaction of nod26 with GS could facilitate rapid NH4+ assimilation, preventing its accumulation in the cytosol. The maintenance of low cytosolic concentrations of NH4+, which are estimated to be 50-fold lower than the NH4+ concentration in nitrogen-fixing symbiosomes (54Streeter J.G. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), would prevent potential futile cycling.Another potential level of complexity in the nod26-GS interaction comes from the observation that both binding partners are subject to post-translational phosphorylation (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 55Weaver C.D. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8954-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 56Finnemann J. Schjoerring J.K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 171-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Lima L. Seabra A. Melo P. Cullimore J. Carvalho H. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 2751-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the case of nod26, the unique site of phosphorylation is Ser262 (55Weaver C.D. Roberts D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8954-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which resides in the C-terminal domain, which is the site of GS interaction. Ser262 phosphorylation is catalyzed by a calcium-dependent protein kinase that is localized to the SM (5Weaver C.D. Crombie B. Stacey G. Roberts D.M. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). nod26 phosphorylation is developmentally regulated, becoming apparent at the onset of nitrogen fixation, and is maintained at steady-state levels throughout the N2-fixing portion of the nodule lifespan (9Guenther J.F. Chanmanivone N. Galetovic M.P. Wallace I.S. Cobb J.A. Roberts D.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation is regulated by osmotic stress signals (9Guenther J.F. Chanmanivone N. Galetovic M.P. Wallace I.S. Cobb J.A. Roberts D.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 981-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which may reflect the regulation of nod26 transport as part of an osmoregulatory response. Preliminary analyses suggest that nod26 peptides that are phosphorylated at Ser262 retain the ability to bind to GS in vitro, but the influence of phosphorylation on the assembly and activity of the complex in vivo remains to be addressed. Cytosolic GS1 is also a target for posttranslational phosphorylation by various protein kinases in plant tissues (56Finnemann J. Schjoerring J.K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 171-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Lima L. Seabra A. Melo P. Cullimore J. Carvalho H. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 2751-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), with phosphorylation potentially leading to interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (56Finnemann J. Schjoerring J.K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 171-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other unidentified phosphoproteins (57Lima L. Seabra A. Melo P. Cullimore J. Carvalho H. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 2751-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The interplay between phosphorylation, GS regulation, and interaction with nod26 and other potential regulatory targets and the effects of these on N2 fixation and assimilation in response to environmental cues remain a topic for future investigation. IntroductionThe formation of legume-rhizobia N2-fixing symbioses in root nodules leads to the development of a novel organelle known as the “symbiosome,” which houses the endosymbiotic rhizobia bacteroids.

These transport activities include the efflux of the primary metabolic product of nitrogen fixation (NH3/NH4+) and the uptake of dicarboxylates as an energy source to support bacterial N2 fixation (1Udvardi M.K.

https://openalex.org/W2025266201,"Age-associated thymic involution has considerable physiological impact by inhibiting de novo T-cell selection. This impaired T-cell production leads to weakened immune responses. Yet the molecular mechanisms of thymic stromal adipose involution are not clear. Age-related alterations also occur in the murine thymus providing an excellent model system. In the present work structural and molecular changes of the murine thymic stroma were investigated during aging. We show that thymic epithelial senescence correlates with significant destruction of epithelial network followed by adipose involution. We also show in purified thymic epithelial cells the age-related down-regulation of Wnt4 (and subsequently FoxN1), and the prominent increase in LAP2alpha expression. These senescence-related changes of gene expression are strikingly similar to those observed during mesenchymal to pre-adipocyte differentiation of fibroblast cells suggesting similar molecular background in epithelial cells. For molecular level proof-of-principle stable LAP2alpha and Wnt4-over-expressing thymic epithelial cell lines were established. LAP2alpha over-expression provoked a surge of PPARgamma expression, a transcription factor expressed in pre-adipocytes. In contrast, additional Wnt4 decreased the mRNA level of ADRP, a target gene of PPARgamma. Murine embryonic thymic lobes have also been transfected with LAP2alpha- or Wnt4-encoding lentiviral vectors. As expected LAP2alpha over-expression increased, while additional Wnt4 secretion suppressed PPARgamma expression. Based on these pioneer experiments we propose that decreased Wnt activity and increased LAP2alpha expression provide the molecular basis during thymic senescence. We suggest that these molecular changes trigger thymic epithelial senescence accompanied by adipose involution. This process may either occur directly where epithelium can trans-differentiate into pre-adipocytes; or indirectly where first epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs followed by subsequent pre-adipocyte differentiation. The latter version fits better with literature data and is supported by the observed histological and molecular level changes."
https://openalex.org/W2078093070,"Mesendoderm induction during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation in vitro is stimulated by the Transforming Growth Factor and Wingless (Wnt) families of growth factors.We identified the periods during which Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) 4, Wnt3a or Activin A were able to induce expression of the mesendoderm marker, Mixl1, in differentiating mouse ESCs. BMP4 and Wnt3a were required between differentiation day (d) 1.5 and 3 to most effectively induce Mixl1, whilst Activin A induced Mixl1 expression in ESC when added between d2 and d4, indicating a subtle difference in the requirement for Activin receptor signalling in this process. Stimulation of ESCs with these factors at earlier or later times resulted in little Mixl1 induction, suggesting that the differentiating ESCs passed through 'temporal windows' in which they sequentially gained and lost competence to respond to each growth factor. Inhibition of either Activin or Wnt signalling blocked Mixl1 induction by any of the three mesendoderm-inducing factors. Mixing experiments in which chimeric EBs were formed between growth factor-treated and untreated ESCs revealed that BMP, Activin and Wnt signalling all contributed to the propagation of paracrine mesendoderm inducing signals between adjacent cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the differentiating cells passed through 'exit gates' after which point they were no longer dependent on signalling from inducing molecules for Mixl1 expression.These studies suggest that differentiating ESCs are directed by an interconnected network of growth factors similar to those present in early embryos and that the timing of growth factor activity is critical for mesendoderm induction."
https://openalex.org/W2028664479,"Many disease states are associated with regional or systemic hypoxia. The study of healthy individuals exposed to high-altitude hypoxia offers a way to explore hypoxic adaptation without the confounding effects of disease and therapeutic interventions. Using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging, we investigated skeletal muscle energetics and morphology after exposure to hypobaric hypoxia in seven altitude-naïve subjects (trekkers) and seven experienced climbers. The trekkers ascended to 5300 m while the climbers ascended above 7950 m. Before the study, climbers had better mitochondrial function (evidenced by shorter phosphocreatine recovery halftime) than trekkers: 16±1 vs. 22±2 s (mean ± SE, p<0.01). Climbers had higher resting [Pi] than trekkers before the expedition and resting [Pi] was raised across both groups on their return (PRE: 2.6±0.2 vs. POST: 3.0±0.2 mM, p<0.05). There was significant muscle atrophy post-CXE (PRE: 4.7±0.2 vs. POST: 4.5±0.2 cm2, p<0.05), yet exercising metabolites were unchanged. These results suggest that, in response to high altitude hypoxia, skeletal muscle function is maintained in humans, despite significant atrophy."

https://openalex.org/W1965691258,"Background Angiogenesis is the target of several agents in the treatment of malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). There is a real need for surrogate biomarkers that can predict selection of patients who may benefit from antiangiogenic therapies, prediction of disease outcome and which may improve the knowledge regarding mechanism of action of these treatments. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have proven efficacy in metastatic RCC (mRCC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical response to these drugs remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study aimed to identify molecular biomarkers associated with the response to sunitinib, a Tyrosine kinase inhibitor. To evaluate this relationship, primary tumors from 23 metastatic RCC patients treated by sunitinib were analyzed for a panel of 16 biomarkers involved in tumor pathways targeted by sunitinib, using real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Nine of the 23 patients (39%) responded to sunitinib. Among transcripts analyzed, only the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) soluble isoforms (VEGF121 and VEGF165) were associated with the response to sunitinib (P = 0.04 for both). Furthermore, the ratio of VEGF soluble isoforms (VEGF121/VEGF165) was significantly associated with prognosis (P = 0.02). Conclusions This preliminary study provides a promising tool that might help in the management of metastatic RCC, and could be extended to other tumors treated by TKI."
https://openalex.org/W1967655002,"Dephosphorylation and endocytic down-regulation are distinct processes that together control the signaling output of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). PTP1B can directly dephosphorylate several RTKs, but it can also promote activation of downstream pathways through largely unknown mechanisms. These positive signaling functions likely contribute to the tumor-promoting effect of PTP1B in mouse cancer models. Here, we have identified STAM2, an endosomal protein involved in sorting activated RTKs for lysosomal degradation, as a substrate of PTP1B. PTP1B interacts with STAM2 at defined phosphotyrosine sites, and knockdown of PTP1B expression augments STAM2 phosphorylation. Intriguingly, manipulating the expression and phosphorylation state of STAM2 did not have a general effect on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EGF receptor trafficking, degradation, or signaling. Instead, phosphorylated STAM2 specifically suppressed Akt activation, and a phosphorylation-deficient STAM2 mutant displayed prolonged localization on endosomes following EGF stimulation. These results reveal a novel link between the dephosphorylation and endocytic machinery and suggest that PTP1B can affect RTK signaling in a previously unrecognized manner."

Using high density oligonucleotide based microarrays, we screened for differences in mRNA expression caused by E2 and eccentric exercise. After random assignment to 8 days of either placebo (CON) or E2 (EXP), eighteen men performed 150 single-leg eccentric contractions. Muscle biopsies were collected at baseline (BL), following supplementation (PS), +3 hours (3H) and +48 hours (48H) after exercise. Serum E2 concentrations increased significantly with supplementation (P<0.001) but did not affect microarray results. Exercise led to early transcriptional changes in striated muscle activator of Rho signaling (STARS), Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) regulation and the downstream transcription factor FOS. Targeted RT-PCR analysis identified concurrent induction of negative regulators of calcineurin signaling RCAN (P<0.001) and HMOX1 (P = 0.009). Protein contents were elevated for RND3 at 3H (P = 0.02) and FOS at 48H (P<0.05). These findings indicate that early RhoA and NFAT signaling and regulation are altered following exercise for muscle remodeling and repair, but are not affected by E2."
https://openalex.org/W2032482343,"Individual dispersal decisions may be affected by the internal state of the individual and the external information of its current environment. Here we estimated the influence of dispersal on survival and investigated if individual phenotype (sex and wing length) and environmental condition (conspecific density and sex-ratio) affected dispersal decisions in the banded damselfly, Calopteryx splendens. As suspected from the literature, we showed that the proportion of dispersing individuals was higher in females than in males. We also found negative-density dependent dispersal in both sexes and influence of sex-ratio on dispersal. Individuals moved less when sex-ratio was male biased. These results are consistent with a lek mating system where males aggregate in a place and hold mating territories. Contrary to our expectations, neither dispersal nor survival was affected by wing length. Nevertheless, mean adult survival was about 8% lower in dispersing individuals than in residents. This might reflect a mortality cost due to dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W2054028145,"Insulin and ecdysone are the key extrinsic regulators of growth for the wing imaginal disks of insects. In vitro tissue culture studies have shown that these two growth regulators act synergistically: either factor alone stimulates only limited growth, but together they stimulate disks to grow at a rate identical to that observed in situ. It is generally thought that insulin signaling links growth to nutrition, and that starvation stops growth because it inhibits insulin secretion. At the end of larval life feeding stops but the disks continue to grow, so at that time disk growth has become uncoupled from nutrition. We sought to determine at exactly what point in development this uncoupling occurs.Growth and cell proliferation in the wing imaginal disks and hemolymph carbohydrate concentrations were measured at various stages in the last larval instar under experimental conditions of starvation, ligation, rescue, and hormone treatment.Here we show that in the last larval instar of M. sexta, the uncoupling of nutrition and growth occurs as the larva passes the critical weight. Before this time, starvation causes a decline in hemolymph glucose and trehalose and a cessation of wing imaginal disks growth, which can be rescued by injections of trehalose. After the critical weight the trehalose response to starvation disappears, and the expression of insulin becomes decoupled from nutrition. After the critical weight the wing disks loose their sensitivity to repression by juvenile hormone, and factors from the abdomen, but not the brain, are required to drive continued growth.During the last larval instar imaginal disk growth becomes decoupled from somatic growth at the time that the endocrine events of metamorphosis are initiated. These regulatory changes ensure that disk growth continues uninterrupted when the nutritive and endocrine signals undergo the drastic changes associated with metamorphosis."

With the goal of sequencing complete DNA of the organism, we first established and sequenced camel EST libraries, generating 70,272 reads. Following trimming, chimera check, repeat masking, cluster and assembly, we obtained 23,602 putative gene sequences, out of which over 4,500 potentially novel or fast evolving gene sequences do not carry any homology to other available genomes. Functional annotation of sequences with similarities in nucleotide and protein databases has been obtained using Gene Ontology classification. Comparison to available full length cDNA sequences and Open Reading Frame (ORF) analysis of camel sequences that exhibit homology to known genes show more than 80% of the contigs with an ORF>300 bp and approximately 40% hits extending to the start codons of full length cDNAs suggesting successful characterization of camel genes. Similarity analyses are done separately for different organisms including human, mouse, bovine, and rat. Accompanying web portal, CAGBASE (http://camel.kacst.edu.sa/), hosts a relational database containing annotated EST sequences and analysis tools with possibility to add sequences from public domain.

https://openalex.org/W2036611565,"Background Stem cell characteristics are an important feature of human cancer cells and play a major role in the therapy resistance of tumours. Strategies to target cancer stem cells are thus of major importance for cancer therapy. Differentiation therapy by nucleoside drugs represents an attractive approach for the elimination of cancer stem cells. However, even if it is generally assumed that the activity of these drugs is mediated by their ability to modulate epigenetic pathways, their precise mode of action remains to be established. We therefore analysed the potential of three nucleoside analogues to induce differentiation of the embryonic cancer stem cell line NTERA 2 D1 and compared their effect to the natural ligand retinoic acid. Methodology/Principal Findings All nucleoside analogues analyzed, but not retinoic acid, triggered proteolytic degradation of the Polycomb group protein EZH2. Two of them, 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep) and 2′-deoxy-5-azacytidine (decitabine), also induced a decrease in global DNA methylation. Nevertheless, only decitabine and 1β-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytarabine) effectively triggered neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells. We show that drug-induced differentiation, in contrast to retinoic acid induction, is caused by caspase activation, which mediates depletion of the stem cell factors NANOG and OCT4. Consistent with this observation, protein degradation and differentiation could be counteracted by co-treatment with caspase inhibitors or by depletion of CASPASE-3 and CASPASE-7 through dsRNA interference. In agreement with this, OCT4 was found to be a direct in-vitro-target of CASPASE-7. Conclusions/Significance We show that drug-induced differentiation is not a consequence of pharmacologic epigenetic modulation, but is induced by the degradation of stem-cell-specific proteins by caspases. Our results thus uncover a novel pathway that induces differentiation of embryonic cancer stem cells and is triggered by the established anticancer drugs cytarabine and decitabine. These findings suggest new approaches for directly targeting the stem cell fraction of human tumours."

Atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice were used as a model to decipher susceptible genes regulated during atherosclerosis prevention with captopril. Microarray gene expression profiling and immunohistology revealed that captopril treatment for 7 months strongly decreased the recruitment of pro-atherogenic immune cells into the aorta. Captopril-mediated inhibition of plaque-infiltrating immune cells involved down-regulation of the C-C chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9). Reduced cell migration correlated with decreased numbers of aorta-resident cells expressing the CCR9-specific chemoattractant factor, chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25).

The important role of C-C chemokines in atherogenesis was further confirmed by broad spectrum C-C chemokine blockers, which inhibited atherosclerotic plaque formation in mice (33.Bursill C.A. Choudhury R.P. Ali Z. Greaves D.R. Channon K.M. Circulation. 2004; 110: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34.Major T.C. Olszewski B. Rosebury-Smith W.S. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2009; 23: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The latter studies point to the therapeutic potential of C-C chemokine receptor blockade for atherosclerosis.The present study investigated the impact of pro-inflammatory immune cells for atherosclerosis development by microarray gene expression analysis of aortic genes from atherosclerotic apoE-deficient mice relative to ACE inhibitor-treated mice. Microarray analysis and immunohistology revealed substantial effects of ACE inhibitor therapy on immune cell recruitment into the aorta. The study identified the strong up-regulation of a C-C chemokine receptor axis in atherosclerotic lesions, i.e. atherosclerosis development was accompanied by a strong increase of plaque-resident immune cells, which were positive for the chemoattractant CCL25, and its receptor CCR9. Atherosclerosis treatment by captopril reduced the aortic infiltration with CCR9- and CCL25-positive immune cells. That observation is intriguing because there seems to be a causal relationship between atherosclerosis-induced angiotensin II-AT1 receptor activation and enhanced Ccr9-Ccl25 expression. The expression of Ccl25 as an Egr-1 target gene (25.Fu M. Zhu X. Zhang J. Liang J. Lin Y. Zhao L. Ehrengruber M.U. Chen Y.E. Gene. 2003; 315: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), could be directly triggered by angiotensin II-mediated AT1 receptor signaling, which induces Egr-1 activation (26.Kim S. Kawamura M. Wanibuchi H. Ohta K. Hamaguchi A. Omura T. Yukimura T. Miura K. Iwao H. Circulation. 1995; 92: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In agreement with that notion, the AT1 receptor protein was co-localized with CCL25 on plaque-resident cells of apoE-deficient mice. Moreover, treatment with the AT1-specific antagonist, losartan, reduced the number of plaque-resident CCL25-positive cells in vivo.Analogously to Ccl25, the up-regulation of Ccr9 in the course of atherosclerosis could be also mediated by angiotensin II-dependent AT1 receptor activation because ACE inhibition and AT1 antagonism blunted the increased mononuclear cell CCR9 protein levels of apoE-deficient mice, and the aortic recruitment of CCR9-positive immune cells. Moreover, angiotensin II-dependent AT1 receptor activation directly stimulated an increase in CCR9 protein levels of isolated monocytes. Moreover, the AT1 receptor protein was expressed on CCR9-positive cells of atherosclerotic plaques. A causal relationship between Ccr9 expression and AT1 receptor activation is also suggested by previous data, and could involve the AT1-dependent induction of tumor necrosis factor α synthesis (35.Schindler R. Dinarello C.A. Koch K.M. Cytokine. 1995; 7: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36.Valdivia-Silva J.E. Franco-Barraza J. Silva A.L. Pont G.D. Soldevila G. Meza I. García-Zepeda E.A. Cancer Lett. 2009; 283: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In addition to the relationship between the angiotensin II system and CCR9-CCL25 protein expression, several lines of evidence support the concept of a causal involvement of the CCR9-CCL25 axis in atherosclerosis development. (i) Immunohistology and immunofluorescence data revealed circulating CCR9-positive monocytes and plaque-resident CCR9-positive macrophages with characteristics of multinucleated, plaque-forming foam cells in apoE-deficient mice. (ii) CCR9-positive monocytes/macrophages are attracted by CCL25, which was released into the plaque-forming aortic intima from aorta-resident cells. (iii) Inhibition of CCR9 by RNA interference significantly attenuated the formation of atherosclerotic plaques of apoE-deficient mice. (iv) Atherosclerotic lesions of patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis showed a strong infiltration of CCR9-positive cells. Thus, the study identified the pro-atherogenic role of the C-C chemoattractant receptor, CCR9, and its specific ligand, CCL25.In agreement with an atherosclerosis-enhancing function, the CCR9-CCL25 axis is induced by several pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic stimuli such as interferon-γ, macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α (37.Jung Y.J.

Therefore targeting the CCL25-CCR9 axis may have potential significance in diagnosing and treating atherosclerotic plaque formation independently of the angiotensin II system.

In agreement with those clinical data, experimental studies demonstrated a causal relationship between angiotensin II release by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), 2The abbreviations used are: ACEangiotensin-converting enzymeCCR9C-C chemokine receptor type 9CCL25C-C motif chemokine 25RNAiRNA interferenceEgr-1early growth response protein 1apoEapolipoprotein EDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. the angiotensin II AT1 receptor, and the development of atherosclerosis because genetic inactivation of either ACE or the AT1 receptor prevents atherosclerosis development in various animal models of atherosclerosis (5.Wassmann S.

Circulation. 2004; 110: 3849-3857Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Likewise, inhibition of angiotensin II activity by ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor antagonists is curative in such animal models of atherosclerosis (7.Hayek T. Attias J. Smith J. Breslow J.L. Keidar S. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8.Keidar S. Attias J. Smith J. Breslow J.L. Hayek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).In view of the major anti-atherosclerotic effects of ACE inhibitors and AT1 antagonists, many studies investigated mechanisms that could contribute to atheroprotection upon angiotensin II inhibition. The effects of angiotensin II in atherosclerosis are complex involving actions on circulating blood cells and arterial smooth muscle cells as major targets (9.Fukuda D. Sata M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 118: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U.

Res. 2008; 31: 1631-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Established pro-atherogenic effects of angiotensin II on smooth muscle cells are related to a phenotype transformation from contractile to synthetic (11.Eto H. Miyata M. Shirasawa T. Akasaki Y. Hamada N. Nagaki A. Orihara K. Biro S. Tei C. Hypertens. Res. 2008; 31: 1631-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The effects of angiotensin II on circulating immune cells are less clear, although, gene inactivation studies clearly demonstrated the involvement of circulating blood and progenitor cells in the atherosclerosis-enhancing activity of ACE and the AT1 receptor (9.Fukuda D. Sata M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 118: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Several studies revealed that AT1 receptor-stimulated signaling enhances the pro-atherogenic potential of monocytes and macrophages by sustaining monocyte/macrophage migration into the subendothelial layer of the arterial wall, where transformation into foam cells occurs (9.Fukuda D. Sata M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 118: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 10.AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U. Cell. 2004; 119: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition to macrophages, the AT1 receptor may also exert effects on T lymphocytes by supporting T lymphocyte migration into the perivascular tissue (12.Guzik T.J. Hoch N.E. Brown K.A. McCann L.A. Rahman A. Dikalov S. Goronzy J. Weyand C. Harrison D.G. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Infiltrating T cells also play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as demonstrated by studies with animal models and patients (13.Zhou X. Nicoletti A. Elhage R. Hansson G.K. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2919-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 14.Gewaltig J. Kummer M. Koella C. Cathomas G. Biedermann B.C. Hum. Pathol. 2008; 39: 1756-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the full impact of angiotensin II on peripheral immune cells in the course of atherosclerosis development is still not understood.To further analyze the role of immune cells in the atherogenic process, and the anti-atherogenic potential of angiotensin II inhibition, we performed microarray gene expression profiling of the aorta as the target organ of atherosclerosis. As a prototypic ACE inhibitor we chose captopril with established anti-atherosclerotic actions in vivo, in various animal models (7.Hayek T. Attias J. Smith J. Breslow J.L. Keidar S. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10.AbdAlla S. Lother H. Langer A. el Faramawy Y. Quitterer U.

We report here that inhibition of angiotensin II generation and atherosclerosis development by captopril in hypercholesterolemic apoE-deficient mice led to a profound change of the aortic immune cell infiltrate, and down-regulated the chemoattractant C-C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9), with its specific ligand, C-C motif chemokine 25 (CCL25)."
https://openalex.org/W2087168695,"Nuclear translocation of chloride intracellular channel protein CLIC4 is essential for its role in Ca(2+)-induced differentiation, stress-induced apoptosis, and modulating TGF-beta signaling in mouse epidermal keratinocytes. However, post-translational modifications on CLIC4 that govern nuclear translocation and thus these activities remain to be elucidated. The structure of CLIC4 is dependent on the redox environment, in vitro, and translocation may depend on reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the cell. Here we show that NO directly induces nuclear translocation of CLIC4 that is independent of the NO-cGMP pathway. Indeed, CLIC4 is directly modified by NO through S-nitrosylation of a cysteine residue, as measured by the biotin switch assay. NO enhances association of CLIC4 with the nuclear import proteins importin alpha and Ran. This is likely a result of the conformational change induced by S-nitrosylated CLIC4 that leads to unfolding of the protein, as exhibited by CD spectra analysis and trypsinolysis of the modified protein. Cysteine mutants of CLIC4 exhibit altered nitrosylation, nuclear residence, and stability, compared with the wild type protein likely as a consequence of altered tertiary structure. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear translocation of CLIC4 is dependent on nitric-oxide synthase activity. Inhibition of nitric-oxide synthase activity inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nitrosylation and association with importin alpha and Ran and ablates CLIC4 nuclear translocation. These results suggest that S-nitrosylation governs CLIC4 structure, its association with protein partners, and thus its intracellular distribution."

We assessed the association of serum phosphate with early mortality among HIV-infected adults with severe malnutrition and/or advanced immunosuppression.An observational cohort of 142 HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Lusaka, Zambia with body mass index (BMI) <16 kg/m(2) or CD4(+) lymphocyte count <50 cells/microL, or both, was followed prospectively during the first 12 weeks of ART. Detailed health and dietary intake history, review of systems, physical examination, serum metabolic panel including phosphate, and serum ferritin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were monitored. The primary outcome was mortality. Baseline serum phosphate was a significant predictor of mortality; participants alive at 12 weeks had a median value of 1.30 mmol/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.04, 1.43), compared to 1.06 mmol/L (IQR: 0.89, 1.27) among those who died (p<0.01). Each 0.1 mmol/L increase in baseline phosphate was associated with an incremental decrease in mortality (AHR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95). The association was independent of other metabolic parameters and known risk factors for early ART-associated mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. While participant attrition represented a limitation, it was consistent with local program experience.Low serum phosphate at ART initiation was an independent predictor of early mortality among HIV patients starting ART with severe malnutrition or advanced immunosuppression. This may represent a physiologic phenomenon similar to refeeding syndrome, and may lead to therapeutic interventions that could reduce mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2044317665,"Figure-ground is the segmentation of visual information into objects and their surrounding backgrounds. Two main processes herein are boundary assignment and surface segregation, which rely on the integration of global scene information. Recurrent processing either by intrinsic horizontal connections that connect surrounding neurons or by feedback projections from higher visual areas provide such information, and are considered to be the neural substrate for figure-ground segmentation. On the contrary, a role of feedforward projections in figure-ground segmentation is unknown. To have a better understanding of a role of feedforward connections in figure-ground organization, we constructed a feedforward spiking model using a biologically plausible neuron model. By means of surround inhibition our simple 3-layered model performs figure-ground segmentation and one-sided border-ownership coding. We propose that the visual system uses feed forward suppression for figure-ground segmentation and border-ownership assignment."
https://openalex.org/W2054101825,"The skeletal site-specific influence of multiple genes on bone morphology is recognised, but the question as to how these influences may be exerted at the molecular and cellular level has not been explored.To address this question, we have compared global gene expression profiles of human trabecular bone from two different skeletal sites that experience vastly different degrees of mechanical loading, namely biopsies from iliac crest and lumbar spinal lamina.In the lumbar spine, compared to the iliac crest, the majority of the differentially expressed genes showed significantly increased levels of expression; 3406 transcripts were up- whilst 838 were down-regulated. Interestingly, all gene transcripts that have been recently demonstrated to be markers of osteocyte, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast-related genes, were markedly up-regulated in the spine. The transcriptome data is consistent with osteocyte numbers being almost identical at the two anatomical sites, but suggesting a relatively low osteocyte functional activity in the iliac crest. Similarly, osteoblast and osteoclast expression data suggested similar numbers of the cells, but presented with higher activity in the spine than iliac crest. This analysis has also led to the identification of expression of a number of transcripts, previously known and novel, which to our knowledge have never earlier been associated with bone growth and remodelling.This study provides molecular evidence explaining anatomical and micro-architectural site-related changes in bone cell function, which is predominantly attributable to alteration in cell transcriptional activity. A number of novel signaling molecules in critical pathways, which have been hitherto not known to be expressed in bone cells of mature vertebrates, were identified."
https://openalex.org/W2077033239,"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is recommended to be given at birth together with BCG vaccine. While we were conducting two trials including low-birth-weight (LBW) and normal-birth-weight (NBW) infants in Guinea-Bissau, OPV was not available during some periods and therefore some infants did not receive OPV at birth, but only BCG. We investigated the effect of OPV given simultaneously with BCG at birth on the immune response to BCG vaccine.We compared the in vitro and the in vivo response to PPD in the infants who received OPV and BCG with that of infants who received BCG only. At age 6 weeks, the in vitro cytokine response to purified protein derivate (PPD) of M. Tuberculosis was reduced in LBW and NBW infants who had received OPV with BCG. In a pooled analysis receiving OPV with BCG at birth was associated with significantly lower IL-13 (p = 0.041) and IFN-gamma (p = 0.004) and a tendency for lower IL-10 (p = 0.054) in response to PPD. Furthermore, OPV was associated with reduced in vivo response to PPD at age 2 months, the prevalence ratio (PR) of having a PPD reaction being 0.75 (0.58-0.98), p = 0.033, and with a tendency for reduced likelihood of having a BCG scar (0.95 (0.91-1.00), p = 0.057)). Among children with a scar, OPV was associated with reduced scar size, the regression coefficient being -0.24 (-0.43-0.05), p = 0.012.This study is the first to address the consequences for the immune response to BCG of simultaneous administration with OPV. Worryingly, the results indicate that the common practice in low-income countries of administering OPV together with BCG at birth may down-regulate the response to BCG vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2006979545,"Cells require distinct adhesion complexes to form contacts with their neighbors or the extracellular matrix, and vinculin links these complexes to the actin cytoskeleton. Metavinculin, an isoform of vinculin that harbors a unique 68-residue insert in its tail domain, has distinct actin bundling and oligomerization properties and plays essential roles in muscle development and homeostasis. Moreover, patients with sporadic or familial mutations in the metavinculin-specific insert invariably develop fatal cardiomyopathies. Here we report the high resolution crystal structure of the metavinculin tail domain, as well as the crystal structures of full-length human native metavinculin (1,134 residues) and of the full-length cardiomyopathy-associated ΔLeu954 metavinculin deletion mutant. These structures reveal that an α-helix (H1′) and extended coil of the metavinculin insert replace α-helix H1 and its preceding extended coil found in the N-terminal region of the vinculin tail domain to form a new five-helix bundle tail domain. Further, biochemical analyses demonstrate that this helix replacement directs the distinct actin bundling and oligomerization properties of metavinculin. Finally, the cardiomyopathy associated ΔLeu954 and Arg975Trp metavinculin mutants reside on the replaced extended coil and the H1′ α-helix, respectively. Thus, a helix replacement mechanism directs metavinculin's unique functions."
https://openalex.org/W1992900259,"Saba Bank is a 2,200 km2 submerged carbonate platform in the northeastern Caribbean Sea off Saba Island, Netherlands Antilles. The presence of reef-like geomorphic features and significant shelf edge coral development on Saba Bank have led to the conclusion that it is an actively growing, though wholly submerged, coral reef atoll. However, little information exists on the composition of benthic communities or associated reef fish assemblages of Saba Bank. We selected a 40 km2 area of the bank for an exploratory study. Habitat and reef fish assemblages were investigated in five shallow-water benthic habitat types that form a gradient from Saba Bank shelf edge to lagoon. Significant coral cover was restricted to fore reef habitat (average cover 11.5%) and outer reef flat habitat (2.4%) and declined to near zero in habitats of the central lagoon zone. Macroalgae dominated benthic cover in all habitats (average cover: 32.5 – 48.1%) but dominant algal genera differed among habitats. A total of 97 fish species were recorded. The composition of Saba Bank fish assemblages differed among habitat types. Highest fish density and diversity occurred in the outer reef flat, fore reef and inner reef flat habitats. Biomass estimates for commercially valued species in the reef zone (fore reef and reef flat habitats) ranged between 52 and 83 g/m2. The composition of Saba Bank fish assemblages reflects the absence of important nursery habitats, as well as the effects of past fishing. The relatively high abundance of large predatory fish (i.e. groupers and sharks), which is generally considered an indicator of good ecosystem health for tropical reef systems, shows that an intact trophic network is still present on Saba Bank."
https://openalex.org/W1969950105,"There is a pressing need for high-affinity protein binding ligands for all proteins in the human and other proteomes. Numerous groups are working to develop protein binding ligands but most approaches develop ligands using the same strategy in which a large library of structured ligands is screened against a protein target to identify a high-affinity ligand for the target. While this methodology generates high-affinity ligands for the target, it is generally an iterative process that can be difficult to adapt for the generation of ligands for large numbers of proteins.We have developed a class of peptide-based protein ligands, called synbodies, which allow this process to be run backwards--i.e. make a synbody and then screen it against a library of proteins to discover the target. By screening a synbody against an array of 8,000 human proteins, we can identify which protein in the library binds the synbody with high affinity. We used this method to develop a high-affinity synbody that specifically binds AKT1 with a K(d)<5 nM. It was found that the peptides that compose the synbody bind AKT1 with low micromolar affinity, implying that the affinity and specificity is a product of the bivalent interaction of the synbody with AKT1. We developed a synbody for another protein, ABL1 using the same method.This method delivered a high-affinity ligand for a target protein in a single discovery step. This is in contrast to other techniques that require subsequent rounds of mutational improvement to yield nanomolar ligands. As this technique is easily scalable, we believe that it could be possible to develop ligands to all the proteins in any proteome using this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2071206111,"The eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin CCT is a hetero-oligomeric complex formed by two rings connected back-to-back, each composed of eight distinct subunits (CCTalpha to CCTzeta). CCT complex mediates the folding, of a wide range of newly synthesised proteins including tubulin (alpha, beta and gamma) and actin, as quantitatively major substrates.We disrupted the genes encoding CCTalpha and CCTdelta subunits in the ciliate Tetrahymena. Cells lacking the zygotic expression of either CCTalpha or CCTdelta showed a loss of cell body microtubules, failed to assemble new cilia and died within 2 cell cycles. We also show that loss of CCT subunit activity leads to axoneme shortening and splaying of tips of axonemal microtubules. An epitope-tagged CCTalpha rescued the gene knockout phenotype and localized primarily to the tips of cilia. A mutation in CCTalpha, G346E, at a residue also present in the related protein implicated in the Bardet Biedel Syndrome, BBS6, also caused defects in cilia and impaired CCTalpha localization in cilia.Our results demonstrate that the CCT subunits are essential and required for ciliary assembly and maintenance of axoneme structure, especially at the tips of cilia."
https://openalex.org/W2092556352,"Various environmental insults result in irreversible damage to proteins and protein complexes. To cope, cells have evolved dedicated protein quality control mechanisms involving molecular chaperones and proteases. Here, we provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that the Lon protease and the SecB and DnaJ/Hsp40 chaperones are involved in the quality control of presecretory proteins in Escherichia coli. We showed that mutations in the lon gene alleviate the cold-sensitive phenotype of a secB mutant. Such suppression was not observed with either clpP or clpQ protease mutants. In comparison to the respective single mutants, the double secB lon mutant strongly accumulates aggregates of SecB substrates at physiological temperatures, suggesting that the chaperone and the protease share substrates. These observations were extended in vitro by showing that the main substrates identified in secB lon aggregates, namely proOmpF and proOmpC, are highly sensitive to specific degradation by Lon. In contrast, both substrates are significantly protected from Lon degradation by SecB. Interestingly, the chaperone DnaJ by itself protects substrates better from Lon degradation than SecB or the complete DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone machinery. In agreement with this finding, a DnaJ mutant protein that does not functionally interact in vivo with DnaK efficiently suppresses the SecB cold-sensitive phenotype, highlighting the role of DnaJ in assisting presecretory proteins. Taken together, our data suggest that when the Sec secretion pathway is compromised, a pool of presecretory proteins is transiently maintained in a translocation-competent state and, thus, protected from Lon degradation by either the SecB or DnaJ chaperones.

In the bacterium Escherichia coli, intracellular protein folding is mainly orchestrated by the chaperones Trigger Factor (TF), 2The abbreviations used are: TFTrigger FactorCscold-sensitiveIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. DnaK/Hsp70, and GroEL/Hsp60. The chaperone TF binds near the ribosomal polypeptide exit with a 1:1 stoichiometry, forming a protective “cradle” for emerging nascent chains. Because of its advantageous localization, TF may interact co-translationally with most nascent polypeptides (6.Lill R. Crooke E. Guthrie B. Wickner W. Cell. 1988; 54: 1013-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7.Ferbitz L. Maier T. Patzelt H. Bukau B. Deuerling E. Ban N. Nature. 2004; 431: 590-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). TF cycles on and off the ribosome, and both ribosome-bound or released polypeptide chains can stay post-translationally bound to ribosome-free TF for a prolonged period (8.Kaiser C.M. Chang H.C.

The ATP-dependent chaperone DnaK, assisted by its dedicated cochaperones DnaJ and GrpE, provides co- and/or post-translational assistance to newly synthesized proteins released from TF (10.Teter S.A.

Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In this case the DnaJ cochaperone, which also exhibits bona fide chaperone activity, is thought to selectively bind various substrates, transfer them to DnaK, and concomitantly stimulate DnaK ATPase activity (14.Liberek K. Marszalek J. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2874-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). In contrast, the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE stimulates ADP/ATP exchange and subsequent substrate release from DnaK (15.Siegenthaler R.K. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34448-34456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Like DnaK, the GroEL-GroES chaperone machine is also responsible for the post-translational folding of a substantial number of newly synthesized polypeptides inside its ATP-dependent cavity (16.Chapman E. Farr G.W. Usaite R. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Chaudhuri T.K. Hondorp E.R. Matthews R.G. Wolf S.G. Yates J.R. Pypaert M. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15800-15805Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Several essential proteins have been described as obligate GroEL-GroES substrates, in agreement with the observation that GroEL-GroES is the sole chaperone machine essential for E. coli viability (17.Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Ishihama Y. Maier T. Chang H.C. Stines A.P. Georgopoulos C. Frishman D. Hayer-Hartl M. Mann M. Hartl F.U.

Trigger Factor cold-sensitive isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid dithiothreitol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. Newly synthesized presecretory proteins are generally targeted post-translationally by the SecB chaperone to the Sec translocon located at the inner membrane (19.Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SecB is a homotetrameric chaperone of 17-kDa monomers assembled as a dimer of dimers (20.Dekker C. de Kruijff B. Gros P. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 144: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It binds its nonnative substrates either co- or post-translationally with high affinity and without specificity for signal sequence. Productive interaction with SecB is strongly influenced by the folding rate of its substrates (21.Diamond D.L. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28994-28998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22.Lilly A.A. Crane J.M. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 1860-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SecB transfers each bound protein substrate to the Sec translocon by interacting specifically with the peripheral translocase motor SecA. Substrate transfer to SecA and the subsequent release of SecB activates SecA for further preprotein translocation through the inner membrane (23.Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 24.Driessen A.J. Nouwen N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 643-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Functional overlaps between SecB and other cytosolic chaperones have been observed. First, SecB overexpression rescues protein aggregation and bacterial growth in the absence of both cytosolic chaperones DnaK and TF (25.Ullers R.S. Luirink J. Harms N. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7583-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and all three chaperones share potential binding sites within their polypeptide substrates (26.Knoblauch N.T. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.J. Driessen A.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, both DnaK and GroEL assist protein export in some cases (27.Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28.Bochkareva E. Seluanov A. Bibi E. Girshovich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22256-22261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Third, under certain conditions, a strong antagonism has been observed between the two chaperones SecB and TF in vivo. Indeed, the presence of ribosome-bound TF generally retards protein export (29.Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43527-43535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30.Ullers R.S. Ang D. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In agreement with this observation, the protein export defect, the cold-sensitive (Cs) phenotype, and the increased protein aggregation observed in the absence of SecB are fully suppressed by null mutations in the tig gene, encoding TF. In this case more SecA and ribosomes are found associated with the inner membrane, suggesting that TF directly or indirectly interferes with the process of co-translational targeting to the Sec translocon, thus driving presecretory proteins toward a post-translational mode of export that relies on the cytosolic chaperone SecB (30.Ullers R.S. Ang D. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31.Karamyshev A.L. Johnson A.E. J. Biol.

These observations suggest the existence of an efficient and dedicated cellular mechanism for the elimination of precursor proteins that may accumulate under various stress conditions. In this study we present genetic and biochemical evidence for the existence of such a quality control mechanism in E. coli and present a model to explain our various findings. Genetic experiments were carried out in E. coli strain SG20781 (32.Painbéni E. Mouray E. Gottesman S. Rouvière-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1021-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), MC4100 (33.Casadaban M.J. J. Mol.

The deletion/replacement of the lon gene by a KanR cassette was carried out as described (35.Yu D. Ellis H.M. Lee E.C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Court D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar) using pKD4 as the DNA template (36.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11196) Google Scholar). The KanR cassette was removed from the chromosome using FLP recombinase as described (36.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11196) Google Scholar). The Δlon::KanR and Δlon alleles were confirmed by DNA sequencing and by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-Lon antibodies (a kind gift of Tomoko Yamamoto, Chiba University). The ΔsecB::CmR (30.Ullers R.S. Ang D. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and secA51 (40.Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) mutant alleles were described previously. The ΔompF::KanR, ΔclpQ::KanR, and ΔclpP::KanR alleles were from strains JWK0912, JWK3903, and JWK0427, respectively (Keio collection). DNA transformations were carried out in the strain DH5α (Invitrogen). Protein overexpression using the pET expression system was carried out in BL21 (λDE3) derivatives (Novagen). All the mutations described in this study were moved to the appropriate genetic backgrounds by bacteriophage P1-mediated transduction. Bacteria were grown in LB or M9 medium supplemented when necessary with either chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml), kanamycin (40 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), or tetracycline (15 μg/ml) (41.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). On LB agar plates, bacteria were incubated for 1 day at 30, 33, or 37 °C, for 2 days at 20 or 22 °C, and for 5 or 6 days at 16 °C. Plasmids p29SEN, pSE380ΔNcoI (42.Genevaux P. Keppel F. Schwager F. Langendijk-Genevaux P.S. Hartl F.U. Georgopoulos C. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and pSE380 (Invitrogen) were described previously. To construct plasmid pSE-Lon (pSE380-Lon), the 2355-bp lon gene was PCR-amplified using primers Lon-ERI-for (5′-gcgaattctatgaatcctgagcgttctgaacg-3′) and Lon-BglII-rev (5′-cgcagatctctattttgcagtcacaacctgcat-3′) and MG1655 genomic DNA as template. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI-BglII and cloned into pSE380ΔNcoI, previously digested with the same enzymes. Alanine substitution of serine 679 in Lon was constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate primers and plasmid pSE-Lon as template. The resulting plasmid was named pSE-LonSA. Plasmid pSE-LonHis6 and pSE-LonSAHis6 (Lon and Lon (S679A) with C-terminal His6 tags) were constructed by PCR using primers Lon-ERI-for and Lon-BglII-His6-rev (5′-cgagatctgttaatgatgatgatgatgatggctgctgccttttgcagtcacaacctgcatac-3′) and pSE-Lon or pSE-LonSA as the DNA template. The PCR fragments were digested with SalI and BglII enzymes then ligated into pSE-Lon previously digested with the same enzymes. Expression of the Lon proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-Lon antibodies, and the in vivo ability of these proteins to restore ΔsecB cold-sensitivity and inhibit colanic acid synthesis on LB agar plates was confirmed. Plasmids pSE-DnaJ and pSE-DnaJ(H33Q) were constructed by subcloning the NcoI-BglII-digested dnaJ and dnaJ259(H33Q) fragments of pWKG90(dnaJ) and pWKG91(dnaJ259) (43.Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), respectively, into pSE380 previously digested with the same enzymes. To construct pET15b-OmpF, the entire ompF gene was PCR-amplified from MG1655 genomic DNA using primers OmpF-NdeI-for 5′-cgcacatatgatgaagcgcaatattctggcagtg-3′ and OmpF-HIII/BHI-rev (5′-caagcttggatccttagaactggtaaacgatacccacagc-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI enzymes, then ligated into pET15b previously digested with the same enzymes. A similar cloning strategy was employed for pET15b-OmpC, pET15b-SecB, and pET15b-RpoA using primers OmpC-NdeI-for (5′-cgcacatatgaaagttaaagtactgtccctcctg-3′) and OmpC-HIII/BHI-rev (5′-caagcttggatccttagaactggtaaaccagacccagagc-3′) for pET15b-OmpC, SecB-NdeI-for (5′-cagccatatgtcagaacaaaacaacactg-3′) and SecB-BamHI-rev (5′-gcggatcctcaggcatcctgatgttcttcag-3′) for pET15b-SecB, and RpoA-NdeI-for (5′-cagccatatgcagggttctgtgacagag-3′) and RpoA-BamHI-rev (5′-gcggatccttactcgtcagcgatgcttgc-3′) for pET15b-RpoA. The plasmid p29-OmpF containing OmpF with a C-terminal myc epitope was constructed by PCR using primers OmpF-ERI/BspHI-for (5′-cggaattctcatgatgaagcgcaatattctggcagtg-3′) and OmpF-myc-HIII/BHI-rev (5′-caagcttggatccttacagatcctcttctgagatgagtttttgttcaccaccgaactggtaaacgatacccacagc-3′) and pET15b-OmpF as template. The EcoRI-HindIII-digested fragment was then ligated into p29SEN previously digested with the same enzymes. All constructs obtained by PCR were verified by sequencing. Strain SG20781 Δlon ΔsecB::CmR ΔompF::KanR harboring pSE-LonHis6 or pSE3-LonS679AHis6 was used to purify Lon and Lon(S679A), respectively. To induce Lon(S679A) protein expression, 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to mid-log phase cultures grown in LB ampicillin at 37 °C. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 rpm (JLA-16.250 Beckman rotor) for 5 min at 4 °C. To obtain larger quantities of Lon wild type protein, Lon expression was also performed in continuous batch culture. In this case cells were grown until an A600 of 80, and expression was induced with 2 mm IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C. In both cases pellets were then resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with 2 mg/ml lysozyme (Euromedex) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The suspension was sonicated on ice (6 pulses, 20 s each). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (JA-20 Beckman rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C and loaded onto a 2-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). The column (pre-equilibrated with buffer A supplemented with 20 mm imidazole) was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer A supplemented with 50 mm imidazole for Lon and 20 mm imidazole for Lon(S679A) following the manufacturer's protocol. Bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole in buffer A. Proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore) and stored at −80 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol. RpoA was purified from strain BL21 (λDE3) harboring plasmid pET15b-RpoA. At mid-log phase, RpoA expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. After 2 h at 37 °C, cell lysis and protein purification were carried out as described for Lon(S679A). Purified RpoA used in the degradation assay was stored under denaturing conditions in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 8 m urea. BL21 (λDE3) harboring pET15b-SecBHis6 was used to overexpress SecBHis6. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB ampicillin to mid-log phase, and SecB expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. After 2 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested at 7000 rpm (JLA-16.250 Beckman rotor) for 10 min at 4 °C and washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm imidazole, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.35 mg/ml lysozyme and kept on ice for 10 min. MgSO4 (5 mm final concentration) was then added, and samples were kept on ice for an additional 10 min. Samples were sonicated twice for 10 s to reduce viscosity. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C (JA-25.50 Beckman rotor). Cleared lysates were applied to a 1-ml Ni-NTA agarose column pre-equilibrated at 4 °C with 5 volumes of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 800 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm imidazole, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The column was washed with 15 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. SecB was eluted with 7 ml of the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was concentrated using a 10-kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol. SecB was further purified by ion exchange chromatography using a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) and the BioLogic DuoFlow System (Bio-Rad). SecB was eluted with a linear 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The peak fractions containing SecB were pooled and concentrated. The protein was stored in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol. The precursor forms of the OmpF and OmpC porins accumulate as aggregates in the cytosolic fraction of BL21 (λDE3) ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR at 40 °C because this strain lacks the DnaK/DnaJ chaperones. To purify these precursors, BL21 (λDE3) ΔdnaKdnaJ::KanR harboring the expression vector pET15b-OmpF or pET15b-OmpC, respectively, was grown in 200 ml of LB ampicillin at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.3. The cultures were then transferred to 40 °C for 40 min in the presence of 1 mm IPTG. Cells were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and aggregates were isolated as described by Tomoyasu et al. (46.Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) except that the final pellet containing total aggregates was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH7.5, 8 m urea. Samples were subsequently applied to a 1-ml Ni-NTA-agarose column and shaken for 1 h at room temperature. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were precipitated and resuspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 8 m urea, then stored at −80 °C. The proOmpFΔC-ter construct missing the last 10 amino acids (353TVAVGIVYQF362) was purified as described for proOmpF. DnaK was purified as described by Zylicz et al. (44.Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GrpE and DnaJ were purchased from StressGen. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad protein assay) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SG20781 ΔsecB or ΔsecB Δlon mutants freshly transformed with plasmid p29-OmpF were grown overnight in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose, ampicillin, and 0.2% casamino acids at 30 °C. Cultures were diluted to an A600 of ∼0.05 in the same medium and grown to approximately absorbance of 0.3 at 30 °C with aeration. Cultures were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in M9 containing 0.2% glucose, ampicillin, 0.1 mm IPTG, and a methionine/cysteine-free amino acid mix. After 30 min at 30 °C, cells were pulse-labeled for 1 min at 30 °C with 10 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine. The chase was initiated by the addition of 2 mm unlabeled methionine/cysteine and immediate transfer to 16 °C for the times indicated. After the chase, cells were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid on ice. Samples were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-OmpF antibodies as described (45.Jong W.S. ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Genevaux P. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4779-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Radio-labeled gels were scanned by Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimaging. Overnight cultures were diluted 1/50 in 200 ml of fresh LB medium and grown at the indicated temperature to an A600 of ∼1.0. Aggregates were isolated using the method developed by Tomoyasu et al. (46.Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) except that all volumes were increased 10-fold (30.Ullers R.S. Ang D. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 3101-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After separation by 12% SDS-PAGE, proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses, aggregates were isolated from 200 ml of cultures and resuspended in 75 μl of phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm EDTA. An equal volume of IDSL buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% CHAPS, 0.8% ASB-14, 1.6% ampholines 5/7 (Bio-Rad 163–1152), 0.4% ampholines 3.5–10 (Bio-Rad 163-1112)) was added, and samples were incubated at 20 °C for 45 min. Isoelectric focusing was subsequently performed using the Tube Cell Model 175 (Bio-Rad) for 18 h at 500 V. Proteins were separated in the second dimension by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, excised from the gel, and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as described (47.Scherl A. Couté Y. Déon C. Callé A. Kindbeiter K. Sanchez J.C. Greco A. Hochstrasser D. Diaz J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Degradation assays were performed in 50-μl reactions containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl with or without SecB or DnaJ chaperones. Reactions were kept on ice for 10 min and transferred at 37 °C for 5 min. Protein substrates proOmpF, proOmpC, or RpoA were denatured in the presence of 8 m urea at 95 °C for 15 min and subsequently added to the reaction at a final concentration of 0.3 μm. Degradation was then initiated by addition of 10 mm ATP (GE Healthcare) and 0.16 μm Lon hexamers. Reactions were kept at 37 °C for the times indicated. At each time point, a 15-μl aliquot was transferred to Laemmli SDS loading buffer (4×) supplemented with 25 mm EDTA to stop the reaction. Proteins separated on 4–12% NUPAGE gels (Invitrogen) were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen, iBlot Transfer Stack) and probed with appropriate antibodies and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence using goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Intensity of the bands was quantified using OptiQuant software. A ΔsecB mutant is Cs for growth below 23 °C, mostly due to its defect in protein export (30.Ullers R.S. Ang D. Schwager F.

https://openalex.org/W2064506694,"Saba Bank is a large submerged platform (∼2200 km2), average depth 30 m, located 4 km southwest of Saba Island in Netherlands Antilles, Caribbean Sea. Ships traveling to and from oil terminals on nearby St. Eustatius routinely anchor on the Bank, damaging benthic megafauna. Gorgonian octocorals are vulnerable to anchor damage, and they are common and conspicuous in shallow water (15–50 m) around the banks. This prompted a rapid assessment of octocoral habitat and diversity. The primary objectives were to estimate total species richness and to characterize habitats vis a vis gorgonians. Landsat imagery and multibeam bathymetry were employed to identify random sites for quantitative transects. A Seabotix LBV200L remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and SCUBA were used to collect and survey to 130 m. A total of 14 scuba dives and 3 ROV dives were completed in 10 days. During that time, 48 octocoral species were collected, including two likely undescribed species in the genera Pterogorgia and Lytreia. Gorgonian richness was exceptional, but not all species were collected, because the species accumulation curve remained steeply inclined after all surveys. Two shallow-water gorgonian habitat types were identified using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses: 1) a high diversity, high density fore-reef environment characterized by Eunicea spp., Gorgonia spp., and Pseudopterogorgia spp. and 2) a low diversity, low density plateau environment characterized by Pseudopterogorgia acerosa, Pterogorgia guadalupensis, and Gorgonia mariae. The analyses support hypotheses of broad (∼15 km) habitat homogeneity (ANOSIM, P>0.05), but a significant difference between fore-reef and plateau environments (ANOSIM, P<0.05). However, there was some indication of habitat heterogeneity along the 15 km study section of the 50 km platform edge along the southeast rim. Our results highlight the complexity and biodiversity of the Saba Bank, and emphasize the need for more scientific exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2171502514,"Background In southern China, a wild ectomycorrhizal mushroom commonly called “Dahongjun” or “Big Red Mushroom” by the local residents, has been harvested, consumed, and/or exported as an exotic food for many years. Although ecologically and economically important, very little is known about this mushroom, including its diversity and population structure. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, we analyzed 122 samples from five local populations representing the known distribution ranges of this mushroom in southern China. We investigated the genetic diversity and geographic structure of this mushroom using sequences from four DNA fragments. Our analyses identified that this mushroom contained at least three divergent lineages: one corresponds to a recently described species Russula griseocarnosa from southern China and the remaining two likely represent two novel species. While these lineages were prominently structured geographically based on ITS sequences, evidence for ancient and/or recent gene flow was also identified within individual lineages. In addition, a local population from Ailaoshan in central Yunnan Province where 85 of our 122 specimens came from showed clear evidence of recombination. Conclusion and Significance The ectomycorrhizal mushroom “Dahongjun” from southern China is a species complex with at least three divergent lineages. These lineages are largely geographically structured and there is evidence for recombination in nature. Our results indicate mature Dahongjun mushrooms with abundant basidiospores are important for the reproduction of this mushroom in nature and that individual populations of this species should be managed separately."
https://openalex.org/W2072557672,"The alpha6beta4 integrin plays a significant role in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis through modulation of growth factor signaling, and is a potentially important therapeutic target. However, alpha6beta4-mediated cell-matrix adhesion is critical in normal keratinocyte attachment, signaling and anchorage to the basement membrane through its interaction with laminin-5, raising potential risks for targeted therapy. Bioengineered Human Skin Equivalent (HSE), which have been shown to mimic their normal and wounded counterparts, have been used here to investigate the consequences of targeting beta4 to establish toxic effects on normal tissue homeostasis and epithelial wound repair. We tested two antibodies directed to different beta4 epitopes, one adhesion-blocking (ASC-8) and one non-adhesion blocking (ASC-3), and determined that these antibodies were appropriately localized to the basal surface of keratinocytes at the basement membrane interface where beta4 is expressed. While normal tissue architecture was not altered, ASC-8 induced a sub-basal split at the basement membrane in non-wounded tissue. In addition, wound closure was significantly inhibited by ASC-8, but not by ASC-3, as the epithelial tongue only covered 40 percent of the wound area at 120 hours post-wounding. These results demonstrate beta4 adhesion-blocking antibodies may have adverse effects on normal tissue, whereas antibodies directed to other epitopes may provide safer alternatives for therapy. Taken together, we conclude that these three-dimensional tissue models provide a biologically relevant platform to identify toxic effects induced by candidate therapeutics, which will allow generation of findings that are more predictive of in vivo responses early in the drug development process."
https://openalex.org/W1987299844,"One of the accessory proteins of Sendai virus (SeV), C, translated from an alternate reading frame of P/V mRNA has been shown to function at multiple stages of infection in cell cultures as well as in mice. C protein has been reported to counteract signal transduction by interferon (IFN), inhibit apoptosis induced by the infection, enhance the efficiency of budding of viral particles, and regulate the polarity of viral genome-length RNA synthesis to maximize production of infectious particles. In this study, we have generated a series of SeV recombinants containing substitutions of highly conserved, charged residues within the C protein, and characterized them together with previously-reported C′/C(−), 4C(−), and F170S recombinant viruses in infected cell cultures in terms of viral replication, cytopathogenicity, and antagonizing effects on host innate immunity. Unexpectedly, the amino acid substitutions had no or minimal effect on viral growth and viral RNA synthesis. However, all the substitutions of charged amino acids resulted in the loss of a counteracting effect against the establishment of an IFN-α-mediated anti-viral state. Infection by the virus (Cm2′) containing mutations at K77 and D80 induced significant IFN-β production, severe cytopathic effects, and detectable amounts of viral dsRNA production. In addition to the Cm2′ virus, the virus containing mutations at E114 and E115 did not inhibit the poly(I:C)-triggered translocation of cellular IRF-3 to the nucleus. These results suggest that the C protein play important roles in viral escape from induction of IFN-β and cell death triggered by infection by means of counteracting the pathway leading to activation of IRF-3 as well as of minimizing viral dsRNA production."
https://openalex.org/W2035259531,"Saba Bank Atoll, Netherlands Antilles, is one of the three largest atolls on Earth and provides habitat for an extensive coral reef community. To improve our knowledge of this vast marine resource, a survey of biodiversity at Saba Bank included a multi-disciplinary team that sampled fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, macroalgae, and sponges.A single member of the dive team conducted surveys of sponge biodiversity during eight dives at six locations, at depths ranging from 15 to 30 m. This preliminary assessment documented the presence of 45 species pooled across multiple locations. Rarefaction analysis estimated that only 48 to 84% of species diversity was sampled by this limited effort, clearly indicating a need for additional surveys. An analysis of historical collections from Saba and Saba Bank revealed an additional 36 species, yielding a total of 81 sponge species recorded from this area.This observed species composition is similar to that found on widespread Caribbean reefs, indicating that the sponge fauna of Saba Bank is broadly representative of the Caribbean as a whole. A robust population of the giant barrel sponge, Xestospongia muta, appeared healthy with none of the signs of disease or bleaching reported from other Caribbean reefs; however, more recent reports of anchor chain damage to these sponges suggests that human activities can have dramatic impacts on these communities. Opportunities to protect this extremely large habitat should be pursued, as Saba Bank may serve as a significant reservoir of sponge species diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2020266794,"Stability and biological activity of proteins is highly dependent on their physicochemical environment. The development of realistic models of biological systems necessitates quantitative information on the response to changes of external conditions like pH, salinity and concentrations of substrates and allosteric modulators. Changes in just a few variable parameters rapidly lead to large numbers of experimental conditions, which go beyond the experimental capacity of most research groups. We implemented a computer-aided experimenting framework (“robot lab assistant”) that allows us to parameterize abstract, human-readable descriptions of micro-plate based experiments with variable parameters and execute them on a conventional 8 channel liquid handling robot fitted with a sensitive plate reader. A set of newly developed R-packages translates the instructions into machine commands, executes them, collects the data and processes it without user-interaction. By combining script-driven experimental planning, execution and data-analysis, our system can react to experimental outcomes autonomously, allowing outcome-based iterative experimental strategies. The framework was applied in a response-surface model based iterative optimization of buffer conditions and investigation of substrate, allosteric effector, pH and salt dependent activity profiles of pyruvate kinase (PYK). A diprotic model of enzyme kinetics was used to model the combined effects of changing pH and substrate concentrations. The 8 parameters of the model could be estimated from a single two-hour experiment using nonlinear least-squares regression. The model with the estimated parameters successfully predicted pH and PEP dependence of initial reaction rates, while the PEP concentration dependent shift of optimal pH could only be reproduced with a set of manually tweaked parameters. Differences between model-predictions and experimental observations at low pH suggest additional protonation-sites at the enzyme or substrates critical for enzymatic activity. The developed framework is a powerful tool to investigate enzyme reaction specifics and explore biological system behaviour in a wide range of experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2024253147,"Background Septins are involved in a number of cellular processes including cytokinesis and organization of the cytoskeleton. Alterations in human septin-9 (SEPT9) levels have been linked to multiple cancers, whereas mutations in SEPT9 cause the episodic neuropathy, hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA). Despite its important function in human health, the in vivo role of SEPT9 is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we utilize zebrafish to study the role of SEPT9 in early development. We show that zebrafish possess two genes, sept9a and sept9b that, like humans, express multiple transcripts. Knockdown or overexpression of sept9a transcripts results in specific developmental alterations including circulation defects and aberrant epidermal development. Conclusions/Significance Our work demonstrates that sept9 plays an important role in zebrafish development, and establishes zebrafish as a valuable model organism for the study of SEPT9."
https://openalex.org/W2042821032,"The model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa has been studied for over fifty years and many temperature-sensitive mutants have been generated. While most of these have been mapped genetically, many remain anonymous. The mutation in the N. crassa temperature-sensitive lethal mutant un-7 was identified by a complementation based approach as being in the open reading frame designated NCU00651 on linkage group I. Other mutations in this gene have been identified that lead to a temperature-sensitive morphological phenotype called png-1. The mutations underlying un-7 result in a serine to phenylalanine change at position 273 and an isoleucine to valine change at position 390, while the mutation in png-1 was found to result in a serine to leucine change at position 279 although there were other conservative changes in this allele. The overall morphology of the strain carrying the un-7 mutation is compared to strains carrying the png-1 mutation and these mutations are evaluated in the context of other temperature-sensitive mutants in Neurospora."
https://openalex.org/W2032333461,"We examined the presence of maximum information preservation, which may be a fundamental principle of information transmission in all sensory modalities, in the Drosophila antennal lobe using an experimentally grounded network model and physiological data. Recent studies have shown a nonlinear firing rate transformation between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and second-order projection neurons (PNs). As a result, PNs can use their dynamic range more uniformly than ORNs in response to a diverse set of odors. Although this firing rate transformation is thought to assist the decoder in discriminating between odors, there are no comprehensive, quantitatively supported studies examining this notion. Therefore, we quantitatively investigated the efficiency of this firing rate transformation from the viewpoint of information preservation by computing the mutual information between odor stimuli and PN responses in our network model. In the Drosophila olfactory system, all ORNs and PNs are divided into unique functional processing units called glomeruli. The nonlinear transformation between ORNs and PNs is formed by intraglomerular transformation and interglomerular interaction through local neurons (LNs). By exploring possible nonlinear transformations produced by these two factors in our network model, we found that mutual information is maximized when a weak ORN input is preferentially amplified within a glomerulus and the net LN input to each glomerulus is inhibitory. It is noteworthy that this is the very combination observed experimentally. Furthermore, the shape of the resultant nonlinear transformation is similar to that observed experimentally. These results imply that information related to odor stimuli is almost maximally preserved in the Drosophila olfactory circuit. We also discuss how intraglomerular transformation and interglomerular inhibition combine to maximize mutual information."
https://openalex.org/W1975448573,"Background Allelic gene structure variations and alternative splicing are responsible for transcript structure variations. More than 75% of human genes have structural isoforms of transcripts, but to date few studies have been conducted to verify the alternative splicing systematically. Methodology/Principal Findings The present study used expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and EST tagged SNP patterns to examine the transcript structure variations resulting from allelic gene structure variations in the major human malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. About 80% of 236,004 available A. gambiae ESTs were successfully aligned to A. gambiae reference genomes. More than 2,340 transcript structure variation events were detected. Because the current A. gambiae annotation is incomplete, we re-annotated the A. gambiae genome with an A. gambiae-specific gene model so that the effect of variations on gene coding could be better evaluated. A total of 15,962 genes were predicted. Among them, 3,873 were novel genes and 12,089 were previously identified genes. The gene completion rate improved from 60% to 84%. Based on EST support, 82.5% of gene structures were predicted correctly. In light of the new annotation, we found that ∼78% of transcript structure variations were located within the coding sequence (CDS) regions, and >65% of variations in the CDS regions have the same open-reading-frame. The association between transcript structure isoforms and SNPs indicated that more than 28% of transcript structure variation events were contributed by different gene alleles in A. gambiae. Conclusions/Significance We successfully expanded the A. gambiae genome annotation. We predicted and analyzed transcript structure variations in A. gambiae and found that allelic gene structure variation plays a major role in transcript diversity in this important human malaria vector."

https://openalex.org/W2023028854,"Anthelmintic resistance is a major threat to current measures for helminth control in humans and animals. The introduction of anthelmintic vaccines, as a complement to or replacement for drug treatments, has been advocated as a preventive measure. Here, a computer-based simulation, tracking the dynamics of hosts, parasites and parasite-genes, shows that, depending on the degree of host-population mixing, the frequency of totally recessive autosomes associated with anthelmintic resistance can follow either a fast dynamical regime with a low equilibrium point or a slow dynamical regime with a high equilibrium point. For fully dominant autosomes, only one regime is predicted. The effectiveness of anthelminthic vaccines against resistance is shown to be strongly influenced by the underlying dynamics of resistant autosomes. Vaccines targeting adult parasites, by decreasing helminth fecundity or lifespan, are predicted to be more effective than vaccines targeting parasite larvae, by decreasing host susceptibility to infection, in reducing the spread of resistance. These results may inform new strategies to prevent, monitor and control the spread of anthelmintic resistance, including the development of viable anthelmintic vaccines."
