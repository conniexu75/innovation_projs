https://openalex.org/W4226216100,"The COVID-19 epidemic has a catastrophic impact on global well-being and public health. More than 27 million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide until now. Due to the growing number of confirmed cases, and challenges to the variations of the COVID-19, timely and accurate classification of healthy and infected patients is essential to control and treat COVID-19. We aim to develop a deep learning-based system for the persuasive classification and reliable detection of COVID-19 using chest radiography. Firstly, we evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) proposed over recent years for medical image classification. Secondly, we develop and train CNN from scratch. In both cases, we use a public X-Ray dataset for training and validation purposes. For transfer learning, we obtain 100% accuracy for binary classification (i.e., Normal/COVID-19) and 87.50% accuracy for tertiary classification (Normal/COVID-19/Pneumonia). With the CNN trained from scratch, we achieve 93.75% accuracy for tertiary classification. In the case of transfer learning, the classification accuracy drops with the increased number of classes. The results are demonstrated by comprehensive receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and confusion metric analysis with 10-fold cross-validation."
https://openalex.org/W4205410768,"Men's mental health promotion presents unique challenges including gender-related barriers and stigmas, which demand novel approaches to prevention, treatment, and management. The aim of this study was to explore men's perceptions of mental health and preferences for mental health promotion. Seven focus groups (N = 59) were conducted in Sydney, Australia, including 5 groups of men (M = 50.65, SD = 13.75 years) and 2 groups of stakeholders who had frontline experience working with men (e.g., men's groups, health clubs, mental health advocates). Data were analysed using thematic analysis and interpreted using a gender relations approach to explore connections between gender roles, relations and identities, and men's mental health. Three overarching themes were identified; (1) Roles, identities, and the conceptualisation and concealment of mental health challenges, revealing challenges to mental health promotion related to perceptions of men's restrictive emotionality and emotional awareness as well as difficulties with conceptualising the internalised experiences of mental health, (2) Constraining social contexts of stigma and gender relations, identifying how social context and the policing of gender roles often obscured opportunities for discussing mental health and help-seeking behaviour, (3) Anchoring mental health promotion to acceptable lifestyle practices, highlighting potential remedies included leveraging men's social practices related to reciprocity, normalising mental health promotion relative to other behaviours, and embedding mental health promotion within acceptable masculine practices. Discussed are directions for men's community-based mental health promotion and opportunities for how masculinities may be negotiated and expanded to embody mental health promoting values."

A total of 86 interviews (TH: n = 28; MY: n = 18; IT: n = 20; UK: n = 20) were conducted with members of the public, including healthcare workers (n = 13). Participants across countries held strong views on government imposed NPIs, with many feeling measures lacked clarity. Most participants reported primarily negative impacts of NPIs on their lives, including through separation, isolation and grief over missed milestones; work-related challenges and income loss; and poor mental health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, many also experienced inadvertent positive consequences, including more time at home to focus on what they most valued in life; a greater sense of connectedness; and benefits to working life. Commonly employed coping strategies focused on financial coping (e.g. reducing spending); psycho-emotional coping (e.g. engaging in spiritual practices); social coping and connectedness (e.g., maintaining relationships remotely); reducing and mitigating risks (e.g., changing food shopping routines); and limiting exposure to the news (e.g., checking news only occasionally). Importantly, the extent to which participants' lived experiences were positive or negative, and their ability to cope was underpinned by individual, social and economic factors, with the analysis indicating some salient differences across countries and participants. In order to mitigate negative and unequal impacts of NPIs, COVID-19 policies will benefit from paying closer attention to the social, cultural and psychological-not just biological-vulnerabilities to, and consequences of public health measures."
https://openalex.org/W4206743397,"Recent advancements in Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) offers the possibility of its use as a cost effective and portable alternative to traditional optoelectronic motion capture systems in analyzing biomechanical performance. One such commercially available IMU is the Perception Neuron motion capture system (PNS). The accuracy of the PNS had been tested and was reported to be a valid method for assessing the upper body range of motion to within 5° RMSE. However, testing of the PNS was limited to upper body motion involving functional movement within a single plane. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further validate the Perception Neuron system with reference to a conventional optoelectronic motion capture system (VICON) through the use of dynamic movements (e.g., walking, jogging and a multi-articular sports movement with object manipulation) and to determine its feasibility through full-body kinematic analysis. Validation was evaluated using Pearson's R correlation, RMSE and Bland-Altman estimates. Present findings suggest that the PNS performed well against the VICON motion analysis system with most joint angles reporting a RMSE of < 4° and strong average Pearson's R correlation of 0.85, with the exception of the shoulder abduction/adduction where RMSE was larger and Pearson's R correlation at a moderate level. Bland-Altman analysis revealed that most joint angles across the different movements had a mean bias of less than 10°, except for the shoulder abduction/adduction and elbow flexion/extension measurements. It was concluded that the PNS may not be the best substitute for traditional motion analysis technology if there is a need to replicate raw joint angles. However, there was adequate sensitivity to measure changes in joint angles and would be suitable when normalized joint angles are compared and the focus of analysis is to identify changes in movement patterns."
https://openalex.org/W4206980017,"This study aimed to assess the mediating roles of positive and negative emotions on the relationship between COVID-19-related risk perception and coping behaviours adopted by Chinese college students in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey from mid February-late October 2020, among 1038 college students, from six Chinese universities (females = 73.41%), ranging within 17-26 years. The survey questionnaire included three major components-the COVID-19-Related Risk Perception Scale (CRPS), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-Revision), and Coping Response of COVID-19 Scale (CRCS). Descriptive statistics and a mediated model were used to analyse the collected data. A partial mediation relationship was found between COVID-19-related risk perception and 1) active-response behaviour (β = 0.05, 95% Confidence Interval [CI: 0.03, 0.08]), 2) self-protection behaviour through positive emotions (β = 0.03, CI [0.01, 0.04]), and 3) risk-taking behaviour through negative emotions (β = -0.04, CI [-0.07, -0.02]). This study's double-mediation model has been shown to detect the effect coping mechanisms to COVID-19. Furthermore, it implies that public health managers should consider the differences in coping mechanisms and the diverse mediating roles of positive and negative emotions for coping with public health emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4207003452,"Early detection of malignant thyroid nodules leading to patient-specific treatments can reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Currently, thyroid specialists use medical images to diagnose then follow the treatment protocols, which have limitations due to unreliable human false-positive diagnostic rates. With the emergence of deep learning, advances in computer-aided diagnosis techniques have yielded promising earlier detection and prediction accuracy; however, clinicians’ adoption is far lacking. The present study adopts Xception neural network as the base structure and designs a practical framework, which comprises three adaptable multi-channel architectures that were positively evaluated using real-world data sets. The proposed architectures outperform existing statistical and machine learning techniques and reached a diagnostic accuracy rate of 0.989 with ultrasound images and 0.975 with computed tomography scans through the single input dual-channel architecture. Moreover, the patient-specific design was implemented for thyroid cancer detection and has obtained an accuracy of 0.95 for double inputs dual-channel architecture and 0.94 for four-channel architecture. Our evaluation suggests that ultrasound images and computed tomography (CT) scans yield comparable diagnostic results through computer-aided diagnosis applications. With ultrasound images obtained slightly higher results, CT, on the other hand, can achieve the patient-specific diagnostic design. Besides, with the proposed framework, clinicians can select the best fitting architecture when making decisions regarding a thyroid cancer diagnosis. The proposed framework also incorporates interpretable results as evidence, which potentially improves clinicians’ trust and hence their adoption of the computer-aided diagnosis techniques proposed with increased efficiency and accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4205922428,"The incidence of breast cancer is increasing in Pakistan as well as globally. Awareness of women about breast cancer plays a cornerstone role in its early detection, better management, and prevention. Keeping this in mind, a cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the awareness of female university students about breast cancer’s risk factors, signs and symptoms, and breast cancer examination. The data was collected from female university students studying in Pakistan. A total of 774 participants completed the survey and recorded their responses on an online pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. Only 29.8% of the participants have identified breast cancer history in their first-degree relatives as a risk factor. Moreover, 14.1% of the participant considered that the use of oral contraceptives for more than 5 years can increase the risk of developing breast cancer. In addition, inward pulled nipple, wounds around the nipple, and abrupt changes in the breast size were considered as the sign and symptoms of breast cancer by 25.2%, 25.7%, and 31.7% of the participants, respectively. Moreover, only 20.9% of the participants identified the correct year for starting breast cancer examination and 44.4% of the respondents marked that mammography should be initiated after 40 years. Overall, the university female students of Pakistan were poorly aware of breast cancer’s risk factors, signs and symptoms, and breast examination. This study has highlighted the need for initiation of aggressive strategies regarding breast cancer awareness in both the literate and illiterate female population of Pakistan."

Logistic regression was used to relate CAT-SS scores (baseline) to C-SSRS assessed outcomes (active ideation with plan and intent; attempt; interrupted, aborted or self-interrupted attempt, or preparatory acts or behaviors; all outcomes combined). A mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between the lagged CAT-SS scores and outcomes (6- and 12-months). The baseline CAT-SS demonstrated predictive accuracy for all outcomes at 6-months, and similar results were found for baseline and all outcomes at and through 12-months. Longitudinal analysis revealed for every 10-point change in the CAT-SS there was a 50-77% increase in the likelihood of suicide-related outcomes. The CAT-SS demonstrated added value when compared to current suicide risk prediction practices."
https://openalex.org/W4206804271,"School anxiety and psychopathological symptoms tend to co-occur across development and persist in adulthood. The present study aimed to determine school anxiety profiles based on Lang's model of the triple response system (cognitive anxiety, psychophysiological anxiety, and behavioral anxiety) and to identify possible differences between these profiles in psychopathological symptoms (depression, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, somatization, anxiety, psychoticism, obsessive-compulsive, phobic anxiety, and paranoid ideation). The School Anxiety Inventory (SAI) and the Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire (SA-45) were administered to 1525 Spanish students (49% girls) between 15 and 18 years old (M = 16.36, SD = 1.04). Latent Profile Analysis identified four school anxiety profiles: Low School Anxiety, Average School Anxiety, High School Anxiety, and Excessive School Anxiety. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed statistically significant differences among the school anxiety profiles in all the psychopathological symptoms examined. Specifically, adolescents with Excessive School Anxiety showed significantly higher levels of the nine psychopathological symptoms than their peers with Average School Anxiety and Low School Anxiety. In addition, the Excessive School Anxiety profile scored significantly higher in phobic anxiety than the High School Anxiety group. These findings allow to conclude that it is necessary enhance well-being and reduce psychopathology of those adolescents who manifest high and very high reactivity in cognitive, psychophysiological, and behavioral anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W4207058602,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 2.1 billion people lack access to safely managed water. Cloth filtration is often employed in rural and developing communities of South Asia for point-of-use water treatment, but bacteria and viruses are too small for efficient removal by this filtration method. Chitosan is a biodegradable, cationic, organic polymer derived from the chemical treatment of chitin that acts as a coagulant and flocculant of contaminant of microbes and other particles in water, thereby facilitating filtration of microbes. This research 1) evaluated the use of chitosan acetate as a pre-treatment coagulation-flocculation process followed by cloth filtration for microbial reductions and 2) assessed floc particle size under three stirring conditions. E. coli KO11 bacteria and MS2 coliphage virus removals were quantified using culture-based methods. Chitosan acetate coagulation-flocculation pre-treatment of water, followed by cloth filtration, met or exceeded the protective (2-star) WHO performance levels for bacteria (2 log10 reduction) and viruses (3 log10 reduction), and filtrate turbidity was consistently reduced to < 1 NTU, meeting United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and WHO targets."
https://openalex.org/W4225575052,"Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, commentators warned that some COVID trials were inadequately conceived, designed and reported. Here, we retrospectively assess the prevalence of informative COVID trials launched in the first 6 months of the pandemic.Based on prespecified eligibility criteria, we created a cohort of Phase 1/2, Phase 2, Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 SARS-CoV-2 treatment and prevention efficacy trials that were initiated from 2020-01-01 to 2020-06-30 using ClinicalTrials.gov registration records. We excluded trials evaluating behavioural interventions and natural products, which are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We evaluated trials on 3 criteria of informativeness: potential redundancy (comparing trial phase, type, patient-participant characteristics, treatment regimen, comparator arms and primary outcome), trials design (according to the recommendations set-out in the May 2020 FDA guidance document on SARS-CoV-2 treatment and prevention trials) and feasibility of patient-participant recruitment (based on timeliness and success of recruitment).We included all 500 eligible trials in our cohort, 58% of which were Phase 2 and 84.8% were directed towards the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Close to one third of trials met all three criteria and were deemed informative (29.9% (95% Confidence Interval 23.7-36.9)). The proportion of potentially redundant trials in our cohort was 4.1%. Over half of the trials in our cohort (56.2%) did not meet our criteria for high quality trial design. The proportion of trials with infeasible patient-participant recruitment was 22.6%.Less than one third of COVID-19 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov during the first six months met all three criteria for informativeness. Shortcomings in trial design, recruitment feasibility and redundancy reflect longstanding weaknesses in the clinical research enterprise that were likely amplified by the exceptional circumstances of a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4205618168,"A comprehensive, comparable assessment of the economic disease burden and the value of relevant care forms a major challenge in the case of mental diseases. This study aimed to inform the development of a resource use measurement (RUM) instrument and harmonized reference unit costs valid for multi-sectoral and multi-national cost assessments for mental health diseases as part of the European PECUNIA project.An iterative, multi-methods approach was applied. Systematic literature reviews appended with national grey literature searches in six European countries were conducted to generate preliminary, literature-based, international, mental health-related service and resource use lists for all investigated sectors in 2018. As part of a multi-national expert survey, these lists were reviewed by 18 Austrian sector-specific experts regarding the clarity, relevance, comprehensiveness and availability in the Austrian context.Out of 295 items included in the preliminary, international, sector-specific lists (health and social care-201 items, criminal justice-35 items, education-39 items; patient, family and informal care-20 items), a total of 261 items and descriptions (88%) were considered clear by all experts. 42 items (14%) were considered not existing in Austria, and 111 items (38%) were prioritized regarding their relevance in the national context. Thirteen additional items (4%) were suggested to be added to accommodate for Austria-specific features of the individual sectors. Major typological difficulties based on item names were observed.The identified country-specific variations and general typological bias and their potential contributions to service and resource use cost variations across countries and sectors call for further systematic investigation. Next, PECUNIA will develop internationally harmonized and comparable definitions of the listed items and their units of analysis based on a new conceptual multi-sectoral costing framework. The developed lists will require consolidation and further prioritization for the development of a patient-reported RUM instrument and consequent reference unit cost valuation."
https://openalex.org/W4205831188,"Introduction Previous studies have demonstrated that cytokines, transforming growth factor (TGF-β1), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can impact the intensity of pain in rodents. However, the roles of cytokines, TGF-β1 and BDNF in humans with chronic pain in osteoarthritis remains unclear, and no comparison between plasma and central cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) has been conducted. Methods Patients with osteoarthritis who were scheduled to receive spinal anesthesia were enrolled. The intensity of pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS). In addition, patients with genitourinary system (GU) diseases and without obvious pain (VAS 0–1) were included as a comparison (control) group. The levels of TGF-β1, BDNF, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin (IL)-8 within the CSF and plasma were collected and evaluated before surgery. Results The plasma and CSF TGF-β1 levels were significantly lower in the osteoarthritis patients with pain (VAS ≥ 3) than in the GU control patients. Downregulation of plasma BDNF was also found in osteoarthritis patients with pain. The Spearman correlation analysis showed that the VAS pain scores were significantly negatively correlated with the levels of TGF-β1 in the CSF of patients with osteoarthritis. However, there was no significant correlations between the pain scores and the levels of BDNF, TNF-α, and IL-8 in either the CSF or plasma. Conclusions TGF-β1 but not BDNF, TNF-α, or IL-8 may be an important biological indicator in the CSF of osteoarthritis patients with chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W4206191407,"Hepatitis B vaccine has contributed to the reduction in hepatitis B virus infections and chronic disease globally. Screening to establish extent of vaccine induced immune response and provision of booster dose are limited in most low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). Our study investigated the extent of protective immune response and breakthrough hepatitis B virus infections among adult vaccinated healthcare workers in selected health facilities in northern Uganda. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 randomly selected adult hepatitis B vaccinated healthcare workers in Lira and Gulu regional referral hospitals in northern Uganda. Blood samples were collected and qualitative analysis of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B surface antigen antibody (HBsAb), Hepatitis B envelop antigen (HBeAg), Hepatitis B envelop antibody (HBeAb) and Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) conducted using ELISA method. Quantitative assessment of anti-hepatitis B antibody (anti-HBs) levels was done using COBAS immunoassay analyzer. Multiple logistic regression was done to establish factors associated with protective anti-HBs levels (≥ 10mIU/mL) among adult vaccinate healthcare workers at 95% level of significance. A high proportion, 81.3% (244/300) of the study participants completed all three hepatitis B vaccine dose schedules. Two (0.7%, 2/300) of the study participants had active hepatitis B virus infection. Of the 300 study participants, 2.3% (7/300) had positive HBsAg; 88.7% (266/300) had detectable HBsAb; 2.3% (7/300) had positive HBeAg; 4% (12/300) had positive HBeAb and 17.7% (53/300) had positive HBcAb. Majority, 83% (249/300) had a protective hepatitis B antibody levels (≥10mIU/mL). Hepatitis B vaccine provides protective immunity against hepatitis B virus infection regardless of whether one gets a booster dose or not. Protective immune response persisted for over ten years following hepatitis B vaccination among the healthcare workers."
https://openalex.org/W4206674414,"Background Knowledge of factors that influence the outcome of infection are crucial for determining the risk of severe disease and requires the characterisation of pathogen-host interactions that have evolved to confer variable susceptibility to infection. Cattle infected by Theileria annulata show a wide range in disease severity. Native ( Bos indicus ) Sahiwal cattle are tolerant to infection, whereas exotic ( Bos taurus ) Holstein cattle are susceptible to acute disease. Methodology/Principal findings We used RNA-seq to assess whether Theileria infected cell lines from Sahiwal cattle display a different transcriptome profile compared to Holstein and screened for altered expression of parasite factors that could generate differences in host cell gene expression. Significant differences (&lt;0.1 FDR) in the expression level of a large number (2211) of bovine genes were identified, with enrichment of genes associated with Type I IFN, cholesterol biosynthesis, oncogenesis and parasite infection. A screen for parasite factors found limited evidence for differential expression. However, the number and location of DNA motifs bound by the TashAT2 factor (TA20095) were found to differ between the genomes of B . indicus vs . B . taurus , and divergent motif patterns were identified in infection-associated genes differentially expressed between Sahiwal and Holstein infected cells. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that divergent pathogen-host molecular interactions that influence chromatin architecture of the infected cell are a major determinant in the generation of gene expression differences linked to disease susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W4206823933,"Introduction The purpose of this study was to longitudinally examine the change in understanding of the self-reflection method, reflective thinking, and writing attitude and perception. Moreover, we investigated students’ educational needs and methods regarding self-reflection. Methods The subjects were 117, who were in the pre-medical course in 2017 and were promoted to the medical course in 2019. Questions concerning students’ understanding of self-reflection methods, their attitude and perception of reflective writing, and educational needs and methods regarding self-reflection were self-developed. For students’ reflective thinking level in writing, we used the approach developed by Galvez-Martin, Bowman, and Morrison and adapted by Kwon. For dada analysis, χ 2 test, t-test, frequency analysis was used. Results We found that students’ level of understanding regarding self-reflection methods increases slightly, but not significant (χ 2 = 2.238, p&gt;0.05). There was no significant change in the level of reflective thinking in writing (χ 2 = 8.003, p&gt;0.05). The students’ attitude toward reflective writing decreased in the medical course than in the pre-medical course (t = 3.475, p&lt;0.001). The perception that reflective writing was helpful for individual improvement decreased during the medical course (t = 4.931, p&lt;0.001). The need for self-reflection education increased in the medical course (t = -2.659, p&lt;0.001). They preferred implementation in the first year of the medical course as an instructor-led special lecture. Conclusion Self-reflective ability is not naturally developed as students’ progress through grade levels. Educational intervention is needed to help students understand approaches to self-reflection and its importance in enabling them to develop their abilities as well as to participate actively in reflective writing."

However, little data are available concerning uterine prolapse in Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with uterine prolapse in women of reproductive age in Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Loma Woreda, Dawro, south-west Ethiopia, in November and December 2019. Four hundred and twenty-two randomly selected women of reproductive age participated in the study. Face-to-face interviews with a pre-structured questionnaire collected data, and diagnoses were made clinically. Epi Data v3.2.1 and SPSS v24 were used for data entry, processing, and analysis. Binary logistic regression was used to determine associations between dependent and independent variables. Variables with P-values less than 0.25 in bivariate logistic regression were further examined using multivariate logistic regression to investigate associations between the dependent variable and independent variables.The mean age of respondents was 35.4 ±7.994 years. The prevalence of symptomatic and anatomical uterine prolapse was 6.6% (28) and 5.9% (25), respectively. The prevalence of anatomical prolapse was used as a reference when determining associated factors. Age at first marriage (Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR): 0.25, 95%CI 0.07, 0.89), place of delivery (AOR: 3.33, 95%CI 1.21, 9.13), birth attendant-assisted delivery (AOR 0.21; 95%CI 0.06, 0.71), and history of abortion (AOR: 2.94, 95%CI 1.08, 7.97) were found significantly and independently associated with the prevalence of uterine prolapse.Uterine prolapse is common in women of reproductive age. Age at first marriage, place of delivery, birth attendant-assisted delivery, and history of abortion were independent predictors of the prevalence of uterine prolapse. We recommend that the health system link primary health care to hospital-set for uterine prolapse treatment programs. Health institution delivery should be encouraged by the local government. Early marriage and unwanted pregnancy need to be prevented through appropriate strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4207055825,"In the aftermath of shock events, policy responses tend to be crafted under significant time constraints and high levels of uncertainty. The extent to which individuals comply with different policy designs can further influence how effective the policy responses are and how equitably their impacts are distributed in the population. Tools which allow policymakers to model different crisis trajectories, policy responses, and behavioral scenarios ex ante can provide crucial timely support in the decision-making process. Set in the context of COVID-19 shelter in place policies, in this paper we present the COVID-19 Policy Evaluation (CoPE) tool, which is an agent-based modeling framework that enables researchers and policymakers to anticipate the relative impacts of policy decisions. Specifically, this framework illuminates the extent to which policy design features and behavioral responsiveness influence the efficacy and equity of policy responses to shock events. We show that while an early policy response can be highly effective, the impact of the timing is moderated by other aspects of policy design such as duration and targeting of the policy, as well as societal aspects such as trust and compliance among the population. More importantly, we show that even policies that are more effective overall can have disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. By disaggregating the impact of different policy design elements on different population groups, we provide an additional tool for policymakers to use in the design of targeted strategies for disproportionately affected populations."

Single gene targeted nanopore sequencing generally yielded higher pathogen specific read counts in qPCR positive samples than qPCR negative controls. Of the 26 CT, NG or MG infections identified by qPCR, 25 were clearly distinguishable from qPCR negative controls by read count. Discrimination of TV qPCR positives from qPCR negative controls was poorer as many had low pathogen loads (qPCR cycle threshold >35) which produced few specific reads. Real-time AMR profiling revealed that 3/3 NG samples identified had gyrA mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance, 2/10 of TV had mutations related to metronidazole resistance, while none of the MG samples possessed 23S rRNA gene mutations contributing to macrolide resistance.Single gene targeted nanopore sequencing for diagnosing and simultaneously identifying key antimicrobial resistance markers for four common genital STIs shows promise. Further work to optimise accuracy, reduce costs and improve speed may allow sustainable approaches for managing STIs and emerging AMR in resource poor and laboratory limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W4205136920,"Background A brief gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) stimulation test which solely focused on LH 30-minute post-stimulation was considered to identify girls with central precocious puberty (CPP). However, it was tested using traditional statistical methods. With advanced computer science, we aimed to develop a machine learning-based diagnostic model that processed baseline CPP-related variables and a brief GnRHa stimulation test for CPP diagnosis. Methods We recruited girls suspected of precocious puberty and underwent a GnRHa stimulation test at Children Hospital 2, Vietnam, and Cathay General Hospital, Taiwan. Clinical data, bone age measurement, and 30-min post-stimulation blood test were used to build up the predictive model. The candidate model was developed by different machine learning algorithms that were mainly evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), and F1-score in internal and external validation data to classify girls as CPP and non-CPP at different time-points (0-min, 30-min, 60-min, and 120-min post-stimulation). Results Among the 614 girls diagnosed with PP, 524 (85.3%) had CPP. The random forest algorithm yielded the highest value of F1-score (0.976), specificity (0.893), positive predicted value (0.987), and relatively high value of AUC (0.972) that contributed to high probability to identify CPP. The performance metrics of the 30-min post-stimulation diagnostic model including sensitivity and specificity surpassed those of the 0-minute model (0-min) and were equivalent to those of the model obtained 60-min and 120-min post-stimulation. Hence, our machine learning-based model helps shorten the stimulation test to 30 minutes after GnRHa injection, in general, it requires 120 minutes for a completed GnRHa stimulation test. Conclusions We developed a diagnostic model based on clinical features and a single sample 30-minute post-stimulation to identify CPP in girls that can reduce distress for children caused by multiple blood samplings."

As an innovative business model connecting the real economy and the virtual economy, the Internet of Things (IoT) finance provides standardized technical support for the expansion of trade and finance. In financial data analysis, deep learning (DL) has become an important means to predict financial market movements, process text information and improve trading strategies. Analysis is conducted on the influence of trade and financial opening on the volatility of real exchange rate. Through the empirical test of panel data of 45 major countries in the world, the pooled ordinary least square (OLS) method and instrumental variable method are used to evaluate the influence of trade and financial opening of sample countries on the volatility of real exchange rate. The main conclusions are that trade openness is negatively correlated with the volatility of real exchange rate, and financial openness is positively correlated with the volatility of real exchange rate. A certain reference is provided for reducing the fluctuation of real exchange rate in the process of opening to the world."

The results were obtained by fluorescence analysis, infrared spectroscopy (total attenuated reflection-Fourier transform, ATR-FTIR) followed by multivariate analysis of principal components (PCA), protein profile, immunodetection, enzymatic activity and oxidative damage to proteins. Fluorescence increased in all glycated samples, except in saliva with fructose. The ATR-FTIR spectra and PCA analysis showed structural changes related to the vibrational mode of glycation of albumin, lysozyme, and salivary proteins. Glycation increased the relative molecular mass (Mr) in protein profile of albumin and lysozyme. Saliva showed a decrease in band intensity when glycated. The analysis of sAA immunoblotting indicated a relative reduction in intensity of its correspondent Mr after sAA glycation; and a decrease in its enzymatic activity was observed. Carbonylation levels increased in all glycated samples, except for saliva with fructose. Thiol content decreased only for glycated lysozyme and saliva with MGO. Therefore, glycation of salivary fluid and sAA may have the potential to identify products derived by glycation process. This opens perspectives for further studies on the use of saliva, an easy and non-invasive collection fluid, to monitor glycated proteins in the aging process and evolution of diseases."

In Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-infected patients report being less active compared to HIV-uninfected individuals. We assessed the levels and correlates of objectively measured physical activity and capacity among HIV-infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals compared to HIV-uninfected individuals in Mwanza, Tanzania.We conducted a cross-sectional study among newly diagnosed HIV-infected ART-naive individuals and HIV-uninfected individuals frequency-matched for age and sex. Socio-demographic data, anthropometrics, CD4 counts, haemoglobin level, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were collected. Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) was assessed as measure of physical activity whereas sleeping heart rate (SHR) and grip strength were assessed as measures of physical capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the correlates associated with physical activity and capacity.A total of 272 HIV-infected and 119 HIV-uninfected individuals, mean age 39 years and 60% women participated in the study. Compared to HIV-uninfected individuals, HIV-infected had poorer physical activity and capacity: lower PAEE (-7.3 kj/kg/day, 95% CI: -11.2, -3.3), elevated SHR (7.7 beats/min, 95%CI: 10.1, 5.3) and reduced grip strength (-4.7 kg, 95%CI: -6.8, -2.8). In HIV-infected individuals, low body mass index, moderate-severe anaemia, low CD4 counts and high CRP were associated with lower physical activity and capacity. In HIV-uninfected individuals, abdominal obesity and moderate anaemia were associated with lower physical activity and capacity.HIV-infected participants had lower levels of physical activity and capacity than HIV-uninfected participants. Correlates of physical activity and capacity differed by HIV status. Management of HIV and related conditions needs to be provided effectively in health care facilities. Interventions promoting physical activity in these populations will be of importance to improve their health and reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases."

There is no large-scale, public health surveillance system aimed at understanding the health and behaviors of men transitioning into fatherhood. The purpose of this study was to describe piloted randomized approaches of a state-based surveillance system examining paternal behaviors before and after their infant's birth to better understand the health needs of men and their families during the transition to parenthood.During October 2018-July 2019, 857 fathers in Georgia were sampled 2-6 months after their infant's birth from birth certificates files and surveyed via mail, online or telephone, in English or Spanish, using two randomized approaches: Indirect-to-Dads and Direct-to-Dads. Survey topics included mental and physical health, healthcare, substance use, and contraceptive use.Weighted response rates (Indirect-to-Dads, 33%; Direct-to-Dads, 31%) and population demographics did not differ by approach. Respondents completed the survey by mail (58%), online (28%) or telephone (14%). Among 266 fathers completing the survey, 55% had a primary care physician, and 49% attended a healthcare visit for themselves during their infant's mother's pregnancy or since their infant's birth. Most fathers were overweight or had obesity (70%) while fewer reported smoking cigarettes (19%), binge drinking (13%) or depressive symptoms (10%) since their infant's birth.This study tests a novel approach for obtaining population-based estimates of fathers' perinatal health behaviors, with comparable response rates from two pragmatic approaches. The pilot study results quantify a number of public health needs related to fathers' health and healthcare access."

The samples were cultured, and pneumococcus was further serotyped through multiplex PCR at the Aga Khan University Hospital as per the method described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA.Pneumococcus was detected in 2370/3140 (75%) children. Vaccine type (VT) and non-vaccine type (NVT) serotypes were carried by 379 and 1990 children. There was a significant decline in VT carriage (by 40.3%, p-value <0.001), whereas overall NVT carriage remained the same. The prevalence of VT serotypes 6B, 9V/9A, and 19F showed a significant decline by 58.8%, 79.3%, and 56%, respectively. The prevalence of NVT serotypes 19A, 21, and 10A increased by 70%, 33.3%, and 65.6%, respectively, whereas serotypes 13 and 9N/9L decreased by 53.4% and 51.8%, respectively. Serotype-specific vaccine effectiveness estimates that reached statistical significance were for 9V/9A (VE = 65.0, 95% CI 26.0-83.5%), 19F (VE = 55.3, 95% CI 15.5-76.4%) and for the vaccine related serotype 6A (VE = 28.4, 95% CI 0.9-48.2%).The emergence of NVT serotypes, primarily 19A replacing VT serotypes in this rural community, necessitates continuous monitoring of serotypes in the carriage and invasive disease to evaluate the utility of existing vaccine formulations."
https://openalex.org/W4206740337,"Taiwan is among the countries with the highest global prevalence of chronic renal disease. However, when advised to undergo dialysis therapy, patients with end-stage renal disease often hesitate. Attitudes toward medication and Taiwanese cultures are the main reasons for this delay, and delay conditioning requires urgent dialysis. This study aimed to explore the experience of urgent dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease.This study used a purposive sampling strategy with semi-structured interviews leading to in-depth interviews. Patients were recruited from the nephrology ward and hemodialysis center of a northern Taiwanese hospital. All participants were aged over 20 years with end-stage renal disease. Although advised by doctors to undergo dialysis, these patients delayed their treatment and later suffered severe complications. After emergency hospitalization, the patients' condition improved. Data were analyzed by content analysis.Interviews with five participants suffering from end-stage renal disease identified six themes: ""experiencing a sudden jolt,"" ""silent organ brings the most pain,"" ""feeling angry: why me?,"" ""facing a dilemma,"" ""taking risks,"" and ""facing consequences.""These patients delayed their treatment and later suffered severe complications, even though doctors advised them to undergo dialysis. Health professionals play an important role in communication and coordination, assisting patients in coping with their situation. The analysis of the reasons for the delay in undergoing dialysis, therefore, should help health professionals provide proper guidance and care to patients who are faced with the decision to accept dialysis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4206935616,"Background The burden of non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in the society is high, and there is currently limited evidence-based recommendation for risk stratification and treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated an association between increasing extent of non-obstructive CAD and cardiovascular events. Whether hypertension, a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, is associated with extensive non-obstructive CAD in patients with symptomatic chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) remains unclear. Methods We included 1138 patients (mean age 62±11 years, 48% women) with symptomatic CCS and non-obstructive CAD (1–49% lumen diameter reduction) by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) from the Norwegian Registry for Invasive Cardiology (NORIC). The extent of non-obstructive CAD was assessed as coronary artery segment involvement score (SIS), and extensive non-obstructive CAD was adjudicated when SIS &gt;4. Hypertension was defined as known hypertension or use of antihypertensive medication. Results Hypertension was found in 45% of patients. Hypertensive patients were older, with a higher SIS, calcium score, and prevalence of comorbidities and statin therapy compared to the normotensive (all p&lt;0.05). There was no difference in the prevalence of hypertension between sexes. Univariable analysis revealed a significant association between hypertension and non-obstructive CAD. In multivariable analysis, hypertension remained associated with extensive non-obstructive CAD, independent of sex, age, smoking, diabetes, statin treatment, obesity and calcium score (OR 1.85, 95% CI [1.22–2.80], p = 0.004). Conclusion In symptomatic CCS, hypertension was associated with extensive non-obstructive CAD by CCTA. Whether hypertension may be a new treatment target in symptomatic non-obstructive CAD needs to be explored in future studies.

https://openalex.org/W4207021394,"National parks often serve as a cornerstone for a country's species and ecosystem conservation efforts. However, despite the protection these sites afford, climate change is expected to drive a substantial change in their bird assemblages. We used species distribution models to predict the change in environmental suitability (i.e., how well environmental conditions explain the presence of a species) of 49 Canadian national parks during summer and winter for 434 bird species under a 2°C warming scenario, anticipated to occur in Canada around the mid-21st century. We compared these to existing species distributions in the 2010s, and classified suitability projections for each species at each park as potential extirpation, worsening, stable, improving, or potential colonisation. Across all parks, and both seasons, 70% of the projections indicate change, including a 25% turnover in summer assemblages and 30% turnover in winter assemblages. The majority of parks are projected to have increases in species richness and functional traits in winter, compared to a mix of increases and decreases in both in summer. However, some changes are expected to vary by region, such as Arctic region parks being likely to experience the most potential colonisation, while some of the Mixedwood Plains and Atlantic Maritime region parks may experience the greatest turnover and potential extirpation in summer if management actions are not taken to mitigate some of these losses. Although uncertainty exists around the precise rate and impacts of climate change, our results indicate that conservation practices that assume stationarity of environmental conditions will become untenable. We propose general guidance to help managers adapt their conservation actions to consider the potentially substantive changes in bird assemblages that are projected, including managing for persistence and change."
https://openalex.org/W4225818272,"The threat to public health posed by drug-resistant bacteria is rapidly increasing, as some of healthcare's most potent antibiotics are becoming obsolete. Approximately two-thirds of the world's antibiotics are derived from natural products produced by Streptomyces encoded biosynthetic gene clusters. Thus, to identify novel gene clusters, we sequenced the genomes of four bioactive Streptomyces strains isolated from the soil in San Diego County and used Bacterial Cytological Profiling adapted for agar plate culturing in order to examine the mechanisms of bacterial inhibition exhibited by these strains. In the four strains, we identified 104 biosynthetic gene clusters. Some of these clusters were predicted to produce previously studied antibiotics; however, the known mechanisms of these molecules could not fully account for the antibacterial activity exhibited by the strains, suggesting that novel clusters might encode antibiotics. When assessed for their ability to inhibit the growth of clinically isolated pathogens, three Streptomyces strains demonstrated activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, due to the utility of bacteriophages for genetically manipulating bacterial strains via transduction, we also isolated four new phages (BartholomewSD, IceWarrior, Shawty, and TrvxScott) against S. platensis. A genomic analysis of our phages revealed nearly 200 uncharacterized proteins, including a new site-specific serine integrase that could prove to be a useful genetic tool. Sequence analysis of the Streptomyces strains identified CRISPR-Cas systems and specific spacer sequences that allowed us to predict phage host ranges. Ultimately, this study identified Streptomyces strains with the potential to produce novel chemical matter as well as integrase-encoding phages that could potentially be used to manipulate these strains."
https://openalex.org/W4205332397,"Shear stress is extremely important for endothelial cell (EC) function. The popularity of 6-well plates on orbital shakers to impose shear stress on ECs has increased among biologists due to their low cost and simplicity. One characteristic of such a platform is the heterogeneous flow profile within a well. While cells in the periphery are exposed to a laminar and high-velocity pulsatile flow that mimics physiological conditions, the flow in the center is disturbed and imposes low shear stress on the cells, which is characteristic of atheroprone regions. For studies where such heterogeneity is not desired, we present a simple cell-patterning technique to selectively prevent cell growth in the center of the well and facilitate the exclusive collection and analysis of cells in the periphery. This guarantees that cell phenotypes will not be influenced by secreted factors from cells exposed to other shear profiles nor that interesting results are obscured by mixing cells from different regions. We also present a multi-staining platform that compartmentalizes each well into 5 smaller independent regions: four at the periphery and one in the center. This is ideal for studies that aim to grow cells on the whole well surface, for comparison with previous work and minimal interference in the cell culture, but require screening of markers by immunostaining afterwards. It allows to compare different regions of the well, reduces antibody-related costs, and allows the exploration of multiple markers essential for high-content screening of cell response. By increasing the versatility of the 6-well plate on an orbital shaker system, we hope that these two solutions motivate biologists to pursue studies on EC mechanobiology and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4206433357,"The ability to accurately complete goal-directed actions, such as reaching for a glass of water, requires coordination between sensory, cognitive and motor systems. When these systems are impaired, like in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), deficits in movement arise. To date, the characterization of upper limb performance in PwMS has typically been limited to results attained from self-reported questionnaires or clinical tools. Our aim was to characterize visually guided reaching performance in PwMS. Thirty-six participants (12 PwMS who reported upper limb impairment (MS-R), 12 PwMS who reported not experiencing upper limb impairment (MS-NR), and 12 age- and sex-matched control participants without MS (CTL)) reached to 8 targets in a virtual environment while seeing a visual representation of their hand in the form of a cursor on the screen. Reaches were completed with both the dominant and non-dominant hands. All participants were able to complete the visually guided reaching task, such that their hand landed on the target. However, PwMS showed noticeably more atypical reaching profiles when compared to control participants. In accordance with these observations, analyses of reaching performance revealed that the MS-R group was more variable with respect to the time it took to initiate and complete their movements compared to the CTL group. While performance of the MS-NR group did not differ significantly from either the CTL or MS-R groups, individuals in the MS-NR group were less consistent in their performance compared to the CTL group. Together these findings suggest that PwMS with and without self-reported upper limb impairment have deficits in the planning and/or control of their movements. We further argue that deficits observed during movement in PwMS who report upper limb impairment may arise due to participants compensating for impaired movement planning processes."
https://openalex.org/W4206928148,"Introduction Disseminated intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is a thrombotic microangiopathy which may complicate a number of severe disease processes including sepsis. Development of microvascular thromboses results in consumption of coagulation factors and platelets and ultimate bleeding. Patients with HIV infection (PWH) often present with baseline dysregulation of the coagulation system which may increase severity and derangement of DIC presentation. Previously, we have shown that HIV is a significant risk factor for development of DIC. Methodology We conducted a retrospective record review of all DIC screens submitted to our tertiary coagulation laboratory in Johannesburg, South Africa, over a one year period and compared the laboratory presentation of DIC in PWH with presentation of DIC in patients without HIV infection. Results Over the year, 246 patients fulfilled the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) diagnostic criteria for DIC– 108 were confirmed HIV-infected and 77 were confirmed uninfected. PWH and DIC presented at a significantly earlier age (41 vs 46 years respectively, p&lt;0.02). The prothrombin time was significantly more prolonged (30.1s vs 26.s), the d-dimer levels were substantially higher (5.89mg/L vs 4.52mg/L) and the fibrinogen (3.92g/L vs 1.73g/L) and platelet levels (64.8 vs 114.8x10 9 /l) were significantly lower in PWH. PWH also showed significant synthetic liver dysfunction and higher background inflammation. Conclusion PWH who fulfil the diagnostic criteria for DIC show significantly more dysregulation of the haemostatic system. This may reflect baseline abnormalities including endothelial dysfunction in the context of inflammation and liver dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4205493549,"Evaluating the conservation of aquatic ecosystems, especially those which serve to supply, has been carried out using a variety of tools. However, the perception of water quality by the local community which lives in direct contact with water resources has not been considered with enough importance. This study analysed the relationship between the conservation status of reservoirs as perceived by the local community and their conservation status according to physical, chemical, and biological indicators. To do so, we calculated the Trophic State Index (TSI) of the reservoirs, the diversity and richness of benthic macroinvertebrate and we analysed the human influence in the riparian zone. Thus, we created the Community Conservation Perception Index (CCPI) to quantitatively associate the perception of the local community with environmental quality indicators (TSI, diversity, richness and anthropogenic influences in the riparian zone). We found that interviewee perception of reservoir conservation (using the CCPI) was related to trophic state, richness and diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate, and the presence of residences and agriculture in the riparian zone. It is necessary to consider the environmental perception of the local community as a relevant factor in management programmes and the conservation of ecosystems, even if artificial, as is the case with reservoirs. These communities can significantly contribute to maintaining the environmental quality through their performance in participatory management in projects such as: participating in the investigation of pollution in reservoirs, collecting parameters related to water quality, and community action in designing conservation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4205747592,"In contrast to the well characterized mitotic machinery in eukaryotes it seems as if there is no universal mechanism organizing chromosome segregation in all bacteria. Apparently, some bacteria even use combinations of different segregation mechanisms such as protein machines or rely on physical forces. The identification of the relevant mechanisms is a difficult task. Here, we introduce a new machine learning approach to this problem. It is based on the analysis of trajectories of individual loci in the course of chromosomal segregation obtained by fluorescence microscopy. While machine learning approaches have already been applied successfully to trajectory classification in other areas, so far it has not been possible to use them to discriminate segregation mechanisms in bacteria. A main obstacle for this is the large number of trajectories required to train machine learning algorithms that we overcome here by using trajectories obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. We used these trajectories to train four different machine learning algorithms, two linear models and two tree-based classifiers, to discriminate segregation mechanisms and possible combinations of them. The classification was performed once using the complete trajectories as high-dimensional input vectors as well as on a set of features which were used to transform the trajectories into low-dimensional input vectors for the classifiers. Finally, we tested our classifiers on shorter trajectories with duration times comparable (or even shorter) than typical experimental trajectories and on trajectories measured with varying temporal resolutions. Our results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms are indeed capable of discriminating different segregation mechanisms in bacteria and to even resolve combinations of the mechanisms on rather short time scales."
https://openalex.org/W4206333390,"Smart adherence products are marketed to assist with medication management. However, little is known about their in-home integration by older adults. It is necessary to investigate the facilitators and barriers older adults face when integrating these products into their medication taking routines before effectiveness can be examined. The aim of this study was to (a) examine the integration of a smart multidose blister package and (b) understand medication intake behaviour of adults with chronic diseases using an integrated theoretical model comprised of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Capacity, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) Model. An ethnographic-informed study was conducted with older adults using the smart multidose blister package to manage their medications for eight weeks. Data was collected quantitatively and qualitatively using in-home observations, photo-elicitation, field notes, semi-structured interviews, system usability scale (SUS) and net promoter scale (NPS). The interview guide was developed with constructs from the TAM, TPB and COM-B Model. Data were analyzed using the Qualitative Analysis Guide of Leuven (QUAGOL) framework to generate themes and sub-themes which were mapped back to TAM, TBP and COM-B Model. Ten older adults with an average age of 76 years, of which 80% were female, participated in the study. On average, participants reported five medical conditions, while the average number of medications was 11.1. The mean SUS was 75.50 and overall NPS score was 0. Qualitative analysis identified three themes; (1) factors influencing medication intake behaviour (2) facilitators to the product use and, (3) barriers to the product use. The smart blister package was found to be easy to use and acceptable by older adults. Clinicians should assess an older adult’s medication intake behavior as well as barriers and facilitators to product use prior to recommending an adherence product for managing medications."
https://openalex.org/W4206615077,"This study aimed to determine the effects of long-term and high-dose administration of glucocorticoids (GCs) on the histological and mechanical properties of the cranial cruciate ligament (CrCL) in healthy beagle dogs. A synthetic corticosteroid at 2 mg/kg every 12 h was administered for 84 days in nine dogs (18 CrCLs) (GC group). Twenty CrCLs from 12 healthy male beagles were used as the normal control (control group). CrCLs were histologically examined (n = 12 in the GC group and n = 14 in the control group) using hematoxylin-eosin, Alcian-Blue, Elastica-Eosin stains, and immunohistological staining of type 1 collagen and elastin. An additional 12 CrCLs were mechanically tested (n = 6 in the GC and n = 6 in the control groups) to determine failure pattern, maximum tensile strength, maximum stress, elastic modulus, and stress and strain at the transition point. The histological examination revealed a significant increase in interfascicular area and fibrillar disorientation at the tibial attachment in both groups. The ratios of mucopolysaccharide-positive area and positive areas of elastic fibers were significantly higher in the control group than in the GC group. The biomechanical examination demonstrated significantly lower stress at the transition point in the GC group than in the control group. The present study results indicate that high-dose corticosteroids may affect metabolism, such as mucopolysaccharides and elastic fibers production, although the effect on type 1 collagen production is small. These changes of the extracellular matrix had a small effect on the strength of the ligament. This study suggested that the ligamentous changes associated with GC are different from the degeneration observed in spontaneous canine CrCL disease."
https://openalex.org/W4206899950,"A number of inherited ataxias is known in humans, with more than 250 loci implicated, most of which are included in human ataxia screening panels. Anecdotally, cases of ataxia in the Norwegian elkhound black have been known for the last 40 years. Affected puppies from three litters were clinically and neurologically examined, and postmortem samples were collected for morphological studies, including ultrastructural analyses. The puppies displayed vestibulocerebellar neurological signs and had degenerative histopathological alterations in cerebellum and brain stem. Three affected dogs, each from different litters, as well as both parents and one healthy littermate from each litter, were whole genome sequenced. Through variant calling we discovered a disease-associated 1 bp deletion in HACE1 (CFA12), resulting in a frameshift at codon 333 and a premature stop codon at codon 366. The perfect association combined with the predicted significant molecular effect, strongly suggest that we have found the causative mutation for Norwegian elkhound black ataxia. We have identified a novel candidate gene for ataxia where dogs can serve as a spontaneous model for improved understanding of ataxia, also in human."
https://openalex.org/W4206973775,"In mountainous and high latitude regions, migratory animals exploit green waves of emerging vegetation coinciding with rising daily mean temperatures initiating snowmelt across the landscape. Snowmelt also causes rivers and streams draining these regions to swell, a process referred to as to as the 'spring pulse.' Networks of streamgages measuring streamflow in these regions often have long-term and continuous periods of record available in real-time and at the daily time step, and thus produce data with potential to predict temporal migration patterns for species exploiting green waves. We tested the potential of models informed by streamflow data to predict timing of spring migration of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) herds in a headwater basin of the Colorado River. Models using streamflow data were compared with those informed by traditional temperature-derived measures of the onset of spring. Non-parametric linear-regression techniques were used to test for temporal stationarity in each variable, and logistic-regression models were used to produce probabilities of migration initiation. Our analysis indicates that models using daily streamflow data can perform as well as those using temperature-derived data to predict past-migration patterns, and nearly as well in potential to forecast future migrations. The best performing model was used to generate probabilities of onset of migration for mule deer herds over the 69-year period-of-record from a streamgage. That model indicated spring migration has been trending toward earlier initiations, with modeled median initiations shifting from a Julian day of 123 in the mid 20th century to Julian day 115 over the most recent two decades. The period of 1960 to 1979 had the latest modeled median initiations with Julian day of 128. The analyses demonstrate promise for merging existing hydrologic and biological data collection platforms in these regions to explore timing of past migration patterns and predict migration onsets in real-time."
https://openalex.org/W3213619905,"The aim of this study was to assess the measurement properties of external training load measures across three formats of standardised training games. Eighty-eight players from two English professional soccer clubs participated in the study spanning three consecutive seasons. External training load data was collected from three types of standardised game format drills (11v11, 10v10, 7v7+6) using Global Positioning Systems. For each external training load metric in each game format, the following measurement properties were calculated; coefficient of variation (CV%) to determine between- and within-subject reliability, intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to determine test-retest reliability, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to determine sensitivity. Total distance (TD) and PlayerLoad ™ (PL) demonstrated good sensitivity (TD SNR = 1.6–4.6; PL SNR = 1.2–4.3) on a group level. However, a wide variety of within-subject reliability was demonstrated for these variables (TD CV% = 1.7–36.3%; PL CV% = 4.3–39.5%) and corresponding intensity measures calculated per minute. The percentage contribution of individual planes to PL showed the lowest between-subject CV% (CV% = 2–7%), although sensitivity varied across formats (SNR = 0.3–1.4). High speed running demonstrated poor reliability across all three formats of SSG (CV% = 51–103%, ICC = 0.03–0.53). Given the measurement properties of external training load measures observed in this study, specifically the within-subject variation, reliability across trials of standardised training games should be calculated on an individual level. This will allow practitioners to detect worthwhile changes across trials of standardised game format drills. Such information is important for the appropriate implementation of training and monitoring strategies in soccer."

Our main sources of information are survey data and administrative data, but we also make use of informative prior distributions based on international estimates of obesity trends and on expectations about smoothness. Although the final model is complex, the difficulty of building and understanding the model is reduced by the fact that it is composed of many smaller submodels. For instance, the submodel describing trends in prevalences is specified separately from the submodels describing errors in the data sources. None of our Thai data sources has more than 7 time points. However, by combining multiple data sources, we are able to fit relatively complicated time series models. Our results suggest that obesity prevalence has recently starting rising quickly among Thai teenagers throughout the country, but has been stable among children under 5 years old."

Eligibility for UCF assistance was based on the running variable of land ownership in acres. We used eligibility as an instrumental variable to estimate the local average treatment effect of UCF assistance on contraceptive expenditures. The results show that UCF assistance results in increases in monthly contraceptive expenditures.
https://openalex.org/W4205273347,"Healthy people can walk nearly effortlessly thanks to their instinctively adaptive gait patterns that tend to minimize metabolic energy consumption. However, the economy of gait is severely impaired in many neurological disorders such as stroke or cerebral palsy (CP). Moreover, self-selected asymmetry of impaired gait does not seem to unequivocally coincide with the minimal energy cost, suggesting the presence of other adaptive origins. Here, we used hemiparetic CP gait as a model to test the hypothesis that pathological asymmetric gait patterns are chosen to equalize the relative muscle efforts between the affected and unaffected limbs. We determined the relative muscle efforts for the ankle and knee extensors by relating extensor joint moments during gait to maximum moments obtained from all-out hopping reference test. During asymmetric CP gait, the unaffected limb generated greater ankle (1.36±0.15 vs 1.17±0.16 Nm/kg, p = 0.002) and knee (0.74±0.33 vs 0.44±0.19 Nm/kg, p = 0.007) extensor moments compared with the affected limb. Similarly, the maximum moment generation capacity was greater in the unaffected limb versus the affected limb (ankle extensors: 1.81±0.39 Nm/kg vs 1.51±0.34 Nm/kg, p = 0.033; knee extensors: 1.83±0.37 Nm/kg vs 1.34±0.38 Nm/kg, p = 0.021) in our force reference test. As a consequence, no differences were found in the relative efforts between unaffected and affected limb ankle extensors (77±12% vs 80±16%, p = 0.69) and knee extensors (41±17% vs 38±23%, p = 0.54). In conclusion, asymmetric CP gait resulted in similar relative muscle efforts between affected and unaffected limbs. The tendency for effort equalization may thus be an important driver of self-selected gait asymmetry patterns, and consequently advantageous for preventing fatigue of the weaker affected side musculature."

Emotional distress and unhealthy lifestyle factors tend to be interdependent between survivors and their informal caregivers (e.g., family and friends who provide unpaid care; together called dyads), such that one partner's lifestyle and coping behaviors influence the other's behaviors, yet no research has closely examined this relationship in HS dyads over time. We will conduct a mixed methods study to quantitatively and qualitatively understand the longitudinal relationship between emotional distress and lifestyle factors across time in this population (HS dyads) to identify treatment targets to prevent emotional distress chronicity and stroke recurrence. In aim 1, we will assess emotional distress (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTS) and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, poor diet, limited physical activity medication adherence/blood pressure control) in dyads of survivors of HS and their caregivers (N = 80), at three separate time points (hospitalization in the Neuro-ICU, 1, and 3 months later). We hypothesize that 1) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be interrelated within and across time for both survivors and caregivers, and 2) lifestyle factors and emotional distress will be interdependent between survivors and caregivers. We also aim to explore the nuanced interplay between lifestyle factors and emotional distress and gain in depth information on barriers and facilitators for a dyadic intervention to optimize lifestyle behaviors and emotional functioning in HS dyads. Eligible patients will be adults who have a caregiver also willing to participate. Patients will be referred for study participation by the nursing team who will ensure that they are cognitively able to meaningfully participate. Multilevel dyadic modeling (i.e., actor-partner interdependence model; APIM) with distinguishable dyads will be used to determine influences of these factors onto each other over time. In Aim 2, we will conduct live video qualitative dyadic interviews (N = 20 or until theme saturation) at all time points from the same participants with and without emotional distress and at least one lifestyle risk factor, to understand the nuanced relationships between emotional distress and lifestyle behaviors, and barriers and facilitators to engagement in a skills-based psychosocial intervention. Interviews will be analyzed using inductive and deductive approaches. The present study is currently ongoing. So far, we enrolled 2 participants. Recruitment will end October 2022 with plans to analyze data by December 2022. The findings from this study will be used to further develop psychosocial interventions and inform novel treatments for survivors of HS and their informal caregivers."
https://openalex.org/W4205342292,"Globally, medical students have demonstrated knowledge gaps in emergency care and acute stabilization. In Colombia, new graduates provide care for vulnerable populations. The World Health Organization (WHO) Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course trains frontline providers with limited resources in the management of acute illness and injury. While this course may serve medical students as adjunct to current curriculum, its utility in this learner group has not been investigated. This study performs a baseline assessment of knowledge and confidence in emergency management taught in the BEC amongst medical students in Colombia.A validated, cross-sectional survey assessing knowledge and confidence of emergency care congruent with BEC content was electronically administered to graduating medical students across Colombia. Knowledge was evaluated via 15 multiple choice questions and confidence via 13 questions using 100 mm visual analog scales. Mean knowledge and confidence scores were compared across demographics, geography and prior training using Chi-Squared or one-way ANOVA analyses.Data were gathered from 468 graduating medical students at 36 institutions. The mean knowledge score was 59.9% ± 23% (95% CI 57.8-62.0%); the mean confidence score was 59.6 mm ±16.7 mm (95% CI 58.1-61.2). Increasing knowledge and confidence scores were associated with prior completion of emergency management training courses (p<0.0001).Knowledge and confidence levels of emergency care management for graduating medical students across Colombia demonstrated room for additional, specialized training. Higher scores were seen in groups that had completed emergency care courses. Implementation of the BEC as an adjunct to current curriculum may serve a valuable addition."
https://openalex.org/W4205748714,"Tumor-treating fields have potential as minimally invasive cancer treatment. This study aimed to explore the optimum tumor-treating field conditions that minimize unpredicted variations in therapeutic outcomes resulting from differences in cell size and electrical properties. The electric field concentration that induces a dielectrophoretic force near the division plane of a mitotic cell was calculated by finite element analysis for 144 cases, based on different combinations of six noise factors associated with cells and four controllable factors including frequency, as determined by the Taguchi method. Changing the frequency from 200 to 400 kHz strongly increased robustness in producing a dielectrophoretic force, irrespective of noise factors. However, this frequency change reduced the force magnitude, which can be increased by simply applying a higher voltage. Based on additional simulations that considered this trade-off effect, a frequency of 300 kHz is recommended for a robust TTF treatment with allowable variations. The dielectrophoretic force was almost independent of the angle of applied electric field deviated from the most effective direction by ±20 degrees. Furthermore, increased robustness was observed for extracellular fluid with higher conductivity and permittivity. The Taguchi method was useful for identifying robust tumor-treating field therapy conditions from a considerably small number of replicated simulations."
https://openalex.org/W4205844750,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrythmia and is associated with costly morbidity such as stroke and heart failure. Mobile health (mHealth) has potential to help bridge the gaps of traditional healthcare models that may be poorly suited to the sporadic nature of AF. The Self-management and Educational technology support Tool for AF patients (SETAF) was designed based on the preferences and needs of AF patients but more study is required to assess the acceptance of this novel tool.Explore the usability and acceptance of SETAF among AF patients in Singapore.A mixed methods study was conducted with AF patients who were purposively sampled from an outpatient cardiology clinic in Singapore. After 6 weeks of using SETAF, semi-structured interviews were performed, and data were analyzed inductively following a thematic analysis approach. Results from a short 4-item survey and application usage data were also analyzed descriptively. Both qualitative and quantitative results were organized and presented following the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework.A total of 37 patients participated in the study and 19 were interviewed. Participants perceived SETAF as useful for improving AF knowledge, self-management and access to healthcare providers and was easy to use due to the guided tutorial and user-friendly interface. They also identified the need for better personalization of content, psychosocial support features and reduction of language barriers. Application usage data revealed preference for AF related content and decreased interaction with the motivational message component of SETAF over time. Overall, most of the participants would continue using SETAF and were willing to pay for it.AF patients in Singapore found SETAF useful and acceptable as a tool for AF management. The insights from this study not only support the potential of mHealth but may also inform the design and implementation of future mHealth tools for AF patients."
https://openalex.org/W4206288406,"Informed consent is an essential prerequisite for enrolling patients into a study. Obtaining informed consent in an emergency is complex and often impossible. Delayed consent has been suggested for emergency care research. This study aims to determine the acceptability of prehospital emergency care research with delayed consent in the Western Cape community of South Africa.This study was an online survey of a stratified, representative sample of community members in the Western Cape province of South Africa. We calculated a powered sample size to be 385, and a stratified sampling method was employed. The survey was based on similar studies and piloted. Data were analysed descriptively.A total of 807 surveys were returned. Most respondents felt that enrolment into prehospital research would be acceptable if it offered direct benefit to them (n = 455; 68%) or if their condition was life-threatening and the research would identify improved treatment for future patients with a similar condition (n = 474; 70%). Similar results were appreciable when asked about the participation of their family member (n = 445; 66%) or their child (n = 422; 62%) regarding direct prospects of benefit. Overwhelmingly, respondents indicated that they would prefer to be informed of their own (n = 590; 85%), their family member's (n = 593; 84%) or their child's (n = 587; 86%) participation in a study immediately or as soon as possible. Only 35% (n = 283) agreed to retention data of deceased patients without the next of kin's consent.We report majority agreement of respondents for emergency care research with delayed consent if the interventions offered direct benefit to the research participant, if the participant's condition was life-threatening and the work held the prospect of benefit for future patients, and if the protocol for delayed consent was approved by a human research ethics committee. These results should be explored using qualitative methods."
https://openalex.org/W4206434583,"Burn is a common case in developing countries, with over half of fire-related deaths reported in Southeast Asia and full-thickness burns as a high mortality risk. Human amnion has been used as a wound dressing for centuries. In this study, a decellularised amnion overlaid with fibrin, ""amnion bilayer (AB),"" was used as a dressing immediately after burn and as a graft to replace the scar in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to full-thickness burn model. The aim was to observe whether amnion bilayer can reduce damages in third-grade burn when skin replacement is deemed impossible. The burn was induced using an electrical solder, heated for 5 mins, and contacted on the rat's bare skin for 20 s. AB was applied as a (i) dressing immediately after induction and graft after eschar removal. Two groups (n = 6) were compared: AB and Sofra-Tulle ®, the National Hospital of Indonesia (NHI) protocol. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome stains. Immunohistochemistry labelling was used to indicate scars (α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA] and collagen-1) and angiogenesis (von Willebrand factor). Also, the macrophages inflammatory protein-3α (MIP-3α) indicates an early inflammatory process. The post dressing of the AB group demonstrated hair follicle remains and adipose tissue development. The NHI group appeared with a denatured matrix. Complete healing was seen in the AB group after 28 days with skin appendages similar to normal, while the NHI group showed no appendages in the centre of the actively inflamed area. The α-SMA was found in both groups. Collagen-1 was highly expressed in the NHI group, which led to a scar. Angiogenesis was found more in the AB group. The AB group had shown the capacity to accelerate complete healing and recover skin appendages better than the current protocol."
https://openalex.org/W4206610241,"The ordinary linear regression method is limited to bivariate data because it is based on the Cartesian representation y = f ( x ). Using the chain rule, we transform the method to the parametric representation ( x ( t ), y ( t )) and obtain a linear regression framework in which the weighted average is used as a parameter for a multivariate linear relation for a set of linearly related variable vectors (LRVVs). We confirm the proposed approach by a Monte Carlo simulation, where the minimum coefficient of variation for error (CVE) provides the optimal weights when forming a weighted average of LRVVs. Then, we describe a parametric linear regression (PLR) algorithm in which the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is used to estimate measurement error regression (MER) parameters individually for the given variable vectors. We demonstrate that MER parameters from the PLR and nonlinear ODRPACK methods are quite similar for a wide range of reliability ratios, but ODRPACK is formulated only for bivariate data. We identify scale invariant quantities for the PLR and weighted orthogonal regression (WOR) methods and their correspondences with the partitioned residual effects between the variable vectors. Thus, the specification of an error model for the data is essential for MER and we discuss the use of Monte Carlo methods for estimating the distributions and confidence intervals for MER slope and correlation coefficient. We distinguish between elementary covariance for the y = f ( x ) representation and covariance vector for the ( x ( t ), y ( t )) representation. We also discuss the multivariate generalization of the Pearson correlation as the contraction between Cartesian polyad alignment tensors for the LRVVs and weighted average. Finally, we demonstrate the use of multidimensional PLR in estimating the MER parameters for replicate RNA-Seq data and quadratic regression for estimating the parameters of the conical dispersion of read count data about the MER line."
https://openalex.org/W4206941733,"The vector control of the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) is affected by cross-coupling, output delay, parameter mismatch, and other factors; thus, resulting in its poor steady-state and insufficient dynamic performance. To address these problems, the design proposed in this study adopts a model predictive current control strategy. In the traditional model predictive control, the absolute value of the difference between the predicted output current of the inverter and the reference current is used as the cost function instead of the minimum value of the valence function, i.e., the optimal solution of the system, and the best switching state is outputted. The design proposed in this study adopts the dual-vector model to predict the current control. Firstly, the reference voltage vector was predicted on basis of the deadbeat idea, which reduced the calculation burden of processor. Next, in order to further improve the stability of the system, a two-vectors duty cycle calculation method was introduced. Then, simplifies the selection range of the two voltage vectors. While ensuring the accuracy of the voltage vector, the control is reduced. Reduce the amount of calculation in the system, thereby improving its robustness. Finally, based on the principle of current vector tracking error minimization, the duration of the selected voltage vector was determined. Last but not the least, the control strategy is applied to the MTPA control to increase the operating efficiency of the control motor. The improved control strategy can effectively reduce the torque ripple and improve the dynamic and steady-state performance of the system. Simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm."
