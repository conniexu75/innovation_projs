https://openalex.org/W1548285478,"Abstract Two immunochemically distinct mucins have been isolated from pig submaxillary glands. The glands were combined according to the ability of aqueous extracts of these glands to inhibit hemagglutination of human type A erythrocytes. Mucin isolated from the glands containing blood group A activity is designated A+ pig submaxillary mucin (A+-PSM), while mucin isolated from the remaining glands is designated A- pig submaxillary mucin (A--PSM). The carbohydrate composition of both mucins is similar and comprises N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, galactose, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Treatment of these mucins with alkaline borohydride resulted in the release of a series of reduced oligosaccharides and the monosaccharide, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactitol (N-acetylgalactosaminitol). Conditions are reported which give more than 90% cleavage of the sugar residues from the protein chain. The most complex oligosaccharide (designated oligosaccharide I) was a pentasaccharide, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranosyl (1 → 3)-[α-l-fucopyranosyl-(1 → 2)]-β-d-galactopyranosyl-(1 → 3)-[N-glycolylneuraminyl-(2 → 6)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactitol. In addition, the following oligosaccharides were isolated (structures are given as related to oligosaccharide I): oligosaccharide II, I minus N-acetylgalactosamine; oligosaccharide III, a disaccharide N-glycolylneuraminyl → N-acetylgalactosaminitol; oligosaccharide IV, I minus N-glycolylneuraminic acid; oligosaccharide V, II minus N-glycolylneuraminic acid. N-Acetylgalactosaminitol (Fraction VI) was the only detectable monosaccharide. Rabbit antiserum to human type A erythrocyte stroma precipitated A+-PSM, but not A--PSM. Oligosaccharides I and IV, found only in A+-PSM, are potent inhibitors of the anti A-A+-PSM precipitation, but oligosaccharides II, III, and V and a monosaccharide (Fraction VI) are completely inactive."
https://openalex.org/W2064780326,"Previous reports demonstrated that hypothalamic stimulation may elicit either eating, drinking, or gnawing and emphasized both the specificity of the neural circuits mediating these behaviors and the similarity to behavior during natural-drive states such as hunger and thirst. We find that, after a period of very consistent elicitation of one of these behaviors, the animal may exhibit an equally consistent alternate behavior. A learning component is implicated in the association of hypothalamic stimulation with a particular behavior pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2045875322,"Pure-tone whistles (2403) by four individual dolphins (Delphinus delphis bairdi) were analyzed for duration and the elapse of time before either response by another animal or a repeat whistle by the same animal. Only five major types of whistle emissions were recorded, all stereotyped and each characteristic of the animal emitting it. Only one of the four animals emitted two different whistles, one of which was rare and both of which were stereotyped. A pure-tone chirp and pulsed sounds are discussed. We found no evidence of a dolphin ""language,"" but we present evidence of social response to acoustic signals."
https://openalex.org/W1556249430,Abstract Large oligonucleotide fragments obtained by partial digestion of yeast phenylalanine transfer ribonucleic acid with ribonuclease T1 have been separated and characterized. The information provided by these analyses and those described in the preceding paper has permitted the derivation of the total sequence of phenylalanine transfer ribonucleic acid.

https://openalex.org/W1530025595,"A new method for the labeling of terminal cis-diol end groups in ribopolynucleotides is described; it involves the reaction of an aqueous solution of RNA with sodium metaperiodate and subsequent reduction of the resulting terminal dialdehyde with 3H-sodium borohydride. The reaction conditions are mild, and conversion to end group-labeled RNA is nearly quantitative, as judged by the incorporation of radioactivity into pApApA and yeast transfer RNA (tRNA). With pApApA and tRNA as substrates, the specificity of reaction for 2′,3′-diol end groups has been confirmed. This method has been applied to the sequence analysis of an octanucleotide isolated from yeast phenylalanine tRNA. A general scheme for 3′-terminal sequence analysis of ribopolynucleotides by application of this technique is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1531801148,"Tritium-labeled tetrasaccharide, GlcNAc-β(1 → 4)-MurNAc-β(1 → 4)-GlcNAc-β(1 → 4)-MurNAc, and disaccharide, GlcNAcβ(1 → 4)-MurNAc (where MurNAc represents N-acetylmuramyl), were prepared by tritiation of the corresponding unlabeled compounds. The products, obtained in good yield, were found to be homogeneous and radiochemically pure by several chromatographic and electrophoretic criteria and indistinguishable from the starting materials. Chemical and enzymatic studies indicated that they were uniformly labeled. The action of lysozyme on the tetrasaccharide was studied by a combination of paper electrophoresis and paper chromatography. The major product of digestion was the disaccharide. Higher oligosaccharides were formed in the initial stages of the reaction and disappeared after prolonged incubation when only disaccharide together with considerable amounts of tetrasaccharide was present. The rate of disappearance of the tetrasaccharide changed markedly during the course of the reactions; the maximal rate increased with the increase in substrate concentration. Four higher oligosaccharides (hexa-, octa-, deca-, and dodecasaccharides) were isolated from lysozyme digests of the tetrasaccharide-3H. Two of these were found to be identical with the hexa- and octasaccharides isolated from lysozyme digests of Micrococcus lysodeikticus cell walls. The higher oligosaccharides were readily digested by lysozyme to yield the corresponding di- and tetrasaccharides. The hexa- and octasaccharides were digested at a much faster rate than the tetrasaccharide. Addition of small amounts of octasaccharide to the tetrasaccharide increased significantly the rate of digestion of the latter. Upon incubation of unlabeled tetrasaccharide with disaccharide-3H in the presence of lysozyme, the labeled tetrasaccharide formed did not contain significant amounts of radioactivity in the nonreducing half of the molecule. Furthermore, when this newly formed radioactive tetrasaccharide was incubated with GlcNAc-14C and lysozyme, the Glc-NAc-β(1 → 4)-MurNAc-β(1 → 4)-GlcNAc contained insignificant amounts of 3H. These results indicate that in the reactions studied over 90% of the new products must be formed by transglycosylation, and not by reversal of hydrolysis. The results obtained show that hydrolysis of the tetrasaccharide to disaccharide proceeds chiefly via transglycosylation, leading to the formation of high oligosaccharides. This mechanism is consistent with the binding data for the association of various saccharides with lysozyme and can be readily explained on the basis of the three-dimensional model of lysozyme presented by Phillips and co-workers."

The 3'-terminal nucleoside is cytidine, and the 5'-terminal dinucleotide is pGpCp. Fourteen minor nucleosides are present, including 7-methylguanosine, 2'-O-methylcytidine, and a nucleoside the identity of which is not established. The sequences involving some of the minor nucleosides, N2-dimethyl-GpCp, GpTp, and ApGp-dihydro-Up, are common to many other tRNAs. The largest oligonucleotide produced is an octanucleotide with the sequence GpGpGpApGpAp-GpCp."
https://openalex.org/W1556531883,"Abstract A particulate preparation obtained by lysing yeast protoplasts was found to catalyze the incorporation of radioactivity from guanosine diphosphate 14C-mannose into a mannose polysaccharide. The km for guanosine diphosphate mannose is 0.5 mm, and the optimum pH is between 5.5 and 7.2. There is an almost absolute requirement of Mn++ for activity, which cannot be substituted by Mg++. The reaction proceeds in the absence of added primer. The reaction product was identified as yeast mannan by comparing the oligosaccharides prepared by acetolysis with those from a radioactive mannan obtained in vivo. The results of the reduction and hydrolysis of these oligosaccharides are consistent with the assumption that a representative part of the mannan molecule is synthesized by the preparation. The reaction product remains attached to particles, from which it can be partially released by mild treatments, such as incubation at 37° or heating at 100° at pH 7.5. Several enzymes also release the radioactivity from the particles. The possible significance of these findings in relation to the passage of mannosyl residues from the inside to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane and their integration into the cell wall is discussed."

At higher currents self-stimulation is maintained without food. Such currents may spread to activate consummatory feedback appropriate to the drive elicited; or, for more intensely stimulated drive mechanisms, wider ranges of sensory feedback may be reinforcing."

https://openalex.org/W1565688240,"Abstract Two radioactive glycopeptides (Glycopeptides I and II) were isolated from the deoxycholate-soluble fraction of rat liver microsomes 90min after injection of glucosamine-1-14C. These two glycopeptides were rich in mannose and N-acetylglucosamine but relatively poor in galactose and sialic acid. Glycopeptide I contained sialic acid, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid, proline, and glycine in the proportion 1:1:4:5:3:1:2:1:1, resulting in a calculated minimum molecular weight of 2950. Glycopeptide II consisted only of aspartic acid, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose. This glycopeptide gave a single symmetrical peak with a sedimentation constant of 0.6 S when examined by ultracentrifugation. The minimum molecular weight of this glycopeptide is 2360, calculated from the molar ratio for aspartic acid, amide, N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose of 1:1:4:9. By using various glycosidases, oligosaccharide chains in Glycopeptide I were found to contain sialic acid and mannose at the nonreducing ends, while mannose and N-acetylglucosamine separately occupy the nonreducing termini of the sugar chains in Glycopeptide II. Possible sequential arrangements of various monosaccharide units in these two glycopeptides are suggested. Comparison of the sequential arrangement of monosaccharide units in Glycopeptides I and II with that of well characterized plasma glycoproteins suggests that the oligosaccharide chains in these glycopeptides lack sialic acidgalactose-N-acetylglucosamine chains, which occupy the peripheral position of the sugar units in many plasma glycoproteins. It is therefore suggested that these glycopeptides isolated from the microsomal membrane may carry mainly the sugar units which occupy the inner core of the mature plasma glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1599409012,"Initial rate kinetics, product inhibition patterns, and equilibrium kinetics all indicate that cleavage of adenylosuccinate (AMP-S) by yeast adenylosuccinate lyase proceeds primarily by a reaction in which fumarate leaves the enzyme before AMP and cannot bind to free enzyme at kinetically significant concentrations. The alternate path, in which AMP leaves first, could be detected at equilibrium by the existence of AMP⇋AMP-S exchange at saturating levels of fumarate and AMP-S. This exchange was less than onetenth the rate of fumarate⇋AMP-S exchange. Moreover, evidence was obtained that the high concentrations of fumarate and AMP-S enhanced the AMP exchange rate in a manner unrelated to their roles as substrates. Thus, under steady state conditions, the contribution of the alternate path must be very small. The steady state analysis also provided evidence that breakages of the C—N and C—H bonds of the substrate are not the slowest steps of the over-all reaction. The inability of free enzyme to bind fumarate at kinetically significant concentrations is supported by failure of other dicarboxylic acids to inhibit the enzyme. However, the succinyl group of AMP-S plays a role in attachment to the enzyme, since AMP-S binds 8 times more strongly than AMP, as indicated by their Ki values. It is suggested that the free enzyme exists principally in a conformation that does not bind dicarboxylic acids, but that attachment of AMP or of the AMP portion of AMP-S promotes conversion to a form that can bind fumarate or the succinyl portion of AMP-S. The resultant inability of the enzyme to be inhibited by dicarboxylic acids may be of biological value."
https://openalex.org/W1556273208,"Abstract The fragments produced by digestion of yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA (tRNAphe) with Taka-Diastase ribonuclease T1 have been resolved on anion exchange columns and characterized. The 3'-terminal sequence has been confirmed to be CpApCpC, and the tetranucleotide TpψpCpGp, concluded previously to be a sequence common to tRNAs, is present also in this RNA. The results of the present work and those described previously on degradation with pancreatic ribonuclease are in mutual agreement and, taken together, permit the derivation of longer oligonucleotide sequences: the latter account for 55 out of 76 nucleotide residues of tRNAphe. The largest oligonucleotide isolated is the dodecanucleotide Ap2'OMeCpUp2'OMeGpApApYp-Apψp5MeCpUpGp; this oligonucleotide contains the presumed anticodon, 2'OMeGpApA."

https://openalex.org/W1558700865,"This study was carried out to determine if previous reports by others concerning the polymorphic nature of prothrombin could be substantiated. The results obtained suggest that preparations of this important blood coagulation zymogen may undergo spontaneous activation with conversion to a very small but significant amount of thrombin. The active enzyme is then capable of producing cleavage at various points on the prothrombin molecule, which results in a heterogeneous mixture of molecules with different chromatographic and electrophoretic properties. Some of these molecules retain prothrombin activity. It seems probable that these events are responsible for the polymorphic nature of prothrombin previously reported, and they may also be indirectly responsible for the deleterious effects that certain cellulose and polymethacrylate ion exchange columns have been reported to produce during chromatography of the zymogen. A relatively homogeneous prothrombin preparation has been obtained by chromatography of less pure products on diethylaminoethyl cellulose columns at pH 7.4 with the use of a continuous buffer gradient. The zymogen thus isolated readily converts to thrombin in 25% (w/v) sodium citrate solution. However, if the preparations are altered owing to partial activation, this does not occur as readily but requires many days for the maximum yield of thrombin to be attained. Polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis, column chromatography, and gel filtration analysis have permitted the identification and isolation of at least seven activation fragments present in the prothrombin conversion system. They appear qualitatively and, in some respects, quantitatively in relation to the thrombin activity developed. These are compared to previous studies of the sedimentation and enzymatic properties of the prothrombin-thrombin system."
https://openalex.org/W1605114604,"Abstract Products obtained by partial degradation of yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA with pancreatic ribonuclease have been characterized. Under limiting conditions of digestion, the transfer RNA was preferentially cleaved only at two points in the chain. The susceptibility of a certain region of the molecule to cleavage by pancreatic ribonuclease indicates that the trinucleotide sequence 2'-O-methylguanylyladenylyladenylyl (-2'OMeG-A-A-) represents the anticodon in yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1571974845,"Abstract Only 3 of the 6 sulfhydryl groups of native bovine heart supernatant malate dehydrogenase (S-MDH) react with p-mercuribenzoate (PMB) with no loss of enzymatic activity. In addition, prolonged incubation of S-MDH in 2.6 m urea solutions does not significantly alter the catalytic properties of the enzyme. In 2.6 m urea, however, all 6 sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme react with PMB, with attendant losses in catalytic activity. Under these conditions the rate of inactivation, although considerably slower than the rate of mercaptide formation, closely parallels the rate of change in the optical rotatory dispersion properties of the enzyme. Native S-MDH exhibits an optical rotatory dispersion curve with a distinct shoulder in the 280 to 290 mµ spectral region and a trough at 233 mµ. Changes in these properties and other optical rotatory dispersion parameters were used to index conformational changes of S-MDH accompanying the various treatments. Native S-MDH and fully active S-MDH · (PMB)3 exhibit identical optical rotatory dispersion curves. S-MDH in 2.6 m urea also exhibits an optical rotatory dispersion curve similar to that of the native enzyme. S-MDH · (PMB)3 and S-MDH · (PMB)6 in 2.6 m urea, however, have significantly different optical rotatory dispersion properties, including a disappearance of the 280 mµ shoulder, decreases in [m']233 values, and large decreases in -b0, a0, and λc values. Since the rate of change in these optical rotatory dispersion properties closely parallelled the rate of loss of catalytic activity but not the rate of mercaptide formation, the results were interpreted as indicating that the loss in activity is related to the changes in protein conformation rather than to the actual blocking of sulfhydryl groups."

https://openalex.org/W1550433059,"Abstract The dinucleotides ApGp, CpGp, and UpGp and seven trinucleotides, ApApGp, ApCpGp, ApUpGp, CpApGp, Cp-CpGp, UpApGp, and UpUpGp, were obtained by Taka-Diastase ribonuclease T1 digestion of yeast RNA and subsequent chromatographic separation with DEAE-Sephadex followed by Dowex 1-X2. The present chromatographic method is suitable for large scale preparation of pure di- and trinucleotides. The absorption spectra and hypochromicities of these oligonucleotides were measured at pH 1, 7, and 13. It is found that the order of the stacking effect in the dinucleotides is ApGp g CpGp g UpGp, which is different from a conclusion drawn from hypochromicity and optical rotatory dispersion data recently reported by Warshaw and Tinoco for the corresponding dinucleoside phosphates. This difference suggested that the additional 3'-terminal phosphate residue has an appreciable effect on the conformations of the dinucleoside phosphates. For the trinucleotides, the hypochromic effect is found to decrease in the order, ApApGp g ApCpGp ≃ CpApGp g UpApGp g CpCpGp g ApUpGp g UpUpGp. The optical rotatory dispersion spectra of two pairs of isomers of known sequence are presented to show the dependence of optical rotatory dispersion on sequence in these oligonucleotides. The possibility of synthesis of polyribonucleotides containing definite repeating di- or trinucleotide sequences is also considered as a potentially important consequence of the present success in large scale preparation of these oligonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1602895465,"Abstract The incorporation of radioactive amino acids into serum proteins by isolated perfused livers from alloxan diabetic rats was depressed in comparison to the normal. The incorporation of amino acids into the major classes of serum lipoproteins (density l1.020; density 1.020 to 1.063; density 1.063 to 1.210) also was impaired in alloxan diabetes. The incorporation of 14C into the total serum proteins and into the lipoproteins was also depressed with livers from chronic alloxan diabetic rats maintained on insulin, and was not further depressed after withdrawal of the insulin from the animals. The incorporation of amino acids into serum proteins was not restored to normal levels upon treatment of the diabetic rats with insulin under our experimental conditions. The incorporation of amino acids into hepatic protein also appeared to be depressed below normal in livers from diabetic rats. The conversion of amino acid 14C to fatty acid carbon of liver and serum triglycerides was reduced with perfused livers from acute and chronic alloxan diabetic rats and was stimulated when the animals were treated with insulin. In diabetes, an increase in the incorporation of amino acid 14C into glyceride-glycerol and into water-soluble neutral compounds of the perfusate was observed, and production of urea and output of amino acid nitrogen were also elevated. The inhibition of synthesis and, possibly, release of the protein moiety of the density l1.020 serum lipoprotein (the carrier of the major proportion of the serum triglyceride) which was observed in perfused livers from acute and chronic alloxan diabetic rats may not be causally related to the inhibition of release of triglyceride in diabetes, since, upon administration of insulin to the diabetic animal, the release of triglyceride by the liver was stimulated even though the defect in the synthesis of serum lipoprotein-protein persisted."

https://openalex.org/W1568503582,"Abstract Extended countercurrent distribution of yeast phenylalanine transfer RNA (tRNAphe) gives rise to two peaks of phenylalanine acceptor activity. By the use of end group-labeling techniques, the 5'-terminal sequence of each of these peaks has been shown to be pGpC-, and the 3'-terminal sequences are -CpApCpC and -CpApCpCpA for Peaks I and II, respectively. Subsequent to the addition of pA to the 3' terminus of the tRNAphe from Peak I by a crude supernatant enzyme from yeast, this tRNA cannot be distinguished from tRNAphe (Peak II) by countercurrent distribution techniques. It is concluded that the two peaks of phenylalanine acceptor activity observed represent the same species of tRNA and differ only in that the tRNAphe (Peak I) is lacking the 3'-terminal pA residue."

Both the side chain and the ureido ring of the biotin molecule are degraded in the particulate system. The side chains of dethiobiotin, homobiotin, and norbiotin are degraded, but little or no degradation of the ureido ring occurs in these three compounds. Neither the side chain nor the ureido ring of biotinol is metabolized. 14C-Norbiotin (the 4-carbon side chain analogue) was isolated and characterized from reaction mixtures of 14C-homobiotin. Another catabolite, tentatively identified as trisnorbiotin (the 2-carbon side chain analogue) was isolated from reaction mixtures containing either 14C-homobiotin or 14C-norbiotin. These findings indicate the presence of a β oxidative system which catalyzes the degradation of the side chain of biotin as well as of several biotin analogues."

Only the unnatural (—)-tartrate was found to be attacked by the enzyme. In the reaction mixture, oxalacetate and pyruvate were detected chromatographically. Their 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones could be detected by paper chromatography. The amino acids obtained by the reduction of the hydrazones were identified chromatographically with aspartic acid and alanine. The presence of oxalacetate and pyruvate in the reaction mixture could be confirmed by the action of malate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase. However, the formation of pyruvate was very slow at the beginning of the reaction. Thus, it was assumed that oxalacetate is the primary product and that pyruvate is formed by nonenzymatic decarboxylation of oxalacetate. A stoichiometric relationship was established between the disappearance of (—)-tartrate and the formation of keto acids. From the above results, the reaction catalyzed was assumed to be the dehydration of (—)-tartrate. This reaction satisfies the requirements of stereospecificity of the dehydration of l-malate by fumarate hydratase."
