https://openalex.org/W2130609859,"Although motor learning is likely to involve multiple processes, phenomena observed in error-based motor learning paradigms tend to be conceptualized in terms of only a single process: adaptation, which occurs through updating an internal model. Here we argue that fundamental phenomena like movement direction biases, savings (faster relearning), and interference do not relate to adaptation but instead are attributable to two additional learning processes that can be characterized as model-free: use-dependent plasticity and operant reinforcement. Although usually ""hidden"" behind adaptation, we demonstrate, with modified visuomotor rotation paradigms, that these distinct model-based and model-free processes combine to learn an error-based motor task. (1) Adaptation of an internal model channels movements toward successful error reduction in visual space. (2) Repetition of the newly adapted movement induces directional biases toward the repeated movement. (3) Operant reinforcement through association of the adapted movement with successful error reduction is responsible for savings."

Stages two through four of this process can be carried out with the Rosetta package, while stage one needs to be done externally. Here, we demonstrate how to carry out the Rosetta enzyme design protocol from start to end in detail using for illustration the triosephosphate isomerase reaction."

Cell swelling-induced membrane stretch/strain is a common stimulus that promotes airway epithelial ATP release, but the mechanisms transducing cell swelling into ATP release are incompletely understood. Using knockdown and knockout approaches, we tested the hypothesis that pannexin 1 mediates ATP release from hypotonically swollen airway epithelia and investigated mechanisms regulating this activity. Well differentiated primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells subjected to hypotonic challenge exhibited enhanced ATP release, which was paralleled by the uptake of the pannexin probe propidium iodide. Both responses were reduced by pannexin 1 inhibitors and by knocking down pannexin 1. Importantly, hypotonicity-evoked ATP release from freshly excised tracheas and dye uptake in primary tracheal epithelial cells were impaired in pannexin 1 knockout mice. Hypotonicity-promoted ATP release and dye uptake in primary well differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells was accompanied by RhoA activation and myosin light chain phosphorylation and was reduced by the RhoA dominant negative mutant RhoA(T19N) and Rho and myosin light chain kinase inhibitors. ATP release and Rho activation were reduced by highly selective inhibitors of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4). Lastly, knocking down TRPV4 impaired hypotonicity-evoked airway epithelial ATP release. Our data suggest that TRPV4 and Rho transduce cell membrane stretch/strain into pannexin 1-mediated ATP release in airway epithelia.

https://openalex.org/W1995630383,"Background DNA-based vaccines have been safe but weakly immunogenic in humans to date. Methods and Findings We sought to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ADVAX, a multigenic HIV-1 DNA vaccine candidate, injected intramuscularly by in vivo electroporation (EP) in a Phase-1, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers. Eight volunteers each received 0.2 mg, 1 mg, or 4 mg ADVAX or saline placebo via EP, or 4 mg ADVAX via standard intramuscular injection at weeks 0 and 8. A third vaccination was administered to eleven volunteers at week 36. EP was safe, well-tolerated and considered acceptable for a prophylactic vaccine. EP delivery of ADVAX increased the magnitude of HIV-1-specific cell mediated immunity by up to 70-fold over IM injection, as measured by gamma interferon ELISpot. The number of antigens to which the response was detected improved with EP and increasing dosage. Intracellular cytokine staining analysis of ELISpot responders revealed both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, with co-secretion of multiple cytokines. Conclusions This is the first demonstration in healthy volunteers that EP is safe, tolerable, and effective in improving the magnitude, breadth and durability of cellular immune responses to a DNA vaccine candidate.

We compared microbiomes of 32 paired urine and urethral swab specimens obtained from adult men attending an STD clinic, by 16S rRNA PCR and deep pyrosequencing. Microbiomes of urine and swabs were remarkably similar, regardless of STI status of the subjects. Thus, urine can be used to characterize urethral microbiomes when swabs are undesirable, such as in population-based studies of the urethral microbiome or where multiple sampling of participants is required."
https://openalex.org/W1998169483,"Background Accurate estimations of life expectancy are important in the management of patients with metastatic cancer affecting the extremities, and help set patient, family, and physician expectations. Clinically, the decision whether to operate on patients with skeletal metastases, as well as the choice of surgical procedure, are predicated on an individual patient's estimated survival. Currently, there are no reliable methods for estimating survival in this patient population. Bayesian classification, which includes Bayesian belief network (BBN) modeling, is a statistical method that explores conditional, probabilistic relationships between variables to estimate the likelihood of an outcome using observed data. Thus, BBN models are being used with increasing frequency in a variety of diagnoses to codify complex clinical data into prognostic models. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of developing Bayesian classifiers to estimate survival in patients undergoing surgery for metastases of the axial and appendicular skeleton. Methods We searched an institution-owned patient management database for all patients who underwent surgery for skeletal metastases between 1999 and 2003. We then developed and trained a machine-learned BBN model to estimate survival in months using candidate features based on historical data. Ten-fold cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to evaluate the BNN model's accuracy and robustness. Results A total of 189 consecutive patients were included. First-degree predictors of survival differed between the 3-month and 12-month models. Following cross validation, the area under the ROC curve was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80–0.93) for 3-month probability of survival and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77–0.90) for 12-month probability of survival. Conclusions A robust, accurate, probabilistic naïve BBN model was successfully developed using observed clinical data to estimate individualized survival in patients with operable skeletal metastases. This method warrants further development and must be externally validated in other patient populations."

So far, each antibody required its own fixation and antigen retrieval protocol so that optimizing immunostaining turned out to be tedious and time consuming.Here we present a novel method to efficiently retrieve the antigen in a widely applicable standard protocol, facilitating fluorescent immunostaining of both cryosections and whole mount preparations in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and medaka (Oryzias latipes).Our method overcomes the loss of sections and damage of tissue and cell morphology, and allows parallel immunostaining in multiple colors, co-immunostaining with fluorescent proteins in transgenic fish lines and in combination with whole mount in situ hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W2053092354,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal disease of deer, elk, and moose transmitted through direct, animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly, via environmental contamination. Considerable attention has been paid to modeling direct transmission, but despite the fact that CWD prions can remain infectious in the environment for years, relatively little information exists about the potential effects of indirect transmission on CWD dynamics. In the present study, we use simulation models to demonstrate how indirect transmission and the duration of environmental prion persistence may affect epidemics of CWD and populations of North American deer. Existing data from Colorado, Wyoming, and Wisconsin's CWD epidemics were used to define plausible short-term outcomes and associated parameter spaces. Resulting long-term outcomes range from relatively low disease prevalence and limited host-population decline to host-population collapse and extinction. Our models suggest that disease prevalence and the severity of population decline is driven by the duration that prions remain infectious in the environment. Despite relatively low epidemic growth rates, the basic reproductive number, R0, may be much larger than expected under the direct-transmission paradigm because the infectious period can vastly exceed the host's life span. High prion persistence is expected to lead to an increasing environmental pool of prions during the early phases (i.e. approximately during the first 50 years) of the epidemic. As a consequence, over this period of time, disease dynamics will become more heavily influenced by indirect transmission, which may explain some of the observed regional differences in age and sex-specific disease patterns. This suggests management interventions, such as culling or vaccination, will become increasingly less effective as CWD epidemics progress."

CD36 deficiency reduces chylomicron production through unknown mechanisms. In this report, we provide novel insights into some of the underlying mechanisms. Our in vivo data demonstrate that CD36 gene deletion in mice does not affect LCFA uptake and subsequent esterification into triglycerides by the intestinal mucosa exposed to the micellar LCFA concentrations prevailing in the intestine. In rodents, the CD36 protein disappears early from the luminal side of intestinal villi during the postprandial period, but only when the diet contains lipids. This drop is significant 1 h after a lipid supply and associates with ubiquitination of CD36. Using CHO cells expressing CD36, it is shown that the digestion products LCFA and diglycerides trigger CD36 ubiquitination. In vivo treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevents the lipid-mediated degradation of CD36. In vivo and ex vivo, CD36 is shown to be required for lipid activation of ERK1/2, which associates with an increase of the key chylomicron synthesis proteins, apolipoprotein B48 and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. Therefore, intestinal CD36, possibly through ERK1/2-mediated signaling, is involved in the adaptation of enterocyte metabolism to the postprandial lipid challenge by promoting the production of large triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that are rapidly cleared in the blood.

In the small intestine, expression of CD36 is especially high in the brush border membrane (BBM) of duodeno-jejunal enterocytes both in rodents and humans (16Poirier H. Degrace P. Niot I. Bernard A.

Although this location correlates with the main site of LCFA absorption, the physiological role played by CD36 in the gut remains incompletely understood. In isolated enterocytes from the proximal intestine, CD36 deletion impairs LCFA uptake (18Nassir F. Wilson B. Han X. Gross R.W. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol.

However, in vivo, the lack of impairment in intestinal net lipid absorption in CD36−/− mice (18Nassir F. Wilson B. Han X. Gross R.W. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol.

By contrast, lipoprotein synthesis and/or secretion are deeply impaired in enterocytes from CD36−/− mice, where smaller chylomicrons are produced. This event might explain the postprandial hypertriglyceridemia found in CD36-deficient mice and humans (20Masuda D. Hirano K. Oku H. Sandoval J.C. Kawase R. Yuasa-Kawase M. Yamashita Y. Takada M.

Indeed, the efficiency of blood triglyceride (TG) clearance is positively linked to chylomicron size (23Quarfordt S.H. Goodman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 116: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be speculated that CD36 plays a role in regulating the metabolic fate of lipids rather than LCFA uptake in the small intestine. However, the molecular mechanisms by which this effect would occur remain unknown. One possibility could be a CD36-dependent modulation of ERK, because it was previously shown to regulate lipoprotein formation (24Tsai J. Qiu W. Kohen-Avramoglu R. Adeli K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2007; 27: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 25Federico L.M. Naples M. Taylor D. Adeli K.

To explore this concept, experiments were conducted in vivo in rats and in wild-type or CD36−/− mice, ex vivo in intestinal segments, and in vitro in stably transfected CHO cells. The present data show that CD36 undergoes rapid ubiquitination and degradation triggered by digestion products during intestinal lipid absorption. This process is associated with CD36-dependent activation of ERK and with increased expression of the key proteins of lipoprotein synthesis apoB48 and MTP. Antibodies against rat CD36 were generated in rabbits and used as described previously (16Poirier H. Degrace P. Niot I. Bernard A. Besnard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse CD36 (R & D System or Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Invitrogen), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-apoB, anti-HSC70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MTP (BD Sciences), secondary antibody peroxidase conjugate goat anti-rabbit (Chemicon International), anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich), and donkey anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were from commercial sources. Protein A/G Plus-agarose immunoprecipitation reagent was from Santa Cruz; MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al) was from Sigma-Aldrich; the ECL kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; triolein was from Sigma; and oleic acid, 2-monolein, and miolein were from Larodan Fine Chemicals. The care and use of laboratory animals followed guidelines of the animal ethics committee of Burgundy University, which approved all protocols. The rats or mice were housed in a controlled environment (constant temperature and humidity, darkness from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). They were fed a standard laboratory chow containing 3% (w/w) lipids (UAR A-04 for rats and mice; Usine d'Alimentation Rationnelle). The alipidic diet was prepared by Safe. Male Wistar rats weighting 180–200 g (Elevage Dépré) were fasted for 48 h. In a first protocol, the animals were refed either a standard laboratory chow containing 3% lipids (w/w, sunflower oil) or a fat-free diet. After sacrifice (by isoflurane anesthesia), jejunal samples (1 cm) taken 24 cm after the pylorus were prepared for immunohistochemistry using antibody against CD36 raised in rabbits (16Poirier H. Degrace P. Niot I. Bernard A. Besnard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In a second protocol, 48-h fasted rats were force-fed 3 ml of sunflower oil or sucrose (isocaloric, 5.27 m). Mucosa from jejunal segments (25 cm taken 10 cm after pylorus) was obtained at different times after and used to prepare homogenates and BBM. Mucosa samples were rapidly frozen and stored at −80 °C until RNA purification. Male C57Bl6 (CD36+/+ and CD36−/− mice (provided by Dr. Jan Glatz) (12 weeks of age) weighing 25–30 g were fasted for 12 h prior to oil gavage (0.5 ml of sunflower oil) and sacrificed by isoflurane anesthesia. The small intestine was divided into three equal parts. The first centimeter was taken from the middle part of the small intestine, considered as the jejunum and treated for immunohistochemistry using antibody anti-CD36 from R & D System. The mucosa from jejunal segments was scraped at 1, 2, and 4 h after the gavage for homogenate preparation and mRNA analysis. The same protocol was performed in mice subjected 30 min before the gavage to an intraperitoneal injection of 100 μl of Me2SO containing 14 mg/kg of body weight of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, whereas the control group received the same volume of Me2SO. The animals were sacrificed 4 h after the oil gavage. Scraped mucosa obtained from rats were weighed and homogenized (with buffer A, which contained 1 g/16.7 ml of 100 mm mannitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1) using a Dounce potter homogenizer. Purified BBM were prepared according to Shirazi-Beechey et al. (28Shirazi-Beechey S.P. Davies A.G. Tebbutt K. Dyer J. Ellis A. Taylor C.J. Fairclough P. Beechey R.B. Gastroenterology. 1990; 98: 676-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, MgCl2 was slowly added to homogenates to reach a final concentration of 10 mm. The samples were stored on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were centrifuged (27,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) (Beckman LE-70, SW41Ti rotor). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 3.8 mol of buffer B (300 mm mannitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) and centrifuged (27,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) (Beckman centrifuge, 70.1Ti rotor). The supernatant was removed, and the BBM pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of buffer B and stored at −20 °C. The purity of BBM preparation and membrane yield were evaluated by assaying the BBM-specific enzyme sucrase-isomaltase according to the Dahlqvist method (29Dahlqvist A. Enzymol. Biol. Clin. 1970; 11: 52-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and enzyme content was related to 1 mg of starting mucosa. The proportion of the sucrase activity retrieved in the BBM fraction corresponds to the efficiency of BBM extraction. Enrichment was obtained by dividing specific activity (UI/mg of protein) of the sucrase in BBM fraction by that of the homogenate. Yield and enrichment were consistent with previous reports (28Shirazi-Beechey S.P. Davies A.G. Tebbutt K. Dyer J. Ellis A. Taylor C.J. Fairclough P. Beechey R.B. Gastroenterology. 1990; 98: 676-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To prepare microsomal and cytosolic fractions, the remaining homogenate from the same animals was centrifuged (18,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was transferred and centrifuged (105,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C) to yield a microsomal (pellet) and a cytosolic (supernatant) fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B. The fractions were stored at −20 °C. When mice were used, a jejunal homogenate was obtained by adding 50 mg of jejunal mucosa to 0.5 ml of buffer A with 1% Triton X-100. Jejunal triglyceride content was evaluated after lipid extraction of mucosa according to the Delsal method (30Delsal J.L. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1954; 36: 1329-1334PubMed Google Scholar). Dried extracts dissolved in 1% Triton X-100 (in chloroform) were dried then redissolved in water for triglyceride determination using CHOD-PAP (Roche Applied Science). Isofluran-anesthetized, 16-h fasted mice were laparatomized, and a 10-cm jejunal loop was isolated in situ and infused with 0.5 ml of a radiolabeled solution of linoleic acid in 2180 μm solution containing 10% of [1-14C]linoleic acid (50 mCi/mmol) emulsified with 10 mm sodium taurocholate to form micelles. Radioactivity incorporation into the different lipid classes in the mucosa was determined (31Petit V. Arnould L. Martin P. Monnot M.C. Pineau T. Besnard P. Niot I. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 278-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The proximal small intestine from 16-h fasted wild-type and CD36−/− mice was cut into small segments (3-cm length) taken 3 cm after the pylorus, split as described by Pardo et al. (32Pardo V.G. Facchinetti M.M. Curino A. Boland R. de Boland A.R. Biogerontology. 2007; 8: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After a 15-min stabilization period, intestinal segments were treated with 240 μm linoleic acid or vehicle (ethanol 0.01%) for 10–20 min. The treatment was ended by submerging the intestinal segment into liquid nitrogen. The mucosa was collected by scraping into ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing anti-protease and anti-phosphatase mixture. CD36 was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C from 500 μg of jejunal homogenate using 1 μg of anti-CD36 (R & D System). Then protein A/G-agarose plus beads were added, and the incubation continued for another 2–3 h. The final pellet was washed three times in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were treated with a denaturating buffer (6 m guanidine HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by extensive PBS washing and then used for detection of ubiquitin or CD36 proteins. In CHO cells, the carboxyl-FLAG-tagged WT or carboxyl lysine mutant (K/A) human CD36 were generated as described (33Smith J. Su X. El-Maghrabi R. Stahl P.D. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13578-13585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected (Lipofectamine 2000; Invitrogen) with empty vector (control) or with vector containing WT CD36 or CD36 where the two C-terminal lysines (469 and 472) were substituted with alanine (K/A). The cells were then selected for stable transfections using hygromycin. Stably transfected cells plated in 6-well plates were incubated for 2 h with either BSA or BSA together with 100 μm of oleic acid, triolein (Sigma), 2-monolein, or diolein (Larodan Fine Chemicals). The cells were lysed, and clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with FLAG affinity gel (Sigma). Immunocomplexes were eluted with FLAG peptide, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with either anti-ubiquitin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or anti-CD36 antibody (Santa Cruz). mRNA levels were measured by real time PCR (9Gaillard D. Laugerette F. Darcel N. El-Yassimi A. Passilly-Degrace P. Hichami A. Khan N.A. Montmayeur J.P. Besnard P. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 31Petit V.

CD36 protein levels were determined using Western blotting (16Poirier H. Degrace P. Niot I. Bernard A. Besnard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and sandwich ELISA (34Pelsers M.M. Lutgerink J.T. Nieuwenhoven F.A. Tandon N.N. van der Vusse G.J. Arends J.W. Hoogenboom H.R. Glatz J.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 407-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of immune signals was by densitometry and with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). All of the data are presented as the means ± S.E. for the indicated number of animals. Significance of differences between groups of observations was tested with a paired Student's t test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. To determine whether CD36 plays a critical role in intestinal LCFA uptake under close to physiological FA delivery conditions, emulsified lipid solution containing [1-14C]linoleic acid as tracer was infused into the lumen of in situ jejunal loops isolated in fasted wild-type and CD36−/− mice. This in vivo technique maintains both intestinal microclimate (i.e. unstirred water layer and cell polarization) and lymph/blood circulations (31Petit V. Arnould L. Martin P. Monnot M.C. Pineau T. Besnard P. Niot I. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 278-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A large lipid load (2180 μm) was used to mimic the postprandial period. Five minutes after infusion, the distribution of radioactivity in lumen and mucosa was similar in CD36+/+ and CD36−/− mice, confirming that CD36 does not contribute to net lipid absorption in the mouse small intestine (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained using a lower concentration of linoleic acid (400 μm) (data not shown). Similarly, analysis of radioactivity incorporation into the different lipid classes in the mucosa did not reveal a difference in TG synthesis between CD36−/− mice and controls (Fig. 1B). Cellular radioactivity was recovered mostly in TG 5 min after infusion, supporting physiological relevance of the experimental model used. To gain insight into how intestinal CD36 can influence the metabolic fate of LCFA in enterocytes, the effect of nutritional status on CD36 localization in the absorptive epithelium was explored by immunohistochemistry. In fasted mice, prominent staining was detected in the epithelial lining of villi (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, disappearance of this immunostaining was observed 4 h after an oral lipid load. The fact that no staining was observed in CD36−/− mice confirms signal specificity. Similar results were observed in fasted rats refed a standard laboratory chow containing 3% lipids (w/w). Interestingly, immunostaining persisted when fasted rats were fed a fat-free diet, demonstrating that CD36 removal from the apical side of enterocytes is a physiological event related to dietary lipids. To explore whether the disappearance of staining resulted from a translocation of CD36 from the apical plasma membrane to an intracellular pool as reported for scavenger receptor class B, type I (35Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.L. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. Gut. 2003; 52: 1424-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), CD36 content in jejunal mucosa homogenates and in purified BBM was assayed by sandwich ELISA. Fasted rats were subjected to an oral lipid load (3 ml of sunflower oil) to optimize the detection of changes in CD36 localization. To confirm lipid dependence, a set of rats was force-fed a sucrose solution providing a similar caloric load to the oil gavage. Activity of sucrase, a BBM enzyme marker, was determined to verify the efficiency of BBM purification. BBM fractions from fasted and force-fed rats exhibited equivalent enrichment and degree of purity and thus can be compared (Table 1).TABLE 1Characteristics of BBM fractions isolated from rat jejunal mucosaTotal sucrase activityEnrichment factor (BBM/homogenate)Efficiency of BBM extractionHomogenateBBMunits/min/mg of protein%Fasted controls0.79 ± 0.0911.53 ± 1.5214.82 ± 1.4313.44 ± 0.96Oil load0.50 ± 0.06 (NS)9.72 ± 0.85 (NS)20.17 ± 2.38 (NS)10.51 ± 1.72 (NS)Sucrose load0.66 ± 0.11 (NS)11.00 ± 0.42 (NS)16.67 ± 0.56 (NS)15.27 ± 0.53 (NS) Open table in a new tab Consistent with earlier data (Fig. 2B), a lipid load led to a 3-fold decrease of CD36 in jejunal BBM from rats 6 h after gavage (Fig. 3, A and C). Similar results were found when the data were expressed as a ratio of CD36 level to sucrase activity, demonstrating that it was BBM-related (Fig. 3B). In agreement with our earlier immunohistochemistry results, this effect was lipid-mediated because no change was observed in sucrose force-fed animals (Fig. 3, A and B). To explore whether lipid-mediated disappearance of CD36 from BBM is associated with intracellular transfer of the protein, CD36 was assayed in jejunal homogenates by both ELISA (Fig. 3, D and E) and Western blotting (Fig. 3F). Total CD36 content in mucosa of lipid force-fed rats remained low as compared with fasted controls. To further analyze this result, CD36 content in cytosolic and microsomal/endosomal fractions (105,000 × g supernatants and pellets, respectively) isolated from jejunal homogenates was assayed by ELISA. Cytosol CD36 content was 8-fold higher in lipid-fed than in fasted rats (2.47 ± 0.34% of total CD36 versus 0.29 ± 0.09%; p < 0.05, n = 3). However, it remained dramatically low and could not account for the 65% decrease in protein in BBM fractions and homogenates. Because no CD36 was found in microsomal/endosomal fractions (data not shown), these results strongly suggest that a major part of internalized intestinal CD36 is degraded 6 h after the lipid load. To study the kinetics of the lipid-mediated disappearance of CD36 protein, CD36 content in whole mucosa and in purified BBM was explored at various times following the oral lipid load in rats. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of CD36 in BBM dramatically decreased 1 h after force-feeding. This effect remained significant 12 h after the gavage, likely because of the high lipid load used in this experiment. The same pattern was observed when CD36 was assayed in the whole mucosa, which excludes quantitative CD36 accumulation in the intracellular compartment (Fig. 4B). Similar data were also obtained in the mouse (Fig. 4C). The lipid-mediated decrease in CD36 protein in jejunal mucosa is specific to this scavenger receptor because two other lipid-binding proteins, coexpressed with CD36 in differentiated enterocytes, were either unchanged (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein; data not shown) or increased (MTP) (Fig. 4D). The lipid-mediated drop in intestinal CD36 levels did not associate with a change in CD36 mRNA 1 h after the lipid load (Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, a significant decrease in CD36 mRNA levels occurred 4 h after the load in rats (Fig. 4E) and mice (Fig. 4F). Thus, two regulatory mechanisms seem to be involved in the decrease of intestinal CD36 content triggered by dietary lipids: an early post-translational mechanism followed by a more delayed transcriptional regulation. Polyubiquitination tags proteins targeted to proteasomes or lysosomes for subsequent degradation (36Miranda M. Sorkin A. Mol. Interv. 2007; 7: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To determine whether the lipid-mediated drop in CD36 levels measured in intestinal mucosa involves the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, jejunal CD36 from mice subjected or not to a lipid load was immunoprecipitated before immunoblotting with an antibody against ubiquitin. The CD36 signal obtained at 2 h was smeared, which is typical of polyubiquitination. This smearing was diminished at 4 h after the lipid load, likely reflecting degradation of the ubiquitinated protein (Fig. 5A). Therefore, dietary fat induces in"

The viral titer was >10(6) TCID(50)/mL by 6 days post infection when a MOI of 10(-5) was used at the initial infection. Two EV71 virus fractions were separated and detected when the harvested EV71 virus concentrate was purified by sucrose gradient zonal ultracentrifugation. The EV71 viral particles detected in the 24-28% sucrose fractions had an icosahedral structure 30-31 nm in diameter and had low viral infectivity and RNA content. Three major viral proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) were observed by SDS-PAGE. The EV71 viral particles detected in the fractions containing 35-38% sucrose were 33-35 nm in size, had high viral infectivity and RNA content, and were composed of four viral proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4), as shown by SDS-PAGE analyses. The two virus fractions were formalin-inactivated and induced high virus neutralizing antibody responses in mouse immunogenicity studies. Both mouse antisera recognized the immunodominant linear neutralization epitope of VP1 (residues 211-225).These results provide important information for cell-based EV71 vaccine development, particularly for the preparation of working standards for viral antigen quantification."

It is the largest and most complicated complex of the respiratory chain. In higher eukaryotes, it is composed of more than 40 subunits. It has a dual genetic origin: 5 to 9 subunits are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, and the others are encoded by the nuclear genome. This complex consists of two parts forming an L-shaped structure: the membrane arm forms the base of the L and is embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane, while the matrix arm forms the side of the L, bonded at one end of the membrane arm and perpendicularly protruding into the soluble matrix space. The matrix arm contains all the Fe-S clusters and the NADH oxidizing activity, while the membrane arm contains the ubiquinone-binding site.

The localization of the different subunits within the two arms of mitochondrial Complex I has been intensively investigated in the bovine enzyme.

On the other end, the membrane arm of plant Complex I differs from the one of mammals. The plant-specific subunits were all found in fragments of the membrane arm (26Klodmann J. Sunderhaus S. Nimtz M. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. Plant Cell. 2010; 22: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This behavior could be predicted for some plant-specific subunits by hydrophobicity analysis and had been described for the carbonic anhydrase-like proteins in Complex I for some time (24Sunderhaus S. Dudkina N.V. Jänsch L. Klodmann J. Heinemeyer J. Perales M. Zabaleta E. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6482-6488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because the membrane arm of plant Complex I is different from non-photosynthetic eukaryotes Complex I, efforts have to be made to understand its organization, function(s), and assembly. Complex I assembly in plants is not currently understood. Combining studies of maize, tobacco, or Arabidopsis mutants, a model for Complex I assembly in plant has been proposed (8Vogel R.O. Smeitink J.A. Nijtmans L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, this model was based on the very little direct experimental data on the internal organization of Complex I available at that time. Moreover, the number of mutants defective in Complex I described in higher plants is much smaller than the number of Complex I mutants available in mammals and fungi. In the model plant Arabidopsis, only a few mutants in nuclear encoded Complex I subunits have been described (28Meyer E.H. Tomaz T. Carroll A.J. Estavillo G. Delannoy E. Tanz S.K. Small I.D.

Recently, the study of genes involved in the expression of the mitochondrial genome has allowed the identification of new mutants impaired in Complex I (31Kühn K. Richter U. Meyer E.H.

Little is known regarding factors involved in the assembly of Complex I in plants. The only potential Complex I assembly factor described so far in plants is the l-galactonolactone dehydrogenase (GLDH) in Arabidopsis (39Pineau B. Layoune O. Danon A. De Paepe R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32500-32505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This enzyme is involved in ascorbate synthesis and has been identified in a smaller version of Complex I but not in the mature complex (23Heazlewood J.L. Howell K.A. Millar A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1604: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The actual role of GLDH in Complex I assembly is unknown. Altogether, this suggests a variation in Complex I assembly pathway between the animal and plant kingdoms. A forward genetic screen has been designed in Chlamydomonas to identify new assembly factors but to date only mutants in the PDSW subunit have been characterized (40Barbieri M.R. Larosa V. Nouet C. Subrahmanian N. Remacle C. Hamel P. Genetics. 2011; 10.1534/genetics.111.128827PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we have studied Arabidopsis mutants in Complex I subunits using Blue-Native PAGE to identify Complex I subcomplexes. The analysis of these subcomplexes provides new information on the composition and assembly of the membrane arm of Arabidopsis Complex I. The T-DNA insertion lines SALK_072274 (cal2), SALK_019040 (39kDa), and SALK_113376 (b12) were obtained from the seed stock center of the Arabidopsis Biological Resources Center (Ohio State University, available on-line). Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in a solution containing 70% (v/v) ethanol and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 5 min, washed first in 70% (v/v) ethanol, and then in 100% (v/v) ethanol, dried, and plated on 0.5× Gamborg B5 medium containing 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.7% (w/v) agar. Seeds were cold-stratified at 4 °C for 2 days and placed in a growth cabinet under a long-day photoperiod (16 h of light at 22 °C and 8 h of dark at 18 °C). Two-week-old seedlings were transferred on soil and grown in a growth chamber under a short-day photoperiod (8 h of light at 22 °C and 16 h of dark at 18 °C). Mitochondria were extracted from the aerial part of short-day-grown plants according to Meyer et al. (28Meyer E.H. Tomaz T. Carroll A.J. Estavillo G. Delannoy E. Tanz S.K. Small I.D. Pogson B.J. Millar A.H. Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 603-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins (20 μg) were solubilized in sample buffer (2% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were loaded on 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS gels. The separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) in transfer buffer (58 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.0375% SDS (w/v), 20% (v/v) methanol) using a semi-dry blotter (Hoeffer). Blue-Native PAGE (BN-PAGE) was performed according to the method described by Jänsch et al. (41Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins (100 μg) were solubilized with dodecylmaltoside (1% (w/v) final) in 75 μl of ACA buffer (750 mm aminocaproic acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and incubated 20 min at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged 10 min at 20,000 × g, and Serva Blue G (0.2% (v/v) final) was added to the supernatant. The samples were loaded onto a 4.5–16% (w/v) gradient gel. In-gel nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction activity staining was performed according to Zerbetto et al. (42Zerbetto E. Vergani L. Dabbeni-Sala F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2059-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The gel was washed three times for 5 min with distilled water and incubated in the reaction medium (0.14 mm NADH, 1.22 mm NBT, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). When the dark-blue stain was visible, the reaction was stopped by transferring the gel to 40% (v/v) methanol/10% (v/v) acetic acid. For the transfer onto the PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), the BN gels were washed in cathode buffer (50 mm Tricine, 15 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0) after migration. The complexes were then transferred under native conditions in cathode buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. After transfer, the membranes were stained for 5 min in staining buffer (30% (v/v) methanol, 7% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.005% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R250). The background was reduced by washing the membranes in 30% (v/v) methanol/7% (v/v) acetic acid. Native molecular weight markers (66–669 kDa, GE Healthcare) were used to estimate the size of complexes and subcomplexes. cDNAs encoding for the C-terminal part of the 18-kDa subunit (Glu37–Asn154), the C-terminal part of MWFE (Met22–Ser65), and NDU9 (Met1–Asp81) were cloned in the Gateway entry vector pDONR207 (Invitrogen) and subsequently transferred to the destination vector, pDEST15 (Invitrogen), which allows the N-terminal fusion of GST. These chimeric proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 pLysS cells and purified on GST-Sepharose. The purified proteins were injected into independent rabbits (4 doses of 250 μg per protein). The rabbits were bled after the third and fourth injections, and the sera were used unpurified in immunodetection experiments. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies at the dilution indicated in Table 1. Secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase were used, and the signals were detected by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). The images were recorded using a Luminescent Image Analyzer (LAS 100, Fuji, Japan).TABLE 1List of antibodies used in this studySubunitCalculated molecular massAntibodies typeDilution usedReferencekDaMWFE8Polyclonal1/1000This workNad623Polyclonal1/1000(33Koprivova A. des Francs-Small C.C.

Each pellet was resuspended in 88 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3. After adding 1 μl of 45 mm DTT, the samples were incubated 15 min at 50 °C. Then 1 μl of 0.1 m iodoacetamide was added, and the sample was further incubated for 15 min at 25 °C before the addition of 10 μl of trypsin 0.1 μg/μl. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 10% (v/v) TFA. The samples were dried down before the MS analysis. Samples were analyzed on a 6510 Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) with an HPLC Chip Cube source. The chip consisted of a 40-nl enrichment column (Zorbax 300SB-C18 5 μm) and a 150-mm separation column (Zorbax 300SB-C18 5 μm) driven by the Agilent Technologies 1100 series nano/capillary liquid chromatography system. Both systems were controlled by using MassHunter Workstation Data Acquisition for Q-TOF (version B.02.00, Build 1128.5, Patches 1–3, Agilent Technologies). Peptides resuspended in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid were loaded onto the trapping column at 4 μl/min in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid with the chip switched to enrichment and using the capillary pump. After five times of sample volume passed through the enrichment column the chip was then switched to separation, and peptides were eluted from the enrichment column and run through the separation column during a 1-h gradient (5% (v/v) acetonitrile/60% (v/v) acetonitrile) directly into the mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was run in positive ion mode, and MS scans run over a range of m/z 250–1400 and at 4 spectra per second. Precursor ions were selected for automatic MS/MS at an absolute threshold of 500, a relative threshold of 0.01, with a maximum of 3 precursors per cycle, and the active exclusion set at 2 spectra with a release after 3 min. Precursor charge-state selection and preference were set to 2+ and then 3+, and precursors were selected by charge then abundance. Resulting MS/MS spectra were opened in MassHunter Workstation Qualitative Analysis (version B.03.01, Build 3.1.346.14, Patch 3, Agilent Technologies), and MS/MS compounds were detected by “Find Auto MS/MS” using default settings. An exclusion list built from Mascot searches (as outlined below) was developed based on peptide (m/z) and charge (z). Isolation width was set to “narrow ∼ 1.3m/z,” precursor type was set to “Exclude,” retention time was set to “0” (to exclude the ions from the entire run), and Δm/z was set to “100 ppm.” This table was then loaded into MassHunter Workstation Data Acquisition for Q-TOF (version B.02.00, Build 1128.5, Patches 1–3, Agilent Technologies) software, and then the same sample was run again. Following the second run a new list of excluded peptides was added to the previous list, and the new list was loaded for the third run. Resulting mzdata.xml files were concatenated into a single mzdata.xml file using mzdataCombinator v1.0.6 (The University of Western Australia Centre of Excellence for Computational Systems Biology, available on-line) and were then searched against an in-house Arabidopsis database comprising ATH1.pep (release 9) from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) and the mitochondrial and plastid protein sets (TAIR). This sequence database contained a total of 33,621 protein sequences (representing 13,487,170 residues). Searches were conducted using the Mascot search engine version 2.2 (Matrix Science) utilizing error tolerances of ±100 ppm for MS and ±0.6 Da for MS/MS. “Max Missed Cleavages” was set to 1, the Oxidation (M), Carbamidomethyl (C), variable modifications, and the Instrument were set to ESI-Q-TOF, and the Peptide charges were set at 2+ and 3+. Results were filtered using “Standard scoring,” “Max. number of hits” was set to AUTO, “Significance threshold” was set at p < 0.05, and the “Ions score cut-off” was 32. The false discovery rate, calculated by automatically searching the data against a decoy database, for these datasets, using an ion score cut-off of 32, was 3.75%. Several smaller peptides with an ion score of 27–32 were included following manual inspection of spectra.

The gels were then stained with the Flamingo Fluorescent gel stain (Bio-Rad) for 3 h. The background was reduced by washing the gels in 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 10 min. After rinsing the gels in distillated water, they were scanned using a Typhoon Tryo scanner (GE Healthcare) using the settings for SYPRO Ruby stain detection. We generated antibodies against three Complex I subunits (18kDa, MWFE, and NDU9) and obtained antibodies raised against CA2, Nad9, Nad6, and the PSST subunit (see Table 1 for summary). In Western blot experiments on wild-type mitochondrial fractions, all the antibodies we used recognized a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to the calculated value (Fig. 1A and Table 1). We then separated mitochondrial protein complexes from wild-type plants on BN-PAGE, transferred the complexes under native conditions to PVDF membranes, and probed them with the antibodies against Complex I subunits.

https://openalex.org/W2001909617,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) receptors are endoplasmic reticulum membrane calcium channels that, upon activation, are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. While searching for novel mediators of IP(3) receptor processing, we discovered that RNF170, an uncharacterized RING domain-containing protein, associates rapidly with activated IP(3) receptors. RNF170 is predicted to have three membrane-spanning helices, is localized to the ER membrane, and possesses ubiquitin ligase activity. Depletion of endogenous RNF170 by RNA interference inhibited stimulus-induced IP(3) receptor ubiquitination, and degradation and overexpression of a catalytically inactive RNF170 mutant suppressed stimulus-induced IP(3) receptor processing. A substantial proportion of RNF170 is constitutively associated with the erlin1/2 (SPFH1/2) complex, which has been shown previously to bind to IP(3) receptors immediately after their activation. Depletion of RNF170 did not affect the binding of the erlin1/2 complex to stimulated IP(3) receptors, whereas erlin1/2 complex depletion inhibited RNF170 binding. These results suggest a model in which the erlin1/2 complex recruits RNF170 to activated IP(3) receptors where it mediates IP(3) receptor ubiquitination. Thus, RNF170 plays an essential role in IP(3) receptor processing via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1994001570,"An organism's survival depends crucially on its ability to detect and acquire nutriment. Attention circuits interact with cognitive and motivational systems to facilitate detection of salient sensory events in the environment. Here we show that the human attentional system is tuned to detect food targets among nonfood items. In two visual search experiments participants searched for discrepant food targets embedded in an array of nonfood distracters or vice versa. Detection times were faster when targets were food rather than nonfood items, and the detection advantage for food items showed a significant negative correlation with Body Mass Index (BMI). Also, eye tracking during searching within arrays of visually homogenous food and nonfood targets demonstrated that the BMI-contingent attentional bias was due to rapid capturing of the eyes by food items in individuals with low BMI. However, BMI was not associated with decision times after the discrepant food item was fixated. The results suggest that visual attention is biased towards foods, and that individual differences in energy consumption - as indexed by BMI - are associated with differential attentional effects related to foods. We speculate that such differences may constitute an important risk factor for gaining weight."
https://openalex.org/W2009392427,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) offer tremendous potential for not only treating neurological disorders but also for their ability to serve as vital reagents to model and investigate human disease. To further our understanding of a key protein involved in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis, we stably overexpressed amyloid precursor protein (APP) in hESCs. Remarkably, we found that APP overexpression in hESCs caused a rapid and robust differentiation of pluripotent stem cells toward a neural fate. Despite maintenance in standard hESC media, up to 80% of cells expressed the neural stem cell marker nestin, and 65% exhibited the more mature neural marker β-3 tubulin within just 5 days of passaging. To elucidate the mechanism underlying the effects of APP on neural differentiation, we examined the proteolysis of APP and performed both gain of function and loss of function experiments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the N-terminal secreted soluble forms of APP (in particular sAPPβ) robustly drive neural differentiation of hESCs. Our findings not only reveal a novel and intriguing role for APP in neural lineage commitment but also identify a straightforward and rapid approach to generate large numbers of neurons from human embryonic stem cells. These novel APP-hESC lines represent a valuable tool to investigate the potential role of APP in development and neurodegeneration and allow for insights into physiological functions of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1977256372,"Background The emergence of artemisinin resistance has raised concerns that the most potent antimalarial drug may be under threat. The currently recommended daily dose of artesunate (AS) is 4 mg/kg, and is administered for 3 days together with a partner antimalarial drug. This study investigated the impact of different AS doses on clinical and parasitological responses in malaria patients from an area of known artemisinin resistance in western Cambodia. Methods Adult patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomized into one of three 7-day AS monotherapy regimens: 2, 4 or 6 mg/kg/day (total dose 14, 28 and 42 mg/kg). Clinical, parasitological, pharmacokinetic and in vitro drug sensitivity data was collected over a 7-day inpatient period and during weekly follow-up to 42 days. Results 143 patients were enrolled (n = 75, 40 and 28 to receive AS 2, 4 and 6 mg/kg/day respectively). Cure rates were high in all treatment groups at 42 days despite almost half the patients remaining parasitemic on Day 3. There was no impact of increasing AS dose on median parasite clearance times, median parasite clearance rates or on the proportion of patients remaining parasitemic on Day 3. However at the lowest dose used (2 mg/kg/d) patients with parasitemia >10,000/µL had longer median (IQR) parasite clearance times than those with parasitemia <10,000/µL (63 (48–75) vs. 84 (66–96) hours, p<0.0001). 19% of patients in the high-dose arm developed neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1.0×109/L) by Day 14 and resulted in the arm being halted early. Conclusion There is no pharmacodynamic benefit of increasing the daily dose of AS (4mg/kg) currently recommended for short-course combination treatment of uncomplicated malaria, even in regions with emerging artemisinin resistance, as long as the partner drug retains high efficacy.

Most multi-transgenic pigs have been produced by complex and time-consuming breeding programs using multiple single-transgenic pigs. This study explored the feasibility of producing multi-transgenic pigs using the viral 2A peptide in the light of previous research indicating that it can be utilized for multi-gene transfer in gene therapy and somatic cell reprogramming. A 2A peptide-based double-promoter expression vector that mediated the expression of four fluorescent proteins was constructed and transfected into primary porcine fetal fibroblasts. Cell colonies (54.3%) formed under G418 selection co-expressed the four fluorescent proteins at uniformly high levels. The reconstructed embryos, which were obtained by somatic cell nuclear transfer and confirmed to express the four fluorescent proteins evenly, were transplanted into seven recipient gilts. Eleven piglets were delivered by two gilts, and seven of them co-expressed the four fluorescent proteins at equivalently high levels in various tissues. The fluorescence intensities were directly observed at the nose, hoof and tongue using goggles. The results suggest that the strategy of combining the 2A peptide and double promoters efficiently mediates the co-expression of the four fluorescent proteins in pigs and is hence a promising methodology to generate multi-transgenic pigs by a single nuclear transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2401701515,"Background The language faculty is probably the most distinctive feature of our species, and endows us with a unique ability to exchange highly structured information. In written language, information is encoded by the concatenation of basic symbols under grammatical and semantic constraints. As is also the case in other natural information carriers, the resulting symbolic sequences show a delicate balance between order and disorder. That balance is determined by the interplay between the diversity of symbols and by their specific ordering in the sequences. Here we used entropy to quantify the contribution of different organizational levels to the overall statistical structure of language. Methodology/Principal Findings We computed a relative entropy measure to quantify the degree of ordering in word sequences from languages belonging to several linguistic families. While a direct estimation of the overall entropy of language yielded values that varied for the different families considered, the relative entropy quantifying word ordering presented an almost constant value for all those families. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that despite the differences in the structure and vocabulary of the languages analyzed, the impact of word ordering in the structure of language is a statistical linguistic universal."

Little is known, however, about the NAPs that are critical to PKC-induced NMDAR trafficking. Here, we showed that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) could be a NAP that mediates the potentiation of NMDAR trafficking by PKC. PKC activation promoted the level of autophosphorylated CaMKII and increased association with NMDARs, accompanied by functional NMDAR insertion, at postsynaptic sites. This potentiation, along with PKC-induced long term potentiation of the AMPA receptor-mediated response, was abolished by CaMKII antagonist or by disturbing the interaction between CaMKII and NR2A or NR2B. Further mutual occlusion experiments demonstrated that PKC and CaMKII share a common signaling pathway in the potentiation of NMDAR trafficking and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. Our results revealed that PKC promotes NMDA receptor trafficking and induces synaptic plasticity through indirectly triggering CaMKII autophosphorylation and subsequent increased association with NMDARs.

https://openalex.org/W2018577534,"Despite having single stranded DNA genomes that are replicated by host DNA polymerases, viruses in the family Geminiviridae are apparently evolving as rapidly as some RNA viruses. The observed substitution rates of geminiviruses in the genera Begomovirus and Mastrevirus are so high that the entire family could conceivably have originated less than a million years ago (MYA). However, the existence of geminivirus related DNA (GRD) integrated within the genomes of various Nicotiana species suggests that the geminiviruses probably originated >10 MYA. Some have even suggested that a distinct New-World (NW) lineage of begomoviruses may have arisen following the separation by continental drift of African and American proto-begomoviruses ∼110 MYA. We evaluate these various geminivirus origin hypotheses using Bayesian coalescent-based approaches to date firstly the Nicotiana GRD integration events, and then the divergence of the NW and Old-World (OW) begomoviruses. Besides rejecting the possibility of a<2 MYA OW-NW begomovirus split, we could also discount that it may have occurred concomitantly with the breakup of Gondwanaland 110 MYA. Although we could only confidently narrow the date of the split down to between 2 and 80 MYA, the most plausible (and best supported) date for the split is between 20 and 30 MYA – a time when global cooling ended the dispersal of temperate species between Asia and North America via the Beringian land bridge."
https://openalex.org/W2031573548,"Massively parallel sequencing technology now provides the opportunity to sample the transcriptome of a given tissue comprehensively. Transcripts at only a few copies per cell are readily detectable, allowing the discovery of low abundance viral and bacterial transcripts in human tissue samples. Here we describe an approach for mining large sequence data sets for the presence of microbial sequences. Further, we demonstrate the sensitivity of this approach by sequencing human RNA-seq libraries spiked with decreasing amounts of an RNA-virus. At a modest depth of sequencing, viral transcripts can be detected at frequencies less than 1 in 1,000,000. With current sequencing platforms approaching outputs of one billion reads per run, this is a highly sensitive method for detecting putative infectious agents associated with human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1966111573,"The study of life history variation is central to the evolutionary theory. In many ectothermic lineages, including lizards, life history traits are plastic and relate to several sources of variation including body size, which is both a factor and a life history trait likely to modulate reproductive parameters. Larger species within a lineage, for example tend to be more fecund and have larger clutch size, but clutch size may also be influenced by climate, independently of body size. Thus, the study of climatic effects on lizard fecundity is mandatory on the current scenario of global climatic change. We asked how body and clutch size have responded to climate through time in a group of tropical lizards, the Tropidurinae, and how these two variables relate to each other. We used both traditional and phylogenetic comparative methods. Body and clutch size are variable within Tropidurinae, and both traits are influenced by phylogenetic position. Across the lineage, species which evolved larger size produce more eggs and neither trait is influenced by temperature components. A climatic component of precipitation, however, relates to larger female body size, and therefore seems to exert an indirect relationship on clutch size. This effect of precipitation on body size is likely a correlate of primary production. A decrease in fecundity is expected for Tropidurinae species on continental landmasses, which are predicted to undergo a decrease in summer rainfall."
https://openalex.org/W2058080202,"Human and porcine coagulation factor VIII (fVIII) display a biosynthetic efficiency differential that is being exploited for the development of new protein and gene transfer-based therapies for hemophilia A. The cellular and/or molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this phenomenon have yet to be uncovered, although it has been temporally localized to post-translational biosynthetic steps. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular adaptation to structurally distinct (e.g. misfolded) or excess protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and is known to be induced by heterologous expression of recombinant human fVIII. Therefore, it is plausible that the biosynthetic differential between human and porcine fVIII results from differential UPR activation. In the current study, UPR induction was examined in the context of ongoing fVIII expression. UPR activation was greater during human fVIII expression when compared with porcine fVIII expression as determined by ER response element (ERSE)-luciferase reporter activity, X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing, and immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP) up-regulation. Immunofluorescence microscopy of fVIII expressing cells revealed that human fVIII was notably absent in the Golgi apparatus, confirming that endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport is rate-limiting. In contrast, a significant proportion of porcine fVIII was localized to the Golgi indicating efficient transit through the secretory pathway. Overexpression of BiP, an integral UPR protein, reduced the secretion of human fVIII by 50%, but had no effect on porcine fVIII biosynthesis. In contrast, expression of BiP shRNA increased human fVIII expression levels. The current data support the model of differential engagement of UPR by human and porcine fVIII as a non-traditional mechanism for regulation of gene product biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2036390833,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors that recognize microbial ligands and subsequently trigger intracellular signaling pathways involving transcription factors such as NFκB and MAPKs such as p38. TLR signaling can regulate both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events leading to altered gene expression and thus appropriate immune responses. The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family comprises four kinases that regulate TLR signaling. However, the role of IRAK-2 has remained unclear, especially in human cells. Recent studies using cells from in-bred Irak2−/− mice showed that murine IRAK-2 was not required for early TLR signaling events but had a role in delayed NFκB activation and in cytokine production. IRAK-2 in mice has four splice variants, two of which are inhibitory, whereas human IRAK-2 has no splice variants. Thus IRAK-2 in mice and humans may function differently, and therefore we analyzed the role of IRAK-2 in TLR responses in primary human cells. siRNA knockdown of IRAK-2 expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed a role for human IRAK-2 in both TLR4- and TLR8-mediated early NFκB and p38 MAPK activation and in induction of TNF mRNA. These data conflict with findings from the in-bred Irak2−/− mice but concur with what has been seen in wild-derived mice for TLR2. Moreover, human IRAK-2 was required for regulating MyD88-dependent TNFα mRNA stability via the TNF 3′UTR.

The innate immune system detects the presence of pathogens through a variety of pattern-recognition receptors, which recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns on invading pathogens (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar). One important family of such receptors is the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 2The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorAct Dactinomycin DAREadenine- and uridine-rich elementDDdeath domainHEKhuman embryonic kidneyIκBinhibitor of NFκBIKKIκB kinaseIRAKinterleukin-1 receptor-associated kinaseMalMyD88-adaptor likeMyD88myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88NFκBnuclear factor κBPBMCperipheral blood mononuclear cellTIRToll/IL-1RTRAFtumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factorTRIFTIR domain containing adaptor protein-inducing IFN-βE3ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligaseAbantibody. of which there are 10 members in the human and 13 members in the mouse (2Takeuchi O. Akira S. Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar). For example, the pathogen-associated molecular pattern for TLR4 is LPS, TLR9 responds to CpG DNA, whereas TLR7 and TLR8 both recognize viral single strand RNA and synthetic imidazoquinoline-like molecules (3Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S.S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). TLRs are transmembrane proteins, which contain a cytoplasmic TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domain and leucine-rich repeats located extracellularly (2Takeuchi O. Akira S. Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar). Detection of a pathogen-associated molecular pattern by a TLR results in receptor dimerization, which allows recruitment of the TIR-domain-containing adaptor proteins: MyD88 is required for all TLR signaling pathways except for TLR3 and MyD88-independent TLR4 pathway (4Takeuchi O. Akira S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar): MyD88-adaptor-like (Mal) is required for TLR2 and TLR4 signaling to recruit MyD88 to the receptor complex (5Fitzgerald K.A.

Nature. 2001; 413: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar); TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF) is required for TLR3 signaling and for a MyD88-independent TLR4 pathway (6Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat.

Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The formation of these receptor-adaptor complexes results in the activation of various signaling pathways of the innate axis of the immune response. These signaling pathways can lead to the activation of MAPKs, such as p38 and JNK, and of transcription factors such as NFκB and IFN regulatory factors (2Takeuchi O. Akira S. Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar). NFκB is required for the transcription of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF and of chemokines such as IL-8. Similarly, p38 activation results in increased expression of cytokines and chemokines due to direct phosphorylation of transcription factors and through increased stability and enhanced translation of mRNAs (8Ashwell J.D.

The serine/threonine interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are recruited to the TLR-adaptor complexes and control downstream signaling to MAPKs and transcription factors (9Flannery S. Bowie A.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 80: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), for example through the activation of the E3 ligase activity of TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which is essential for some signaling events (10Walsh M.C. Kim G.K. Maurizio P.L. Moinar E.E. Choi Y. PloS ONE. 2008; 3: e4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Structurally, IRAK family members share similar domains. They contain a N-terminal death domain (DD), a ProST domain, a central conserved kinase domain, and, apart from IRAK-4, a C-terminal domain (9Flannery S. Bowie A.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2010; 80: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 have been characteristically described as active kinase family members (11Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 12Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), whereas IRAK-M, a negative regulator, is thought to have no kinase activity (13Shen S.H. Slightom J.L. Smithies O. Cell. 1981; 26: 191-203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). IRAK-2, which was always assumed to be a pseudokinase due to the absence of an aspartate residue in the kinase domain, has recently been described as having kinase activity (14Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Upon TLR stimulation, IRAK-4 interacts with both MyD88 and IRAK-2 via homotypic DD interactions, to form a complex proximal to the receptor termed the Myddosome (15Lin S.C. Lo Y.C. Wu H. Nature. 2010; 465: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). IRAK-4 is widely regarded as the most critical IRAK in MyD88-dependent TLR pathways, because IRAK-4 knock-out mice show impaired signaling to MAPKs and transcription factors for all TLR signaling pathways except TLR3 (16Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C.

In contrast to IRAK-4, deletion of IRAK-1 attenuates, but does not eliminate, TLR-induced NFκB, MAPK activation, and gene induction (19Thomas J.A. Allen J.L. Tsen M. Dubnicoff T. Danao J. Liao X.C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 7296-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The role of IRAK-2 has been the most enigmatic of the family. Evidence of a role for IRAK-2 in TLR signaling was revealed though studies of the vaccinia virus protein A52 (24Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A52, shown to be important for virus virulence (24Harte M.T. Haga I.R. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P.C. Bartlett N.W. Smith G.L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), inhibited all TLR pathways to NFκB through interacting with IRAK-2 (25Maloney G. Schröder M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30838-30844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This viral targeting of IRAK-2 and not IRAK-1 by A52 to disrupt TLR-induced NFκB activation (26Keating S.E. Maloney G.M. Moran E.M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) suggested a predominant role for IRAK-2 in NFκB activation. Consistent with this, knockdown of IRAK-2 expression by siRNA in a human cell line inhibited TLR3-, TLR4-, and TLR8-induced NFκB-dependent reporter gene activity (26Keating S.E. Maloney G.M. Moran E.M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The recent generation of Irak2 knock-out mice showed that Irak2−/− mice were highly resistant to LPS- and CpG-induced septic shock (14Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), whereas a previous study showed that the difference in mortality between wild-type and Irak1−/− mice was only subtle (20Swantek J.L. Tsen M.F. Cobb M.H. Thomas J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 15: 4301-4306Crossref Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interestingly, even though the Irak2−/− mice were resistant to TLR-induced septic shock, in cells derived from these mice early TLR2 signaling events were intact, with IRAK-2 only being required for late NFκB activation and not MAPK activation (14Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Using independently generated Irak2−/−mice, another group also showed for TLR7 that only late NFκB activation was impaired, whereas both early and late NFκB activation were normal for TLR4 stimulation (27Wan Y. Xiao H. Affolter J. Kim T.W. Bulek K. Chaudhuri S. Carlson D. Hamilton T. Mazumder B. Stark G.R. Thomas J. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10367-10375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus currently there are contradictory findings on the role of IRAK-2 in NFκB and p38 MAPK in a human cell line compared with murine cells from in-bred knock-out mice (28Wan Y. Kim T.W. Yu M. Zhou H. Yamashita M. Kang Z. Yin W. Wang J. Thomas J. Sen G.C. Stark G.R. Li X. J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nothing is known about the role of human IRAK-2 in post-transcriptional regulation. Of note, IRAK-2 in mice has four splice variants, two of which are inhibitory, whereas human IRAK-2 has no splice variants (29Hardy M.P. O'Neill L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27699-27708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus IRAK-2 in mice and humans may function differently. Therefore to further elucidate and clarify the role of IRAK-2 in TLR signaling in the human system, we investigated the function of IRAK-2 in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional TLR responses in primary human cells. The results show that IRAK-2 is essential for TLR4- and TLR8-induced cytokine and chemokine mRNA and protein production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In contrast to what was seen in murine cells (14Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K. Kumagai Y. Saitoh T. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 27Wan Y. Xiao H. Affolter J. Kim T.W. Bulek K. Chaudhuri S. Carlson D. Hamilton T. Mazumder B. Stark G.R. Thomas J. Li X. J.

Furthermore, human IRAK-2 controlled a MyD88-dependent TLR pathway to TNFα mRNA stability via the TNF 3′UTR. Thus we have revealed an essential role for IRAK-2 for both transcriptional and post-transcriptional TLR responses in primary human cells, while the particular role of IRAK-2 in regulating gene induction of TNFα suggests that IRAK-2 is a critical pro-inflammatory kinase in humans. Human PBMCs from healthy volunteers were provided by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. PBMCs were purified from the buffy coat of heparinized whole blood preparations from healthy volunteers by density centrifugation on low-endotoxin Ficoll-Hypaque. Isolated PBMCs were washed three times in sterile PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm NaH2PO4), counted, and seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete RPMI 1640 medium.

The IL-8 3′UTR-luciferase reporter construct was a gift from Peter King (Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Centre, Birmingham, AL). Plasmids expressing K237A IRAK-2 and E528A IRAK-2 were generated in-house by site-directed mutagenesis. The TRAF6 expression plasmids FLAG-TRAF6 and FLAG-TRAF domain (dominant-negative TRAF6 amino acids 289–522) were provided by Tularik Inc., and C70A TRAF6 and K124R TRAF6 were provided by Justin McCarthy (University College Cork, Ireland).

CL075 (3M002) a thiazoloquinolone derivative, was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). HEK293_R1 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml and 24 h later were transfected with 60 ng of either TNF, IL-8, or β-actin 3′UTR reporter constructs. The TK-Renilla construct (20 ng) was included to normalize the data for transfection efficiency. Where indicated, 5–25 ng of expression plasmids for MyD88, IRAK-2, or TRAF6 expression plasmids were co-transfected with reporters. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant at 230 ng by the addition of pcDNA3.1. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h following transfection. All transfections were done in triplicate, and data are expressed as fold induction (mean ± S.D.) relative to control levels for a representative experiment of a minimum of three separate experiments. siRNA duplexes targeting the IRAK2 gene targeted the sequence 5′-CCAGATCATCCTGAACTGGAA-3′, as previously described (26Keating S.E.

PBMCs were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml (200 μl per well) for cytokine analysis in 96-well plates and transfected with siRNA 1 h later. 5 pmol of siRNA diluted in serum-free RPMI was used per transfection. Each well received a solution containing 0.2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), 0.5 μl siRNA, and 49.3 μl of serum-free medium per transfection. An identical second transfection of siRNA with Lipofectamine 2000 was carried out 24 h later. After a further 24 h, cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml LPS or 2.5 μg/ml CL075 and finally harvested 24 h later. For detection of IκBα or p-p38, PBMCs were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/ml in 6-well plates (2 ml per well). 50 pmol of siRNA diluted in serum-free RPMI and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 were used per transfection, using a protocol identical to that used for the 96-well plates. To examine the effect of IRAK-2 siRNA on MyD88-induced TNFα 3′UTR or the IL-8 3′UTR, HEK_293 R1 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml (200 μl per well). Cells were transfected with 5 pmol of siRNA using 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 24 h later, followed by transfection with MyD88 and either TNFα 3′UTR, IL-8 3′UTR, or β-actin 3′UTR plasmids and a second siRNA transfection 24 h later. After a further 24 h, cells were harvested and lysed, and the relative luciferase activity was measured. For detection of IκBα, p-p38, and endogenous IRAK-2, cells were harvested and subjected to centrifugation, the pellet was lysed in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50 mm DTT), lysates were boiled for 5 min and then subjected to 2 min sonication. Lysate (20 μl) was loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto an Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For analysis of IκBα degradation and p38 phosphorylation, membranes were probed with either a mouse mAb against IκBα (a gift from Prof. R. Hay, Dundee University, Dundee, UK) or rabbit anti-p38-phosphospecific Ab (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). For detection of endogenous IRAK-2, a rabbit pAb was generated using the following IRAK-2 peptide as an antigen: (NHCOCH3) CADVYRGHRHGKPFVFK (CONH2) (Inbiolabs, Estonia). To control for protein loading, the membranes were reprobed with anti-β-actin Ab (Sigma-Aldrich) or rabbit anti-p38 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology). PBMCs were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in a 96-well plate (200 μl/well) 1 h prior to siRNA treatment. The supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-8 or TNFα by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). PBMCs were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml in 12-well plates (1 ml per well). Cells were transfected 1 h later with 25 pmol of siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000. Each well received a solution containing 1 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, 2.5 μl of siRNA, and 246.5 μl of serum-free medium per transfection Cells were transfected with an identical siRNA treatment 24 h later. After another 24 h, cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml LPS or 2.5 μg/ml CL075 for the indicated times. Cells were harvested, and RNA was isolated using High Pure Isolation kits from Roche Applied Science (Burgess Hill, UK). Induction of mRNA in PBMCs was assayed by quantitative real-time PCR using GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega) and normalized to β-actin mRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. To examine the stability of mRNA, PBMCs were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were transfected with siRNA using 0.2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 per transfection and subsequently transfected with siRNA again 24 h later. After another 24 h, cells were stimulated with either 100 ng/ml LPS or 2.5 μg/ml CL075 for 2 h followed by treatment of 5 μg/ml Actinomycin D (Act D, Sigma-Aldrich) and either LPS or CL075. Cells were harvested, and RNA analysis was carried out as described above. The primers used were as follows: TNFα, 5′-GAA CCC CGA GTG ACA AGC CTG-3′ and 5′-TCA GCT CCA CGC CAT TTG CCA-3′; IL8, 5′-CTC TGT GTG AAG GTG CAG TTT TG-3′ and 5′-AAG CTT TAC AAT AAT TTC TGT GGT-3′; and β-actin, 5′-CGC GAG AAG ATG ACC CAG ATC-3′ and 5′-GCC AGA GGC GT CAG GGA TA-3′. Statistical analysis was carried out using a paired Student's t test. We have previously showed that knockdown of IRAK-2 expression by siRNA inhibited human TLR4- and TLR8-dependent NFκB reporter gene activity in HEK293 cells (26Keating S.E. Maloney G.M. Moran E.M. Bowie A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, reported data from murine Irak2−/− cells has shown that IRAK-2 is dispensable for early NFκB and p38 MAPK activation (14Kawagoe T. Sato S. Matsushita K. Kato H. Matsui K.

Thus, here we wanted to assess the requirement for human IRAK-2 in early TLR signaling in the more physiological setting of primary human PBMCs. Firstly the efficacy of siRNA oligonucleotides that target IRAK2 in PBMCs was confirmed by examining their effect on endogenous IRAK-2 protein levels. Fig. 1A shows that endogenous IRAK-2 protein levels were almost undetectable in PBMCs treated with IRAK-2 siRNA, relative to the control siRNA-treated samples, either in the presence or absence of stimulation with CL075 (3M002). CL075 is a thiazoloquinolone derivative agonist of TLR7 and TLR8, which is known to preferentially activate TLR8 in PBMCs (3Gorden K.B. Gorski K.S. Gibson S.J. Kedl R.M. Kieper W.C. Qiu X. Tomai M.A. Alkan S.S. Vasilakos J.P. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1259-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). PBMCs are known to respond to both LPS and CL075, via TLR4 and TLR8, respectively, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines (30Ablasser A. Poeck H. Anz D. Berger M. Schlee M. Kim S. Bourquin C. Goutagny N. Jiang Z. Fitzgerald K.A. Rothenfusser S. Endres S. Hartmann G. Hornung V. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6824-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When PBMCs were treated with CL075, the production of IL-8 in response to CL075 was reduced to basal levels in the cells treated with IRAK-2 siRNA relative to those treated with the control siRNA (Fig. 1B). CL075-induced TNFα production was also significantly inhibited in PBMCs treated with IRAK-2 siRNA compared with control siRNA-treated samples (Fig. 1C), thus demonstrating for the first time to our knowledge a role for IRAK-2 in TLR8 responses in primary human cells. IRAK-2 was also required for LPS/TLR4-mediated IL-8 production in PBMCs (Fig. 1D). Furthermore TLR4-mediated TNFα release from PBMCs was also significantly inhibited by treatment of cells with IRAK-2 siRNA (Fig. 1E). In addition, both CL075- and LPS-induced IL-6 production was significantly reduced in PBMCs (data not shown). Thus IRAK-2 has a critical role in cytokine production in primary human cells, for both endosomal (TLR8) and non-endosomal (TLR4) TLR pathways. Our data from primary human cells showed a requirement for IRAK-2 in TLR-induced cytokine induction. Previous work showed that TLR-dependent cytokine induction from macrophages from in-bred Irak2−/− mice was also impaired, although NFκB and MAPK activation were largely unaffected (14Kawagoe T.

Kim T.W. Bulek K. Chaudhuri S. Carlson D. Hamilton T. Mazumder B. Stark G.R. Thomas J. Li X. J. Biol.

J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, in macrophages from a wild-derived mouse strain, RNA interference targeting Irak2 did inhibit TLR-induced NFκB and p38 MAPK activation (31Conner J.R. Smirnova I.I. Poltorak A. J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 1615-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus the mechanistic basis for the requirement for IRAK-2 for cytokine induction in the more physiological setting of primary human cells was not obvious, and therefore we next explored the role of IRAK-2 in TLR-induced signaling pathways in PBMCs. Treatment of PBMCs with CL075 led to NFκB activation within 5 min of stimulation, as measured by degradation of the inhibitory NFκB subunit, IκBα (Fig. 2A). When cells were pretreated with IRAK-2 siRNA, TLR8-dependent degradation of IκBα was prevented at every time point tested (5–30 min) compared with cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 2A). Thus this demonstrated for the first time a role for IRAK-2 in early TLR8-induced NFκB activation in primary human cells, which is not the case for TLR7 in murine cells (27Wan Y. Xiao H. Affolter J. Kim T.W. Bulek K. Chaudhuri S. Carlson D. Hamilton T. Mazumder B. Stark G.R. Thomas J. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10367-10375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A role for IRAK-2 in TLR4-mediated NFκB activation was also observed in PBMCs, because IRAK-2 siRNA caused reduced IκBα degradation after 20 or 30 min LPS stimulation, compared with cells treated with control siRNA (Fig 2B). Again, this contrasts with what was observed in macrophages from mice lacking IRAK-2, where IRAK-2 had no role in either early or late TLR4-induced NFκB activation (28Wan Y. Kim T.W. Yu M. Zhou H. Yamashita M. Kang Z. Yin W. Wang J. Thomas J. Sen G.C. Stark G.R. Li X. J. Immunol. 2011; 186: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We next determined whether IRAK-2 was involved in p38 MAPK activation in TLR-stimulated primary human cells. Upon stimulation of PBMCs with LPS or CL075 we detected phosphorylation of p38 after 5 min, sustained until at least 20 min (Fig. 2, C and D). Crucially, when PBM"

Currently, we have limited understanding of S. aureus-derived mechanisms contributing to bacterial pathogenesis and host inflammation during staphylococcal disease. Herein, we characterize an influential role for the saeR/S two-component gene regulatory system in mediating cytokine induction using mouse models of S. aureus pathogenesis. Invasive S. aureus infection induced the production of localized and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-2. In contrast, mice infected with an isogenic saeR/S deletion mutant demonstrated significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Additionally, secreted factors influenced by saeR/S elicited pro-inflammatory cytokines in human blood ex vivo. Our study further demonstrated robust saeR/S-mediated IFN-γproduction during both invasive and subcutaneous skin infections. Results also indicated a critical role for saeR/S in promoting bacterial survival and enhancing host mortality during S. aureus peritonitis. Taken together, this study provides insight into specific mechanisms used by S. aureus during staphylococcal disease and characterizes a relationship between a bacterial global regulator of virulence and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators."

However, the precise mechanism by which α7nAChR-activated STAT3 inhibits inflammatory response remains unclear.The inflammatory response has been reported to be modulated by the post-transcriptional control (12Stoecklin G.

However, in U937 cells transiently transfected with dominant negative STAT3 (10Minegishi Y. Saito M. Tsuchiya S. Tsuge I. Takada H. Hara T. Kawamura N. Ariga T. Pasic S. Stojkovic O. Metin A.

Nicotine increases the decay of TNF-α mRNA and decreases the expression of luciferase reporter containing TNF-α 3′-UTR. Down-regulation of TTP by siRNA treatment decreases the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine on U937 cells. Our results show that nicotine-activated STAT3 induces the expression of TTP and, in turn, TTP plays key roles in nicotine-induced anti-inflammatory effect through destabilization of TNF-α transcripts.DISCUSSIONNicotine has been found to inhibit TNF-α production from LPS-stimulated macrophages (4Wang H.

In this study, we provide evidence that nicotine exerts its inhibitory effects through STAT3-dependent TTP expression: nicotine-STAT3 signaling down-regulates TNF-α mRNA stability in an TNF-α 3′-UTR-dependent manner; nicotine increases the STAT3 binding to the TTP promoter, the TTP promoter activity and the expression of TTP; down-regulation of STAT3 by siRNA or dnSTAT3 mutants with reduced DNA-binding activity abolishes the nicotine induction of TTP expression and inhibitory effect; siRNAs to TTP significantly restore the nicotine-mediated inhibition in TNF-α production and TNF-α-UTR Luc activity. These results indicate that the binding of nicotine-activated STAT3 to the TTP promoter and induction of TTP expression is important for nicotine-induced down-regulation of TNF-α production in U937 cells. These results are consistent with those of previous reports suggesting that the DNA binding activity of STAT3 is required for the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine on macrophages (7de Jonge W.J. van der Zanden E.P.

Even though we did not directly compare the two pathways, we hypothesize that the nicotine-STAT3 signaling pathway may mimics IL-10-STAT3 pathways, or vice versa, to suppress macrophage activity.It has been reported that stimulation with LPS results in a strong and rapid induction of TTP mRNA in mouse macrophages (34Mahtani K.R.

Consistent with previous study, we found that LPS alone increased TTP expression level at 4 h post-treatment in human macrophages, but its effect was mild. Even though we analyzed the TTP expression at early time (1, 2, and 3 h) after LPS stimulation, we could not detect strong induction of TTP expression (data not shown). Even though LPS increases the expression level of TTP, it also activates p38 MAPK, which results in inactivation of TTP and allows the stabilization of ARE-containing TNF-α mRNA (36Chrestensen C.A. Schroeder M.J. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Pelo J.W. Worthington M.T. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol.

Lang R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 2991-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and inhibit TNF-α production from LPS-stimulated macrophages through induction of a STAT3-dependent increase of TTP expression and decrease of p38 MAPK activity (30Schaljo B.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that nicotine decreased the TNF-α production from LPS-stimulated human macrophages via STAT3-dependent induction of TTP expression. Interestingly, nicotine is known to increase the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (39Aicher A. Heeschen C. Mohaupt M. Cooke J.P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and, in our study, nicotine did not reduce the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (data not shown), demonstrating that decrease in the p38 MAPK activity may not be essential for the inhibitory effect of nicotine on TNF-α expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Consistent with this hypothesis, TTP is reported to induce the decay of TNF-α mRNA in the presence of p38 MAPK activity (30Schaljo B. Kratochvill F. Gratz N. Sadzak I. Sauer I. Hammer M. Vogl C. Strobl B. Müller M. Blackshear P.J. Poli V. Lang R. Murray P.J. Kovarik P. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and we found that TTP mediates the inhibitory effect of nicotine. Collectively, our results suggest the possibility that, even though the nicotine-STAT3 signaling pathway resembles IL-10-STAT3 pathways in induction of TTP expression, they seem to differ in regulation of p38 MAPK activity. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms by which nicotine-STAT3 signaling pathway supports TTP to destabilize the TNF-α mRNA in the presence of p38 MAPK activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages.We found a discrepancy between levels of the TNF-α transcripts and protein in nicotine-treated U937 cells: Whereas nicotine induced strong destabilization of TNF-α mRNA and strong down-regulation of TNF-α mRNA level, it induced mild decrease in TNF-α level. Our expectation was that there would be good correlation between the expression levels of TNF-α mRNA and protein. It has been reported that TNF-α is highly stable at neutral pH and at 37 °C (40Haranaka K. Carswell E.A. Williamson B.D. Prendergast J.S. Satomi N. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consistent with the previous reports, we found that TNF-α in the supernatant is stable in the presence of nicotine, which may be a possible explanation for the discrepancy.In conclusion, we have shown that nicotine-STAT3 signaling induces the expression of TTP in macrophages and thus, down-regulates TNF-α production by destabilizing its transcripts. Because an excess of TNF-α is involved in many inflammatory diseases, the inhibition of TNF-α production through the modulation of nicotine-STAT3-TTP signaling pathway may have wide-ranging clinical implications.

In this study, we provide evidence that nicotine exerts its inhibitory effects through STAT3-dependent TTP expression: nicotine-STAT3 signaling down-regulates TNF-α mRNA stability in an TNF-α 3′-UTR-dependent manner; nicotine increases the STAT3 binding to the TTP promoter, the TTP promoter activity and the expression of TTP; down-regulation of STAT3 by siRNA or dnSTAT3 mutants with reduced DNA-binding activity abolishes the nicotine induction of TTP expression and inhibitory effect; siRNAs to TTP significantly restore the nicotine-mediated inhibition in TNF-α production and TNF-α-UTR Luc activity. These results indicate that the binding of nicotine-activated STAT3 to the TTP promoter and induction of TTP expression is important for nicotine-induced down-regulation of TNF-α production in U937 cells. These results are consistent with those of previous reports suggesting that the DNA binding activity of STAT3 is required for the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine on macrophages (7de Jonge W.J. van der Zanden E.P.

Even though we did not directly compare the two pathways, we hypothesize that the nicotine-STAT3 signaling pathway may mimics IL-10-STAT3 pathways, or vice versa, to suppress macrophage activity.It has been reported that stimulation with LPS results in a strong and rapid induction of TTP mRNA in mouse macrophages (34Mahtani K.R.

Consistent with previous study, we found that LPS alone increased TTP expression level at 4 h post-treatment in human macrophages, but its effect was mild. Even though we analyzed the TTP expression at early time (1, 2, and 3 h) after LPS stimulation, we could not detect strong induction of TTP expression (data not shown). Even though LPS increases the expression level of TTP, it also activates p38 MAPK, which results in inactivation of TTP and allows the stabilization of ARE-containing TNF-α mRNA (36Chrestensen C.A.

In this study, we found that nicotine decreased the TNF-α production from LPS-stimulated human macrophages via STAT3-dependent induction of TTP expression. Interestingly, nicotine is known to increase the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (39Aicher A. Heeschen C. Mohaupt M. Cooke J.P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and, in our study, nicotine did not reduce the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (data not shown), demonstrating that decrease in the p38 MAPK activity may not be essential for the inhibitory effect of nicotine on TNF-α expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Consistent with this hypothesis, TTP is reported to induce the decay of TNF-α mRNA in the presence of p38 MAPK activity (30Schaljo B. Kratochvill F. Gratz N. Sadzak I. Sauer I. Hammer M. Vogl C.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and we found that TTP mediates the inhibitory effect of nicotine. Collectively, our results suggest the possibility that, even though the nicotine-STAT3 signaling pathway resembles IL-10-STAT3 pathways in induction of TTP expression, they seem to differ in regulation of p38 MAPK activity. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms by which nicotine-STAT3 signaling pathway supports TTP to destabilize the TNF-α mRNA in the presence of p38 MAPK activity in LPS-stimulated macrophages.We found a discrepancy between levels of the TNF-α transcripts and protein in nicotine-treated U937 cells: Whereas nicotine induced strong destabilization of TNF-α mRNA and strong down-regulation of TNF-α mRNA level, it induced mild decrease in TNF-α level. Our expectation was that there would be good correlation between the expression levels of TNF-α mRNA and protein. It has been reported that TNF-α is highly stable at neutral pH and at 37 °C (40Haranaka K. Carswell E.A. Williamson B.D. Prendergast J.S. Satomi N. Old L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Consistent with the previous reports, we found that TNF-α in the supernatant is stable in the presence of nicotine, which may be a possible explanation for the discrepancy.In conclusion, we have shown that nicotine-STAT3 signaling induces the expression of TTP in macrophages and thus, down-regulates TNF-α production by destabilizing its transcripts. Because an excess of TNF-α is involved in many inflammatory diseases, the inhibition of TNF-α production through the modulation of nicotine-STAT3-TTP signaling pathway may have wide-ranging clinical implications. Nicotine has been found to inhibit TNF-α production from LPS-stimulated macrophages (4Wang H. Yu M. Ochani M. Amella C.A. Tanovic M. Susarla S. Li J.H. Wang H. Yang H. Ulloa L. Al-Abed Y. Czura C.J.

In this study, we provide evidence that nicotine exerts its inhibitory effects through STAT3-dependent TTP expression: nicotine-STAT3 signaling down-regulates TNF-α mRNA stability in an TNF-α 3′-UTR-dependent manner; nicotine increases the STAT3 binding to the TTP promoter, the TTP promoter activity and the expression of TTP; down-regulation of STAT3 by siRNA or dnSTAT3 mutants with reduced DNA-binding activity abolishes the nicotine induction of TTP expression and inhibitory effect; siRNAs to TTP significantly restore the nicotine-mediated inhibition in TNF-α production and TNF-α-UTR Luc activity. These results indicate that the binding of nicotine-activated STAT3 to the TTP promoter and induction of TTP expression is important for nicotine-induced down-regulation of TNF-α production in U937 cells. These results are consistent with those of previous reports suggesting that the DNA binding activity of STAT3 is required for the anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine on macrophages (7de Jonge W.J. van der Zanden E.P.

In addition, mutation within the DNA-binding domain of STAT3 resulting in the reduced DNA-binding activity has been found to be associated with the hyper-IgE syndrome, a disorder of immunity in human (10Minegishi Y.

Until now, nicotine-activated STAT3 has been reported to suppress the expression of inflammatory mediators through inhibition of transcriptional activity of NF-κB (9Wang T. Niu G. Kortylewski M.

However, our results indicate that, just like IL-10-activated STAT3 (30Schaljo B. Kratochvill F. Gratz N. Sadzak I. Sauer I. Hammer M. Vogl C. Strobl B. Müller M. Blackshear P.J. Poli V. Lang R. Murray P.J. Kovarik P. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), nicotine-activated STAT3 also exerts its anti-inflammatory function by promoting the transcription of TTP. Even though we did not directly compare the two pathways, we hypothesize that the nicotine-STAT3 signaling pathway may mimics IL-10-STAT3 pathways, or vice versa, to suppress macrophage activity. It has been reported that stimulation with LPS results in a strong and rapid induction of TTP mRNA in mouse macrophages (34Mahtani K.R. Brook M. Dean J.L. Sully G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

The stability of TTP mRNA is regulated by TTP itself and TTP expression peaks at early time after LPS stimulation and then decreases through autoregulation (35Tchen C.R. Brook M. Saklatvala J.

Consistent with previous study, we found that LPS alone increased TTP expression level at 4 h post-treatment in human macrophages, but its effect was mild. Even though we analyzed the TTP expression at early time (1, 2, and 3 h) after LPS stimulation, we could not detect strong induction of TTP expression (data not shown). Even though LPS increases the expression level of TTP, it also activates p38 MAPK, which results in inactivation of TTP and allows the stabilization of ARE-containing TNF-α mRNA (36Chrestensen C.A.

https://openalex.org/W1988996469,"2B4 (CD244) is an important activating receptor for the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell responses. Here we show that 2B4 is heavily and differentially glycosylated in primary human NK cells and NK cell lines. The differential glycosylation could be attributed to sialic acid residues on N- and O-linked carbohydrates. Using a recombinant fusion protein of the extracellular domain of 2B4, we demonstrate that N-linked glycosylation of 2B4 is essential for the binding to its ligand CD48. In contrast, sialylation of 2B4 has a negative impact on ligand binding, as the interaction between 2B4 and CD48 is increased after the removal of sialic acids. This was confirmed in a functional assay system, where the desialylation of NK cells or the inhibition of O-linked glycosylation resulted in increased 2B4-mediated lysis of CD48-expressing tumor target cells. These data demonstrate that glycosylation has an important impact on 2B4-mediated NK cell function and suggest that regulated changes in glycosylation during NK cell development and activation might be involved in the regulation of NK cell responses. 2B4 (CD244) is an important activating receptor for the regulation of natural killer (NK) cell responses.

Natural killer cells are the first lymphoid subpopulation in the defense against tumors and viral infection. Their activity is regulated by the interplay between inhibitory receptors, most of which recognize MHC class I expression on target cells, and activating receptors, which are engaged by various ligands (1Lanier L.L. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Important inhibitory receptors are members of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor family as well as CD94/NKG2 heterodimers (2Moretta L. Moretta A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Examples for activating receptors are NKG2D (CD314), DNAM-1 (CD226), and the well characterized natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: NCRnatural cytotoxicity receptorNKnatural killerILZisoleucine zipperBADGbenzyl-2-acetoamino-2-deoxy-α-D-galactopyranoside2Dtwo-dimensionalSBsample bufferCScastanospermineCIPcalf intestinal phosphatasePSAPisum sativum agglutininLCALens culinaris agglutininDSLDatura Stramonium lectin. NKp30 (CD337), NKp44 (CD336), and NKp46 (CD335) (2Moretta L. Moretta A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 3Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 225-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). These receptors transduce their activation signal via small adaptor proteins like CD3zeta or DAP10 (4Moretta A. Bottino C. Vitale M. Pende D. Cantoni C. Mingari M.C. Biassoni R. Moretta L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 197-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). The human activating NK cell receptor 2B4 (CD244) belongs to the SLAM-related receptor (5Claus M. Meinke S. Bhat R. Watzl C. Front Biosci. 2008; 13: 956-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is a 365-amino acid type 1 transmembrane protein with a calculated molecular weight of 39 kDa and a pI of 9.16 (6Tangye S.G. Lazetic S. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6981-6985PubMed Google Scholar). It has a large intracellular domain containing four immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs that recruit adaptor molecules like SAP (SH2D1A or DSHP) or EAT2 after phosphorylation (7Eissmann P. Beauchamp L. Wooters J. Tilton J.C. Long E.O. Watzl C. Blood. 2005; 105: 4722-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 8Veillette A. Nat. Rev.

The extracellular part of 2B4 consists of an N-terminal V-set Ig domain, a membrane-proximal C2-set Ig domain, and several N-glycosylation sites (6Tangye S.G. Lazetic S. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6981-6985PubMed Google Scholar). The ligand of 2B4 is CD48, a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored molecule with broad expression in the hematopoietic system (10Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 11Latchman Y. McKay P.F. Reiser H. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5809-5812PubMed Google Scholar). Engagement of 2B4 by its ligand results in the recruitment and clustering of the receptor into lipid rafts and phosphorylation of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif domains (12Watzl C. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Watzl C. Stebbins C.C. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3545-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This initiates a signaling cascade, leading to polarization and the release of cytolytic granules into the contact zone between the NK and target cell (14Bryceson Y.T. March M.E. Barber D.F.

Although 2B4 stimulation alone is sufficient to activate IL-2 stimulated NK cells, it also serves as an important coactivatory signal for the stimulation of resting NK cells (16Assarsson E.

Glycosylation plays an important role in receptor-ligand recognition. It can act as a biochemical signal recognized by lectins but also have structural influence in receptor-ligand recognition because of its bulky shape caused by branched side chains (20André S. Kozár T. Kojima S. Unverzagt C. Gabius H.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Carbohydrates are linked to proteins by N- and O-glycosidic bonds. The negatively charged sialic acids are the outermost monosaccharides on the glycosidic chains and offer a recognition site for specific lectins (e.g. sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)) or pathogens. Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 are known inhibitory receptors on NK cells (21Yamaji T. Mitsuki M. Teranishi T. Hashimoto Y. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sialic acids also play an important role in naïve T cells, where they can impair the recognition of MHC class I molecules (22Baum L.G. Derbin K. Perillo N.L. Wu T. Pang M. Uittenbogaart C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10793-10799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Casabó L.G. Mamalaki C. Kioussis D. Zamoyska R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 397-404PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that the NK cell receptor 2B4 is modified by N- and O-glycosylation and that it is highly sialylated. Our data demonstrate that N-linked carbohydrates are essential for the 2B4/CD48 interaction. In contrast, sialylation has a negative impact on the ligand binding of 2B4 and on 2B4-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity. Primary NK cells were isolated and cultured as described (7Eissmann P. Beauchamp L. Wooters J. Tilton J.C. Long E.O. Watzl C. Blood. 2005; 105: 4722-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell lines used in this study were NK92C1, NKL (NK cell lines), HEK 293T (HEK) and HeLa. HeLa and HEK cells were stably transfected with CD48 (HEK-CD48, HeLa-CD48) or empty vector as a control. The following antibodies were used: anti-2B4 (C1.7, Beckman Coulter, Germany), IgG1 control (MOPC-21, Sigma), biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, VA), anti-CD48 (MEM-102), goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (both Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Germany), goat anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated, goat anti-mouse IgG PE-conjugated, and streptavidin HRP-conjugated (all Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA). The anti-isoleucine zipper mAb (ILZ-11) as well as rabbit anti-2B4 antibodies have been described previously (13Watzl C. Stebbins C.C. Long E.O. J.

The enzymes used were PNGaseF (peptide-N-glycosidase F, Sigma), Arthrobacter ureafaciens α2–3,6,8,9-neuraminidase (Merck-Calbiochem) and O-glycosidase (endo-α-N-acetyl galactosaminidase, New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). BADG (benzyl-2-acetoamido-2-deoxy-α-D-galactopyranoside, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) and castanospermine (Castanospermum australe, dissolved in water) (both Merck-Calbiochem) were used as inhibitors for O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation, respectively. Protein phosphorylation was induced by using the phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate. Cells were resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in PBS containing 200 μm Na-orthovanadate activated by 0.3% H2O2 and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Lysates of up to 2 × 107 cells were prepared as described previously (7Eissmann P. Beauchamp L. Wooters J. Tilton J.C. Long E.O. Watzl C. Blood. 2005; 105: 4722-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and incubated for 1 h with 20 μl of Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG (Invitrogen) coated with 1.6 μg of isotype mAb (MOPC21) for preclearing and subsequently with specific antibody (C1.7) to isolate 2B4. Beads were washed in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with 20 μl of ASB-14 lysis buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1 m Tris-base, 4% (w/v) ASB-14) by shaking for 20 min at 18 °C. Bead eluates of immunoprecipitated 2B4 or 2B4-ILZ fusion proteins were supplemented with ASB-14 sample buffer (SB) (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% (w/v) ASB-14) to a final volume of 100 μl, incubated for 20 min at 18 °C, and then mixed with 100 μl of SB with 130 mm DTT and 2% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient buffer (pH gradient 3–10). For isoelectric focusing, ReadyStrip immobilized pH gradient (pH 3–10) (Bio-Rad) were used with the following conditions: 50 μA per gel at 20 °C for all steps; active rehydration at 50 V for 12 h; focusing, 15 min 250 V (ramp, rapid), 2 h at 4000 V (ramp, linear), 5 h at 4000 V (ramp, rapid). About 10,000 V-h were reached. IPG strips were equilibrated in 75 mm Tris (pH 8.8), 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS plus 0,5% (w/v) DTT and then in equilibration buffer with 4.5% (w/v) iodacetamid instead of DTT. Proteins were separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris ZOOM gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore) and developed as described before (7Eissmann P. Beauchamp L. Wooters J. Tilton J.C. Long E.O. Watzl C. Blood. 2005; 105: 4722-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using rabbit anti-2B4 or 4G10 antibodies and the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Lysates of 1 × 105 cells or 2B4 immunoprecipitates were separated via SDS-PAGE and blotted as described above. PVDF membranes were blocked using Carbo-FreeTM blocking solution (Vector Laboratories, CA). After overnight incubation with appropriate lectins at 5 μg/ml (biotinylated lectin Kit I and II, Vector Laboratories), membranes were washed and subjected to streptavidin conjugated with HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Immunoprecipitated proteins were treated enzymatically directly on the magnetic beads. For dephosphorylation, 8 × 106 beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 1× NEB3 buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 μl of CIP (New England Biolabs). The same amount of beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 1 μl of one of the following deglycosylation enzymes: PNGaseF for de-N-glycosylation (overnight at 37 °C), neuraminidase for desialylation (2 h at 37 °C), and neuraminidase plus O-glycosidase for de-O-glycosylation (2 h of 37 °C). 2B4-ILZ fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (24Stark S. Flaig R.M. Sandusky M. Watzl C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 296: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Prior to protein elution from the agarose beads, samples were divided and left untreated (overnight incubation at 4 °C or at 37 °C) or enzymatically deglycosylated. For desialylation, beads were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 17 μl of neuraminidase in PBS. Additional de-O-glycosylation was achieved in a second approach using 10 μl of O-glycosidase together with the aforementioned amount of neuraminidase. For ablation of N-glycosidic bound carbohydrates, the same amount of beads were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 17 μl of PNGaseF in 50 mm phosphate buffer G7 reaction buffer. After treatment, beads were washed twice and proteins were eluted as described in Ref. 24Stark S. Flaig R.M. Sandusky M. Watzl C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 296: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar. Concentration was quantified using the EZQ protein quantitation kit (Invitrogen). Purity was controlled via SDS-PAGE and silver staining and successful deglycosylation via 2D gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis, respectively. For 2D gel electrophoresis, 100 ng of 2B4-ILZ fusion proteins were supplemented with ASB-14 lysis buffer up to 20 μl and processed as described above. For 2B4 point mutants of the predicted N-glycosylation sites, appropriate asparagines were replaced by glutamines by site-directed mutagenesis. PCR products were restricted and religated into the 2B4-ILZ plasmid. The following primers were used (point mutations are underlined): N71Q: forward, GTGGGAGCAGGGCTCTTTG and reverse, AGAGCC CTGCTCCACTTCAA. N77Q: forward, GCCTTC CCAGACTTCCAATGATAG and reverse, TTGGAAG TCTGGGAAGGCAAAG. N89Q: forward, GTCA AGCAGTTGAGTCTTCTCATC and reverse, GACTCA ACTGCTTGACTATAAAACT. Desialylation of cells was done using 1 μl of neuraminidase for 1 × 106 cells/100 μl of PBS, rotating for 2 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To inhibit elongation of O-glycosyl chains, cells were incubated with 2.5 mm BADG for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. N-glycosylation was inhibited by blocking glycosidase I and II using castanospermine (CS). Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml CS for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed once with CTL medium (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin) and used for cytotoxicity assays as described (7Eissmann P. Beauchamp L. Wooters J. Tilton J.C. Long E.O. Watzl C. Blood. 2005; 105: 4722-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To study the glycosylation of 2B4, we immunoprecipitated the receptor from different NK cells and stable 2B4-transfected HEK-293T (HEK-2B4) cells and analyzed it via 2D gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. The 2B4 receptor migrated at an apparent molecular weight of about 70 kDa in all cells analyzed and showed distinct spots over a broad pH range (Fig. 1A). The spot pattern between 2B4 molecules from primary NK cells, the NK cell line NKL, and HEK-2B4 cells were comparable, whereas the NK cell line NK92C1 expressed a more alkaline receptor. To test whether these differences in pH could be due to background phosphorylation of the four cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif domains, immunoprecipitated 2B4 proteins were dephosphorylated using Calf Intestinal Phosphatase (CIP). Although this treatment led to a complete dephosphorylation of 2B4, as evident by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B), it only resulted in a marginal shift of the whole spot pattern toward a more basic pH (Fig. 1B). In contrast, inhibition of phosphatases using pervanadate led to an overall shift toward acidic pH and a significant phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated 2B4, as proven by phosphotyrosine staining (supplemental Fig. 1C). This indicates that background phosphorylation is not the reason for the diverse spot pattern of the 2B4 receptor. Human 2B4 contains eight possible N-glycosylation sites, and the calculated molecular weight of the core peptide is about 39 kDa. To test whether 2B4 is N-glycosylated, the immunoprecipitated receptor was dephosphorylated using CIP or additionally de-N-glycosylated using PNGaseF. Removal of N-glycans reduced the mass of 2B4 to the predicted molecular mass of 39 kDa (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the spot patterns between NK92C1 and the other NK cell lines was comparable after PNGaseF treatment (Fig. 1C). This suggests that N-linked carbohydrates on 2B4 differ between NK92C1 and the other NK cells analyzed. It further shows that N-linked sugars account for the 30-kDa difference between calculated and apparent molecular weight of the 2B4 receptor. However, the 2B4 receptor still migrated as distinct spots covering a broad pH range after the removal of N-glycans. This suggested the presence of additional sugar moieties that are highly charged and of small size. Sialic acids are highly negatively charged and therefore shift the pH of proteins toward acidic pI with only minor change in molecular mass. To test for the presence of sialic acids on 2B4, we desialylated immunoprecipitated 2B4 using neuraminidase. Desialylation shifted the pH of immunoprecipitated 2B4 to its calculated pI of 9.61 (Fig. 2, A and B). Additional removal of O-linked glycans did not change the pI further (Fig. 2C). Instead, we sometimes observed a slight increase in molecular weight of the 2B4 receptor under these conditions. These data show that the distinct spot pattern of 2B4 is caused by sialic acid residues on N- and O-linked sugars. Some of the N-glycosylation sites within 2B4 are in close proximity to the binding site of its ligand CD48. According to the structure of murine 2B4 (25Velikovsky C.A. Deng L. Chlewicki L.K. Fernández M.M. Kumar V. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2007; 27: 572-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the N-linked carbohydrates may lie outside of the binding interface. However, they could still be involved in ligand binding because of their large size and high negative charge. Additionally, O-linked carbohydrates, for which no consensus motifs are known, could have an impact on the function of the 2B4 receptor. To test how these carbohydrates could influence the binding affinity of 2B4 to its ligand CD48, we expressed the extracellular Ig-like domains of 2B4 linked to an isoleucine ILZ motif as a recombinant soluble fusion protein in HEK cells (24Stark S. Flaig R.M. Sandusky M. Watzl C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2005; 296: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These 2B4-ILZ fusion proteins showed a glycosylation pattern similar to the 2B4 receptor found in stably transfected HEK cells and primary human NK cells (Fig. 3A, top panel). Also, the difference between the apparent molecular weight of 2B4-ILZ of about 55 kDa and the calculated molecular mass of 27 kDa can be explained by the addition of about 30 kDa because of glycosylation of the 2B4 fusion protein. Desialylation as well as de-O-glycosylation of the fusion protein shifted the pI to a more alkaline pH, and removal of N-linked carbohydrates resulted in a mass shift toward the calculated molecular weight (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that the glycosylation of the 2B4-ILZ fusion protein is comparable with the 2B4 receptor expressed on NK cells. We next asked how the removal of the different sugars from the 2B4-ILZ fusion protein would affect the binding to its ligand CD48. For this we used the fusion protein to stain HEK and HeLa cells stably transfected with CD48. Removal of N-linked carbohydrates by PNGase treatment severely compromised the specific binding of 2B4-ILZ to HEK-CD48 and HeLa-CD48 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). This suggests that N-linked sugars on 2B4 are essential for its binding to CD48. To further corroborate this, we substituted asparagines (N) in the three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites of the N-terminal V-set Ig domain of the 2B4-ILZ fusion protein by glutamines (Q) using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 4A). Two sites (N71Q and N77Q) were in close proximity to the binding site of CD48 according to the murine structure (25Velikovsky C.A. Deng L. Chlewicki L.K. Fernández M.M. Kumar V. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2007; 27: 572-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with the third mutation (N89Q) lying outside of this interaction site. The mutated 2B4-ILZ fusion proteins were used in binding studies against CD48 expressing HeLa and HEK cells. Interestingly, all mutated proteins showed diminished binding capacity compared with the WT 2B4-ILZ (Fig. 4B). The fusion proteins with mutations close to the CD48 binding interface (N71Q and N77Q) displayed a somewhat reduced binding, whereas removing N-glycans at position 89 had a more pronounced effect on binding to CD48. These data support our findings that N-glycosidic-linked carbohydrates are important for 2B4-mediated ligand recognition. When we removed sialic acid residues or additionally O-linked sugars, we observed a somewhat increased binding of 2B4-ILZ to HeLa-CD48 cells (Fig. 3C). This increase was consistently seen for many different CD48-expressing cells (Fig. 3D) and suggests that sialic acid residues on 2B4 may have a negative impact on its binding to CD48. To test whether 2B4 glycosylation also has an impact on 2B4-mediated NK cell activation, we used mock- or CD48-transfected HeLa cells as targets for different NK cells. The presence of CD48 clearly enhanced the lysis of HeLa cells by primary human NK cells or the NK cell lines NKL and NK92C1, demonstrating the specific NK cell activation through 2B4 (Fig. 5). We then removed sialic acids from the surface of NK cells by neuraminidase treatment. The analysis of the immunoprecipitated 2B4 receptor from the treated cells by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting showed a clear shift toward basic pH, demonstrating the effectiveness of the treatment (supplemental Fig. 2A). Neuraminidase-treated NK cells showed enhanced killing against CD48-expressing target cells (Fig. 5A). Although the extent of the enhanced lysis varied between experiments, we consistently observed better 2B4-mediated killing by neuraminidase-treated NK cells. To interfere with O-glycosylation, we cultured the NK cells with the inhibitor BADG. BADG competes with endogenous GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr for galactosyl transferase and therefore prevents the elongation of O-glycosyl chains. Analysis of 2B4 from the treated cells showed a loss of negative charge as well as a slight decrease in molecular mass because of loss of O-glycosidic-bound carbohydrates (supplemental Fig. 2B). Also, the BADG-treated cells showed enhanced killing activity against CD48-expressing target cells (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that 2B4-specific NK cell activation can be enhanced by removal of sialic acid from the surface of NK cells or the inhibition of O-linked glycosylation and correlates nicely with our observation that the removal of these sugars can enhance the ligand binding activity of 2B4. Because ablation of N-glycans or mutation of predicted N-linked glycosylation sites of 2B4-ILZ fusion proteins interfered with the binding to CD48-expressing cells, we wanted to test if de-N-glycosylated NK cells were impaired in CD48-mediated target cell lysis. PNGase failed to de-N-glycosylate whole NK cells, and the inhibitor of the GlcNAc phosphotransferase, tunicamycin, showed toxic side effects. We therefore cultured NK cells with CS, which inhibits glycosidase I and II and thereby interferes with the N-glycosidic pathway during its first trimming steps in the endoplasmic reticulum. Western blotting of immunoprecipitated 2B4 after CS treatment showed a decrease in the molecular mass of 2B4, demonstrating the effectiveness of the treatment (Fig. 6A). CS-treated NK92C1 and NKL cells showed a diminished killing of CD48-expressing target cells compared with control cells (Fig. 6B). This suggests that N-linked sugars are important for 2B4-mediated NK cell activation. It is well known that glycans can play a major role in cell-cell communication (26Ohtsubo K. Marth J.D. Cell. 2006; 126: 855-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). However, only little is known about the glycosylation of lymphocytes, their changes during cellular activation, and how this might influence the reactivity of these cells. We therefore wanted to examine the glycosylation of NK cells and how this might change upon cytokine-driven expansion and activation of these cells. We compared the lysate of freshly isolated or IL-2 expanded NK cells from the same donor by Western blotting using different lectins. Three of these lectins (Pisum sativum agglutinin (PSA), Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA), and Datura stramonium lectin (DSL)) showed clear alterations in the carbohydrate spectrum of NK cells after activation (Fig. 7A). To directly investigate possible changes in 2B4 glycosylation, we compared immunoprecipitated 2B4 from freshly isolated and IL-2 expanded NK cells via 2D gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. We detected a clear difference in the migration of 2B4 before and after IL-2 expansion with the 2B4 receptor from freshly isolated NK cells migrating at a more acidic position (Fig. 7B). We also analyzed immunoprecipitated 2B4 from freshly isolated and IL-2-expanded NK cells by Western blotting using the different lectins. Although LCA and DSL did not recognize 2B4, PSA was able to stain 2B4 (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, the PSA staining of immunoprecipitated 2B4 was more intense in the sample from IL-2 expanded NK cells, again suggesting changes in 2B4 glycosylation upon NK cell activation. Glycosylation is an important posttranslational modification of membrane proteins and crucial for proper cell function. Our data show that the activating human NK cell receptor 2B4 is expressed as a highly glycosylated protein. We found that the majority of the sugars are attached to 2B4 via N-linked glycosylation, adding about 30 kDa to its molecular mass. Additionally, 2B4 is also O-glycosylated and contains sialic acid residues on both N- and O-linked sugars, which are responsible for shifting the pI of 2B4 to a more acidic pH. 2B4 contains eight possible N-glycosylation sites. However, Zielinska et al. (27Zielinska D.F. Gnad F. Wiśniewski J.R. Mann M. Cell. 2010; 141: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) have shown that N-glycosylation is not restricted to the N-!P-(S/T) sequence motif (where !P is any amino acid except proline) or the uncommon N-X-C motif but can also be found on yet unknown positions. Furthermore, only 30% of all available motifs within a protein are glycosylated, with some of them showing only incomplete glycosylation (28Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This results in a heterogeneous population of differentially glycosylated proteins as we have found for the 2B4 receptor. The differential glycosylation of 2B4 could be attributed to sialic acid residues on both N- and O-linked sugars, as removal of sialic acids created a population of 2B4 molecules migrating at one distinct pI. Considering the bioinformatic tools of the CBS prediction service databank, the sequence of 2B4 does not reveal any O-glycosylation sites. However, there is no clear consensus sequence for O-glycosylation sites. As we still observed distinct spots after removal of N-glycosylation, we suggest that 2B4 is also modified by O-linked sugars. The enzymatic removal of O-glycosidic-bound carbohydrates requires first a removal of sialic acids, making a specific analysis of O-linked sugars difficult. We observed an increase in the molecular weight of 2B4 after removal of O-glycosidic-bound carbohydrates compared with the removal of sialic acids alone. This rather surprising result might be explained by peptide dimerization because of diminished repulsion after the removal of O-linked sugars. The structural information available today about the interaction between 2B4 and CD48 did not implicate glycosylation to be important for this binding. Our data demonstrate that N-glycosylation of 2B4 is essential for this interaction, as removal of these sugars from the 2B4 fusion protein almost completely prevented its binding to CD48-expressing cells. Removal of N-linked sugars can affect the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Indeed, we saw that de-N-glycosylation of 2B4-ILZ resulted in reduced recognition of the fusion protein by the conformation-specific anti-2B4 mAb C1.7. This might indicate that N-linked sugars are part of the epitope that is recognized by C1.7 or that N-linked sugars are necessary for the stabilization of this epitope. Additionally, removal of N-linked sugars may also cause protein aggregation. However, we did not observe such aggregates in our Western blot analysis (Figs. 1C and 3A), and the recognition of the treated fusion protein by a polyclonal anti-2B4 antibody was only slightly impaired. Therefore, the reduced binding of the de-N-glycosylated 2B4-ILZ fusion protein to CD48 can only partially be explained by aggregation and is more likely because of an involvement of N-linked carbohydrates in the binding to CD48. This was further corroborated by our functional analysis of CS-treated NK cell lines and the mutational analysis of 2B4. All three mutants influenced the binding to CD48-expressing cells negatively. Among these, N-linked glycans in close proximity to the CD48 binding interface (Asn-71 and Asn-77) displayed a more intermediate effect in contrast to the carbohydrates nearby the C2-set Ig domain (Asn-89). This rather surprising result can be explained in several ways: Firstly, carbohydrates linked to Asn-89 might be important to stabilize the two Ig-like domains into a defined, rigid structure. Therefore, point mutation of Asn-89 might result in a fusion protein with more flexible domains that is hampered in its binding to CD48. Secondly, glycans linked to Asn-89 could be large enough to directly contribute to the interaction with CD48. Finally, because the structure of human 2B4 has not yet been solved, small alterations in the tertiary structure might bring the Asn-89 glycosylation site closer to the CD48 binding site in comparison to the murine structure. Further mutations and combinations of mutations will be necessary to analyze this in more detail. Interestingly, the glycosylation pattern of 2B4 from NK92C1 cells differed from that of other NK cells or 2B4-transfected HEK cells. This difference in glycosylation could be attributed to N-linked sugars, suggesting that it could also influence the binding of 2B4 to CD48. It has been shown that binding by the 2B4 related receptor CD2 to its ligand CD58 is independent of glycosylation (29Davis S.J. Davies E.A. Barclay A.N. Daenke S. Bodian D.L. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 369-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CD2 contains only one potential N-glycosylation site in its membrane-distal IgV domain, which lies on the opposite site of the contact area with CD58 (29Davis S.J. Davies E.A. Barclay A.N. Daenke S. Bodian D.L. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Butters T.D. Dwek R.A. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 369-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Contrary to this, 2B4 contains three N-glycosylation sites in its membrane-distal IgV domain, two of which are in close proximity to the putative CD48 binding site (25Velikovsky C.A. Deng L. Chlewicki L.K. Fernández M.M. Kumar V. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2007; 27: 572-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the basis of the CD2-CD58 interaction, Mathew et al. (30Mathew S.O. Kumaresan P.R. Lee J.K. Huynh V.T. Mathew P.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 1005-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) showed that Lys-68 and Glu-70 of the human 2B4 IgV domain were necessary for ligand binding. However, in our hands, these mutations were not sufficient to abolish ligand binding. Only a 2B4 triple mutant, K54A/H65A/T110A, based on the structure of the murine 2B4-CD48 complex (25Velikovsky C.A. Deng L. Chlewicki L.K. Fernández M.M. Kumar V. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2007; 27: 572-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), completely abolished binding to CD48 3M. Claus and C. Watzl, unpublished results. . These results show that the human 2B4/CD48 interaction is similar to the one defined for mouse 2B4/CD48. Our data also show that sialylation of 2B4 affects its binding to CD48. Interestingly, sialic acids seem to hinder this interaction, as we observed increased binding of 2B4 to CD48 after neuraminidase treatment. The negative charge introduced by the addition of sialic acids may lead to some repulsion within the 2B4-CD48 interaction, which would explain the positive effect on binding upon removal of sialic acids. This effect was not only seen in the binding of the recombinant 2B4 fusion protein to CD48-expressing cells but could also be confirmed in NK cells, as neuraminidase treatment of NK cells resulted in enhanced 2B4-mediated lysis of CD48-expressing target cells. Our data show that 2B4 is sialylated on N- and O-linked sugars. This would explain why the inhibition of O-linked glycosylation in NK cells by BADG also enhanced the lysis of CD48-expressing cells and suggest that sialic acids on O-linked sugars are involved in the repulsion during the 2B4-CD48 interactions. However, BADG seemed to have a greater impact on 2B4-mediated NK cell activation compared with neuraminidase treatment. This could suggest that O-linked sugars also directly interfere with the 2B4-CD48 interactions. Removal of sialic acids by neuraminidase or blocking O-linked glycosylation by BADG treatment of NK cells does not only affect the glycosylation of 2B4 but affects many different surface molecules and can therefore have general effects on NK cell reactivity (31Benson V. Grobarova V. Richter J. Fiserova A. Int. Immunol. 2010; 22: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This explains why the treated NK cells already show some difference in lysis of mock-transfected target cells. However, the lysis of CD48-transfected targets was affected to a much larger extent, arguing for a specific effect on 2B4-mediated NK cell activation. Glycans are involved in many cellular processes. The binding of CD8 to MHC-I is enhanced upon removal of sialic acids (32Daniels M.A. Devine L. Miller J.D. Moser J.M. Lukacher A.E. Altman J.D. Kavathas P. Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and desialylation increases CD8+ T cell sensitivity to antigen-presenting cell stimulation (33Crespo H.J. Cabral M.G. Teixeira A.V. Lau J.T. Trindade H. Videira P.A. Immunology. 2009; 128: e621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to naïve T cells, activated T cells show a reduction in sialylation (32Daniels M.A. Devine L. Miller J.D. Moser J.M. Lukacher A.E. Altman J.D. Kavathas P. Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulated surface sialylation may play a role in regulating T cell responses. Our data show that the glycosylation of NK cells also changes upon IL-2-driven expansion and activation of these cells. More specifically, the glycosylation of 2B4 itself is altered during NK cell activation. Freshly isolated NK cells express a more acidic receptor, which might be due to higher sialylation. Therefore, in line with the data for T lymphocytes, a reduction in sialylation during NK cell activation may be one mechanism to enhance target cell recognition by cytotoxic cells. The lectin staining of immunoprecipitated 2B4 gave another hint for variations in 2B4 glycosylation during NK cell activation. Interestingly, PSA and LCA stained 2B4 differentially, although they show very similar reactivity (34Kornfeld K. Reitman M.L. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6633-6640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both lectins bind core-fucosylated, mono- and biantennary N-glycans but not their tri- and tetra-antennary forms. However, a recent study suggests that they differ in their binding affinity to branched N-glycans (35Tateno H. Nakamura-Tsuruta S. Hirabayashi J. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). LCA binds better to biantennary N-glycans, whereas PSA exhibits a higher affinity to trimannosyl structures. Interestingly, sialylation seems to decreases the binding affinity of both lectins (35Tateno H. Nakamura-Tsuruta S. Hirabayashi J. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Hence, PSA but not LCA staining of 2B4 indicates different core glycosylation, whereas the stronger PSA staining after NK cell activation would be compatible with a reduction in sialylation, as already suggested by the 2D gel electrophoresis. As sialylation of 2B4 has a negative impact on CD48 recognition, a reduced sialylation would result in enhanced 2B4-mediated NK cell activation. Indeed, we have shown previously that IL-2-stimulated NK cells show better 2B4-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity (36Endt J. Eissmann P. Hoffmann S.C. Meinke S. Giese T. Watzl C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, IL-2 stimulation has various effects on NK cells, including the up-regulation of SAP (36Endt J. Eissmann P. Hoffmann S.C. Meinke S. Giese T. Watzl C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2007; 37: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), an adapter molecule important for 2B4-mediated NK cell activation. Therefore, although the reduced sialylation of 2B4 might be involved in the better reactivity of the receptor, it is certainly not the only reason for the enhanced 2B4-mediated activation of IL-2-stimulated NK cells.

https://openalex.org/W2082426855,"Introduction Angiopoietins and their receptor Tie-2 are, in concert with VEGF-A, key mediators in angiogenesis. This study evaluates the prognostic impact of all known human angiopoietins (Ang-1, Ang-2 and Ang-4) and their receptor Tie-2, as well as their relation to the prognostic expression of VEGF-A. Methods 335 unselected stage I-IIIA NSCLC-patients were included and tissue samples of respective tumor cells and stroma were collected in tissue microarrays (TMAs). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to semiquantitatively evaluate the expression of markers in duplicate tumor and stroma cores. Principal Findings In univariate analyses, low tumor cell expression of Ang-4 (P = 0.046) and low stromal expressions of Ang-4 (P = 0.009) and Ang-2 (P = 0.017) were individually associated with a poor survival. In the multivariate analysis, low stromal Ang-2 (HR 1.88; CI 95% 1.15-3.08) and Ang-4 (HR 1.47, CI 95% 1.02–2.11, P = 0.04) expressions were independently associated with a poor prognosis. In patients with high tumor cell expression of Ang-2, a concomitantly high tumor VEGF-A expression mediated a dramatic survival reduction (P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis of patients with high Ang-2 expression, high tumor VEGF-A expression appeared an independent poor prognosticator (HR 6.43; CI 95% 2.46–16.8; P<0.001). Conclusions In tumor cells, only Ang-4 expression has prognostic impact in NSCLC. In tumor stroma, Ang-4 and Ang-2 are independently associated with survival. The prognostic impact of tumor cell VEGF-A in NSCLC appears strongly associated with a concomitantly high tumor cell expression of Ang-2."

The function of the diverse connexin molecules is related to their tissue-specific expression and highly dynamic turnover. Although multiple connexins have been previously reported to compensate for each other's functions, little is known about how connexins influence their own expression or intracellular regulation. Of the three vertebrate lens connexins, two connexins, connexin43 (Cx43) and connexin46 (Cx46), show reciprocal expression and subsequent function in the lens and in lens cell culture. In this study, we investigate the reciprocal relationship between the expression of Cx43 and Cx46. Forced depletion of Cx43, by tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, is associated with an up-regulation of Cx46 at both the protein and message level in human lens epithelial cells. An siRNA-mediated down-regulation of Cx43 results in an increase in the level of Cx46 protein, suggesting endogenous Cx43 is involved in the regulation of endogenous Cx46 turnover. Overexpression of Cx46, in turn, induces the depletion of Cx43 in rabbit lens epithelial cells. Cx46-induced Cx43 degradation is likely mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, as (i) treatment with proteasome inhibitors restores the Cx43 protein level and (ii) there is an increase in Cx43 ubiquitin conjugation in Cx46-overexpressing cells. We also present data that shows that the C-terminal intracellular tail domain of Cx46 is essential to induce degradation of Cx43. Therefore, our study shows that Cx43 and Cx46 have novel functions in regulating each other's expression and turnover in a reciprocal manner in addition to their conventional roles as gap junction proteins in lens cells.

https://openalex.org/W2012425516,"The present study was designed to assess the relative contribution of each leg to unperturbed bipedal posture in lower limb amputees. To achieve this goal, eight unilateral traumatic trans-femoral amputees (TFA) were asked to stand as still as possible on a plantar pressure data acquisition system with their eyes closed. Four dependent variables were computed to describe the subject's postural behavior: (1) body weight distribution, (2) amplitude, (3) velocity and (4) regularity of centre of foot pressure (CoP) trajectories under the amputated (A) leg and the non-amputated (NA) leg. Results showed a larger body weight distribution applied to the NA leg than to the A leg and a more regular CoP profiles (lower sample entropy values) with greater amplitude and velocity under the NA leg than under the A leg. Taken together, these findings suggest that the NA leg and the A leg do not equally contribute to the control of unperturbed bipedal posture in TFA. The observation that TFA do actively control unperturbed bipedal posture with their NA leg could be viewed as an adaptive process to the loss of the lower leg afferents and efferents because of the unilateral lower-limb amputation. From a methodological point of view, these results demonstrate the suitability of computing bilateral CoP trajectories regularity for the assessment of lateralized postural control under pathological conditions."

In addition to its tumor suppressing functions, our laboratory showed that maspin is also essential for normal fetal development as maspin knock-out mice are embryonic lethal during the peri-implantation stage partially due to disrupted visceral endodermal cell adhesion (10Gao F. Shi H.Y. Daughty C. Cella N. Zhang M. Development. 2004; 131: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The underlying molecular mechanism by which maspin regulates cell adhesion is currently unknown and under intense investigation. To date, there are two proposed pathways utilized by maspin to increase cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion; that is, the plasminogen activation system and β1 integrin signaling (9Cella N.

The plasminogen activation system is believed to be a central player in several different processes important for tumor progression and metastasis (14Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell.

In this system urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a serine protease, binds to its glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor (uPAR) and readily activates plasminogen to initiate a protease cascade resulting in localized ECM degradation for the purpose of cell migration (17Ellis V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 46692-46698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that maspin integrates into the plasminogen activation system. Maspin inhibits prostate carcinoma cell migration and invasion by strengthening mature focal adhesion contacts, reducing uPA activity by internalizing the maspin-uPA-uPAR complex and by binding to pro-uPA, thus blocking its activation (12Yin S. Lockett J. Meng Y. Biliran Jr., H. Blouse G.E. Li X. Reddy N. Zhao Z. Lin X. Anagli J. Cher M.L. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although maspin is classified as a serpin and decreases pericellular uPA activity, maspin does not directly inhibit uPA proteolytic activity (19McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778PubMed Google Scholar, 20Biliran Jr., H. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8676-8682PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bass R. Fernández A.M. Ellis V. J. Biol.

Together, these studies demonstrated that maspin can reduce prostate carcinoma cell migration and invasion by internalization of cell surface maspin-uPA-uPAR complexes. The second proposed cell adhesion pathway involves maspin associating with β1 integrin, thus, altering integrin-mediated signaling. Initial studies investigating the anti-invasive function of maspin showed that MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells treated with exogenous maspin had increased expression of α5- and α3-integrins. In addition to altered integrin expression profile, maspin stimulated focal adhesion and stress fiber formation in MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells to a fibronectin matrix acting through the α5β1 integrin receptor (3Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar, 22Odero-Marah V.A. Khalkhali-Ellis Z. Chunthapong J. Amir S. Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Hendrix M.J. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have suggested that cell surface maspin co-localizes with β1 integrin to increase MCF10A cell adhesion. This increased adhesion was facilitated by amino acids residues 139–225 in the maspin molecule (9Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Another study demonstrated that maspin inactivation of β1 reduces vascular smooth muscle cell migration on laminin or fibronectin matrices (13Bass R. Wagstaff L. Ravenhill L. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27712-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A peptide mimicking the G α-helix (G-helix, amino acids 237–251) region of maspin was both essential and sufficient for inhibiting cell migration, but it had no effect on cell adhesion (13Bass R. Wagstaff L. Ravenhill L. Ellis V. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27712-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Ravenhill L. Wagstaff L. Edwards D.R. Ellis V. Bass R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36285-36292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These discoveries showed that the G-helix of maspin regulates cell migration, but another region (amino acids 139–225) is involved in regulating cell adhesion. Initially thought to simply localize uPA for ECM degradation, recent evidence indicates that uPAR also initiates intracellular signaling cascades that regulate cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation independent of protease activity (24Smith H.W. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). In fact, it is now becoming clear that uPAR can specifically modify integrin functions to regulate ECM binding, cell adhesion, and migration (24Smith H.W. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 25Tarui T. Andronicos N. Czekay R.P. Mazar A.P. Bdeir K. Parry G.C. Kuo A. Loskutoff D.J. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We speculate that maspin acts as an integrator of these two systems, ultimately leading to decreased cell migration and increased cell adhesion. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the intramolecular region(s) of maspin necessary for its pro-adhesive function and decipher its mechanism of action. We demonstrate two different regions proximal to the reactive center loop (RCL) of maspin that are responsible for maspin-mediated MCF10A cell adhesion. Importantly, this enhanced adhesion is dependant on the presence of both uPA and uPAR and is present in a complex with uPA-uPAR-β1 integrin on the cell surface. Together, we suggest that maspin coordinates both uPA-uPAR and β1 integrin receptors to regulate both mammary epithelial cell-ECM adhesion and migration. For immunoprecipitation and functional blocking experiments, we used the rabbit anti-human uPAR and anti-human uPA (American Diagnostics). We used mouse monoclonal anti-maspin (BD Pharmingen) and rabbit polyclonal anti-β1 integrin (Chemicon) for both immunoprecipitation and immunoblot probing. An affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against maspin RCL peptide (AbS4A) was used from previous studies (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Both the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and maspin peptides were obtained from Sigma. Human uPA was purchased from Chemicon. MCF10A, immortalized human mammary luminal epithelial cells (CRL-10317; American Type Culture Collection), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 5% donor horse serum, 20 μg/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 μg/ml cholera toxin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 500 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All growth factors and hormones were purchased from Sigma. For maspin secretion studies, MCF10A cells either directly ordered from ATCC (low passage) or carried in our laboratory for 2 years (high passage) were maintained in defined keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with ciprofloxacin and MITO+ (BD Biosciences). Cells were passaged weekly and fed three times per week. Conditioned medium was collected on the day of passage, centrifuged to remove cell debris, and concentrated 24× using a 30-kDa spin filter (Millipore). Harvested protein was then used for Western blot analysis, as described later. Control (uPAR+/+) and uPAR-deficient (uPAR−/−) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from embryos as previously described (27Ma Z. Thomas K.S. Webb D.J. Moravec R. Salicioni A.M. Mars W.M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1061-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that amino acid residues 139–225 within maspin are important for increased MCF10A cell adhesion to its self-deposited matrix (9Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine the surface-exposed amino acid sequences that may regulate cell adhesion, we analyzed the three-dimensional structure of maspin by Molsoft ICM-pro software. Subsequently, we purchased peptides (Sigma) composed of 16–23 amino acids (depending on the hydrophilicity and molecular weight) to test in adhesion assays. GST-tagged maspin (GST-maspin) was produced as previously described (28Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Point mutants were constructed with a QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The primers are as follows: control mutant D177A, S178L, T180P (forward, 5′-GGATGAAGAAATTTCCGGCATTAGAACCAAAAGAATGTCC; reverse, 5′-GGACATTCTTTTGGTTCTAATGCCGGAAATTTCTTCATCC); single (E201K) mutant (forward, 5′-GATGAATCTTAAGGCCACTTTCTGCTTGGG; reverse, 5′-CCCAAGCAGAAAGTGGCCTTAAGATTCATC); double (K268E, K270E) mutant (forward, 5′-GGCCAATGCCGAAGTCGAACTTTCCCTCCC; reverse, 5′-GGGAGGGAAAGTTCGACTTCGGCATTGGCC). To develop the triple mutant (E201K,K268E,K270E), primers of mutant K268E, K270E, and E201K were used as the template. To verify their fidelity, the constructs were sequenced. The constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells and expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). Assays utilizing endogenous ECM proteins generated by MCF10A cells were performed as previously described (29Langhofer M. Hopkinson S.B. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 753-764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCF10A cells were plated in 96-well dishes and allowed to reach confluence. Cells were washed with PBS and treated for 5 min with fresh sterile 20 mm NH4OH followed by extensive water washes. Wells were blocked with heat-denatured BSA (10 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Subconfluent cultures were trypsinized, washed with 37 °C serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium, and incubated with either antibodies or recombinant proteins (500 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C (when assaying endogenous maspin, enzyme-free cell dissociation solution was used instead of trypsin). In all assays 2.0 × 104 cells were plated in triplicate and allowed to adhere for 30 min at 37 °C. The GST protein was used as a control. Wells were washed with 37 °C serum-free DMEM/F-12, and adhered cells were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal violet dye. Cell adhesion was determined by the reading at 590 nm subtracted by the blank value (determined by BSA-coated wells, 5% of maximal cell adhesion). Cell adhesion was plotted as the percentage of the corresponding control value. Cell surface stripping of uPA from uPAR was conducted as previously described (30Stoppelli M.P. Tacchetti C. Cubellis M.V. Corti A. Hearing V.J. Cassani G. Appella E. Blasi F. Cell. 1986; 45: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent cultures were washed twice with DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 1 mg/ml BSA. Then cells were incubated with 50 mm glycine-HCl (pH 3.0) with 100 mm NaCl at 25 °C for 2 min, and the reaction was halted by neutralizing with 500 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). In the function-blocking studies, cells were first incubated with the function blocking anti-uPAR or control rabbit IgG for 10 min; uPA and recombinant GST-maspin was added for another 20 min. Bacterial recombinant GST-maspin was labeled with 125I as described previously (31Conlon M. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc, Totowa, NJ2002: 971-977Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) and uPAR−/− MEFs (5.0 × 104 cells) were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS on 96-well plates overnight. Cells were chilled on ice for 30 min, washed 3 times with ice-cold DMEM, then blocked on ice for 60 min using blocking buffer (DMEM containing 5% heat-inactivated BSA). MEFs were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-GST-maspin in blocking buffer at 4 °C for 90 min. After incubation, unbound 125I-GST-maspin protein was removed by washing 3 times with blocking buffer. Specific 125I-GST-maspin binding was determined by subtracting the detected radioactivity by the nonspecific binding (determined in the presence of a 50-fold excess of non-labeled GST-maspin). In the studies evaluating the uPA-uPAR interactions, 125I-GST-maspin was treated with ABS4A and S-20 (Santa Cruz) antibodies, which block the RCL and N-terminal domains, before adding to WT MEF cells. In one set, WT MEF cells were treated with an anti-mouse uPAR antibody (R&D), which blocks uPA binding to uPAR. In the other set, WT MEF cells were stripped of uPA, then treated with the anti-mouse uPAR antibody and then administered uPA (800 nm) and 125I-GST-maspin. Results were reported as 125I-GST-maspin binding to WT MEF cell surface as a percentage of control (IgG) antibody treatment. Because MCF10A cells express uPAR at low levels, we overexpressed uPAR in MCF10A cells. Lysates from MCF10A cells overexpressing uPAR were prepared in lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycolate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific). Cellular debris was cleared from lysates by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Whole cell extracts (500 μg) were incubated overnight (constant rocking) with 5 μg of specific antisera or control rabbit irrelevant antiserum (Ki67) at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose-coupled beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Beads were centrifuged, washed 3 times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and boiled for 5 min in sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare), and probed for β1 integrin, uPAR, and maspin. Appropriate secondary antibodies were added, and proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Statistical differences between two individual groups were determined using an unpaired t test. Statistical significance was considered when the p value was less than 0.05. One key function of maspin is the regulation of cell motility and adhesion. After its discovery, researchers determined that maspin was ubiquitous in the cellular cytoplasm but was also localized to secretory vesicles and the cell surface (32Pemberton P.A. Tipton A.R. Pavloff N. Smith J. Erickson J.R. Mouchabeck Z.M. Kiefer M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additional studies by our laboratory and others further confirmed that maspin can be secreted or localized to the cell surface (8Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar, 9Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M.

Despite these findings, a recent study has suggested that maspin is an obligate intracellular protein that is not associated with the cytoskeleton or present on the cell surface (34Teoh S.S. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10862-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether MCF10A cells from our laboratory can export maspin into the culturing medium. In these experiments, we utilized human corneal epithelial cells as a positive control for maspin secretion. Studies have shown that maspin is expressed and secreted from corneal epithelial cells, which seems to regulate stromal wound healing and maintaining avascularity (8Ngamkitidechakul C. Burke J.M. O'Brien W.J. Twining S.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3135-3141PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, human corneal epithelial cells provide further evidence that maspin can be secreted from cells. Because the existence of extracellular maspin is crucial for the findings presented in this manuscript, we sought to verify that the MCF10A cells in our laboratory can export maspin. The culturing media was obtained from two different MCF10A populations; (i) cells obtained directly from ATCC or (ii) cells that have been cultured in our laboratory for 2 years and analyzed by Western immunoblot for maspin protein expression. Maspin was detected in all media and cells tested (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, using densitometry analysis, we discovered that the detection of extracellular maspin is significantly reduced in high passage MCF10A cells compared with the low passage cells (Fig. 1B). Additionally, intracellular maspin expression was elevated in the high passage MCF10A cells compared with the low passage cells. These results suggest that maspin is exported from MCF10A cells, and maspin secretion may be reduced by extended culturing conditions. MCF10A cells deposit ECM proteins and can nucleate adhesive complexes typical of epithelia (35Goldfinger L.E. Stack M.S. Jones J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 36Goldfinger L.E. Hopkinson S.B. deHart G.W. Collawn S. Couchman J.R. Jones J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our cell adhesion model, we previously demonstrated that the region between amino acids 139 and 225 in maspin appears to mediate cell adhesion (9Cella N. Contreras A. Latha K. Rosen J.M. Zhang M. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1510-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the exact region(s) involved has not been elucidated. To determine the region(s) of maspin that is involved in adhesion, we developed a variety of competitive peptides. First, we developed peptides that dissect the aforementioned region (amino acid residues 139–225) into peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 137–158, 169–189, 181–202, 190–211, and 203–225. Then, using Molsoft ICM software to analyze the tertiary structure of maspin, we developed peptides to other regions of maspin that are exposed such as the RCL-(329–343), 260–275, and the control peptide (97–112). Using these peptides, we determined which region of maspin is involved in mediating MCF10A cell adhesion. The only peptides (derived from amino acid residues 139–225) that did compete with GST-maspin were the 181–202 and 190–211 peptides (Fig. 2A). These results have identified the 190–202 region of maspin is partially responsible for mediating cell adhesion. In addition, we discovered a novel region between amino acids 260 and 275 that is also important in regulating maspin-mediated MCF10A cell adhesion (Fig. 2A). Although the 190–202 (blue) and 260–275 (green) peptides are separated by 58 amino acids in the primary structure of maspin, they are adjacent to one another in the tertiary structure (Fig. 2B). To further demonstrate that these regions are involved in maspin-mediated adhesion, we developed mutants of GST-maspin; single mutant (E201K), double mutant (K268E,K270E), triple mutant (E201K,K268E,K270E), and a control mutant (D177A, S178L, T180P). The single (E201K) mutant corresponds to peptide 181–202, whereas the double (K268E,K270E) mutant corresponds to peptide 260–275. The control (D177A, S178L, T180P) mutant failed to have any reduced cell adhesion. However, both the single and double GST-maspin mutants had significantly reduced MCF10A cell adhesion (by 16 and 17%, respectively) as compared with WT GST-maspin (Fig. 2C). The triple (E201K,K268E,K270E) mutant had an additive effect whereby MCF10A cell adhesion was decreased by ∼28% when compared with WT GST-maspin (Fig. 2C). These findings support the notion that proximal amino acid residues from 190–202 and 260–275 in maspin mediate its effect on MCF10A cell adhesion. Recent accumulating evidence suggests an important role of the uPA-uPAR complex in regulating cell adhesion (24Smith H.W. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 37Dass K. Ahmad A. Azmi A.S. Sarkar S.H. Sarkar F.H. Cancer Treat. Rev. 2008; 34: 122-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Because maspin is localized with the uPA-uPAR complex at the cell surface (12Yin S. Lockett J. Meng Y. Biliran Jr., H. Blouse G.E. Li X. Reddy N. Zhao Z. Lin X. Anagli J. Cher M.L. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we investigated whether uPAR is involved in maspin binding to the cell surface. Using WT and uPAR−/− MEFs, we found that WT MEFs displayed specific 125I-GST-maspin binding, whereas uPAR−/− MEFs were absent of any specific 125I-GST-maspin binding using concentrations within the normal physiological range (<500 nm) (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that uPAR expression is necessary for maspin to bind or localize to the cell surface. In this study and others (11Al-Ayyoubi M. Schwartz B.S. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19502-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we have implied that a region proximal to the RCL of maspin is involved in mediating cell adhesion. Therefore, we determined the binding of 125I-GST-maspin to WT MEF cells that were incubated with either control (IgG), RCL (ABS4A), or N-terminal (S-20) blocking antibodies. We found that only the RCL (and/or surrounding area) and not the N terminus of maspin is necessary for maspin binding to the surface of WT MEFs (Fig. 3B). To determine whether the uPA-uPAR complex is required for 125I-GST-maspin binding to MEF cell surface, we used an antibody that disrupts uPA binding to uPAR. In the first set of experiments, treatment with this antibody did not change the binding of 125I-GST-maspin to WT MEF cells (Fig. 3C, first set). However, 125I-GST-maspin binding to the WT MEF cell surface is reduced when cells were stripped of uPA and incubated with the uPAR blocking antibody before reintroducing exogenous uPA and 125I-GST-maspin (Fig. 3C). These results demonstrated that cell surface localization of maspin requires not only uPAR but the uPA-uPAR complex. As stated earlier, maspin binds to both uPA and pro-uPA, causing reduced cell attachment by strengthening mature focal adhesion contacts (12Yin S. Lockett J. Meng Y. Biliran Jr., H. Blouse G.E. Li X. Reddy N. Zhao Z. Lin X. Anagli J. Cher M.L. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4173-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A current model proposes that an unidentified region of maspin, in close proximity to the RCL, is responsible for maspin binding to uPA (and pro-uPA) (11Al-Ayyoubi M. Schwartz B.S. Gettins P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19502-19509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that the amino acid residues from 190–202 and 260–275 in maspin mediate its effect on cell adhesion, and these regions are proximal to the RCL (Fig. 2). Using this information, we hypothesized that the association of maspin and uPA may mediate cell adhesion. To test this hypothesis, we acid-stripped endogenous uPA before the addition of GST-maspin and evaluated the effect on MCF10A cell adhesion. Stripping uPA substantially blocks maspin-induced MCF10A cell adhesion (Fig. 4A). To verify that this ablation of maspin-induced adhesion was a direct effect of uPA removal, we resupplied uPA-stripped MCF10A cells with exogenous uPA (800 nm). In fact, the addition of exogenous uPA rescues the maspin-mediated adhesion of uPA-stripped MCF10A cells (154.06% of GST control, Fig. 4A). These experiments demonstrate that uPA is needed for maspin-mediated adhesion. These combined studies revealed that uPAR or uPA removal from the surface of MCF10A cells ablates maspin localization to the cell surface (Fig. 3) and its ability to enhance cell adhesion (Fig. 4A). However, whether uPA and uPAR function independently or if the localization and adhesion functions of maspin require the uPA-uPAR complex is still not clear. Therefore, we utilized uPAR blocking antibody (anti-uPAR, blocks"

Here, we used a mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic murine model of bone-metastatic prostate cancer, RM1(BM), to determine how inhibiting osteolysis with ZOL affects the ability of these cells to establish metastases in bone, the integrity of the tumour-bearing bones and the survival of the tumour-bearing mice.The model involves intracardiac injection for arterial dissemination of the RM1(BM) cells in C57BL/6 mice. ZOL treatment was given via subcutaneous injections on days 0, 4, 8 and 12, at 20 and 100 µg/kg doses. Bone integrity was assessed by micro-computed tomography and histology with comparison to untreated mice. The osteoclast and osteoblast activity was determined by measuring serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP 5b) and osteocalcin, respectively. Mice were euthanased according to predetermined criteria and survival was assessed using Kaplan Meier plots.Micro-CT and histological analysis showed that treatment of mice with ZOL from the day of intracardiac injection of RM1(BM) cells inhibited tumour-induced bone lysis, maintained bone volume and reduced the calcification of tumour-induced endochondral osteoid material. ZOL treatment also led to a decreased serum osteocalcin and TRAP 5b levels. Additionally, treated mice showed increased survival compared to vehicle treated controls. However, ZOL treatment did not inhibit the cells ability to metastasise to bone as the number of bone-metastases was similar in both treated and untreated mice.ZOL treatment provided significant benefits for maintaining the integrity of tumour-bearing bones and increased the survival of tumour bearing mice, though it did not prevent establishment of bone-metastases in this model. From the mechanistic view, these observations confirm that tumour-induced bone lysis is not a requirement for establishment of these bone tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2014373208,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and tuberculosis (TB) are two of the world's most devastating diseases. The first vaccine the majority of infants born in Africa receive is Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) as a prevention against TB. BCG protects against disseminated disease in the first 10 years of life, but provides a variable protection against pulmonary TB and enhancing boost delivered by recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) expressing antigen 85A (Ag85A) of M. tuberculosis is currently in phase IIb evaluation in African neonates. If the newborn's mother is positive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the baby is at high risk of acquiring HIV-1 through breastfeeding. We suggested that a vaccination consisting of recombinant BCG expressing HIV-1 immunogen administered at birth followed by a boost with rMVA sharing the same immunogen could serve as a strategy for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 and rMVA expressing an African HIV-1-derived immunogen HIVA is currently in phase I trials in African neonates. Here, we aim to develop a dual neonate vaccine platform against HIV-1 and TB consisting of BCG.HIVA administered at birth followed by a boost with MVA.HIVA.85A. Thus, mMVA.HIVA.85A and sMVA.HIVA.85A vaccines were constructed, in which the transgene transcription is driven by either modified H5 or short synthetic promoters, respectively, and tested for immunogenicity alone and in combination with BCG.HIVA222. mMVA.HIVA.85A was produced markerless and thus suitable for clinical manufacture. While sMVA.HIVA.85A expressed higher levels of the immunogens, it was less immunogenic than mMVA.HIVA.85A in BALB/c mice. A BCG.HIVA222–mMVA.HIVA.85A prime-boost regimen induced robust T cell responses to both HIV-1 and M. tuberculosis. Therefore, proof-of-principle for a dual anti-HIV-1/M. tuberculosis infant vaccine platform is established. Induction of immune responses against these pathogens soon after birth is highly desirable and may provide a basis for lifetime protection maintained by boosts later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2043619137,"Over the past decade, firefly Luciferase (fLuc) has been used in a wide range of biological assays, providing insight into gene regulation, protein-protein interactions, cell proliferation, and cell migration. However, it has also been well established that fLuc activity can be highly sensitive to its surrounding environment. In this study, we found that when various cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, and 293T) stably expressing fLuc were treated with staurosporine (STS), there was a rapid loss in bioluminescence. In contrast, a stable variant of Renilla luciferase (RLuc), RLuc8, exhibited significantly prolonged functionality under the same conditions. To identify the specific underlying mechanism(s) responsible for the disparate sensitivity of RLuc8 and fLuc to cellular stress, we conducted a series of inhibition studies that targeted known intracellular protein degradation/modification pathways associated with cell death. Interestingly, these studies suggested that reactive oxygen species, particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), was responsible for the diminution of fLuc activity. Consistent with these findings, the direct application of H2O2 to HeLa cells also led to a reduction in fLuc bioluminescence, while H2O2 scavengers stabilized fLuc activity. Comparatively, RLuc8 was far less sensitive to ROS. These observations suggest that fLuc activity can be substantially altered in studies where ROS levels become elevated and can potentially lead to ambiguous or misleading findings."

We have previously shown an association between an EphB2 germline nonsense variant and risk of familial prostate cancer among African American Men (AAM). Here we set out to test the hypothesis that common variation within the EphB2 locus is associated with increased risk of sporadic PC in AAM. We genotyped a set of 341 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) encompassing the EphB2 locus, including known and novel coding and noncoding variants, in 490 AA sporadic PC cases and 567 matched controls. Single marker-based logistical regression analyses revealed seven EphB2 SNPs showing statistically significant association with prostate cancer risk in our population. The most significant association was achieved for a novel synonymous coding SNP, TGen-624, (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.22; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08-0.66, p = 1×10(-5)). Two other SNPs also show significant associations toward a protective effect rs10465543 and rs12090415 (p = 1×10(-4)), OR = 0.49 and 0.7, respectively. Two additional SNPs revealed trends towards an increase in risk of prostate cancer, rs4612601 and rs4263970 (p = 0.001), OR = 1.35 and 1.31, respectively. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed low levels of linkage disequilibrium within the region, with two blocks being associated with prostate cancer risk among our population. These data suggest that genetic variation at the EphB2 locus may increase risk of sporadic PC among AAM."

Therefore, a multigene transformation strategy for use in plant molecular biology and plant genetic breeding is thus needed. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe a versatile, ready-to-use multigene genetic transformation method, named the Recombination-assisted Multifunctional DNA Assembly Platform (RMDAP), which combines many of the useful features of existing plant transformation systems. This platform incorporates three widely-used recombination systems, namely, Gateway technology, in vivo Cre/loxP and recombineering into a highly efficient and reliable approach for gene assembly. RMDAP proposes a strategy for gene stacking and contains a wide range of flexible, modular vectors offering a series of functionally validated genetic elements to manipulate transgene overexpression or gene silencing involved in a metabolic pathway. In particular, the ability to construct a multigene marker-free vector is another attractive feature. The built-in flexibility of original vectors has greatly increased the expansibility and applicability of the system. A proof-of-principle experiment was confirmed by successfully transferring several heterologous genes into the plant genome. Conclusions/Significance This platform is a ready-to-use toolbox for full exploitation of the potential for coordinate regulation of metabolic pathways and molecular breeding, and will eventually achieve the aim of what we call “one-stop breeding.”"
https://openalex.org/W2035099435,"Tumor overexpression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its specific inhibitor SerpinE1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1) correlates with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential. Conversely, tumor expression of uPA and another specific inhibitor, SerpinB2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor type-2), are associated with favorable outcome and relapse-free survival. It is not known how overexpression of these uPA inhibitors results in such disparate outcomes. A possible explanation may be related to the presence of a proposed low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-binding motif in SerpinE1 responsible for mitogenic signaling via ERK that is absent in SerpinB2. We now show that complementation of such a LDLR-binding motif in SerpinB2 by mutagenesis of two key residues enabled high affinity binding to very LDLR (VLDLR). Furthermore, the VLDLR-binding SerpinB2 form behaved in a manner indistinguishable from SerpinE1 in terms of enhanced uPA-SerpinB2 complex endocytosis and subsequent ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation; that is, the introduction of the LDLR-binding motif to SerpinB2 was necessary and sufficient to allow it to acquire characteristics of SerpinE1 associated with malignancy. In conclusion, this study defines the structural elements underlying the distinct interactions of SerpinE1 versus SerpinB2 with endocytic receptors and how differential VLDLR binding impacts on downstream cellular behavior. This has clear relevance to understanding the paradoxical disease outcomes associated with overexpression of these serpins in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W1992700454,"We report that the production of hydrogen peroxide by radical chain reductions of molecular oxygen into water in buffers leads to hinge degradation of a human IgG1 under thermal incubation conditions. The production of the hydrogen peroxide can be accelerated by superoxide dismutase or redox active metal ions or inhibited by free radical scavengers. The hydrogen peroxide production rate correlates well with the hinge cleavage. In addition to radical reaction mechanisms described previously, new degradation pathways and products were observed. These products were determined to be generated via radical reactions initiated by electron transfer and addition to the interchain disulfide bond between Cys(215) of the light chain and Cys(225) of the heavy chain. Decomposition of the resulting disulfide bond radical anion breaks the C-S bond at the side chain of Cys, converting it into dehydroalanine and generating a sulfur radical adduct at its counterpart. The hydrolysis of the unsaturated dehydropeptides removes Cys and yields an amide at the C terminus of the new fragment. Meanwhile, the competition between the carbonyl (-C(α)ONH-) and the side chain of Cys allows an electron transfer to the α carbon, forming a new intermediate radical species (-(·)C(α)(O(-))NH-) at Cys(225). Dissociative deamidation occurs along the N-C(α) bond, resulting in backbone cleavage. Given that hydrogen peroxide is a commonly observed product of thermal stress and plays a role in mediating the unique degradation of an IgG1, strategies for improving stability of human antibody therapeutics are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2116286905,"OriP, the latent origin of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), consists of two essential elements: the dyad symmetry (DS) and the family of repeats (FR). The function of these elements has been predominantly analyzed in plasmids transfected into transformed cells. Here, we examined the molecular functions of DS in its native genomic context and at an ectopic position in the mini-EBV episome. Mini-EBV plasmids contain 41% of the EBV genome including all information required for the proliferation of human B cells. Both FR and DS function independently of their genomic context. We show that DS is the most active origin of replication present in the mini-EBV genome regardless of its location, and it is characterized by the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) allowing subsequent replication initiation. Surprisingly, the integrity of oriP is not required for the formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) at or near DS. In addition we show that initiation events occurring at sites other than the DS are also limited to once per cell cycle and that they are ORC-dependent. The deletion of DS increases initiation from alternative origins, which are normally used very infrequently in the mini-EBV genome. The sequence-independent distribution of ORC-binding, pre-RC-assembly, and initiation patterns indicates that a large number of silent origins are present in the mini-EBV genome. We conclude that, in mini-EBV genomes lacking the DS element, the absence of a strong ORC binding site results in an increase of ORC binding at dispersed sites."

This makes it necessary to predict patient outcome so as to improve the accuracy of treatment. Although the antiviral mechanism of genetically altered IL28B is unknown, IL28B polymorphism is considered a good predictor of IFN combination treatment outcome. Methodology Using microarray, we quantified the expression profile of 237 IFN related genes in 87 CH liver biopsy specimens to clarify the relationship between IFN pathway and viral elimination, and to predict patients' clinical outcome. In 72 out of 87 patients we also analyzed IL28B polymorphism (rs8099917). Principal Findings Five IFN related-genes (IFI27, IFI 44, ISG15, MX1, and OAS1) had expression levels significantly higher in nonresponders (NR) than in normal liver (NL) and sustained virological responders (SVR); this high expression was also frequently seen in cases with the minor (TG or GG) IL28B genotype. The expression pattern of 31 IFN related-genes also differed significantly between NR and NL. We predicted drug response in NR with 86.1% accuracy by diagonal linear discriminant analysis (DLDA). Conclusion IFN system dysregulation before treatment was associated with poor IFN therapy response. Determining IFN related-gene expression pattern based on patients' response to combination therapy, allowed us to predict drug response with high accuracy. This method can be applied to establishing novel antiviral therapies and strategies for patients using a more individual approach."

However, little is known about changes in coronary risk factors in different socioeconomic groups. This study examined whether changes in established coronary risk factors in Britain over 20 years between 1978–80 and 1998–2000 differed between socioeconomic groups. Methods and Findings A socioeconomically representative cohort of 7735 British men aged 40–59 years was followed-up from 1978–80 to 1998–2000; data on blood pressure (BP), cholesterol, body mass index (BMI) and cigarette smoking were collected at both points in 4252 survivors. Social class was based on longest-held occupation in middle-age. Compared with men in non-manual occupations, men in manual occupations experienced a greater increase in BMI (mean difference = 0.33 kg/m2; 95%CI 0.14–0.53; p for interaction = 0.001), a smaller decline in non-HDL cholesterol (difference in mean change = 0.18 mmol/l; 95%CI 0.11–0.25, p for interaction≤0.0001) and a smaller increase in HDL cholesterol (difference in mean change = 0.04 mmol/l; 95%CI 0.02–0.06, p for interaction≤0.0001). However, mean systolic BP declined more in manual than non-manual groups (difference in mean change = 3.6; 95%CI 2.1–5.1, p for interaction≤0.0001). The odds of being a current smoker in 1978–80 and 1998–2000 did not differ between non-manual and manual social classes (p for interaction = 0.51). Conclusion Several key risk factors for CHD and type 2 diabetes showed less favourable changes in men in manual occupations. Continuing priority is needed to improve adverse cardiovascular risk profiles in socially disadvantaged groups in the UK."

Analysis of the purified scFv indicated that it has the same specificity and affinity as the original mAb. Cell viability assays and xenograft model results suggested that the humanized scFv possesses anti-tumor growth activity in vitro and in vivo.

Analysis of the humanized phage antibodies by phage ELISA revealed that the antibodies retained high antigen-binding activity and detected the same epitope as the parent mAb E10. A humanized single chain Fv (scFv) antibody was expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. Analysis of the purified scFv indicated that it has the same specificity and affinity as the original mAb. Cell viability assays and xenograft model results suggested that the humanized scFv possesses anti-tumor growth activity in vitro and in vivo. This successful production of a humanized scFv with the ability to inhibit αvβ3-mediated cancer cell growth may provide a novel candidate for integrin αvβ3-targeted therapy. Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from preexisting vessels, is a fundamental process during cancer progression (1Cavallaro U. Christofori G. J. Neurooncol. 2000; 50: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Tumor angiogenesis is a complex process that depends on the balance between proangiogenic molecules and anti-angiogenic molecules (2Keshet E. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Inhibition of angiogenesis is an emerging practice for cancer treatment. Anti-angiogenesis therapy hinders tumor growth by limiting the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tumor. This therapy has multiple advantages over other anti-cancer treatments, such as fewer side effects, fewer resistance problems, and applicability to a broad spectrum of tumors (3Klohs W.D. Hamby J.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two new anti-angiogenesis peptides have been shown to effectively inhibit tumor growth in mouse models (3Klohs W.D. Hamby J.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Black W.R. Agner R.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 450Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One of these, Avastin, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, which is active during the generation of new blood vessels in tumors (5Rosenfeld P.J. Rich R.M. Lalwani G.A. Ophthalmol. Clin. North Am. 2006; 19: 361-372PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 6Wu L. Martínez-Castellanos M.A. Quiroz-Mercado H. Arevalo J.F. Berrocal M.H. Farah M.E. Maia M. Roca J.A. Rodriguez F.J. Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 2008; 246: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins composed of a single α and a single β chain that have activated or non-activated conformations. Integrins are involved in a wide range of cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions (7Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 8Hodivala-Dilke K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and they play an important role in tumor angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. The αvβ3 integrin, which is expressed in many tumor cells, is significantly up-regulated on the endothelium during angiogenesis but is not seen on quiescent endothelium and is considered the most important integrin for angiogenesis (7Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 9Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 10Cai W. Chen X. Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 407-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The αvβ3 integrin can also cooperate with several cytokines or proteinases, including matrix metalloproteinase 2, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and platelet-derived growth factor, and thereby promote tumor angiogenesis (11Landen C.N. Kim T.J. Lin Y.G. Merritt W.M. Kamat A.A. Han L.Y. Spannuth W.A. Nick A.M. Jennnings N.B. Kinch M.S. Tice D. Sood A.K. Neoplasia. 2008; 10: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This integrin is therefore a potential target for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. Monoclonal antibodies and low-molecular-weight antagonists against αvβ3 have been shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation through obstructing the integrin binding to its ligand. The mAb LM609 and human monoclonal antibody Vitaxin were found to be effective in vivo and in vitro (12Patel S.R. Jenkins J. Papadopolous N. Burgess M.A. Plager C. Gutterman J. Benjamin R.S. Cancer. 2001; 92: 1347-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 6471-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), the RGD mimetic cilengitide has been shown to be effective in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (14Nabors L.B. Mikkelsen T. Rosenfeld S.S. Hochberg F. Akella N.S. Fisher J.D. Cloud G.A. Zhang Y. Carson K. Wittemer S.M. Colevas A.D. Grossman S.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 1651-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the integrin αvβ3 antagonist S247 was shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in a mouse model (15Reinmuth N. Liu W. Ahmad S.A. Fan F. Stoeltzing O. Parikh A.A. Bucana C.D. Gallick G.E. Nickols M.A. Westlin W.F. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2079-2087PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant antibody-based treatments are becoming increasingly available and are showing exciting clinical successes. Single-chain Fv (scFv) 2The abbreviations used are: scFvsingle-chain FvSCsecretory componentWBWestern blot. antibodies consist of VH and VL regions only, thus representing the smallest fragments capable of retaining the full binding structure of a native antibody. Compared with whole antibodies, scFvs have many advantages. An scFv is composed of the variable antigen binding regions (VH and VL) without the Fc portion, which may interact with Fc receptors on normal tissues (16Luk J.M. Wong K.F. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2006; 33: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that scFvs can penetrate into tumors more efficiently and facilitate faster systemic clearance (17Kuan C.T. Srivastava N. McLendon R.E. Marasco W.A. Zalutsky M.R. Bigner D.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 127: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A humanized scFv to integrin αvβ6 has recently been shown to possess good therapeutic potential to block cancer cell invasion (18Kogelberg H. Tolner B. Thomas G.J. Di Cara D. Minogue S. Ramesh B.

E10, a mouse monoclonal antibody against human integrin αvβ3 with the ability to inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, was previously produced in our lab 3D. Liu, C. Wang, C. Li, X. Zhang, B. Zhang, Z. Mi, X. An, and Y. Tong, unpublished data. . In this study, this mouse antibody was used in a humanization protocol (19Rader C. Cheresh D.A. Barbas 3rd., C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and several humanized phage Fab antibodies that recognize the same epitope as E10 were selected. We then constructed an scFv vector that expressed one of these humanized antibodies, D5, in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. The purified scFv protein was analyzed by several methods and showed antigen-binding activity to human integrin αvβ3. Furthermore, a cell viability study demonstrated that the scFv acts to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro, suggesting that this scFv could become a candidate drug for tumor immunotherapy. MDA-MB-435 human breast carcinoma cells were obtained from Peking Union Medical College. HT-29 cells were from our laboratory stores. Human integrin αvβ3 protein was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated anti-M13, and HRP-conjugated anti-His tag antibodies were obtained from Merck (Shanghai, China). E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Shanghai, China) was used as the host for the expression of soluble scFv protein. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Takara (Dalian, China). The mouse monoclonal antibody (E10) was humanized as described previously (19Rader C. Cheresh D.A. Barbas 3rd., C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, two sequential phage antibody displays with predetermined CDR3 were conducted to humanize the light chain and Fd fragment of the heavy chain, respectively. First, the light chain CDR3 of mouse monoclonal antibody E10 was fused with a human light chain antibody gene library (FR1 through FR3), and this fusion library was inserted into the antibody, displaying phagemid vector pComb3 between the SacI and XbaI sites. The chimeric Fd containing the E10 heavy chain variable region fused with human heavy chain constant region 1 (CH1) was inserted between the XhoI and SpeI sites. After four rounds of biopanning of this phage-displayed antibody library against human integrin αvβ3, the resultant humanized light chain antibody clones were screened and used for a second humanization step. In this second step, the humanized light chain genes were inserted into the SacI and XbaI sites of pComb3, and the heavy chain library containing the E10 heavy chain variable region CDR3 and human heavy chain variable region FR1 through FR3, as well as the human CH1 gene, were inserted into the XhoI and SpeI sites. Electrotransformation of the constructed phagemid library into the E. coli strain XL1-Blue resulted in a phage-displayed antibody library with the humanized heavy chain. After four rounds of biopanning against immobilized human integrin αvβ3, several phage antibodies with high antigen-binding activity were selected, and humanized heavy chain genes were obtained. In the panning procedure, the human integrin αvβ3 (100 μg/ml of protein in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.6)) was coated on ELISA plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then blocked at 37 °C for 2 h with 5 mg/ml BSA in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer and washed four times with TBST (TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20). The phage library was added (1012 pfu in 100 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After phage binding, the wells were washed 10 times with TBST (TBS plus 0.1% Tween 20), and the bound phages were eluted using 100 μl of elution buffer (0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.2), 1 mg/ml BSA) per well. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 2 m Tris-base. The eluted phages were amplified as described previously (20Tsui P. Tornetta M.A. Ames R.S. Silverman C. Porter T. Weston C. Griego S. Sweet R.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 263: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Binding activity of the phage-displayed antibody was measured by phage ELISA. ELISA plates were coated with 200 ng/well of human integrin αvβ3 protein at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then blocked at 37 °C for 2 h with 10% nonfat milk and washed four times with PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20). The phage antibody was mixed with equal amounts nonfat milk and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. This mixture was added at 100 μl/well and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The helper phage VCSM13 was used as a negative control. The plates were washed four times with PBST, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. Color was developed with TAB (0.05% hydrogen chloride, 0.2 mg/ml 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine, 2.5 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate, 0.1% H2O2, 50 mm sodium citrate) solution (Sigma, Shanghai, China), and the plates were read in an ELISA reader at 450 nm. Nonspecific reactivity of the phage antibodies was analyzed using two antigens: BSA and hepatitis B virus surface antigen by indirect ELISA, as described above. The positive phage antibody clones were also analyzed by competitive ELISA to verify their binding to the same epitope. In these competitive ELISAs, the human integrin αvβ3 protein was coated on ELISA plates. The mouse antibody E10 was diluted into different concentrations and was mixed with the positive phage antibody clones. The mixture was used as primary antibody and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Other steps of the competitive ELISA were the same as for the indirect ELISA. Two heavy chain primers and two light chain primers were designed based on the sequence of humanized antibody clone D5. The phagemid D5 was used as the template, and two heavy chain primers (VHBam, 5′-CGG GAT CCA CCA TGA AGG TGA AAC TGC TC-3′ and LNKr, 5′-AGC CAC CTC CGC CTG AAC CGC CTC CAC CTG AGG AGA CGG TGA C-3′) were used to amplify the VH coding regions, whereas the VL fragments were obtained by PCR using two light chain primers (VLrKpn, 5′-GGC GAT ATT TTG ATT TCC ACC TTG G-3′ and LNK, 5′-CAG GCG GAG GTG GCT CTG GCG GTG GCG GAT CGG AGC TCG TGA TGA CC-3′). The scFv gene was amplified by overlapping extension PCR. The VH and VL fragments were mixed as the template, and primers VHBam and VLrKpn were used to amplify the scFv gene. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRV and inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE80L (Novagen), which was digested with BamHI and SmaI to create expression plasmid pQE80L-scFv. E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformed with pQE80L-scFv was cultured in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until the logarithmic phase of growth was reached (at A 600 0.5–0.6). Bacteria were induced for production of scFv protein by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mm for 6 h at 25 °C. Bacteria from cultures were centrifuged, and the cytoplasm was extracted after sonication. The total bacterial proteins were then partitioned into soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was collected, and the pellets (insoluble fraction), which contained the inclusion bodies, were resuspended in deionized water. Both fractions were analyzed in parallel by 15% SDS-PAGE to characterize the solubility of the scFv proteins. Then the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and then loaded onto a gravity-flow column packed with 3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin slurry (Novagen). His-tagged scFv protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the yield was quantified using a Coomassie protein assay kit (Biomed, Beijing, China) (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 7: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE using 15% gels was performed to validate the identity and evaluate the purity of the target fusion proteins. The human integrin αvβ3 protein was coated at 200 ng/well in ELISA plates at 4 °C overnight. The plates were then blocked at 37 °C for 2 h with 10% nonfat milk and washed four times with PBST. The scFv proteins were added as the primary antibodies at various dilutions (0.05 nm, 0.1 nm, 0.5 nm, 1.0 nm, 2.0 nm, and 5.0 nm diluted in PBST). An irrelevant protein, human secretory component (SC), which is also expressed by the pQE80L vector, was used as a negative control. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, the plates were washed four times with PBST, followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-His tag antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. Color was developed with TAB solution, and the plates were read in an ELISA reader at 450 nm. For Western blot (WB) analysis, the human integrin αvβ3 proteins were first subjected to SDS-PAGE and then electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane. Protein scFv and mAb E10 were used as primary antibodies, with His-tagged SC as a negative control. The bound antibodies were detected using either HRP-conjugated anti-His-tagged SC as a negative control. The bound antibodies were detected using either HRP-conjugated anti-His tag antibody or HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in PBST at room temperature for 90 min. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL WB analysis system (Pierce). Far WB has been derived from the standard Western blotting method to allow the detection of protein-protein interactions in vitro (21Wu Y. Li Q. Chen X.Z. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3278-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysate of pQE80L-scFv was firstly separated by SDS-PAGE and then electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane. The cell lysates of pQE80L-SC and purified scFv protein were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The proteins in the membrane were denatured and renatured by gradually reducing the guanidine-HCl concentration. The membrane was blocked before incubation with human integrin αvβ3 protein (1 μg/ml diluted in PBST). After four washes with PBST, the membrane was incubated with mAb E10 for 2 h at room temperature, and the bound antibodies were detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL WB analysis system. The recombinant scFv protein was also analyzed by immunocytochemical assays. The human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435 was cultured and fixed on glass slides. MDA-MB-435 cells were rinsed with 0.1 m PBS and blocked with 10% nonfat milk in TBST for 20 min, then incubated with the recombinant protein scFv at 4 °C overnight. Protein SC and mAb E10 were used as controls. After washing with PBS, the cell was incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. The staining intensity was evaluated by microscopic observation. The Cell Titer 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Beijing, China) was used to determine the number of viable cells in proliferation assays, as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells (1000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates. The medium was replaced 24 h later with serum-reduced growth medium, and the scFv antibody was added at a concentration range from 5 pm to 5 nm. Equimolar amounts of mAb E10 and anti-His mAb were used as controls. The cells were incubated for 24 h before the medium was replaced by MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetra zolium) solution. The plates were further incubated for 1–4 h at 37 °C before the absorbance was read at 490 nm. Female athymic BALB/c mice at 4 weeks of age were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center, Military Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and were rested for 1 week before use. The animal study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice received 1 × 106 MDA-MB-435 cells in 100 μl of PBS per mouse, injected subcutaneously into the right flank. When subcutaneous tumors became measurable, they were measured daily with a caliper in three perpendicular directions. When tumors had grown to ∼50 mm3 (about 2 weeks after implantation), tumor-bearing mice were randomized into two groups that received either the scFv or SC protein. Eight mice per group were treated by intravenous injection with 30 μg scFv protein or equimolar amounts of SC protein in 100 μl of PBS on days 0, 4, and 8. Mice were followed for 3 weeks, and the tumor growth was measured manually using a caliper ruler. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses of data were performed using Student's t test. In all cases, p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. An antibody light chain library containing mAb E10 light chain CDR3 was constructed as described under “Materials and Methods. The capacity of the antibody library was about 2.1 × 106, and the titer of the antibody library was determined to be 8.96 × 1014 plaque-forming units/ml. Twenty phage clones were randomly selected from the library and analyzed by PCR, which showed that the antibody gene insertion frequency was 80%. After four rounds of panning against immobilized human integrin αvβ3, 30 phage clones were picked randomly and analyzed by phage ELISA. Ten of the selected clones were found to bind to human integrin αvβ3. The potential cross-reactivity of these positive phage antibody clones was analyzed by indirect ELISA using two irrelevant protein antigens (BSA and hepatitis B virus surface antigen). These results indicated that all of the positive clones specifically recognize the human integrin αvβ3 with no significant nonspecific reactivity (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, competitive ELISA showed that the antigen-binding activity of three of the clones (B12, B8, and A20) is inhibited by mAb E10, suggesting that these three phage antibodies target the same epitope as the mAb E10 (Fig. 1B). Following generation of the light chain antibody library, a heavy chain antibody library was also generated from mAb E10. This pComb3-based heavy chain library expressed the humanized light chain gene B12 and contained a human Fd gene library with E10 heavy chain grafted to HCDR3. Electrotransformation of these heavy chain constructs into E. coli strain XL1-Blue resulted in a phage-displayed antibody library with a capacity of 2.0 × 107. Twenty phage clones were randomly selected from this library, and PCR analysis results suggested that the human antibody heavy chain insertion frequency was 50%. After four rounds of panning against immobilized human integrin αvβ3, 20 phage clones were picked randomly, and the antigen-binding activity and cross-reactivity of these clones were analyzed by phage ELISA. Eight clones were found to have high antigen-binding capacity with human integrin αvβ3 with no significant cross-reactivity with irrelevant antigens (Fig. 2A). Competitive ELISA showed that the antigen-binding activity of three highly reactive phage clones (C16, D5, and D10) was inhibited by mAb E10, suggesting that these antibodies detected the same epitope as mAb E10 (Fig. 2B). The heavy chain and the light chain sequences of the clone with strongest antigen-binding activity, D5, were determined. Homology analysis and germ line gene analysis indicated that the light chain had a typical human immunoglobulin structure and belonged to the VKIII family and that the heavy chain belonged to the VH1 gene family (GenBank Nucleotide Sequence Database accession numbers AY489290 and DQ192641). This newly generated scFv construct was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pQE80L to create the expression plasmid pQE80L-scFv, as described under “Materials and Methods.” pQE80L-scFv was transformed into the E. coli host strain BL21 (DE3), and the recombinant protein scFv was produced. The recombinant protein can be expressed in E. coli as both soluble and insoluble forms of ∼28 kDa, with recombinant proteins comprising about 28% of the total soluble protein extract (Fig. 3). Recombinant proteins were purified from cell lysates as described under “Materials and Methods.” To investigate the antigen-specificity of the recombinant scFv, an ELISA assay was performed using human integrin αvβ3 as a capture antigen. Increasing concentrations of scFv corresponded to enhanced colorimetric signals, but no significant background was detected in wells where irrelevant proteins were used as negative controls (Fig. 4A). The recombinant scFv protein sample was also analyzed by WB analysis. The human integrin αvβ3 protein was first subjected to SDS-PAGE. The scFv detected a polypeptide band corresponding to the human integrin αvβ3 at a fragment size similar to that of mAb E10, whereas no background staining was detected with the negative protein SC (Fig. 4B). Far WB analysis demonstrated that human integrin αvβ3 protein can bind to the recombinant scFv but is unable to recognize SC protein. These results also imply that the recombinant scFv retains the desired antigen-binding activity (Fig. 4C). To verify whether the purified scFv was able to bind integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, cells of the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-435, which express αvβ3, were incubated with the purified scFv and examined by immunocytochemical assay. These assays showed that the scFv bound to integrin αvβ3 expressed on the membrane of MDA-MB-435 cells to a similar extent to that observed with mAb E10, whereas SC protein did not react with MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 5). To test whether the scFv was able to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro, MDA-MB-435 cells and HT-29 cells, which have been reported to be integrin αvβ3-negative (22Liu Z. Jia B. Zhao H. Chen X. Wang F. Mol. Imaging Biol. 2011; 13: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), were incubated with purified scFv or control antibody. Then cell viability was examined by MTS assay. The results suggest that the humanized scFv has good anti-tumor growth activity in vitro. The mAb E10 also inhibited MDA-MB-435 cell growth, but the negative antibody had no effect on MDA-MB-435 cell growth (Fig. 6A). Another result showed that the humanized scFv cannot influence HT-29 cell growth (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the scFv can specially bind to the integrin αvβ3 to inhibit tumor cell growth. Neither mAb E10 nor anti-His mAb had any effect on HT-29 cell growth (data not shown). Effects of the humanized scFv on tumor growth were tested in a MDA-MB-435 cell murine xenograft model. When tumors had grown to ∼50 mm3, mice were treated by intravenous injection with scFv protein or SC protein, which had also been expressed by the pQE80L vector. Mice were followed for 3 weeks, and the tumor growth was measured manually using a caliper ruler. The results suggest that tumor growth was delayed significantly by multiple injections of humanized scFv protein (Fig. 7). The SC protein had almost no effect on the tumor growth, similar to the control group. Integrin αvβ3 is a heterodimeric transmembrane glycoprotein and is believed to be involved in tumor angiogenesis because of its increased expression in proliferating vascular endothelial cells (8Hodivala-Dilke K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Integrin αvβ3 can bind to extracellular matrix protein through the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence and plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis and the migration of cancer (23Avraamides C.J. Garmy-Susini B. Varner J.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Therefore, if it is possible to interfere with αvβ3 expression at the endothelial surface of tumor cells, tumor angiogenesis may be inhibited and tumor growth may be slowed because of a lack of cellular nutrition. The mouse monoclonal antibody LM609, specific for the human integrin αvβ3, has been shown to have anti-tumor activity in vivo (13Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 6471-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, mouse antibodies may cause human anti-mouse antibody responses, resulting in a short serum half-life of these antibodies, which severely limits their clinical applicability. Human antibodies are much less immunogenic in humans and are therefore more desirable candidates for therapy. Vitaxin, the humanized version of the mAb LM609, has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical trials and has passed phase 1 safety trials (24Gutheil J.C. Campbell T.N. Pierce P.R. Watkins J.D. Huse W.D. Bodkin D.J. Cheresh D.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3056-3061PubMed Google Scholar, 25Rader C. Popkov M. Neves J.A. Barbas 3rd., C.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 2000-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we generated a humanized Fab antibody, D5, against human integrin αvβ3 from a phage-displayed antibody library. Human(ized) single-chain Fv antibodies can be produced in two ways using phage display library technology. One way is to humanize a mouse monoclonal antibody that is known to have high antigen-binding affinity and specificity. Another method is via de novo panning of a human phage display library with the target antigen. The latter method is of limited use because of the tendency to lose high-affinity binders (26Borras L. Gunde T. Tietz J. Bauer U. Hulmann-Cottier V. Grimshaw J.P. Urech D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9054-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the former method to engineer a humanized scFv from the mouse monoclonal antibody against human integrin αvβ3 by phage antibody display using a predetermined CDR3 gene. The scFv of this humanized antibody was expressed in E. coli in a soluble form. Fab and scFv antibodies have a lower molecular weight than full-length antibodies but can retain the same antigen affinity as the parent antibody. As such, these antibody fragments have been widely studied for targeted therapy and drug delivery purposes. scFvs can be expressed in mammalian, plant, and bacterial cells (27Hedley S.J.

Although each of these systems has its own advantage, the bacterial expression system is the most universally used, as it is relatively inexpensive and easy to manipulate and has a rapid growth rate (30Mayer M. Buchner J. Methods Mol. Med. 2004; 94: 239-254PubMed Google Scholar). However, inclusion bodies of scFv proteins are often produced during bacterial expression, which requires the incorrectly folded proteins to be denatured and renatured before further use. It is preferable for the antibody fragment to be directly expressed in a soluble and active form in E. coli. The use of a low culture temperature, low isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentrations and the coexpression of molecular chaperones are typical methods that can promote the soluble expression of recombinant proteins (31Gräslund S.

Expressing fusion proteins in the soluble fraction allows proper folding of the protein and disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm, thereby increasing the likelihood of obtaining soluble proteins with preserved biological activity (32Yang J.

In this study, the scFv against human integrin αvβ3 was expressed at a low temperature (25 °C) and low isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside concentration (0.4 mm). To further increase the recombinant protein solubility, we chose E. coli BL21 (DE3) as the host strain, as it has been previously demonstrated to be appropriate for soluble protein expression (31Gräslund S.

By adopting these strategies, the scFv against integrin αvβ3 was expressed in soluble form and easily purified for further use. The humanized scFv protein purified by this method retained a high binding activity to human integrin αvβ3 and acted to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that this humanized scFv antibody represents a potential novel tool in cancer therapeutics. This humanized scFv may also be useful for delivery of other therapeutic molecules via the construction of bifunctional antagonists because tumor angiogenesis does not exclusively depend on integrin αvβ3."

However, to the best of our knowledge, the association of sun-induced skin damage with mortality remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Subjects were 8472 white participants aged 25–74 years in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. Cardiovascular disease mortality, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality were obtained by either a death certificate or a proxy interview, or both. Actinic skin damage was examined and recorded by the presence and severity (absent, minimal, moderate, or severe) of overall actinic skin damage and its components (i.e., fine telangiectasia, solar elastosis, and actinic keratoses). Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were applied to explore the associations. A total of 672 cancer deaths, 1500 cardiovascular disease deaths, and 2969 deaths from all causes were documented through the follow-up between 1971 and 1992. After controlling for potential confounding variables, severe overall actinic skin damage was associated with a 45% higher risk for all-cause mortality (95% CI: 1.22, 1.72; P<0.001), moderate overall skin damage with a 20% higher risk (95% CI: 1.08., 1.32; P<0.001), and minimal overall skin damage with no significant mortality difference, when compared to those with no skin damage. Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality with fine telangiectasia, solar elastosis, and actinic keratoses. The results were similar for cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality. Conclusions The present study gives an indication of an association of actinic skin damage with cardiovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality in white subjects. Given the lack of support in the scientific literature and potential unmeasured confounding factors, this finding should be interpreted with caution. More independent studies are needed before any practical recommendations can be made."
https://openalex.org/W2092875962,"Miniature pigs are useful model animals for humans because they have similar anatomy and digestive physiology to humans and are easy to breed and handle. In this study, whole blood microarray analyses were conducted to evaluate variations of correlation among individuals and ages using specific pathogen-free (SPF) Clawn miniature pigs. Whole blood RNA is easy to handle compared to isolated white blood cell RNA and can be used for health and disease monitoring and animal control. In addition, whole blood is a heterogeneous mixture of subpopulation cells. Once a great change occurs in composition and expressing condition of subpopulations, their associated change will be reflected on whole blood RNA. From 12 to 30 weeks of age, fractions of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils in white blood cells showed insignificant differences with age as a result of ANOVA analysis. This study attempted to identify characteristics of age-related gene expression by taking into account the change in the number of expressed genes by age and similarities of gene expression intensity between individuals. As a result, the number of expressed genes was less in fetal stage and infancy period but increased with age, reaching a steady state of gene expression after 20 weeks of age. Variation in gene expression intensity within the same age was great in fetal stage and infancy period, but converged with age. The variation between 20 and 30 weeks of age was comparable to that among 30 weeks individuals. These results indicate that uniformity of laboratory animals is expected for miniature pigs after 20 weeks of age. Furthermore, a possibility was shown that whole blood RNA analysis is applicable to evaluation of physiological state."
https://openalex.org/W1967259570,"Much work in behavioral ecology has shown that animals fight over resources such as food, and that they make strategic decisions about when to engage in such fights. Here, we examine the evolution of one, heretofore unexamined, component of that strategic decision about whether to fight for a resource. We present the results of a computer simulation that examined the evolution of over- or underestimating the value of a resource (food) as a function of an individual's current hunger level. In our model, animals fought for food when they perceived their current food level to be below the mean for the environment. We considered seven strategies for estimating food value: 1) always underestimate food value, 2) always overestimate food value, 3) never over- or underestimate food value, 4) overestimate food value when hungry, 5) underestimate food value when hungry, 6) overestimate food value when relatively satiated, and 7) underestimate food value when relatively satiated. We first competed all seven strategies against each other when they began at approximately equal frequencies. In such a competition, two strategies--""always overestimate food value,"" and ""overestimate food value when hungry""--were very successful. We next competed each of these strategies against the default strategy of ""never over- or underestimate,"" when the default strategy was set at 99% of the population. Again, the strategies of ""always overestimate food value"" and ""overestimate food value when hungry"" fared well. Our results suggest that overestimating food value when deciding whether to fight should be favored by natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W2044082173,"The intensity of gene transcription is generally reflected by the level of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment to the gene. However, genome-wide studies of polymerase occupancy indicate that RNAPII distribution varies among genes. In some loci more polymerases are found in the 5' region, whereas in other loci, in the 3' region of the gene. We studied the distribution of elongating RNAPII complexes at highly transcribed GAL-VPS13 locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that in the cell population the amount of polymerases gradually decreased toward the 3' end of the gene. However, the conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation assay averages the signal from the cell population, and no data on single cell level can be gathered. To study the spacing of elongating polymerases on single chromosomes, we used a sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay for the detection of multiple RNAPII complexes on the same DNA fragment. Our results demonstrate uniform distribution of elongating polymerases throughout all regions of the GAL-VPS13 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1984356438,"The γδ T cell receptor (TCR) differs from immunoglobulin and αβ TCR in its overall binding mode. In human, genes δ1, δ2, and δ3 are used for TCRδ chains. Previously, we have studied antigen binding determinants of TCRδ2 derived from dominant γδ T cells residing in peripheral blood. In this study we have investigated the critical determinants for antigen recognition and TCR function in TCRδ1 originated from gastric tumor-infiltrating γδ T lymphocytes using three independent experimental strategies including complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) of TCRδ1 (CDR3δ1)-peptide mediated binding, CDR3δ1-grafted TCR fusion protein-mediated binding, and TCRγ4δ1- and mutant-expressing cell-mediated binding. All three approaches consistently showed that the conserved flanking V and J sequences but not the diverse D segment in CDR3δ1 determine the antigen binding. Most importantly, we found that mutations in the V and J regions of CDR3δ1 also abolish the assembly of TCR and TCR-CD3 complexes in TCRγ4δ1-transduced J.RT3-T3.5 cells. Together with our previous studies on CDR3δ2 binding, our finding suggests that both human TCRδ1 and TCRδ2 recognize antigen predominately via flanking V and J regions. These results indicate that TCRγδ recognizes antigens using conserved parts in their CDR3, which provides an explanation for a diverse repertoire of γδTCRs only recognizing a limited number of antigens."
