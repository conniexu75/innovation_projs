https://openalex.org/W177925015,"It is now well established that insulin in vitro enhances the incorporation of labeled amino acids into the protein of isolated rat diaphragm (l-6) ; this stimulating action of insulin on protein synthesis appears not to depend on a simultaneous stimulation by insulin of glucose utilization (4-6). Whether insulin promotes the transfer of labeled amino acid from the medium into the protein of isolated diaphragm by increasing the rate of entry of amino acid from the medium into the cell (4, 7) or by some other means has been uncertain. Manchester and Young (8, 9) have recently shown that Cl4 from pyruvate, ketoglutarate, and bicarbonate can be incorporated by isolated rat diaphragm into certain amino acids of its protein. If insulin stimulates incorporation of amino acids into protein by affecting the rate of their entry into the cell, incorporation of amino acids formed within the cell should not be influenced by insulin. In an attempt to define more precisely the mechanism of the action of insulin in this respect we have studied the effect of insulin on the uptake of 04 from various C14-labeled carboxylic acids and bicarbonate into the protein of isolated rat diaphragm. Our results suggest that insulin stimulates incorporation of amino acids into protein, not by an effect on the rate of their entry into the cell, but by influencing some intracellular process, the details of which are discussed."

In tonometer form they are fast and gentle not requiring anesthetics for the cornea of the human eye. Readings are accurate and independent of tissue tension, corneal stiffness, astigmatic curvatures, and surface tension. There are also separate indications of corneal rigidity and relaxation, and tonographic fluid expression. Other applications include monitoring blood pressure, uterine contractions, and infant intracranial pressure."

Pellet sucrose spaces and total pellet were de- termined by the isotope dilution method and from pellet water contents, respectively. From these volumes, extraparticulate spaces were derived mathematically. 2. For the case of mitochondria in 0.30 M sucrose, pellet sucrose spaces were 66 to 80% but extraparticulate spaces were only 23 to 33% of total pellet water volumes. Thus about two- thirds of the intramitochondrial water volume is permeable to sucrose. 3. In hypotonic sucrose, all of the mitochondrial space which sucrose does not enter adheres to Boyle-van% Hoff’s Law, be- having as an ideal osmometer. 4. Thus, the apparent contradiction between mitochondrial sucrose permeability and osmotic behavior is considered resolved through study of both the sucrose-accessible and the sucrose- inaccessible space of mitochondrial pellets. Two possible struc- tural bases for this heterogeneity are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2028682915,"IT is well known that many tissues when placed in an electrolyte medium are profoundly affected by the presence or absence of calcium ions. This is also true of the red cells of the tortoise1, of the snapping turtle2 and probably of the red cells of certain fishes3–5, which in a calcium-free electrolyte medium become highly permeable to cations, and hence swell and rupture (haemolysis). The red cells of the frog, chicken and of Mammalia, however, are little affected by suspension in calcium-free sodium chloride solution, exchange of cations with the external medium being very slow, and haemolysis correspondingly delayed. Nevertheless dependence on calcium of the human red cell may be demonstrated after suitable treatment of the cells in conformity with earlier work by Maizels6 and Wilbrandt7. The former showed that human red cells became highly permeable to cations when placed in an electrolyte-free medium (for example, glucose), unless about 10 mM sodium or potassium chloride were present, while Wilbrandt found sodium and potassium chlorides to be less effective than the salts of the alkaline earths, though there was no specificity within this group, the actions of calcium, magnesium, strontium and barium being quantitatively similar."

Only ""on"" discharges were found in the nerves, whereas ""on"" and ""off"" discharges as well as spontaneous activity and tactile responses were obtained from the ganglia."

https://openalex.org/W2075910235,"THE occurrence of pleuropneumonia-like organism as contaminants in tissue culture is a common experience in many laboratories1–5. Such infections may be inapparent or may cause progressive degeneration of the cells. The origin of this type of contamination has never been satisfactorily explained, and although the serum used in tissue culture media is often suspected we have never succeeded in isolating pleuropneumonia-like organisms from many samples of fresh human, bovine, horse and rabbit sera. Our results suggest that at least some of the pleuropneumonia-like organisms found in tissue culture are L forms of contaminating bacteria. This belief is based on the following observations."

The physical characteristics of X virus obtained from ultra- violet induction of Escherichia coli K12X have been compared with those of X virus obtained by infection of the sensitive host E. coli W-1485. No significant differences were observed, and it has been concluded that the present evidence supports the view that the X virus from virulent infections is identical to that produced by ultraviolet induction of a lysogenic strain. 2. The origin of viral phosphorus in ultraviolet-induced cul- tures of E. coli K12X has been studied. About two-thirds of the viral deoxyribonucleic acid-P is derived from the medium after ultraviolet induction. It appears that synthesis of virus components from the medium is necessary, a finding which is in contrast to results obtained with smaller virulent phages such as T3 and T7, parasitizing E. coli B. 3. The acid-soluble fraction ultraviolet induced culture has been analyzed for its purine- and pyrimidine-containing constituents."
https://openalex.org/W2075658734,"THE experiments and arguments of McCutchen1 and Lewis and McCutchen2 appear to confirm the theory of lubrication of mammalian joints first put forward twenty-seven years ago with particular reference to the intra-articular fibrocartilages and later developed in connexion with particular problems of articular structure, general and special3. The essence of that theory is that there is a sensibly thick film of synovial fluid between articular surfaces while the joint is in motion, and that this fluid is not only maintained between the surfaces but also flows between them in the direction of motion in accordance with the laws of viscous hydrodynamics. The question of the origin of the fluid was left in abeyance, being a physiological rather than a mechanical problem."

https://openalex.org/W2071323618,PREVIOUS work from this laboratory suggested that plasma ‘alkaline’ ribonuclease is filtered through kidney glomeruli and re-absorbed and inactivated by the tubules1; in support of this hypothesis a correlation was found in normal rats between plasma and kidney cortex ribonuclease activity2. In the present investigation foreign proteins3 were administered to rats in an attempt to influence the kidney cortex enzyme activity.
