https://openalex.org/W1586249089,"Abstract Plasma membranes prepared from rat livers have been treated with digitonin or phospholipase A under conditions which result in substantial loss of glucagon-stimulated adenyl cyclase activity but no loss of fluoride-stimulated activity. These results are thought to reflect extensive modification of the structures responsible for hormone sensitivity without destruction of the catalytic component of the adenyl cyclase system in these membranes. Corresponding decreases in binding of 125I-glucagon to the membranes are observed following digitonin or phospholipase A treatment. Both glucagon sensitivity of adenyl cyclase and binding of 125I-glucagon can be partially restored by exposing treated membranes to aqueous suspensions of membrane lipids. The mechanism of the effects of these lipids has not been established. Pure phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine are all capable of partially restoring glucagon-stimulated adenyl cyclase activity and binding of 125I-glucagon to phospholipase A-treated membranes. Of these, phosphatidylserine produces the greatest effects. Chromatographic fractions of membrane lipids produce positive and negative effects on control and treated membranes which are difficult to interpret. However, it appears that there is some specificity in the effects of the lipid fractions. These results may have significant implications regarding the relationship of adenyl cyclase systems to membrane structure and attempts to purify the components of these systems."
https://openalex.org/W1498685946,"Abstract A glycolipid hapten of the Forssman antigen of horse spleen was found to be a ceramide pentasaccharide, which contained 2 moles of N-acetylgalactosamine, 2 moles of galactose, and 1 mole of glucose per ceramide. An α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase of hog liver (Weissman, B., and Hinrichsen, D. F., Biochemistry, 8, 2034 (1969)) hydrolyzed the terminal α-N-acetylgalactosaminosyl residue with a simultaneous loss of the Forssman hapten activity. The resulting compound was identical with globoside (Yamakawa, T., Nishimura, S., and Kamimura, H., Jap. J. Exp. Med., 35, 201 (1965); Hakomori, S., Siddiqui, B., Li, Y. T., Li, S. C., and Hellerqvist, C. G., J. Biol. Chem. 246, 2271 (1971)) and gave a specific precipitin reaction with anti-globoside antiserum. The oligosaccharide released from the Forssman hapten gave an intense Morgan-Elson reaction and 1 of the 2 moles of galactosamine was periodate resistant. With these results and those of methylation studies, the structure of Forssman hapten was proposed as N-acetylgalactosaminosyl-α-(1 → 3) N-acetylgalactosaminosyl-β-(1 → 3)galactopyranosyl-α-(1 → 4)galactopyranosyl-β-(1 → 4)glucopyranosyl-(1 → 1)ceramide."

https://openalex.org/W1538155906,"Abstract Livers from normal fed male rats were perfused in vitro with equimolar quantities of either caproic, caprylic, lauric, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, or linolenic acid. The concentration of free fatty acid in the medium was maintained at approximately 0.5 mm by constant infusion of the fatty acid during the experimental period of 4 hours. The rate of uptake of free fatty acid by the liver, about 13.2 µmoles per g of liver per hour, was similar for all fatty acids. The total output of triglyceride by the liver, however, was a function of the chemical structure of the specific fatty acid infused. The secretion of triglyceride into the medium and the accumulation of triglyceride by the liver was not stimulated by infusion of either caproic or caprylic acids. The output of triglyceride by the liver after 4 hours of perfusion was observed to be proportional to the number of carbon atoms in the saturated fatty acid; when long chain fatty acids containing 18 carbon atoms were infused, the output of triglyceride decreased as the number of double bonds in the fatty acid increased. These effects of the fatty acid substrate were not clearly apparent after perfusion for shorter periods of time; they may have been dependent on a critical intracellular concentration for that specific fatty acid (or metabolic derivative) which secondarily determined the reaction rates for esterification and secretion of the triglyceride. Accumulation of triglyceride in liver resulted from infusion of fatty acids containing 12 carbon atoms or more; more triglyceride seemed to accumulate when palmitic acid was infused than when other long chain fatty acids were infused. On examination of the triglyceride fatty acids of liver and perfusate by gas-liquid chromatography, it was determined that the triglyceride had been enriched with the infused fatty acid, although a definite relationship between the percentage of enrichment of the fatty acid in the triglyceride and the stimulation of output of triglyceride was not discernible. The rates of ketogenesis, normally of small magnitude in livers from fed animals, were similar in all groups except the one receiving palmitic acid, in which case the output of ketone bodies was less than that of the other groups. Stimulation of output of glucose by fatty acids may vary with the ability of the specific acid to be esterified and secreted or stored as triglyceride. Medium and short chain fatty acids exerted a larger and longer lasting effect on stimulation of output of glucose than did any of the long chain fatty acids; the effect of palmitic acid was minimal. The differential effects of the various free fatty acids on secretion of triglyceride by the liver may, in part, be the mechanism by which dietary factors in the intact animal influence the concentration of triglyceride in the serum."
https://openalex.org/W1637127028,"Abstract Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) synthetase was found to be distributed in all human tissues assayed and has been purified 5100-fold from human erythrocytes. It has an absolute requirement for inorganic phosphate. Magnesium was the most effective divalent cation at both high and low concentrations. No requirement for potassium was found. The pH optimum was 7.2 to 7.4. The isoelectric point was 4.7 ± 0.2. With the usual substrates, ATP and ribose-5-P, the reaction produces equimolar amounts of PP-ribose-P and AMP. Of a number of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides tested as possible substrates, the purified enzyme was active only with ATP and dATP. Ribulose-5-P was 34% as effective a substrate as ribose-5-P, while the enzyme had virtually no activity with other phosphorylated sugars. The Km values for ATP and ribose-5-P were 14 µm and 33 µm, respectively. Crude preparations of the enzyme were stabilized by dithiothreitol while the 5100-fold purified enzyme was inactivated by this compound. The enzyme was stabilized at -70°, 4°, and 60° by saturating concentrations of ATP and magnesium. Phosphate was absolutely required to maintain activity. The reversible association and dissociation of PP-ribose-P synthetase is described. The smallest native form of the enzyme has a molecular weight of 60,000 as estimated from Stokes radius and sedimentation velocity. In the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP and magnesium chloride, the enzyme consistently associates into two heavy forms estimated to have molecular weights of about 1,200,000 and 720,000. Intermediate molecular forms were observed in the presence of ATP or magnesium chloride alone. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the enzyme in sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 34,500. It is probable that the aggregated form is the active enzyme and that the enzyme is normally aggregated in the cell. Correlation of this reversible association and dissociation with cooperativity have not yet been documented."
https://openalex.org/W2023096899,"Amounts of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in discrete regions of the brain were estimated after exposure of rats to microwave irradiation. Amounts were highest in the cerebellum and brainstem, intermediate in the hypothalamus and midbrain, and lowest in the hippocampus and cortex. Decapitation increased the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in all brain areas, although the increase in the cerebellum was three to four times greater than that in other areas. Microwave irradiation may provide a means of rapidly fixing brain tissue in situ while permitting easy dissection of the brain. In this way artifacts produced by decapitation can be eliminated, and concentrations of heat-stable compounds in the brain can be estimated under conditions which more closely approximate those in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1538441456,"Abstract A particulate galactosyltransferase isolated from pig submaxillary glands catalyzed the transfer of galactose from uridine diphosphate galactose to both high and low molecular weight derivatives of N-acetylgalactosamine (2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactopyranosides). The most effective acceptor for this enzyme was sialidase-treated ovine submaxillary mucin. The product of this reaction was galactosyl → N-acetylgalactosaminyl → protein, which is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the more complex oligosaccharides of porcine submaxillary mucin. However, the enzyme does not transfer galactose to sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides. Thus, the relative activities of the UDP-galactose:mucin galactosyltransferase reported here, and the previously described CMP-sialic acid:mucin sialyltransferase may act as the controlling mechanism for determining the final structures of the oligosaccharide units in the submaxillary mucins. The enzyme preparation also contained two previously described galactosyltransferases which utilized N-acetylglucosamine (or serum-type glycoproteins containing N-acetylglucosamine end groups) and Tay-Sachs ganglioside, respectively, as galactose acceptors. The enzyme described here was distinguished from the previously reported enzymes by acceptor specificity and competition studies."
https://openalex.org/W1525487738,"The activity of the enzyme adenyl cyclase has been measured in various lines of mouse, hamster, and rat fibroblasts maintained in tissue culture. All cell lines have detectable adenyl cyclase activity. With respect to the activity of the enzyme in the presence of fluoride ions: (a) mouse embryo fibroblasts and L cells have relatively high levels of enzyme, whereas 3T3 cells derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts have low levels; (b) 3T3 cells transformed by SV40 and MSV/MuLV viruses have elevated enzyme levels, but 3T3 cells transformed by polyoma virus have slightly decreased levels; (c) hamster embryo fibroblasts and the established BHK line have relatively high levels and transformation of BHK cells by polyoma virus only slightly decreases enzyme activity; (d) rat embryo fibroblasts have the highest enzyme activity found. With respect to stimulation of the enzyme by prostaglandins, prostaglandin E1 is the most effective when tested on L cells, followed in effectiveness by prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2α, and prostaglandin B1. Prostaglandin A2 produces only a small response. Two cell lines derived from 3T3 cells by transformation with polyoma or SV40 virus are unresponsive to all prostaglandins tested. With most lines, adenyl cyclase activity remained constant during culture for 2 to 3 months. However, in rat embryo fibroblasts and SV40 (3T3) cells, the fluoride-stimulated enzyme levels (but not basal levels) fell with successive passages."

https://openalex.org/W1557949336,"Abstract The adenine phosphoribosyltransferase of Escherichia coli K-12 is markedly derepressed under cultural conditions which preclude de novo synthesis of purines. The enzyme obtained from such cultures was purified to constant specific activity of 14.0 µmoles of AMP formed at 37° per min per mg. Enzyme activity is associated with an apparently homogeneous protein species as indicated by either acrylamide gel electrophoresis or gel filtration at low pH and in the presence of divalent cation. The molecular weight as estimated by gel filtration under these conditions is 40,000. At high pH and in the absence of divalent cations, several protein moieties are observed by these techniques; each, however, exhibits enzyme activity. Apparent Km values were found to be 0.01 to 0.02 mm and 0.15 to 0.25 mm for adenine and P-ribose-PP, respectively. The pH optimum is approximately 8.0 and either manganese or magnesium will satisfy the divalent cation requirement. All uncyclized nucleoside 5'-phosphate esters significantly inhibited activity, apparently by competing with P-ribose-PP. The total nucleotide pool is therefore postulated to be involved in the regulation of adenine utilization."
https://openalex.org/W1548284545,"Abstract The uptake of adenine by membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli is accompanied by its conversion to AMP and is stimulated by P-ribose-PP. The pH optimum for uptake in phosphate buffer is 7.8. The Km for adenine is 20 µm and for P-ribose-PP is 200 µm. Uptake is inhibited by AMP and ATP. Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity is associated with membrane vesicles. A role of this enzyme in the uptake of adenine is indicated by the fact that the uptake and enzyme activity are similarly affected by variations in pH, substrates, and inhibitors; moreover, removal of the enzyme from the vesicles results in a concomitant loss of uptake activity. The enzyme isolated from membrane vesicles appears to be identical with the soluble enzyme isolated directly from cell-free extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1483243352,"Abstract The adenylate cyclase of a corticosterone producing transplanted adrenal cancer of the rat is stimulated not only by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), but also by epinephrine, norepinephrine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. The lowest effective concentration of each hormone is about 10-6 m. Other hormones, including parathyroid hormone, thyrocalcitonin, glucagon, and vasopressin, do not influence the tumor cyclase. ACTH is the only hormone that stimulates normal adrenal adenylate cyclase. To study further the characteristics of the tumor hormone receptors, experiments have been performed employing hormone analogues, subunits, and inhibitors. The tumor ACTH receptor requires similar portions of the ACTH molecule for activity as does the normal adrenal receptor. Thus, the tumor and the normal adrenal cyclase are stimulated by the ACTH analogue containing the NH2-terminal 24 amino acids of ACTH, but neither responds to the analogue containing only the COOH-terminal 15 amino acids. A number of observations suggest that the tumor possesses a β adrenergic receptor. The tumor cyclase is stimulated by a series of catecholamines in the following order of potency: isoproterenol g epinephrine g norepinephrine g ephedrine. Methoxamine is inactive. The β adrenergic antagonist propranolol abolishes the stimulatory effect of the catecholamines but not that of the other hormones. Phentolamine and dibenzylamine do not block the catecholamine responses. Studies with the subunits of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone have shown activity in stimulating the tumor cyclase principally by the β subunit of each hormone. The results indicate the presence of multiple specific hormone receptors in the tumor cyclase. Since the effects of the different hormones are not additive, it is suggested that the multiple hormone receptors act through a common cyclase catalytic unit."
https://openalex.org/W1501822391,"Abstract Two fucosyltransferases have been found in pork liver which transfer l-fucose from GDP-l-fucose into various derivatives of human plasma α1-acid glycoprotein. One of these enzymes incorporates l-fucose into the terminal positions of α1-acid glycoprotein prosthetic groups and into the disaccharide, galactosyl-(β,1 → 4)-N-acetylglucosamine. This enzyme does not transfer fucose to lactose, galactosyl(β,1 → 3)-N-acetylglucosamine, galactosyl-(β,1 → 6)-N-acetylglucosamine, and the α- and β-methyl-d-galactopyranosides. The substrate specificity indicates that the fucosyltransferase is responsible for the incorporation of l-fucose into plasma glycoproteins in vivo. The enzyme is membrane-bound and requires Triton X-100 and divalent cation for optimum activity. The other pork liver fucosyltransferase incorporates l-fucose into a position on the oligosaccharide prosthetic group of α1-acid glycoprotein at which l-fucose does not occur in the native glycoprotein; the function of this enzyme in pork liver is not known."
https://openalex.org/W1600528069,"Abstract Initial rates of adenine uptake by Escherichia coli resting cells were found to correlate closely with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity of cell homogenates when measured under optimal conditions. Cultural conditions, inhibitors, and subjecting the cells to osmotic altered both uptake and phosphoribosyltransferase activities pari passu. At appropriate concentrations virtually all of the adenine in the medium was taken up into the cells even under conditions in which no growth occurred and macromolecular synthesis was negligible. In energy-depleted cells glucose, ribose, or P-ribose-PP markedly stimulated uptake of adenine while several other sugar phosphates gave much less or no stimulation. P-ribose-PP also stimulated uptake of several additional purines and pyrimidines. For P-ribose-PP-stimulated adenine uptake the kinetics with respect to both P-ribose-PP and adenine concentrations was similar to those observed for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Iodo-acetamide (0.4 mm) caused virtually complete inhibition of the glucose- or ribose-stimulated uptake of adenine but did not affect the P-ribose-PP-stimulated uptake. Labeled adenine taken up was found intracellularly predominantly as AMP, IMP, and GMP while free adenine accounted for 0 to 2% of the total radioactivity taken up. Nucleotide inhibitors of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity were also found to be inhibitors of adenine uptake; free purines (which do not inhibit adenine phosphoribosyltransferase) also inhibited uptake, most probably acting after conversion to nucleotides. Several phosphoribosyltransferases are apparently located in the pericytoplasmic space since variable amounts (up to 70%) are released into the shock fluid when cells are subjected to osmotic by the method of Nossal and Heppel (J. Biol. Chem., 241, 3055 (1966)). This release is accompanied by a parallel loss in purine uptake capacity. Although all purine and pyrimidine uptake systems can be stimulated to a greater or lesser extent by P-ribose-PP, they are distinct and may be governed by completely different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1576038134,"Abstract Mouse mammary epithelial cells contain two protein phosphokinases (I and II) which are bound to a cyclic AMP-binding protein in the cytosol fraction. Kinase II is activated specifically by cyclic AMP. During development of the mammary gland in pregnancy the specific activities of these proteins in the epithelial cells increase 7- to 9-fold. In organ cultures of mouse mammary tissue and in isolated epithelial cell preparations prolactin induces these proteins in cells formed in vitro by insulin-mediated cell division. Insulin acts synergistically with prolactin for the induction of the protein kinases, but the induction of the cyclic AMP-binding protein requires only the action of prolactin. The induction of these proteins was coordinate and rapid, with half-maximal induced levels observed after 30 min and maximal levels observed by 4 hours. The formation of these enzymes preceded the prolactin-induced phosphorylation of specific nuclear proteins and occurred slightly before a stimulation of rapidly labeled nuclear RNA synthesis. These observations are consistent with the possibility that the induction of the protein kinase and cyclic AMP-binding protein complex is an early event in the action of prolactin upon which subsequent steps in activation are dependent. Neither prolactin nor insulin stimulated the adenylyl cyclase activity of isolated mammary cell membranes. Addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP or cyclic AMP to the medium could not substitute for the actions of insulin, hydrocortisone, or prolactin for the induction of [32P]casein despite the finding that large amounts of cyclic AMP were taken up by the cultured cells. These findings provide evidence for a novel mechanism for regulation in which cyclic AMP is not rate-limiting, but the proteins with which cyclic AMP interacts are hormonally induced."

https://openalex.org/W1607410698,"Abstract The pathway of myo-inositol catabolism in Aerobacter aerogenes has been studied, beginning with the first noncyclic intermediate, 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid. A kinase acts on 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid to yield a monophosphorylated product. The isolation of the kinase product was rendered difficult by the presence, in both crude and 20-fold purified extracts, of the next enzyme in the pathway, an aldolase which catalyzes the cleavage of the kinase product to yield dihydroxyacetone phosphate and malonic semialdehyde. However, accumulation of the kinase product was accomplished by specific inactivation of the aldolase by reduction with sodium borohydride in the presence of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The kinase product was identified as 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid 6-phosphate. Malonic semialdehyde is further metabolized by the last enzyme in the pathway, malonic semialdehyde oxidative decarboxylase. This enzyme was also partially purified. It catalyzes the conversion of malonic semialdehyde, coenzyme A, and NAD+ to acetyl-CoA, CO2, and NADH + H+. All three of the enzymes that have been identified in this study are induced by growth on myo-inositol, and are constitutive in a mutant which is constitutive for the first three enzymes of the inositol pathway. The operation of the pathway thus results in the conversion of myo-inositol to an equimolar mixture of three known metabolites: dihydroxyacetone phosphate, acetyl-CoA, and CO2."

https://openalex.org/W1603713494,"Abstract When a number of metal ions were tested as activators over a 100-fold range of metal ion concentration (0.01 to 1.0 mm), aconitase was specifically activated by Fe(II). Manganese(II) does not activate aconitase but binds to the enzyme, as shown indirectly by inhibition of the enzyme activation by Fe(II) and directly by electron paramagnetic resonance. A titration of the enzyme with Mn(II) may be fit most simply by assuming two binding sites for Mn(II) with a dissociation constant, Kdiss, of 47 ± 3 µm and 5 to 7 weak binding sites (Kdiss = 620 ± 80 µm). Interaction among these sites is indicated by the effect of bound Mn(II) on the longitudinal relaxation rate (1/T1p) of water protons. Iron(II) competes with Mn(II) for the tight binding sites, yielding a dissociation constant for aconitase-Fe(II) of 16 ± 6 µm. The binary aconitase-Fe(II) complex and the ternary aconitase-Fe(II)-citrate complex are paramagnetic, as determined by 1/T1p of water protons, but less so than unbound Fe(II), as determined by magnetic susceptibility. In the catalytically inactive Mn-aconitase complex, a 3-fold enhancement of the effect of Mn on 1/T1p of water protons is observed. Citrate, isocitrate, and cis-aconitate halve this enhancement, suggesting the formation of ternary enzymemetal-substrate (E-M-S) bridge complexes. The dissociation constants (K3) of these ternary Mn(II) complexes agree with the respective Km values of citrate and isocitrate, but not of cis-aconitate using the Fe(II) enzyme. Citrate in proportion to its concentration raises the K3 of E-manganeseisocitrate, consistent with competition of the two substrates for the same Mn(II) site on the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1583788306,"Luteinizing hormone (LH), but not follicle-stimulating hormone or prolactin, was shown to enhance steroid synthesis of Leydig tumor cells in vitro. Adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) duplicated the effect of LH. Removal of LH from the medium within 1 hour of incubation by washing the cells had no effect on the rate of steroid synthesis previously stimulated by LH. Under these conditions, addition of LH antiserum was required to reduce steroid synthesis. In contrast, removal of cAMP by washing the tumor cells caused a rapid termination of the previously induced steroidogenesis. Cycloheximide reduced the steroid synthesis initiated by LH. These results suggest that (a) steroidogenesis may be controlled by short lived factors (proteins), (b) LH may be required continually to elevate cAMP levels to maintain steroid synthesis at stimulated rates, and (c) that LH is probably bound to the tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1533569247,"Abstract With a partially purified enzyme from Brevibacterium liquefaciens, the adenylate cyclase reaction, ATP → cyclic AMP + PPi, was demonstrated to be readily reversible. Pyruvate, which was known to activate the reaction in the forward direction, had a similar stimulatory effect on the reverse reaction. The equilibrium constant at pH 7.3 and 25° was approximately 0.065 m at the magnesium concentrations used. This result indicates a high free energy of hydrolysis (ΔG0obs) for the 3' ester bond of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), estimated at -11.9 kcal mole-1 under these conditions. Since the reaction involves one reactant and two products, the equilibrium is concentration-dependent, i.e. high concentrations of cyclic AMP and PPi are required to show a high percentage of conversion to ATP; high enzyme concentrations and long incubation periods are therefore needed. The recent report by others of failure to confirm the reversibility of the reaction with the same enzyme system is attributed to failure to observe these requirements."
https://openalex.org/W1482128231,"Abstract In order to obtain information on the mechanism of ether bond formation in the synthesis of O-alkyl lipids, a study was carried out to determine if there is a loss of hydrogen from carbon 3 of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (non-phosphorus-linked carbon) in the course of its incorporation into glyceryl ethers. Accordingly, a mixture of [1,3-3H2] DHAP and [1,3-14C2]DHAP was prepared. In a microsomal enzyme system from Tetrahymena pyriformis which synthesizes O-alkyl lipids, it was found that there was a loss of hydrogen from carbon 3 of glyceryl ethers synthesized from double-labeled DHAP. The loss was quantitatively consistent with the labilization of one of the hydrogens linked to carbon 3 of DHAP and was not due to isomerase activity."

Two phosphonic acid analogues of ATP,β,γ-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate and α,β-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate, were found to inactivate the enzyme very specifically at much lower nucleotide concentrations.

https://openalex.org/W1608153971,"A capsular polysaccharide produced by Aerobacter aerogenes has been purified and shown to consist of galactose, mannose, and glucuronic acid in a molar ratio of 2:1:1, respectively. Partial acid hydrolysis liberated an aldobiouronic acid identified as 2-O-β- d -glucuronosyl- d -mannose. Analysis of capsular polysaccharide by Smith periodate degradation further indicated that all of the galactose residues are linked through C-3, all of the mannose residues are linked through both C-2 and C-3, and all of the glucuronic acid is at terminal, nonreducing positions. Digestion of capsular polysaccharide with a specific phage-induced polysaccharide depolymerase resulted in its nearly quantitative conversion to two limit oligosaccharides, termed A and B. Partial acid hydrolysis, methylation analysis, and periodate degradation indicated that A is the tetrasaccharide, Gal-1 → 3-(GlcUA-1 → 2)-Man-1 → 3-Gal. B was characterized as an octasaccharide composed of two units of A by the following procedure: Smith periodate degradation of B yielded the pentasaccharide mannosyl (α)/→ galactosyl (α)/→ galactosyl (α)/→ mannosyl (α)/→ lyxitol. This pentasaccharide was characterized and the anomeric configuration of the glycosidic bonds determined by sequential enzymatic degradation with specific exoglycosidases. Further analyses indicated that B is the octasaccharide, Gal-1 (α)/→ 3-(GlcUA-1 (β)/→ 2)-Man-1 (α)/→ -3-Gal-1 (α)/→ 3-Gal-1 (α)/→ 3-(GlcUA-1 (β)/→ 2)-Man-1 (α)/→ 3-Gal. A third oligosaccharide, termed C, was present in small amounts in extensive depolymerase digests of capsular polysaccharide. This oligosaccharide was shown to be a dodecasaccharide composed of three units of A. Exhaustive depolymerase digestion of C resulted in its slow degradation to yield equimolar amounts of A and B. These results indicate that Aerobacter aerogenes capsular polysaccharide is composed of repeating sequences of the following tetrasaccharide. [see PDF for sequence] Moreover, they also indicate that the phage-induced polysaccharide depolymerase is a glycanohydrolase which specifically cleaves the galactosyl-1 (α)/→ 3-galactose linkages in the capsular polysaccharide."

https://openalex.org/W1586291099,"Abstract The structure of the first noncyclic intermediate in the catabolism of myo-inositol by Aerobacter aerogenes has been elucidated. This compound had been thought to be a 4-deoxy-5-ketohexonic acid. However, a reinvestigation of its structure showed it to be a 2-deoxy-5-ketohexonic acid. The phenylosazone derivative was prepared and purified to chromatographic homogeneity as the sodium salt. Periodate oxidation of the osazone generated two products. One was identified chromatographically and colorimetrically as malonic semialdehyde. The other was shown to be identical with the 1,2-bisphenylhydrazone of mesoxaldehyde. These results implied the presence of a methylene at C-2 and a carbonyl at C-5 in the parent compound. A compound identical with the intermediate in inositol catabolism was generated by the action of Acetobacter suboxydans ATCC 621 on 2-deoxy-d-glucose. This result confirmed the presence of a methylene group at position 2 in the inositol intermediate and furthermore made it highly likely that the intermediate is 2-deoxy-5-keto-d-gluconic acid (2-deoxy-d-threo-5-hexulosonic acid)."
https://openalex.org/W1511524890,"Abstract [1,2-3H]Dihydrotachysterol3, specific activity 350 Ci per mole, was chemically synthesized from [1,2-3H]5-cholestene-3β-yl benzoate. The structural assignment and radiochemical purity were confirmed by ultraviolet spectrum and cochromatography with crystalline dihydrotachysterol3. The metabolism of an intravenous dose of 0.65 nmole of [1,2-3H] dihydrotachysterol3 in vitamin D-deficient rats was studied by chromatographing CHCl3-MeOH extracts of serum on Sephadex LH-20. The major polar metabolite of dihydrotachysterol3 was isolated and identified as 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3 by cochromatography with synthetic 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3. In vitro biosynthesis of 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol3 from dihydrotachysterol3 was demonstrated in a liver homogenate system previously described for the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3."

https://openalex.org/W1533024445,"Abstract The interaction of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase with NAD and adenine nucleotides has been studied. The effects of these compounds on the individual steps in several catalytic activities of this multifunctional enzyme have been determined. The results may be tabulated as follows In general, the NAD interacts with the dehydrogenase to promote substrate oxidation and to protect the enzyme against inactivation. At physiological concentrations, ATP inhibits almost every step in the above reactions except the acetylation of the dehydrogenase with p-nitrophenyl acetate. The present findings further characterize the active center of the dehydrogenase. ATP inhibition could contribute to metabolic control and the Pasteur effect in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1557717497,"Abstract The interaction of 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase with various adenine nucleotides has been studied in order to gain insight into the manner in which the coenzyme, NAD, is bound to the enzyme and how this binding affects the various catalytic activities of the protein. The effects of adenine nucleotides were examined on the enzymatic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. This reaction provides a simple model for the formation and turnover of the normally occurring S-acyl-enzyme complex. 5'-AMP, ADP, and ATP stimulated the initial rate of formation of the S-acetyl-enzyme intermediate, but adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and ADP-ribose had no effect. All adenine nucleotides inhibited the hydrolysis of the S-acetyl-enzyme intermediate with the following order of potency: ADP g ADP-ribose g ATP g 5'-AMP g adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. By contrast, NAD inhibited the acetylation of the enzyme, and, under certain conditions, facilitated the deacetylation of the S-acetyl intermediate. Adenosine had no effect on the esterase activity. Inorganic pyrophosphate reduced the rate of both the acetylation and deacetylation steps, thereby localizing the inhibitory moiety of the adenine nucleotides. The relationship of these effects to the mechanism of coenzyme binding and enzymatic catalysis is considered."

https://openalex.org/W1595893976,"Abstract The ultraviolet absorption and circular dichroism spectra of lipoamide dehydrogenase have been analyzed in the region 290 to 420 nm. Marked differences in spectra between free FAD and FMN, oxidized and reduced enzyme, can be accounted for with the same set of Gaussian bands, suggesting that the binding of FAD to the apoprotein does not generate new transitions. Rather, the optical properties of the enzyme in the region 290 to 420 nm can be described with the same set of bands belonging to free FAD, whether the enzyme is in the oxidized or reduced state. The bands have been identified by studies of pH and temperature dependence of their optical activity. The circular dichroism of the reduced enzyme is characteristic of the reducing substrate, NADH, or dihydrolipoic acid. It appears unlikely that either the conformation or environment of the flavin is equivalent in these two reduced states. Moreover, irrespective of oxidation state, the preliminary circular dichroism and absorption spectra results presented suggest that the intramolecular interactions which generate the optical activity of the free coenzyme are altered on binding."
https://openalex.org/W1541573461,"Abstract The low temperature acid transition of ribonuclease A has been investigated by using optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism. Changes are seen in the mean residue rotation at 228 nm, suggesting some loss of organized secondary structure in the molecule. However, no parallel changes are seen in circular dichroism measurements below 230 nm, indicating that the change in conformation involves only side chain residues."
https://openalex.org/W1995032647,"WE strongly endorse Vane's comments1 on the pitfalls associated with the use of synthetic peptides in biological studies. It is particularly misleading to express results in terms of weight without evidence of homogeneity, because apart from error peptides (which may not be inert), account is seldom taken of salt and solvent content."
