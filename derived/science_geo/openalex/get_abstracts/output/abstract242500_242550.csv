https://openalex.org/W2119742125,"Revealing the mechanisms for neuronal somatic diversification remains a central challenge for understanding individual differences in brain organization and function. Here we show that an engineered human LINE-1 (for long interspersed nuclear element-1; also known as L1) element can retrotranspose in neuronal precursors derived from rat hippocampus neural stem cells. The resulting retrotransposition events can alter the expression of neuronal genes, which, in turn, can influence neuronal cell fate in vitro. We further show that retrotransposition of a human L1 in transgenic mice results in neuronal somatic mosaicism. The molecular mechanism of action is probably mediated through Sox2, because a decrease in Sox2 expression during the early stages of neuronal differentiation is correlated with increases in both L1 transcription and retrotransposition. Our data therefore indicate that neuronal genomes might not be static, but some might be mosaic because of de novo L1 retrotransposition events."

https://openalex.org/W2143758178,"The organization of cellular niches is known to have a key role in regulating normal stem cell differentiation and regeneration, but relatively little is known about the architecture of microenvironments that support malignant metastasis. Using dynamic in vivo confocal imaging, here we show that murine bone marrow contains unique anatomic regions defined by specialized endothelium. This vasculature expresses the adhesion molecule E-selectin and the chemoattractant stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) in discrete, discontinuous areas that influence the homing of a variety of tumour cell lines. Disruption of the interactions between SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 inhibits the homing of Nalm-6 cells (an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line) to these vessels. Further studies revealed that circulating leukaemic cells can engraft around these vessels, suggesting that this molecularly distinct vasculature demarcates a microenvironment for early metastatic tumour spread in bone marrow. Finally, purified haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and lymphocytes also localize to the same microdomains, indicating that this vasculature might also function in benign states to demarcate specific portals for the entry of cells into the marrow space. Specialized vascular structures therefore appear to delineate a microenvironment with unique physiology that can be exploited by circulating malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2049868369,"Histone H3 lysine 4 (K4) methylation has been linked to the transcriptional activation in a variety of eukaryotic species. Here we show that a common component of MLL1, MLL2, and hSet1 H3 K4 methyltransferase complexes, the WD40-repeat protein WDR5, directly associates with histone H3 di- and trimethylated at K4 and with H3-K4-dimethylated nucleosomes. WDR5 is required for binding of the methyltransferase complex to the K4-dimethylated H3 tail as well as for global H3 K4 trimethylation and HOX gene activation in human cells. WDR5 is essential for vertebrate development, in that WDR5-depleted X. laevis tadpoles exhibit a variety of developmental defects and abnormal spatial Hox gene expression. Our results are the first demonstration that a WD40-repeat protein acts as a module for recognition of a specific histone modification and suggest a mechanism for reading and writing an epigenetic mark for gene activation."

Here, we have used single-molecule and scanning confocal imaging to characterize the behavior of GFP-tagged signaling proteins in Jurkat T cells. We show that the coreceptor CD2, the adaptor protein LAT, and tyrosine kinase Lck cocluster in discrete microdomains in the plasma membrane of signaling T cells. These microdomains require protein-protein interactions mediated through phosphorylation of LAT and are not maintained by interactions with actin or lipid rafts. Using a two color imaging approach that allows tracking of single molecules relative to the CD2/LAT/Lck clusters, we demonstrate that these microdomains exclude and limit the free diffusion of molecules in the membrane but also can trap and immobilize specific proteins. Our data suggest that diffusional trapping through protein-protein interactions creates microdomains that concentrate or exclude cell surface proteins to facilitate T cell signaling.

In response to antigen, T cells proliferate and mount an immune response through coordinated processes of cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The discovery of the immunological synapse, a highly organized array of signaling, adhesion, and cytoskeletal proteins at the interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) or a planar membrane bilayer containing APC-associated proteins (Monks et al., 1998Monks C.R.

The molecular patterning observed at the immunological synapse has been proposed to contribute to the sensitivity of signaling initiated by the T cell receptor (TCR; Monks et al., 1998Monks C.R.

However, the precise role of the synapse and its mechanism of formation remain poorly understood (Lee et al., 2002aLee K.H. Holdorf A.D. Dustin M.L. Chan A.C. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Studies of other model systems for T cell signaling also have suggested that membrane subdomains contribute to signal transduction. These model systems include primary and immortalized T cells (e.g., Jurkat cells) that can be activated by anti-TCR antibodies applied to glass coverslips or microspheres. The TCR and many downstream signaling molecules (e.g., tyrosine kinases such as Lck and ZAP-70 and adaptor proteins such as LAT and Grb2) redistribute to the interface between the T cell and its stimulating ligand (Bunnell et al., 2002Bunnell S.C.

Moreover, even within the interface between Jurkat T cells and anti-TCR-coated surfaces, small and transient clusters of signaling molecules have been observed (Bunnell et al., 2002Bunnell S.C.

Several studies also have suggested that actin and myosin motor proteins are involved in the polarization and clustering of cell surface components upon TCR ligation (Wulfing and Davis, 1998Wulfing C.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Clustering of T cell plasma membrane proteins into lipid raft microdomains has been suggested to play an important role in signal transduction. Lipid rafts are created by a partial phase separation of cholesterol, unsaturated sphingolipids, lipid-modified proteins, and proteins with longer transmembrane regions within a membrane bilayer (Rietveld and Simons, 1998Rietveld A. Simons K. The differential miscibility of lipids as the basis for the formation of functional membrane rafts.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The TCR and several downstream signaling molecules have been classified as lipid raft associated (Kabouridis et al., 1997Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C.

Removal of acylation motifs from either the Src family kinase Lck or the transmembrane adaptor protein LAT interferes with signaling, supporting the idea that lipid rafts serve as “platforms” for signal transduction in T cells (Yurchak and Sefton, 1995Yurchak L.K. Sefton B.M. Palmitoylation of either Cys-3 or Cys-5 is required for the biological activity of the Lck tyrosine protein kinase.Mol. Cell.

The most commonly used criterion for classifying a protein as lipid raft associated is insolubility in cold 1% Triton X-100 (Xavier et al., 1998Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Membrane compartmentation is required for efficient T cell activation.Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). However, others have questioned whether detergent insolubility gives rise to artifactual associations (Heerklotz, 2002Heerklotz H. Triton promotes domain formation in lipid raft mixtures.Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2693-2701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, Munro, 2003Munro S. Lipid rafts: Elusive or illusive?.Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), thereby creating controversy over the existence of lipid rafts. In any event, this biochemical method does not provide insight into the dynamics of rafts in living cells. Microscopy provides another avenue for investigating lipid rafts and other types of membrane micodomains. Conventional wide-field or confocal microscopies can visualize large-scale organization of molecules in the membrane but are not necessarily well suited for studying lipid rafts, which might form and dissociate on a rapid timescale and may be smaller than the resolution limit of the light microscope (Varma and Mayor, 1998Varma R. Mayor S. GPI-anchored proteins are organized in submicron domains at the cell surface.Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, Sharma et al., 2004Sharma P. Varma R.

The development of techniques for imaging single fluorophores in vitro and in living cells (Sako et al., 2000Sako Y. Minoghchi S. Yanagida T. Single-molecule imaging of EGFR signalling on the surface of living cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, Nakada et al., 2003Nakada C. Ritchie K. Oba Y.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) offers another means of probing membrane structure and the dynamics of proteins in the plasma membrane. Single-molecule tracking can yield information on diffusion coefficients and boundaries or “fences” that limit diffusion, both of which provide insight into local membrane environments and interactions that constrain mobility (Schutz et al., 1997Schutz G.J. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Single-molecule microscopy on model membranes reveals anomalous diffusion.Biophys.

Phospholipids undergo hop diffusion in compartmentalized cell membrane.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). These techniques also provide information on spatial and temporal heterogeneity in molecular behavior. In T cells, a single-molecule study has reported a large reduction in the diffusion coefficient of the Lck kinase upon TCR crosslinking, which the authors suggest reflects an association with lipid rafts and the actin cytoskeleton (Ike et al., 2003Ike H. Kosugi A. Kato A. Iino R. Hirano H. Fujiwara T. Ritchie K. Kusumi A. Mechanism of Lck recruitment to the T-cell receptor cluster as studied by single-molecule-fluorescence video imaging.ChemPhysChem. 2003; 4: 620-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Imaging of plasma membrane proteins by confocal microscopy and single-molecule techniques provide different but potentially complementary views of membrane structure and protein dynamics, but the two approaches have not been combined in a single study on a given cell type. Moreover, published single-molecule studies have focused on single proteins, but comparisons of several proteins can potentially provide new information on factors that influence protein mobility in the plasma membrane. In this study, using Jurkat T cells, we have combined confocal imaging to examine the overall membrane distributions and total internal reflection microscopy to monitor the single-molecule behaviors of several key molecules involved in T cell signaling. Our results reveal that TCR activation induces the formation of membrane subdomains, distinct from lipid rafts and built by a network of protein-protein interactions, that can exclude or trap distinct signaling molecules. We prepared GFP fusions of two raft-associated proteins (the tyrosine kinase Lck and the adaptor protein LAT) and two nonraft-associated proteins (the costimulatory transmembrane protein CD2 and the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45), as well as selected mutant versions of these proteins. Lck, a Src family kinase, is acylated and partially partitions (∼25%) into a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Xavier et al., 1998Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Membrane compartmentation is required for efficient T cell activation.Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). To probe lipid raft behavior without the influence of protein-protein interactions, we fused GFP to the 10 aa N terminus of Lck (Lck10), which partitions into a detergent-insoluble raft fraction by virtue of the dual lipid modification of two cysteines in this peptide (Shenoy-Scaria et al., 1994Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. Cysteine3 of Src family protein tyrosine kinase determines palmitoylation and localization in caveolae.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). LAT, an adaptor protein that becomes heavily tyrosine phosphorylated after TCR activation and presents docking sites for several SH2 domain-containing downstream signaling proteins (e.g., PLC-γ1 and Grb2; Hartgroves et al., 2003Hartgroves L.C. Lin J. Langen H. Zech T. Weiss A. Harder T. Synergistic assembly of linker for activation of T cells signaling protein complexes in T cell plasma membrane domains.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20389-20394Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), also is lipid modified and fractionates with lipid rafts (Zhang et al., 1998bZhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. LAT palmitoylation: its essential role in membrane microdomain targeting and tyrosine phosphorylation during T cell activation.Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). We also studied a mutant of LAT in which its nine tyrosine phosphorylation sites were mutated to phenylalanine (LAT(Y-F)); this protein partitions into the detergent-insoluble fraction but does not recruit SH2-containing proteins (Lin and Weiss, 2001Lin J. Weiss A. Identification of the minimal tyrosine residues required for linker for activation of T cell function.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29588-29595Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Conversely, we analyzed a dual cysteine mutant of LAT (LAT(C-S)) that is not palmitoylated and does not partition into lipid rafts (Lin et al., 1999Lin J. Weiss A. Finco T.S. Localization of LAT in glycolipid-enriched microdomains is required for T cell activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28861-28864Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CD2 is a transmembrane protein that interacts with CD58 on the APC. This interaction contributes to cell-cell adhesion and generates intracellular signals that enhance the TCR response (Bachmann et al., 1999Bachmann M.F. Barner M. Kopf M. CD2 sets quantitative thresholds in T cell activation.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1383-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Human CD2 is not raft associated by the standard criterion of insolubility in 1% Triton X-100, although it demonstrates partial resistance to extraction at lower (0.2%) Triton X-100 concentrations (Yang and Reinherz, 2001Yang H. Reinherz E.L. Dynamic recruitment of human CD2 into lipid rafts. Linkage to T cell signal transduction.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18775-18785Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally, CD45 is a nonraft, transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase that can dephosphorylate Lck as well as other targets (Janes et al., 1999Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Aggregation of lipid rafts accompanies signaling via the T cell antigen receptor.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). We fused a truncated version of CD45 lacking the majority of its cytoplasmic domain to GFP to track its behavior. Data on the detergent solubility of all of the GFP-tagged proteins used in this study except CD45 and LAT(C-S), which were not present at the cell surface in high enough abundance for analysis by Western blotting, are presented in Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online. In our experimental system, Jurkat T cells were transfected with a GFP- (or mRFP)-tagged protein construct, and then the cells were plated on coverslips that were coated with either anti-TCR antibodies (stimulatory) or nonspecific IgG (nonstimulatory). The former condition triggers actin-mediated cell spreading, induction of calcium transients, and tyrosine phosphorylation (Bunnell et al., 2001Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), though it has been shown that a low, basal level of signaling occurs even in unstimulated Jurkat cells (Roose et al., 2003Roose J.P. Diehn M. Tomlinson M.G. Lin J. Alizadeh A.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Weiss A. T cell receptor-independent basal signaling via Erk and Abl kinases suppresses RAG gene expression.PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: e53https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0000053Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To visualize single GFP-tagged molecules on the T cell surface at the interface with the substrate, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination (Sako et al., 2000Sako Y. Minoghchi S. Yanagida T. Single-molecule imaging of EGFR signalling on the surface of living cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, Axelrod, 2003Axelrod D. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in cell biology.Methods Enzymol. 2003; 361: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and recorded images at video rate using a cooled, intensified CCD camera (Figure 1A ; Movie S1). Individual, diffraction-limited spots typically exhibited single-step photobleaching and single-exponential distributions of bleaching times and were very similar in intensity to purified GFP, indicating that they represent single molecules (Figure S2). Tracking GFP-tagged proteins for 0.5–10 s (Figure 1D) revealed multiple modes of diffusion, even for individual molecules (Figures 1B, 1C, and 1E). In some instances, single molecules were highly mobile in the plane of the membrane, but in other cases, movement was highly restricted. Similar single-molecule behavior for plasma membrane proteins has been described elsewhere (Schutz et al., 1997Schutz G.J. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Single-molecule microscopy on model membranes reveals anomalous diffusion.Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, Dietrich et al., 2002Dietrich C.

J. 2004; 86: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, individual molecules often made abrupt transitions between “immobile” and “mobile” states (Figures 1C and 1E). For this reason, we employed a method for calculating diffusion coefficients that could measure transitions in mobility over time for individual molecules (Figures 2A and 2B ; see Experimental Procedures).Figure 2Diffusional Immobilization and Response to TCR Signaling for Several GFP-Tagged Signaling MoleculesShow full caption(A) and (B) illustrate the experimental determination of diffusion coefficients.

In (A), a representative single-molecule trajectory is shown (duration = 2.90 s).

(C) Histograms of diffusion coefficients are shown for unstimulated and TCR-activated cells for Lck-GFP, Lck10-GFP, LAT-GFP, LAT(C-S)-GFP, LAT(Y-F)-GFP, CD2-GFP, and CD45-GFP. Average values are reported in Table S1. Given the potentially large difference in radius between a lipid raft and a single membrane protein, our a priori prediction was that raft-associated proteins would have lower diffusion coefficients than raft nonassociated proteins. We tested this prediction by examining the distributions of diffusion coefficients for all the above constructs. Histograms of the diffusion coefficients revealed distinct behaviors for the different GFP-tagged proteins in unstimulated T cells (Figure 2; Table S1). At one extreme, single CD2-GFP molecules were primarily immobile with only occasional episodes of rapid mobility (average diffusion coefficient of 0.04 μm2/s; Table S1). At the other extreme, the raft-targeted Lck10-GFP was primarily mobile and displayed the highest average diffusion coefficient of the proteins tested (0.73 μm2/s). In between these two extremes were Lck, LAT, and LAT(C-S). The histograms of these proteins revealed a peak of very low diffusion coefficients and then a long trailing shoulder of higher values. In contrast, the histograms for the raft-targeting motif of Lck (Lck10-GFP) and the nonphosphorylatable LAT (LAT(Y-F)-GFP) both lacked the relatively immobile population peak at the far left of the histogram. CD45 displayed a similar distribution and also had an intermediate mean value (0.45 μm2/s). In summary, the diffusional behaviors of different proteins in the T cell signaling pathway vary significantly and do not correlate with biochemical fractionation into lipid rafts. For example, CD2, which does not behave as a classical lipid raft protein, is less mobile than the lipid raft-associated proteins Lck, Lck10, LAT, and LAT(Y-F). In addition, interfering with lipid raft association of LAT through mutations did not alter its diffusion behavior. Thus, we conclude that factors other than partitioning into a detergent-insoluble raft fraction determine the diffusional properties of signaling molecules in the T cell membrane. We also examined how activation of TCR signaling by anti-TCR antibodies affects single-molecule diffusion. TCR activation triggered a significant reduction in diffusion coefficient for LAT and the nonpalmitoylated LAT(C-S) mutant, but not for any of the other proteins (Figure 2; Table S1). This result indicates that signaling alters the local environment of LAT and does so independently of lipid rafts. To better understand the differences in the single-molecule diffusion behavior of various signaling proteins, we examined their distributions by confocal and epifluorescence microscopy in living cells. We simultaneously imaged CD2-mRFP along with GFP fusions of a number of other proteins involved in TCR signaling, stimulating the cells for 10 min prior to imaging. CD2 localized to numerous discrete clusters at the antibody-proximal surface of the cell (Figure 3).

Rather, as has been noted by others (Bunnell et al., 2001Bunnell S.C. Kapoor V. Trible R.P. Zhang W. Samelson L.E.

Surprisingly, while treating cells with Latrunculin A prior to activation prevented CD2 clustering and cell spreading, adding the drug 10 min after activation had no discernable effect on the distribution of CD2 (Figure S3). Together, these results suggest that F-actin is required for the formation, but not maintenance of CD2 clusters. CD45 also did not colocalize with CD2, being reduced at the center compared to the periphery as shown previously (Johnson et al., 2000Johnson K.G. Bromley S.K. Dustin M.L. Thomas M.L.

Stable interactions between MLL1 and MOF were confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation, cosedimentation, and cotransfection analyses, and interaction sites were mapped to MLL1 C-terminal and MOF zinc finger domains. The purified complex has a robust MLL1-mediated histone methyltransferase activity that can effect mono-, di-, and trimethylation of H3 K4 and a MOF-mediated histone acetyltransferase activity that is specific for H4 K16. Importantly, both activities are required for optimal transcription activation on a chromatin template in vitro and on an endogenous MLL1 target gene, Hox a9, in vivo. These results indicate an activator-based mechanism for joint MLL1 and MOF recruitment and targeted methylation and acetylation and provide a molecular explanation for the closely correlated distribution of H3 K4 methylation and H4 K16 acetylation on active genes."

Identifying the causal perturbations that confer malignant transformation is a central goal in cancer biology. Here we report an RNAi-based genetic screen for genes that suppress transformation of human mammary epithelial cells. We identified genes previously implicated in proliferative control and epithelial cell function including two established tumor suppressors, TGFBR2 and PTEN. In addition, we uncovered a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor role for REST/NRSF, a transcriptional repressor of neuronal gene expression. Array-CGH analysis identified REST as a frequent target of deletion in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, we detect a frameshift mutation of the REST gene in colorectal cancer cells that encodes a dominantly acting truncation capable of transforming epithelial cells. Cells lacking REST exhibit increased PI(3)K signaling and are dependent upon this pathway for their transformed phenotype. These results implicate REST as a human tumor suppressor and provide a novel approach to identifying candidate genes that suppress the development of human cancer."

The nucleotide contents are identical, and in both cases the conformation of the GTP-containing, intra-dimer interface is indistinguishable from the GDP-containing, inter-dimer contact. Here we present two structures corresponding to the start and end points in the microtubule polymerization and hydrolysis cycles that illustrate the consequences of nucleotide state on longitudinal and lateral assembly. In the absence of depolymerizers, GDP-bound tubulin shows distinctive intra-dimer and inter-dimer interactions and thus distinguishes the GTP and GDP interfaces. A cold-stable tubulin polymer with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPCPP, containing semi-conserved lateral interactions, supports a model in which the straightening of longitudinal interfaces happens sequentially, starting with a conformational change after GTP binding that straightens the dimer enough for the formation of lateral contacts into a non-tubular intermediate. Closure into a microtubule does not require GTP hydrolysis."

However, the molecular mechanism by which this happens is unknown. We addressed this question for two dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated protein kinases (DYRKs), as they autophosphorylate their activation loop on an essential tyrosine but phosphorylate their substrates on serine and threonine. Here we demonstrate that autophosphorylation of the critical activation-loop tyrosine is intramolecular and mediated by the nascent kinase passing through a transitory intermediate form. This DYRK intermediate differs in residue and substrate specificity, as well as sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors, compared with its mature counterpart. The intermediate’s characteristics are lost upon completion of translation, making the critical tyrosine autophosphorylation a “one-off” inceptive event. This mechanism is likely to be shared with other kinases."

https://openalex.org/W2023794544,"How the replication machinery is loaded at origins of DNA replication is poorly understood. Here, we implicate in this process the Xenopus laevis homolog (xRTS) of the RECQL4 helicase mutated in Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. xRTS, which bears homology to the yeast replication factors Sld2/DRC1, is essential for DNA replication in egg extracts. xRTS can be replaced in extracts by its human homolog, while RECQL4 depletion from mammalian cells induces proliferation failure, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function. xRTS accumulates on chromatin during replication initiation, after prereplication-complex (pre-RC) proteins, Cut5, Sld5, or Cdc45 but before replicative polymerases. xRTS depletion suppresses the loading of RPA, the ssDNA binding protein that marks unwound origins before polymerase recruitment. However, xRTS is unaffected by xRPA depletion. Thus, xRTS functions after pre-RC formation to promote loading of replication factors at origins, a previously unrecognized activity necessary for initiation. This role connects defective replication initiation to a chromosome-fragility disorder."

These results identify several mechanisms that confine ubiquitylation of RNAPII to the forms of the enzyme that arrest during elongation. RNAPII requires assistance from a plethora of transcription factors not only to initiate from promoters but also to perform efficient transcript elongation. It is evident from several lines of evidence that transcript elongation by RNAPII involves frequent pausing and stalling, and an important role of the many elongation accessory factors may be to minimize the negative impact of such events on transcription (Arndt and Kane, 2003Arndt K.M. Kane C.M. Running with RNA polymerase: eukaryotic transcript elongation.Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 543-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). But what happens when RNAPII becomes irreversibly arrested during transcription? Irreversible, or prolonged, arrest is likely to be a frequent occurrence, not least in response to DNA damage (Svejstrup, 2002Svejstrup J.Q. Mechanisms of transcription-coupled DNA repair.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Because RNAPII transcription is strand specific and does not involve special lesion-bypass polymerases such as those used for DNA replication, irreversible stalling/arrest in an active gene can only be dealt with by repairing the damage so that transcription can continue or by somehow physically removing the stalled polymerase. Evidence for both processes has been obtained (Svejstrup, 2003Svejstrup J.Q. Rescue of arrested RNA polymerase II complexes.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Several types of DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes are removed much more quickly than in the nontranscribed strand or in the genome overall, via a process called transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) (Bohr et al., 1985Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C.

Mechanisms of transcription-coupled DNA repair.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms underlying TC-NER are still elusive but involve the stalled polymerase and the transcription-repair coupling factors Cockayne’s syndrome (CS) A and CSB (Troelstra et al., 1992Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.

CSB belongs to the Swi2/Snf2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases, and its functional homolog in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is called Rad26 (van Gool et al., 1994van Gool A.J. Verhage R.

Evidence for ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of RNAPII in response to UV-generated DNA damage has also been obtained (Bregman et al., 1996Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J.

Ultraviolet radiation alters the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II large subunit and accelerates its proteasome-dependent degradation.Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A functional connection between TC-NER and RNAPII degradation was uncovered when it was found that yeast Rad26 interacts with Def1, a protein required for ubiquitylation of RNAPII in response to DNA damage but not for TC-NER (Woudstra et al., 2002Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. A Rad26-Def1 complex coordinates repair and RNA pol II proteolysis in response to DNA damage.Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Conversely, while Rad26 is required for normal TC-NER, it is not necessary for RNAPII degradation. Together, these data led to the suggestion that cells contend with damage-stalled RNAPII by a two-pronged approach. First, rapid repair of the lesion by Rad26-mediated TC-NER is attempted. However, if this fails, RNAPII is degraded via Def1-mediated ubiquitylation/degradation, presumably allowing the damage to later be dealt with via general genome repair (Woudstra et al., 2002Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q.

Rescue of arrested RNA polymerase II complexes.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This sequence of events, with ubiquitylation/degradation of RNAPII being the last resort, was suggested based on experiments in yeast, but data from mammalian systems are also consistent with this scenario (Luo et al., 2001Luo Z. Zheng J. Lu Y. Bregman D.B. Ultraviolet radiation alters the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II large subunit and accelerates its proteasome-dependent degradation.Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Lee et al., 2002Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Transcription-coupled and DNA damage-dependent ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). While an overall model has been suggested for the mechanisms ensuring that irreversibly stalled RNAPII does not persist for long enough to compromise cell viability (Svejstrup, 2003Svejstrup J.Q. Rescue of arrested RNA polymerase II complexes.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), biochemical results to directly support it are few. Moreover, studies to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying RNAPII ubiquitylation and degradation are absent or confusing. For example, it is unclear if (and how) the ubiquitylation machinery is directed specifically toward arrested RNAPII as proposed. If stalled/arrested RNAPII is indeed the target for ubiquitylation/degradation, this raises the question of how polymerases stalling at DNA lesions during transcript elongation are distinguished from polymerases that are immobile at promoters or are in the discontinuous, early stages of transcript elongation (promoter clearance). One of the distinguishing features of the different forms of RNAPII during the transcription cycle is their phosphorylation state (on the C-terminal repeat domain [CTD] of the Rpb1 subunit) (Svejstrup, 2004Svejstrup J.Q. The RNA polymerase II transcription cycle: cycling through chromatin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, RNAPII entering promoters is hypophosphorylated; newly initiated (promoter-proximal) polymerases are phosphorylated at serine 5 in the CTD repeat, while RNAPIIs engaged in processive transcript elongation are predominantly phosphorylated at serine 2 and not at serine 5. However, the way that phosphorylation of RNAPII affects its ubiquitylation is still unclear. RNAPII is a target for ubiquitylation in HeLa nuclear extracts, and ubiquitylation in these extracts is increased under conditions that allow transcription or when the DNA template is damaged (Lee et al., 2002Lee K.B. Wang D. Lippard S.J. Sharp P.A. Transcription-coupled and DNA damage-dependent ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 4239-4244Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, whether these stimulatory effects are caused by arrested elongation complexes or indirect effects has not been addressed. Experiments addressing the effect of RNAPII phosphorylation on ubiquitylation are similarly open to doubt. On one hand, it was reported that the form of RNAPII whose level was diminished most quickly after UV irradiation was the hypophosphorylated form (Ratner et al., 1998Ratner J.N. Balasubramanian B. Corden J. Warren S.L. Bregman D.B. Ultraviolet radiation-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Implications for transcription-coupled DNA repair.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5184-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). On the other hand, experiments using kinase inhibitors of some degree of specificity were used as basis to suggest that CTD phosphorylation plays a positive role for RNAPII ubiquitylation (Mitsui and Sharp, 1999Mitsui A. Sharp P.A. Ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II large subunit signaled by phosphorylation of carboxyl-terminal domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6054-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Luo et al., 2001Luo Z. Zheng J. Lu Y. Bregman D.B. Ultraviolet radiation alters the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II large subunit and accelerates its proteasome-dependent degradation.Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The correct interpretation of these experiments in complex biological systems is complicated by the fact that the apparent disappearance of hypophosphorylated RNAPII after UV irradiation (Ratner et al., 1998Ratner J.N. Balasubramanian B. Corden J. Warren S.L. Bregman D.B. Ultraviolet radiation-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Implications for transcription-coupled DNA repair.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5184-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) might be caused by CTD phosphorylation rather than ubiquitylation and degradation. Likewise, CTD phosphorylation is required for transcription, and polymerase arrest during transcription might be required for ubiquitylation, so the proposed positive effect of CTD phosphorylation (Mitsui and Sharp, 1999Mitsui A. Sharp P.A. Ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II large subunit signaled by phosphorylation of carboxyl-terminal domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 6054-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Luo et al., 2001Luo Z. Zheng J. Lu Y. Bregman D.B. Ultraviolet radiation alters the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II large subunit and accelerates its proteasome-dependent degradation.Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) might also be indirect or potentially even misleading. The importance of better understanding the connection between RNAPII ubiquitylation and the CTD is also underscored by experiments performed with the conserved ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, which mediates damage-induced RNAPII ubiquitylation/degradation in yeast (Beaudenon et al., 1999Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase mediates DNA damage-induced degradation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Rsp5 contains a WW domain, through which it interacts with RNAPII in vitro. This protein-protein interaction seems to occur via the RNAPII CTD but does not require CTD phosphorylation (Huibregtse et al., 1997Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. The large subunit of RNA polymerase II is a substrate of the Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, the functional importance for RNAPII ubiquitylation of this interaction has not been tested, and its significance has been questioned by the finding that numerous unrelated proteins carrying a WW domain are also capable of binding the CTD in vitro (Gavva et al., 1997Gavva N.R. Gavva R. Ermekova K. Sudol M. Shen C.J. Interaction of WW domains with hematopoietic transcription factor p45/NF-E2 and RNA polymerase II.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24105-24108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In order to facilitate a real understanding of RNAPII ubiquitylation at the basic biochemical level, we established an in vitro assay, which reconstitutes the reaction using highly purified, physiologically relevant factors. By the use of this system and complementing in vivo experiments, we present evidence that sheds light on the importance of the RNAPII ternary complex, DNA damage, and Def1, as well as the CTD and CTD phosphorylation, for RNAPII ubiquitylation. Our data provide a conceptual context in which to understand the targeting of RNAPII for ubiquitylation and degradation in response to not only arrest at DNA lesions but also other transcription-obstructing events. Protein ubiquitylation typically requires enzymes of three different functional types, E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) (Pickart, 2001Pickart C.M. Mechanisms underlying ubiquitination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that Rsp5 is the E3 for damage-induced ubiquitylation of budding yeast RNAPII (Beaudenon et al., 1999Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase mediates DNA damage-induced degradation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6972-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As there is only one known E1 (Uba1), the only remaining unknown factor for the basic ubiquitylation reaction was therefore the E2. We reconstituted RNAPII ubiquitylation with recombinant ubiquitylation factors and RNAPII, testing a variety of human rE2s for their ability to support the reaction. Only Ubc5c supported robust RNAPII ubiquitylation (Figure 1A ). The yeast homolog of human Ubc5c, Ubc5, was therefore expressed, purified, and used with the other highly purified yeast factors (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) in the subsequent experiments. Using this defined system, it was first established that the RNAPII ubiquitylation reaction indeed requires E1, E2, and E3 (Figure 1B). To investigate whether the reconstituted ubiquitylation reaction targeted a biologically relevant lysine acceptor residue, RNAPII ubiquitylated in vitro was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (Winkler et al., 2002Winkler S.G. Lacomis L. Philip J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Svejstrup J.Q. Tempst P. Isolation and mass spectrometry of transcription factor complexes.Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we identified a singly protonated peptide with a molecular mass of 1956.027 Da, which corresponds to GG from the C terminus of ubiquitin linked to KVLDVTKEAQANLLTAK (residues 689–705) of Rpb1. This peptide contains Rpb1 lysine 695, which was previously identified as a target of ubiquitylation in vivo as part of a proteomics approach to generally identify ubiquitylated proteins in yeast (Peng et al., 2003Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D. Gygi S.P. A proteomics approach to understanding protein ubiquitination.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the reconstituted in vitro assay indeed results in ubiquitylation of an acceptor lysine previously identified as a target of the reaction in vivo. The biological relevance of the in vitro assay was further investigated by performing in vivo experiments. In yeast, Ubc4 and Ubc5 are encoded by very similar genes (97% similar at the amino acid level) whose function is overlapping (Seufert and Jentsch, 1990Seufert W. Jentsch S. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC4 and UBC5 mediate selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). So, to investigate if Ubc5 is also the E2 for RNAPII ubiquitylation in vivo, wild-type cells and cells lacking UBC4, UBC5, or both were UV irradiated and compared for their ability to degrade RNAPII (Figure 1C). As observed previously (Beaudenon et al., 1999Beaudenon S.L. Huacani M.R. Wang G. McDonnell D.P. Huibregtse J.M. Rsp5 ubiquitin-protein ligase mediates DNA damage-induced degradation of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell.

A Rad26-Def1 complex coordinates repair and RNA pol II proteolysis in response to DNA damage.Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), Rpb1, but not tubulin, was temporarily degraded in response to DNA damage (Figure 1C, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Such degradation was also observed in ubc4 and ubc5 single mutants. In contrast, ubc4 ubc5 double mutant cells were unable to degrade Rpb1 under the same conditions (Figure 1C). These experiments thus support the finding that Ubc5 (or Ubc4) is the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme involved in damage-mediated degradation of RNAPII. Having established a fully defined in vitro ubiquitylation system with physiologically relevant factors, it was now possible to address important questions regarding basic properties and regulation of the RNAPII ubiquitylation reaction. We first investigated whether the incorporation of RNAPII into an elongation-competent ternary complex with DNA and RNA affects the efficiency of the ubiquitylation reaction. Ternary RNAPII/DNA/RNA complexes were assembled from highly purified RNAPII and DNA/RNA oligonucleotides (Kireeva et al., 2000Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Waugh D.S. Kashlev M. The 8-nucleotide-long RNA:DNA hybrid is a primary stability determinant of the RNA polymerase II elongation complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6530-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), of which one of the DNA oligonucleotides (the transcribed strand) was biotin tagged so that ternary complexes could be purified (Figure S2; see also Experimental Procedures for details). Purified ternary complexes were then compared with free RNAPII in the ubiquitylation assay (Figure 2A ). Strikingly, RNAPII in a purified ternary complex was a much better substrate for ubiquitylation than the same polymerase in free form was (Figure 2B, upper panel), with up to 25-fold more ubiquitylation observed when ternary complexes were used as substrate (Figure 2B, lower panel). Purification of RNAPII after ubiquitylation further confirmed that it was indeed the polymerase, rather than another protein in the reaction mixture, which was modified (Figure S3). More significantly, the stimulation of RNAPII ubiquitylation in the elongation complex was not observed when the RNA oligonucleotide was omitted so that active RNAPII was only associated with DNA (the purified DNA-RNAPII complex mimicking promoter bound RNAPII) (Figure 2C, compare lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, these data opened the possibility that it is primarily the RNAPII ternary complex, rather than specifically the structure arising when RNAPII arrests at a DNA lesion, that is recognized by the ubiquitylation machinery. To directly address this possibility, RNAPII ternary complexes were formed with oligonucleotides of which the transcribed strand did, or did not, contain a transcription-obstructing DNA lesion in the active site of RNAPII (Figure 3A ). In one case, RNAPII was allowed to transcribe 34 nucleotides before reaching the lesion (or arresting, if CTP was omitted, on the undamaged control template). In a parallel set of experiments, knowledge of the precise position of RNAPII arrest (data not shown) allowed assembly from oligonucleotides of a ternary complex directly at the transcription-blocking DNA lesion or on the corresponding “undamaged” coding strand (Figure S2; see Experimental Procedures for details). In both sets of experiments, when “damaged” and “undamaged” ternary complexes were compared, similar final levels of RNAPII ubiquitylation were invariably observed (data not shown). However, a time course of the ubiquitylation reaction uncovered a preference for damage-stalled RNAPII (Figure 3C, compare lanes 3 and 11). These data support the idea that the ubiquitylation machinery possesses an intrinsic ability to recognize a polymerase arrested in a gene but that damage-arrested RNAPII is a particularly good substrate. Having established that RNAPII in a ternary complex is an excellent target for ubiquitylation, we now investigated the effect of the Def1 protein. Def1 is required for DNA-damage-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of RNAPII in vivo (Woudstra et al., 2002Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. A Rad26-Def1 complex coordinates repair and RNA pol II proteolysis in response to DNA damage.Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and recent results using an assay based on crude yeast cell-free extracts showed that it is also involved in ubiquitylation in vitro (Reid and Svejstrup, 2004Reid J. Svejstrup J.Q. DNA damage-induced Def1-RNA polymerase II interaction and Def1 requirement for polymerase ubiquitylation in vitro.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29875-29878Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the purified system, Def1 failed to elicit a positive effect on ubiquitylation of free RNAPII but rather appeared to somewhat inhibit the reaction (Figure 3B and data not shown). However, when RNAPII was incorporated into a ternary complex, Def1 clearly stimulated the ubiquitylation reaction, significantly increasing the rate of modification (Figure 3C, compare lanes 2 and 3 with 6 and 7). A stimulatory effect of Def1 on ubiquitylation in the presence of DNA damage was much less pronounced but still detectable (compare lanes 10 and 14). These data support the idea that Def1 contributes directly to the preferential degradation of RNAPII stalled/arrested during transcript elongation by increasing the rate of its ubiquitylation. Genetic data indicate that Def1 plays a role in transcript elongation also in the absence of DNA damage (Woudstra et al., 2002Woudstra E.C. Gilbert C. Fellows J. Jansen L. Brouwer J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. A Rad26-Def1 complex coordinates repair and RNA pol II proteolysis in response to DNA damage.Nature. 2002; 415: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and the data presented above support the idea that transcriptional arrest in general provides a strong signal for RNAPII ubiquitylation. Therefore, we tested whether DNA-damage-independent transcriptional arrest can also lead to RNAPII ubiquitylation in living cells. For this purpose, the effect of the elongation inhibitor 6-azaurazil (6-AU) on RNAPII ubiquitylation was tested (6-AU causes a decrease in cellular UTP/GTP levels). RNAPII was immunoprecipitated from sonicated yeast extracts, and the ubiquitylation state of Rpb1 was then tested by Western blotting, probing with anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Figure 4). Treatment with 6-AU clearly induced RNAPII ubiquitylation (compare lanes 1 and 2). Significantly, compromising transcript elongation by deletion of DST1 (encoding TFIIS, in whose absence the ability of RNAPII to escape arrest is significantly impaired) in itself resulted in detectable RNAPII ubiquitylation and also led to a further marked increase in Rpb1 ubiquitylation levels in the presence of 6-AU (compare lanes 2 and 4, and refer to loading control shown in the lower panel). In strong support of the idea that the same factors are responsible for damage-induced and damage-independent ubiquitylation, RNAPII modification was dramatically reduced in ubc4 ubc5 double mutant cells (Figure 4, lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these data support the idea that transcriptional arrest provoked by damage-independent events also elicits RNAPII ubiquitylation. We next used the in vitro ubiquitylation system to investigate the functional importance of the RNAPII CTD for ubiquitylation. For these experiments, we took advantage of a yeast strain expressing a modified form of Rpb1 as the only source of this subunit (Feaver et al., 1991Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. CTD kinase associated with yeast RNA polymerase II initiation factor b.Cell. 1991; 67: 1223-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This form has a recognition site for FXa protease engineered in between the body of the Rpb1 protein and its highly flexible CTD repeats. We purified RNAPII to virtual homogeneity from this strain by adsorbing it to CTD binding 8WG16 antibodies immobilized on Sepharose beads. After treatment of the bead bound material with FXa protease, only CTD-less RNAPII was released. As expected (Feaver et al., 1991Feaver W.J. Gileadi O. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. CTD kinase associated with yeast RNA polymerase II initiation factor b.Cell. 1991; 67: 1223-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the mobility of the Rpb1ΔCTD subunit was increased compared to normal Rpb1, while that of other subunits was unchanged (Figure 5A and data not shown). Strikingly, when similar amounts of the two RNAPII forms were compared in the reconstitution assay, only wild-type RNAPII was ubiquitylated (Figure 5B). Incorporation of the CTD-less polymerase into a ternary complex (Figure 5C) or addition of a large excess of ubiquitylation enzymes (data not shown) both failed to overcome the inhibition of the ubiquitylation reaction observed upon CTD removal. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the CTD is absolutely required for RNAPII ubiquitylation. The CTD is reversibly modified by serine phosphorylation at positions 2 and 5 during the transcription cycle (Svejstrup, 2004Svejstrup J.Q. The RNA polymerase II transcription cycle: cycling through chromatin.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of CTD phosphorylation on RNAPII ubiquitylation. TFIIK and CTDK1 were purified to near homogeneity (see Figure S4) and used in phosphorylation rea"

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important component of the angiogenic response to ischemia. Here we used adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery to skeletal muscle to examine the effects of VEGF vs. a stabilized form of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha). The recombinant AAVs were injected into mouse tibialis anterior muscle, and their effects were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and functional assays. These analyses showed that stabilized HIF-1alpha markedly increase capillary sprouting and proliferation, whereas VEGF164 or VEGF120 induced only proliferation of endothelial cells without formation of proper capillary structures. The Evans Blue permeability assay indicated that, unlike VEGF, HIF-1alpha overexpression did not increase vascular leakiness in the transduced muscle. Doppler ultrasound imaging showed that vascular perfusion in the HIF-1alpha treated muscles was significantly enhanced when compared to the controls and not further improved by co-expression of the arteriogenic growth factors angiopoietin-1 or platelet-derived growth factor-B. Our results show that AAV-mediated transduction of a stabilized form of HIF-1alpha can circumvent the problems associated with overexpression of individual angiogenic growth factors. HIF-1alpha should thus offer a potent alternative for pro-angiogenic gene therapy."

In the epidermis, nucleotides are involved in proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we have used a combination of luciferin-luciferase luminometry, pharmacological inhibitors, and confocal microscopy to demonstrate that HaCaT keratinocytes release ATP into the culture medium, and that there are three mechanisms for nucleotide interconversion, resulting in ATP generation at the cell surface. Addition of ADP, GTP, or UTP to culture medium elevated the ATP concentration. ADP to ATP conversion was inhibited by diadenosine pentaphosphate, oligomycin, and UDP, suggesting the involvement of cell surface adenylate kinase, F1F0 ATP synthase, and nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDPK), respectively, which was supported by immunohistochemistry. Simultaneous addition of ADP and GTP elevated ATP above that for each nucleotide alone indicating that GTP acts as a phosphate donor. However, the activity of NDPK, F1F0 ATP synthase or the forward reaction of adenylate kinase could not fully account for the culture medium ATP content. We postulate that this discrepancy is due to the reverse reaction of adenylate kinase utilizing AMP. In normal human skin, F1F0 ATP synthase and NDPK were differentially localized, with mitochondrial expression in the basal layer, and cell surface expression in the differentiated layers.

Extracellular nucleotides, such as ATP and ADP, are now recognized as important autocrine and paracrine factors involved in the regulation of many cellular processes in a wide range of tissues. They act via activation of the P2 family of receptors of which there are two subgroups: the P2X receptors (ligand-gated ion channels) and the P2Y receptors (G protein-coupled receptors) as determined by their molecular structure, transduction pathways, and pharmacological properties (1Abbracchio M.P. Boeynaems J.M. Barnard E.A. Boyer J.L. Kennedy C. Miras-Portugal M.T. King B.F. Gachet C. Jacobson K.A. Weisman G.A. Burnstock G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 52-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). There are currently seven members of the P2X subgroup (P2X1-7) (2Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.P. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar) and eight members of the P2Y subgroup (P2Y1,2,4,6,11-14) identified in mammalian cell types (3Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 64: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). In the epidermis, P2 receptors are involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and thus subtypes are expressed in different regions. Differential expression of multiple P2 receptor subtypes is species- and cell type-dependent (4Pillai S. Bikle D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Reimer W.J. Dixon S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1040-C1048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol.

Burnstock G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 1007-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), P2X5 receptors are expressed in keratinocytes in the early stages of differentiation, i.e. the spinous layer, and P2X7 receptors are confined to the terminally differentiated cells of the cornified layer (8Greig A.V.

Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In vitro, normal human keratinocytes express mRNA for P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, and P2Y6 receptors, although from [Ca2+]i and proliferation studies only the P2Y2 receptor appears to be functional (10Burrell H.E. Bowler W.B. Gallagher J.A. Sharpe G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 440-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptor mRNA is down-regulated during Ca2+-induced differentiation (10Burrell H.E. Bowler W.B. Gallagher J.A. Sharpe G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 440-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) in agreement with immunohistochemical reports. In contrast, in the HaCaT cell line (human keratinocyte cell line) (11Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar), multiple P2Y receptors are functional, including P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 subtypes, with the P2Y4 receptor being the most predominant (10Burrell H.E. Bowler W.B. Gallagher J.A. Sharpe G.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 440-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and possibly reflecting on the differences in culture conditions. Because the upper cornified layers of the epidermis are constantly abraded, nucleotides are important in normal epidermal homeostasis where changes in the rates of proliferation and differentiation are necessary to maintain the epidermal barrier. Furthermore, during wounding, nucleotides are released by platelets as part of the aggregation reaction associated with clotting (12Huang N. Wang D. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7904-7908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and by dead or damaged cells at sites of trauma. Collectively, these increase the rate of proliferation above that of normal homeostasis, thus enhancing healing. Nucleotides are not only released from platelets or by dead or damaged cells, but they are also constitutively released by keratinocytes under static conditions (7Dixon C.J. Bowler W.B. Littlewood-Evans A. Dillon J.P. Bilbe G. Sharpe G.R. Gallagher J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for ATP release is well established in platelets (13Detwiler T.C. Feinman R.D. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2462-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and neurons/neuroendocrine cells (14Unsworth C.D. Johnson R.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Although changes in nucleotide concentrations will be initially localized, diffusion and/or convection facilitate changes in the entire extracellular space. The presence of these enzymes has huge consequences when studying P2 receptors, because subsequent responses are unlikely to be due to the nucleotide added, unless nucleotide conversion is accounted for. More importantly, this will also have repercussions for P2 receptor identification, because agonist potency series are one method by which P2Y receptors are classified. The presence of interconversion enzymes has not previously been studied in keratinocytes or the skin, nor have all the mechanisms for nucleotide conversion at the cell surface been studied in a single cell type. Furthermore, little is known about the kinetics of conversion by cells. This makes it difficult to determine a time point at which effects of extracellular nucleotides can be investigated, without the concern that conversion has already taken place. In this study, we have shown evidence for ATP synthesis via ecto-adenylate kinase, ecto-F1F0 ATP synthase, and ecto-NDPK in the keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT.

Mouse monoclonal primary antibody raised to the β subunit of ATP synthase and MitoTracker Red CMXRos were purchased from Molecular Probes (via Cambridge BioScience Ltd., Cambridge, UK). Epidermal growth factor receptor antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Nm23-H1 antibody was purchased from Insight Biotechnology (Middlesex, UK). Triton X-100, sodium azide, and paraformaldehyde were all purchased from VWR International Ltd. (Leicestershire, UK). The HaCaT cell line was a gift from Professor Fusenig (Division of Differentiation and Carcinogenesis in Vitro, Institute of Biochemistry, German Carcinogenesis Research Centre). ATP monitoring reagent (AMR) was purchased from Cambrex (Wokingham, UK) in the form of a ViaLight™ HS kit and was reconstituted according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Ap5A was used in an untreated and treated form. Treated Ap5A was produced by incubation for 2 h with 20 units/ml grade VII apyrase. Apyrase activity was removed by heat-treating it at 100 °C for 10 min. Samples of ATP and ADP were then added, and bioluminescence was measured using AMR to ensure that apyrase activity had been destroyed. Background ATP and ADP concentrations from the treated-Ap5A were measured to confirm purity. Cell Culture—HaCaT cells were cultured in DMEM with additional supplements of 5% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The osteoblast-like cell line, SaOS-2, was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HaCaT cells were passaged at ∼70% confluence and were preincubated with 0.02% EDTA for 5-10 min, before incubation with 0.05% trypsin in 0.02% EDTA for 5 min. SaOS-2 cells were passaged similarly, but did not require the preincubation stage with EDTA. Cells were resuspended in fresh DMEM and split at a ratio of 1:10. Cells were utilized between passages 48 and 75. Experiments were carried out in 12-well plates seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and cultured overnight or until confluent before ATP measurements were carried out. Measurement of Extracellular ATP—Complete DMEM was removed from confluent HaCaT cells grown in 12-well plates. Cells were then washed twice in warm PBS prior to addition of 0.5 ml of serum-free DMEM. Plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to ensure that ATP, released through mechanical stimulation when changing the medium, had degraded. Nucleotides were then added to the cells, and 200-μl samples of medium were collected almost immediately (after ∼5 s) into 5-ml round-bottomed polystyrene tubes. Where more than one nucleotide was added, this was carried out simultaneously. When inhibitors were added, these were introduced to the cells 10 min prior to addition of nucleotides and were incubated at 37 °C with the cells. To each tube, 20 μl of AMR containing luciferin and luciferase was added, and the tubes were placed into a Berthold tube luminometer (LB 955 Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Relative light unit readings were taken every second for a period of 5 s. The light emitted was detected by a photon counter covering the spectral range from 380 to 630 nm. Mean values were then calculated, and measurements from controls were subtracted. These controls consisted of nucleotides and/or inhibitors in serum-free medium (vehicle) alone (with the exception of Fig. 5, A and B). For Fig. 5 (A and B), 40-μl samples of medium were removed immediately and then every 10 min for a total of 90 min. To each of these samples, 4 μl of AMR was added, and the ATP concentration was measured as outlined above. Finally, ATP standard curves were produced using known concentrations of ATP, and from these, measurements of relative light units were converted into ATP concentrations. Measurement of ADP—To measure ADP, 2 μl of each sample was carefully pipetted into the bottom of clean luminometer tubes, and the ATP content was measured by addition of 20 μl of AMR. The amount of light emitted (relative light units) was immediately recorded. To each tube, 6 μl of 100 μm phosphoenolpyruvate (to give final concentration of 10 μm) and 10 units of pyruvate kinase (33.5 μl of 100 units/ml or 1 mg of protein/ml) were added, and the bioluminescence was recorded per second over a 5-s period. The mean bioluminescence was calculated, and the ATP measurement for the corresponding tube was subtracted. As a control, the amount of light produced for the tube containing 20 μl of AMR, 6 μl of phosphoenolpyruvate, and 33.5 μl of pyruvate kinase was also recorded per second over a 5-s period, and the mean value was calculated. This was then subtracted from the tubes containing ADP, and the final readings were converted into ADP concentrations using a calibration curve. Confocal Microscopy—HaCaT cells were seeded onto 22-mm glass coverslips at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml and were allowed to grow overnight. Cells were washed with PBS three times for 10 min each to remove culture medium. After staining, coverslips were mounted with VectaShield and sealed on glass slides before visualization using a Leica (SP2 AOBS) confocal microscope. Control Cells (Intracellular Staining)—In Fig. 9, cells were incubated for 30 min with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (final concentration 100 nm) and washed in PBS prior to fixation. Cells in all experiments were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and quenched in 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked for 10 min in blocking buffer (0.1% BSA in PBS), and washed in PBS for a further 10 min. Cells were incubated for 5 h in the presence of primary antibodies (3 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody raised to the β subunit of ATP synthase or 1:200 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to nm23-H1) in 0.1% sodium azide and 1% BSA in PBS, before washing five times in PBS for 10 min each to remove excess primary antibody and incubation in the dark with secondary antibodies (3 μl/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugate for ATP synthase or 3 μl/ml pig anti-rabbit IgG FITC for nm23-H1) in 0.1% sodium azide in PBS for 5 h at 4 °C. Coverslips were then washed five times in PBS for 10 min each to remove excess secondary antibody. Cell Surface Staining—Cells were washed in PBS prior to fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and quenching in 50 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min. The unpermeabilized cells were then incubated for 5 h with primary antibodies (1:200 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) simultaneously with 3 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody raised to the β subunit of ATP synthase) in 0.1% sodium azide and 1% BSA in PBS. Cells were then washed five times in PBS for 10 min each to remove excess primary antibody and incubated in the dark with 3 μl/ml pig anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate (in 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) for 5 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed five times in PBS for 10 min each to remove excess secondary antibody. This was then repeated with 3 μl/ml rabbit anti-mouse TRITC conjugate (in 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) and a further series of 5 washes with PBS as already outlined. To observe NDPK distribution, this procedure was repeated using 1:200 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to nm23-H1 (in 0.1% sodium azide and 1% BSA in PBS) and 3 μl/ml pig anti-rabbit IgG FITC (secondary antibody). Immunohistochemistry for Paraffin Sections—Normal human skin was fixed in formal saline for 24 h and paraffin-embedded. Skin sections (15 μm) were mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and dried overnight in a 50 °C oven before dewaxing with xylene and rehydrating through alcohols. Sections were then stained using the protocol outlined for cell surface staining of keratinocytes grown on coverslips. Primary antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibody raised to the β subunit of ATP synthase and rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to nm23-H1 (in 0.1% sodium azide and 1% BSA in PBS). Secondary antibodies used were pig anti-rabbit IgG FITC conjugate for visualization of nm23-H1 and rabbit anti-mouse TRITC conjugate for visualization of ATP synthase. Ethical approval was obtained from the Liverpool Ethics Committee. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was carried out with analysis of variance, with the significant between groups determined by a Tukey post test. Increasing Cell Number Increases ATP in the Bathing Medium—In previous studies (7Dixon C.J. Bowler W.B. Littlewood-Evans A. Dillon J.P. Bilbe G. Sharpe G.R. Gallagher J.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1680-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), confluent cultures of normal human keratinocytes have been shown to release ATP in real-time experiments. However, this has not previously been shown in the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, neither has release in keratinocytes been shown to be dependent on cell number. Therefore, HaCaT cells were seeded into 12-well plates at densities ranging from 100 to 1,000,000 cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h. Complete medium was then removed, replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for a further hour. The ATP concentration was measured from duplicate samples (2 × 200 μl) of medium using AMR. Because the ATP concentration of the medium surrounding the cells increased with cell number per well, this suggests that HaCaT cells also release ATP (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this release was greater in the HaCaT cell line than with osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells, when seeded at the same density (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Culture medium surrounding HaCaT cells contains more ATP than that surrounding SaOS-2 cells. HaCaT and the osteoblast-like cell line, SaOS-2, were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to adhere and grow for 24 h. Complete medium was removed and replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free medium before 200-μl samples were collected and ATP concentrations measured using AMR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ADP, GTP, and UTP Elevate the ATP Concentration of Bathing Medium—Because SaOS-2 cells have previously been reported to express ecto-NDPK activity (43Buckley K.A. Golding S.L. Rice J.M. Dillon J.P. Gallagher J.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), this prompted the hypothesis that conversion of extracellular nucleotides would also take place in HaCaT cells. HaCaT cells were, therefore, grown in 12-well plates and stimulated with various P2 receptor agonists. Cell culture medium was collected, and the ATP concentration was determined. Although addition of 10 μm ATP, UDP, and 2-methylthio-5′-adenosine diphosphate had no effect on the concentration of ATP in the culture medium (after correction by subtraction of controls; i.e. nucleotides in the absence of cells), ADP, GTP, and UTP (10 μm) elevated ATP in the medium by ∼250, 100, and 100 nm (5.5-, 2.5-, and 2.5-fold), respectively (Fig. 3). This differs from the results found in SaOS-2 cells, where only ADP induced an increase in the concentration of ATP in the culture medium (43Buckley K.A. Golding S.L. Rice J.M. Dillon J.P. Gallagher J.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The increase in ATP observed on addition of ADP to HaCaT cells was concentration-dependent (Fig. 4) and was also much greater than that reported in SaOS-2 cells (43Buckley K.A. Golding S.L. Rice J.M. Dillon J.P. Gallagher J.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, over a period of 90 min, although ATP is readily degraded by ecto-nucleotidases (Fig. 5A) when ATP (10 μm) is directly added to HaCaT cells, the ATP produced by interconversion of 10 μm ADP → ATP (Fig. 5B) appears to be relatively stable with time and is much lower at ∼250 nm. Both the ATP-degrading and ATP-forming activities were confirmed as enzyme-mediated, because the results in the presence of cells (Fig. 5, solid squares and solid line) differed to those from identical experiments in the absence of cells (solid triangles and dotted line).Fig. 4ADP elevates ATP in the culture medium in a concentration-dependent manner. Increasing concentrations of ADP (1-50 μm) were added to confluent cultures of HaCaT cells. Samples (200 μl) of culture medium were collected, and the ATP concentration was measured. ATP measurements from ADP samples in the absence of cells were also taken and subtracted from those in the presence of cells. Experiments were performed in duplicate and are representative of two separate experiments. Data shown are mean ± S. E.

https://openalex.org/W2054493526,"Nuclear shell structures--the distribution of the quantum states of individual protons and neutrons--provide one of our most important guides for understanding the stability of atomic nuclei. Nuclei with 'magic numbers' of protons and/or neutrons (corresponding to closed shells of strongly bound nucleons) are particularly stable. Whether the major shell closures and magic numbers change in very neutron-rich nuclei (potentially causing shape deformations) is a fundamental, and at present open, question. A unique opportunity to study these shell effects is offered by the 42Si nucleus, which has 28 neutrons--a magic number in stable nuclei--and 14 protons. This nucleus has a 12-neutron excess over the heaviest stable silicon nuclide, and has only one neutron fewer than the heaviest silicon nuclide observed so far. Here we report measurements of 42Si and two neighbouring nuclei using a technique involving one- and two-nucleon knockout from beams of exotic nuclei. We present strong evidence for a well-developed proton subshell closure at Z = 14 (14 protons), the near degeneracy of two different (s(1/2) and d(3/2)) proton orbits in the vicinity of 42Si, and a nearly spherical shape for 42Si."
https://openalex.org/W1986964454,"The cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family of metal ion transporters plays important roles in zinc transport at all phylogenetic levels. In this report, we describe a novel interaction between two members of the CDF family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One CDF member in yeast, Msc2p, was shown recently to be involved in zinc transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and required for ER function. We describe here a newly recognized CDF family member in yeast, Zrg17p. ZRG17 was previously identified as a zinc-regulated gene controlled by the zinc-responsive Zap1p transcription factor. A zrg17 mutant exhibits the same zinc-suppressible phenotypes as an msc2 mutant, including an induction of the unfolded protein response in low zinc. Moreover, a significant fraction of the total Zrg17p protein appears to localize to the ER. Their common phenotypes and localization suggested that these two proteins function together to mediate zinc transport into the ER. Consistent with this hypothesis, Msc2p and Zrg17p physically interact with each other, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. Therefore, we propose that Msc2p and Zrg17p form a heteromeric zinc transport complex in the ER membrane. We also demonstrate that ZnT5 and ZnT6, mammalian homologues of Msc2p and Zrg17p, functionally interact as well.

Zinc is required by all organisms because of the essential roles this metal plays in cells. For example, zinc is important for the activity of many proteins that reside in or move through the secretory pathway. In pancreatic β cells, zinc is needed for the assembly of proinsulin into homohexamers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ZRE, zinc-responsive element; CDF, cation diffusion facilitator; UPR, unfolded protein response; TAP, tandem affinity purification. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ZRE, zinc-responsive element; CDF, cation diffusion facilitator; UPR, unfolded protein response; TAP, tandem affinity purification. and/or Golgi (1.Huang X.F.

Biol. 1998; 8: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The subsequent packaging of insulin into crystalline structures within secretory granules also requires zinc (1.Huang X.F. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20417-20423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Killer T cells present antigen peptides on their cell surface bound to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. The processing of some of these peptides takes place in the ER by the ER-associated aminopeptidase, which utilizes zinc in its active site (3.Rock K.L. York I.A. Goldberg A.L. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 4.Serwold T. Gonzalez F. Kim J. Jacob R. Shastri N. Nature. 2002; 419: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Zinc metalloenzymes responsible for attaching phosphoethanolamine groups to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors are resident ER proteins (5.Galperin M.Y. Jedrzejas M.J. Proteins. 2001; 45: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6.Mann K.J. Sevlever D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As a last example, the Scj1p protein chaperone in the ER of yeast is a DnaJ homologue needed for protein folding and ER-associated degradation (7.Shen Y. Meunier L. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Scj1p has two zinc finger motifs and probably requires zinc for its function (9.Linke K. Wolfram T. Bussemer J. Jakob U. J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Because of these and the many other needs for zinc, eukaryotic cells must utilize zinc transport proteins in their plasma membranes and intracellular organelles for the uptake and intracellular distribution of zinc. The activities of these transporters are often regulated to maintain consistent intracellular zinc levels in the face of changing zinc availability. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been an excellent model system for studying zinc transport and regulation. The initial uptake of zinc into the cytoplasm of yeast is accomplished by three transporters on the plasma membrane: Zrt1p, Zrt2p, and Fet4p (11.Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 12.Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33749-33757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In times of zinc deficiency, zinc stores in the vacuole are mobilized by the Zrt3p transporter protein to supply zinc to the cytoplasm and other organelles (14.MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Alternatively, when zinc levels in the cytoplasm become replete or excessive, the Zrc1p protein is involved in transporting extra zinc into the vacuole to be stored (15.MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39187-39194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The genes for these zinc transporter proteins are regulated by the zinc-responsive transcription factor, Zap1p. Zap1p up-regulates genes in zinc-deficient conditions by binding to an 11-base pair consensus sequence, a zinc-responsive element (ZRE), found in one or more copies in the promoters of its target genes (16.Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Lyons et al. (17.Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) performed microarray analysis on the yeast transcriptome and estimated that as many as 46 genes in the yeast genome are directly regulated by Zap1p. Whereas many of the yeast zinc transporters known to date have been shown to be Zap1p targets, the Msc2p protein is not. Msc2p is a member of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family of metal ion transporters (18.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 19.Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Many members of the CDF family transport metal ions such as zinc either out of the cell or into intracellular organelles (18.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 20.Liuzzi J.P. Cousins R.J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 151-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Msc2p was recently shown to be localized to the ER and involved with zinc transport into this compartment (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Under low zinc conditions, an msc2 mutant exhibits an up-regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and has defects in ER-associated protein degradation, suggesting that Msc2p and zinc are needed for proper ER function (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The UPR and ER-associated degradation defects as well as other phenotypes of the msc2 mutant are all suppressible by elevated zinc. These observations suggested that there are other zinc transporters active in the ER/secretory pathway. Two vacuolar zinc transporters, Zrc1p and Cot1p, were found to potentially contribute to ER zinc levels; an msc2 zrc1 cot1 triple mutant caused an up-regulation of the UPR in low zinc even higher than that seen in an msc2 mutant alone. However, even this triple mutant was suppressed by elevated zinc (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These observations led us to look for more potential zinc transporters in the secretory pathway. One candidate for such a protein was Zrg17p. Previous studies of ZRG17 determined it to be a Zap1p target and regulated by zinc at the mRNA level (i.e. ZRG17 is up-regulated in low zinc and down-regulated in high zinc) (17.Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 22.Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zrg17p is a probable membrane protein with multiple transmembrane domains. It was previously proposed that Zrg17p was involved in zinc uptake, perhaps under environmental conditions where Zrt1p was less effective (22.Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, zrg17 mutants have an abnormal large cell morphology, which is suppressed by the addition of higher amounts of zinc in the medium (22.Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An msc2 mutant also exhibits this zinc-suppressible large cell phenotype (21.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This suggested that Zrg17p may be involved in ER zinc transport. In this report, we determined that this is the case and that Zrg17p and Msc2p physically interact to form a complex that transports zinc into the ER. Last, we suggest that Zrg17p is a distant member of the CDF family and present evidence that other CDF family members interact to form heteromeric complexes for metal ion transport.

To generate mutant strains CEY9 (DY150 zrg17::KanMX) and CEY11 (DY150 msc2::HIS3 zrg17::KanMX), the KanMX cassette with 500 bp flanking the ZRG17 open reading frame was amplified by PCR from the zrg17 yeast deletion mutant (Research Genetics).

Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and pZnT6 was a gift from Liping Huang (University of California, Davis, CA) (25.Huang L. Kirschke C.P. Gitschier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). pRS316GAL1LEU2, pYES2L, and pZnT5L were generated by swapping the URA3 gene on pRS316GAL1, pYES2, and pZnT5, respectively, with the LEU2 gene using the marker swap plasmid pUL9 (26.Cross F.R. Yeast. 1997; 13: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). pZRG17 and pZRG17HA were constructed the same way as pMSC2 and pMSC2HA (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR products containing the ZRG17 promoter and open reading frame (and terminator in the case of pZRG17) were put into pFL38 or YCpZRC1-HA by homologous recombination to generate pZRG17 and pZRG17HA, respectively (27.Ma H. Kunes S. Schatz P.J. Botstein D. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To generate the pGAL-ZRG17HA construct, the ZRG17 open reading frame starting at the fourth in-frame ATG plus 3× hemagglutinin antigen (HA) tags and termination sequence from pZRG17HA was amplified by PCR. This fragment was then inserted into the SacI site of the vector pRS316GAL1LEU2 by homologous recombination. We previously determined that the annotation in the Saccharomyces Genome Data base is likely to be incorrect regarding the ATG translation start site of the ZRG17 gene (17.Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). All of the above plasmids encoding ZRG17 constructs were confirmed to be functional by complementation of the zrg17 mutant growth phenotype on YPGE plates at 37 °C. pGEV-TRP1 was co-transformed with pRK315, pZnT5L, or pZnT6 so that expression levels of Pma1p-HA, ZnT5, and ZnT6 could be controlled by the addition of β-estradiol (Sigma) (10-7 to 10-6 m) (28.Gao C.Y.

After initial selection for the plasmids, transformed cells were harvested and subsequently plated onto YPGE plates at a concentration of ∼10,000 cells/plate. YPGE plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 or 4 days and screened for colonies. Plasmids were isolated from these colonies and sequenced. One of the plasmids isolated was pHSP150, whose insert consists of a genomic fragment from yeast chromosome X and contains the HSP150 gene. Growth Assays—The desired strains were grown overnight in YPD, SD galactose, or SD glucose with the appropriate auxotrophies and β-estradiol where indicated. These cultures were subsequently diluted into the same medium, and 5 μl of diluted culture, yielding 104 or 103 cells, were spotted onto YPGE or YPGEgal plates. Where indicated, different concentrations of ZnCl2 and/or β-estradiol were added to the plates. The plates were incubated 3-4 days and photographed. β-Galactosidase Assays and Subcellular Fractionation—β-Galactosidase assays, with specific activity normalized to protein content, and subcellular fractionation, where protein extracts were fractionated on sucrose gradients with or without Mg2+, were performed as described previously (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Protein Lysates, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Protein lysates for co-immunoprecipitation were obtained as follows. Yeast cultures were grown to an A600 = ∼ 1.0 in LZM medium containing 1 or 1000 μm zinc. The cells were harvested, washed once with water, and resuspended in 50 mm NaCl. Protein lysates were obtained using glass beads in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm EDTA (all from Sigma), mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture pellets (Roche Applied Science)) and vortexing 10 × 30 s, with 30 s on ice between pulses. The cell debris was pelleted by centrifuging for 2 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was the total protein lysate. The lysates were then solubilized with 3% LM (n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside) (MP Biomedicals) on ice for 2 h. The insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifuging for 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C. The detergent-soluble protein lysates were diluted 1:3 into IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), and then 50 μl of IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to each lysate. The lysates plus beads were rotated at 4 °C for 30 min, after which the beads were washed four times with IPP150 buffer plus 0.1% LM. The beads were resuspended in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and incubated at 65 °C for 30 min to elute the proteins off of the beads. Equal volumes of eluted protein lysates were loaded onto SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. When denatured by boiling, epitope-tagged Zrg17p exhibited high molecular weight aggregates on immunoblots (data not shown). Therefore, lysates containing epitope-tagged Zrg17p were always denatured for 30 min at either 37 °C or 65°C prior to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were done by standard techniques (29.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Blots were visualized with POD (Roche Applied Science). Band quantitation to determine -fold difference in protein levels was performed using NIH Image 1.61. Antibodies used were rabbit anti-HA (Sigma), mouse anti-Dpm1p (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), rabbit anti-Kex2p (gift of Steven Nothwehr, University of Missouri-Columbia), goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary (Pierce), and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary (Pierce). Zrg17p Is a Distant Member of the CDF Family of Metal Ion Transporters—The Zrg17p protein is 504 amino acids in length. While originally estimated to have seven transmembrane domains (22.Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the consensus of several algorithms (e.g. TOPPRED2, SOSUI, DAS, HMMTOP, and TMPRED) predicted only six such domains in the Zrg17p protein (Fig. 1A). Membrane topology predictions of Zrg17p consistently placed both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends on the cytosolic surface of cellular membranes. This topology is common among many members of the CDF family of metal ion transporters (18.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Sequence data base comparisons indicated that Zrg17p is closely related to gene products found in a number of other fungal species, including Aspergillus nidulans, Gibberella zeae, Neurospora crassa, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Ashbya gossypii. When the amino acid sequences of these orthologs were used to identify other related proteins in the sequence data bases using PSI-BLAST, several members of the CDF family were identified in the first iteration. For example, the human ZnT3 and ZnT6 CDF proteins were detected with E-values of 1 × 10-6 and 8 × 10-6, respectively. These results suggested that Zrg17p and its fungal orthologs are distant members of the CDF family of metal transporters. Zrg17p and its closely related proteins appear to form a distinct subfamily of CDF proteins, as indicated by a multiple sequence alignment/tree-building analysis depicted in Fig. 1B. Unlike many other CDF proteins, however, Zrg17p has a histidine-rich domain (... HDHDEINEQIPHSH...) located between predicted transmembrane domains III and IV (Fig. 1A). Similar domains are found between transmembrane domains IV and V in most other eukaryotic CDF proteins. Studies Implicating Zrg17p in ER Zinc Transport—Zrg17p was previously proposed to be involved in zinc uptake across the plasma membrane (22.Yuan D.S. Genetics. 2000; 156: 45-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the apparent relationship of Zrg17p to members of the CDF family suggested that this protein was more likely to transport zinc either outside of the cell or into an intracellular compartment. Furthermore, the zinc-suppressible large cell phenotype previously observed for zrg17 mutants was similar to that seen with msc2 mutants. This suggested that Zrg17p may also be involved in transporting zinc into the ER lumen. If so, we predicted that zrg17 mutants would share other phenotypes with msc2 mutants. We generated an isogenic strain where the ZRG17 gene was deleted from the genome. We also generated an msc2 zrg17 double deletion strain. If Msc2p and Zrg17p functioned separately to supply zinc to the ER, we predicted that these phenotypes would be more severe in the double mutant than in either single mutant. However, if Msc2p and Zrg17p functioned in the same pathway, no additivity of their effects would be expected. Mutant msc2 cells grow well at 30 °C on rich YPGE medium plates containing the respired carbon sources glycerol and ethanol but grow poorly at 37 °C (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This temperature-sensitive growth phenotype is suppressible by high zinc added to the medium (21.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, the zrg17 mutant also exhibited a temperature-sensitive growth defect on YPGE, and it was also suppressible by added zinc. To determine whether the msc2 and zrg17 single mutations differed in their severity, we assessed suppression of the growth defect over a range of zinc concentrations added to these plates. The single mutants each showed partial suppression with the addition of 100-250 μm zinc and full suppression with 500 μm zinc added. Thus, msc2 and zrg17 mutants show very similar zinc-suppressible growth defects at 37 °C. As expected, the msc2 zrg17 double mutant also showed poor growth on YPGE at the higher temperature. Similar concentrations of added zinc suppressed the double mutant to the same degree as the single mutants, indicating that the two mutations are not additive for this phenotype. Another previously observed phenotype of the msc2 mutant is the up-regulation of the UPR in zinc-limiting conditions (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The UPR is a response to misfolded proteins in the ER of cells whereby protein chaperones and degradation systems are up-regulated to refold or degrade the aberrant proteins. The increased level of UPR in msc2 mutants probably reflects, at least in part, the zinc requirement of luminal protein chaperones (i.e. Scj1p) (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We introduced a UPR reporter construct (UPRE-lacZ) into the msc2, zrg17, and msc2 zrg17 mutants and determined the activity of this reporter over a range of zinc concentrations. As observed previously, wild type cells show a small induction in UPRE-lacZ expression under low zinc conditions, and the msc2 mutation exacerbates this effect (Fig. 2B). Like the msc2 mutant, the zrg17 mutant also exhibited elevated UPRE-lacZ activity in low zinc (LZM + 0.3-10 μm ZnCl2) compared with wild type cells. The double mutant showed an increase similar to that seen in both single mutants, again demonstrating that these mutations are not additive with respect to this phenotype. We have shown previously that activity of a HIS4-lacZ reporter, which is not responsive to either zinc or unfolded proteins, showed high expression in both wild type and mutant strains at all zinc concentrations (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This indicates that the results presented here are specific to the UPRE-lacZ reporter and not a general effect on lacZ activity. Therefore, the UPRE-lacZ results suggest that Zrg17p, like Msc2p, is needed to maintain protein folding in the ER. Previous studies suggested that loss of Msc2p function results in an increased level of labile cytosolic/nuclear zinc, and this is consistent with the role of Msc2p in transporting cytosolic zinc into the ER lumen (10.Ellis C.D. Wang F. MacDiarmid C.W. Clark S. Lyons T. Eide D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21.Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 5036-5043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This phenotype was observed using a Zap1p-regulated ZRE-lacZ reporter construct. Zap1p activity and ZRE-lacZ expression is high when labile zinc levels decrease and is reduced when labile zinc levels rise. If Msc2p and Zrg17p are involved in the same process, we predicted that the zrg17 mutant would also have altered Zap1p-mediated regulation. The ZRE-lacZ reporter was transformed into the msc2, zrg17, and msc2 zrg17 mutants to determine whether these strains have altered zinc homeostasis. In wild type cells, Zap1p is more active in low zinc, resulting in high expression of the ZRE-lacZ reporter (Fig. 2C). With increasing medium zinc concentrations, Zap1p becomes less active, resulting in decreased expression of the reporter. The reporter expression profile in the msc2, zrg17, and msc2 zrg17 mutants was quite different from the wild type profile. All three mutants had reporter activity in LZM plus 1-30 μm ZnCl2 lower than that seen in wild type cells. These results suggest that Zap1p is sensing higher amounts of zinc in the cytosol of these mutants and are consistent with Zrg17p, like Msc2p, being needed to transport zinc into an intracellular compartment. Once more, the phenotypes of the single mutants were not additive in the double mutant. Finally, we tested whether zrg17 mutants also show a genetic interaction that we discovered for msc2. We performed a genetic screen for genes that, when overexpressed from a high copy plasmid, could suppress the msc2 temperature-sensitive growth defect (see “Materials and Methods”). One gene identified in this screen was HSP150. Hsp150p is a cell wall protein whose exact function is unknown. However, overexpression of Hsp150p completely suppresses the temperature-sensitive msc2 growth defect. As seen in Fig. 3, HSP150 overexpressed from a high copy plasmid (pHSP150) also suppressed the growth defect of the zrg17 mutant as well as the msc2 zrg17 double mutant. Thus, the zrg17 and msc2 mutant defects are alleviated by the same overexpression suppressor. These results, combined with shared and nonadditive phenotypes of the zrg17 and msc2 mutants described in Fig. 2 argue that both proteins are involved in the same pathway supplying zinc to the endoplasmic reticulum of yeast.

Under most reaction conditions for integration in vitro, the majority of the reaction products are “half-site” products that result from integration of only one viral DNA end into one strand of the target DNA. Preprocessed DNA substrates are more efficient substrates for half-site reactions than are blunt-ended substrates, which require the removal of two nucleotides prior to integration. In contrast, we find that blunt-ended DNA is a better substrate for the biologically relevant reaction of concerted integration of pairs of viral DNA ends. The reaction pathway is channeled to concerted integration, and half-site integration products are reduced with blunt-ended DNA substrate that must first be processed by integrase. In addition, the terminal nucleotide requirements for concerted integration are more stringent than for the half-site reaction. Longer DNA is more efficient for the concerted reaction than is shorter DNA that is capable of efficient half-site integration. This suggests that nonspecific interactions of integrase with viral DNA distant from the termini contribute to the assembly of a complex that is competent for concerted integration. Finally, differential effects of mutation of a residue in the C-terminal domain of integrase on concerted versus half-site integration implicate protein-protein interactions involving this domain as important for concerted integration.

Integration of retroviral DNA into the host chromosomal DNA, an essential step in the retroviral replication cycle, involves two chemical steps (1Craigie R. Craig N.L. Craigie R. Gellert M. Lambowitz A.M. Mobile DNA II. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2002: 613-630Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The newly synthesized blunt-ended viral DNA first undergoes 3′ end processing. In this reaction, two nucleotides are removed from each 3′ end. Next, the exposed hydroxyl groups attack a pair of phosphodiester bonds on opposite strands of the target DNA to complete the strand transfer step. For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PIC, preintegration complex; LTR, long terminal repeat; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; IN, integrase; NC, nucleocapsid. the sites of attack are separated by 5 bp, resulting in a five-base duplication of target DNA sequence upon repair of the resulting integration intermediate. In the presence of a divalent metal ion, the viral integrase protein alone is able to carry out both 3′ processing and DNA strand transfer with simple DNA substrates that mimic the viral DNA ends (2Bushman F.D. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5645-5648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F. Cell. 1990; 62: 829-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 4Katz R.A.

However, under most reaction conditions the products of DNA strand transfer result from the integration of a single viral DNA end into one strand of the target DNA, a reaction that has been termed “half-site” as opposed to concerted integration. Were this to occur in the cell, the viral DNA would fail to integrate, and the viral replication cycle would be aborted. Following reverse transcription, the viral DNA remains associated with integrase and other viral and cellular proteins as part of the preintegration complex (PIC) (5Brown P.O. Bowerman B. Varmus H.E.

PICs isolated from infected cells efficiently integrate their DNA into a target DNA in vitro. In contrast to the typical reaction products with purified integrase, the products mostly result from concerted integration of a pair of viral DNA ends into target DNA. Although early work demonstrated that the integrase proteins of several retroviruses could accomplish concerted integration, the efficiency was extremely low and required genetic selection to detect the products (2Bushman F.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4454-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that, under appropriate reaction conditions, both Rous sarcoma virus and HIV-1 integrase proteins alone are capable of much higher efficiencies of concerted integration allowing the products to be detected directly by physical assays. Other studies have suggested that viral or cellular proteins in addition to integrase may be involved in promoting concerted integration (23Hindmarsh P. Leis J. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 397-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Aiyar A. Hindmarsh P. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3571-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Carteau S. Gorelick R.J.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In principle, biochemical dissection of the preintegration complex could reveal the factors that contribute to highly efficient concerted integration. Unfortunately, these complexes are present in low abundance in cell extracts, and our knowledge of even their protein composition alone is largely limited to that obtainable from immunoprecipitation experiments. Because PICs are not readily amenable to detailed biochemical analysis at the molecular level, it is necessary to reconstitute complexes with all the features of those isolated from cells to fully understand their functioning. To this end, we have investigated the factors that promote concerted integration by HIV-1 integrase. We found that blunt-ended DNA substrates are more efficient for concerted integration than “preprocessed” substrates. This indicated that the 3′ processing reaction pathway plays a role in channeling the reaction to the concerted integration pathway. In addition, the 2-base overhang-generated 3′ processing is important for promoting concerted integration. These findings suggest a rationale for why HIV-1 synthesizes an additional two nucleotides beyond the proviral sequence; the 2-base overhang generated by 3′ processing is important for the subsequent integration step. A gain of function mutant in the C-terminal domain of integrase was found to carry out more efficient concerted integration than the wild type protein, whereas a different mutation of the same residue abolished concerted integration without affecting the half-site reaction. These results suggest that the C-terminal domain is involved in a multimerization interface that is required for concerted integration but is dispensable for the half-site reaction. DNA Substrates—The 355-bp linear mini-viral DNAs were prepared by NdeI or ScaI digestion of pNde355 and pSca355, respectively, and purified on agarose gels. NdeI or ScaI digestion of these plasmids, which are based on pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), results in a linear fragment flanked by 21 bp of HIV-1 NL4-3 U5 LTR and U3 LTR sequences. NdeI digestion of pNde355 gives the precleaved substrate, and ScaI digestion of pSca355 gives the blunt-ended substrate. The precleaved DNA contains unique BamHI and AatII restriction sites, 61 and 248 bp from the U3 terminus, respectively. The blunt-ended DNA substrate contains unique ClaI and AatII restriction sites, 55 bp and 250 bp from the U3 terminus, respectively. The DNA fragments were treated with alkaline phosphatase before 5′ end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. Target DNAs were supercoiled [phis]X174 (5386 bp) or pBR322 (4361 bp). The ∼410-bp substrates S1, S2, and S3 were made by ligation of oligonucleotides containing 21 bp of U5 terminal sequence to the EcoRI site of a 380-bp BamH1 to EcoRI restriction fragment of pBR322. The oligonucleotides were designed so that S1 terminated with the authentic sequence of HIV-1-preprocessed DNA, S2 terminated with the authentic sequence of blunt-ended DNA, and S3 terminated with the sequence corresponding to preprocessed substrate made by NdeI cleavage. Protein Expression and Purification—Except as noted, HIV-1 integrase carrying the F185H and C280S mutations was used. These mutations improve the solubility of the protein and do not compromise viral replication in vivo (27Leavitt A.D. Robles G. Alesandro N. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bischerour J. Leh H. Deprez E. Brochon J.C. Mouscadet J.F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). F185H/C280S integrase was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography essentially as described for the catalytic domain (29Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). After removal of the His tag with thrombin, the protein was loaded onto a Mono S HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15-0.65 m NaCl, containing 25 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight against 1 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (w/v) glycerol. The purified protein was concentrated using a Centriprep (YM-10 membrane, Millipore) membrane, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Integrase protein with the W235F or W235A mutation was purified as described for wild type His-tagged integrase (30Craigie R. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Karn J. HIV: A Practical Approach. 2. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 53-71Google Scholar). Briefly, the integrase was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and the cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. The lysate was centrifuged, and integrase was extracted from the pellet in buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The protein was then purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and the His tag was removed with thrombin. HMGA1 was purified as described elsewhere (31Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). HMGB1 was a gift from Dr. Martin Gellert, National Institutes of Health. HIV-1 NC was a gift from Dr. Louis Henderson, NCI-Frederick, National Institutes of Health. Integration Assay—Typical reaction mixtures (50-μl final volume) were assembled by incubating 80 nm integrase on ice in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 12% Me2SO, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% polyethylene glycol-6000, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ZnCl2, and 100 mm NaCl (final) followed by the addition of 10 nm donor DNA substrate. These components were preincubated on ice for 1 h, and 500 ng of target plasmid DNA was then added. After an additional 1-h preincubation on ice, the reaction was initiated by a transfer to incubation at 37 °C, which continued for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS and EDTA to 0.1% and 10 mm, respectively, together with 5 μg of proteinase K. Incubation was continued at 37 °C for a further 1 h. 10 μl of the reaction mixture was then electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose gel in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Scale-up reactions for restriction analysis or gel isolation of products were extracted with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol and then with chloroform only followed by ethanol precipitation. Gels were dried, exposed to imaging plates, and visualized and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Integration Assay—We initially used a 355-bp linear DNA with 21 bp of U5 LTR sequence at one end and 21 bp of U3 LTR sequence at the other end as the viral DNA substrate for integration. The ends were generated by cleavage with NdeI, which leaves the 3′ ends terminating with the CA dinucleotide corresponding to the product of 3′ end processing. Like authentic viral DNA, this substrate has a 2-base overhang at the 5′ ends, but this overhang differs in sequence from the natural substrate. Supercoiled pBR322 or [phis]X174 served as the target DNA for integration. The potential products of one-end or two-end integration events are depicted in Fig. 1. In preliminary experiments we explored a wide range of reaction conditions (data not shown). As reported previously by Grandgenett and co-workers (20Sinha S. Pursley M.H. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the presence of polyethylene glycol in the reaction mixture was found to be critical for promoting the two-end integration reaction. The products of a typical reaction are shown in Fig. 2. The identity of each band was confirmed by restriction analysis (supplemental Fig. 1). The major product of concerted integration corresponds to the product labeled concerted in Fig. 1; restriction analysis showed that, as reported by Grandgenett and co-workers (20Sinha S. Pursley M.H. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), pairs of U5 ends were preferentially used compared with U3/U5 pairs or U3/U3 pairs (supplemental Fig. 1). Cloning and sequencing of integration products demonstrated that most exhibited the 5-bp target site duplication characteristic of HIV-1 DNA integration (supplemental Table I). The 1-LTR coupled product was not observed, probably because of the stiffness of the short DNA that energetically disfavors intramolecular juxtaposition of two ends on the same DNA molecule. The major half-site reaction products corresponded to the tagged circle and donor/donor products depicted in Fig. 1.Fig. 2Products of an integration reaction with 355-bp U3/U5 viral DNA substrate and circular pBR322 as the target. The viral DNA was 5′ end-labeled with 32P. Reaction products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized using a PhosphorImager. The positions of the 2-LTR concerted integration product, the half-site product, and products resulting from integration of viral DNA substrate into itself (Donor/donor) are indicated. The migration positions of linear size markers are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Concerted Integration Is Less Sensitive to High Ionic Strength than Is Half-site Integration—Most of the literature on HIV-1 integrase activities reports assays and conditions under which the integration products almost exclusively result from half-site integration events. These assays are highly sensitive to salt, and low salt is essential for robust activity. Fig. 3 shows that in the assay reported here low salt also greatly stimulates the half-site reaction. Although the two-end reaction exhibits a similar trend, there is a much lesser salt dependence than for the half-site reaction. Although the efficiency of the half-site reaction progressively decreases with increasing ionic strength, the efficiency of concerted integration remains constant between 150 and 350 mm NaCl. The nucleoprotein complexes that mediate concerted integration are therefore more stable with high ionic strength than those that carry out the half-site reaction. This property mirrors the functional association of integrase with the preintegration complex, which is not dissociated even at greater than 0.5 m concentrations of NaCl. Concerted Integration Is Not Stimulated by Host Factors—The Grandgenett laboratory has reported that relatively efficient concerted integration by HIV-1 integrase can occur without cellular or viral cofactors (20Sinha S. Pursley M.H. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas other reports have implicated the cellular proteins HMGB1 (23Hindmarsh P. Leis J. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 397-410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HMGA1 (26Hindmarsh P. Ridky T. Reeves R. Andrake M. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the viral protein NC (25Carteau S. Gorelick R.J. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as cofactors for concerted integration. Although they are clearly not essential, we wished to determine whether they have any effect on the efficiency of concerted integration under our assay conditions. Stimulation was observed at only the highest concentration of HMGB1, and no stimulation was observed with the other proteins tested (Fig. 4). Blunt-ended DNA Substrate Is More Efficient than Preprocessed Substrate for Concerted Integration—Viral DNA made by reverse transcription is blunt-ended and must be processed to remove two nucleotides from the 3′ ends prior to the strand transfer step. However, most previous studies of concerted integration in vitro used preprocessed viral DNA substrates that bypass the 3′ end-processing step of the integration reaction. The issue of whether processing by integrase influences the subsequent DNA strand transfer step has not been addressed. Both blunt-ended and preprocessed substrate work efficiently in simple in vitro assays of DNA strand transfer that monitor the half-site reaction with short DNA substrates mimicking one end of the viral DNA. Because the concerted integration of blunt substrate requires that both ends first be processed, we anticipated that preprocessed substrate would be more efficient for concerted integration than blunt-ended substrate would be. Fig. 5 shows that, contrary to this expectation, blunt-ended substrate is actually better for concerted integration than preprocessed substrate (compare with the preprocessed substrate Fig. 3). Half-site integration events are also decreased with blunt-ended substrate. NdeI-cleavage provides a convenient way to generate a preprocessed substrate, but the resulting 2-base overhang differs in sequence from the natural substrate. To test whether the identity of these bases influences concerted integration, we synthesized blunt-ended and preprocessed substrates with the natural terminal sequence, together with a preprocessed substrate with a terminus corresponding to the product of NdeI cleavage. Fig. 5C shows that blunt-ended DNA is more efficient for concerted integration even when compared with preprocessed DNA with the authentic terminal sequence. However, although the NdeI-cut and authentic preprocessed substrates are equally competent for half-site integration, the NdeI-cut preprocessed substrate is less efficient for concerted integration than is the authentic preprocessed substrate. The sequence of the two terminal bases therefore influences the efficiency of concerted integration; preprocessed substrates with CA and AT overhangs are equally efficient for half-site integration. IN/W235F Carries Out Concerted Integration More Efficiently than Wild Type IN—The W235E or W235A mutation in IN abolishes viral replication of HIV-1 even though the activity of integrase is normal in in vitro assays that do not distinguish concerted from half-site integration products (27Leavitt A.D. Robles G. Alesandro N. Varmus H.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 721-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Cannon P.M. Wilson W. Byles E. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4768-4775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Leavitt A.D. Shiue L. Varmus H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2113-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cannon P.M. Byles E.D. Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 651-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, HIV-1 IN with the mutation W235F is replication-competent (35Engelman A. Englund G. Orenstein J.M. Martin M.A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2729-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the replication defect of the Trp-235 mutant might be due to an inability to carry out concerted integration. Fig. 6 shows that this is indeed the case. Half-site reaction products are seen at normal levels, whereas concerted integration products are not detected. Interestingly, the W235F mutant carried out concerted integration more efficiently than either wild type integrase (data not shown) or the F185H/C280S mutant. The profound differential effects of mutation of this residue on half-site versus concerted integration suggest a role in a protein-protein interface that is required for the concerted reaction. It is noteworthy that Trp-233 of Rous sarcoma virus integrase, which corresponds to Trp-235 of HIV-1 integrase, is also critical for integration. However, the phenotype of the mutants differ from those reported here for HIV-1 integrase. The Rous sarcoma virus W233A integrase is inactive for both concerted and half-site integration, whereas the W233F protein is wild type for concerted integration and slightly hyperactive for the half-site reaction (17Chiu R. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6482-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Longer Viral DNA Substrates Are More Efficient for Concerted Integration—20 bp of terminal viral DNA sequence are efficient substrates for half-site integration in vitro, but the effect of the length of the flanking DNA sequence has not been determined for the concerted reaction. We therefore constructed a set of viral DNA substrates of various lengths to test the length dependence of concerted integration. Each substrate had 21 bp of blunt-ended U5 terminal sequence at one end and a varying length of nonspecific DNA. Fig. 7 shows that several hundred base pairs are required for maximal efficiency of concerted integration, and very little concerted product was observed with substrates shorter than 200 bp. This contrasts with half-site integration, which occurs efficiently with oligonucleotide substrates as short as 20 bp (36Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The DNA cutting and joining steps involved in retroviral DNA integration must be carefully orchestrated to ensure the proper outcome, insertion of the viral DNA into the genome of the host cell. In particular, the cleavage and joining reactions at the two ends of the viral DNA must be coordinated. Our results demonstrate that the processing of the viral DNA by integrase directs the reaction pathway toward concerted integration and away from the half-site reaction pathway. Changing the 2-base overhang on the nontransferred strand from CA to AT reduces the efficiency of concerted integration without compromising the half-site reaction. We infer that processing by integrase facilitates the formation of a synaptic complex that is competent for concerted integration and the nature of the 2-base overhang is important for the formation or stability of this complex. The importance of this 2-base overhang for concerted integration may explain why HIV-1 synthesizes an additional two nucleotides beyond the proviral sequence. We note that in the closely related Mu transition reaction, the flanking DNA on the nontransferred strand is also important for assembly of a stable synaptic complex of a pair of Mu DNA ends with transposase (37Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Although, half-site integration reactions are robust and efficient under a wide range of reaction conditions, the efficiency of concerted integration is highly sensitive to many variables, including the concentration and stoichiometry of reaction components and the presence of additives such as polyethylene glycol. This may account for differing reports in the literature on what factors are important for concerted integration. Are cellular proteins involved in concerted integration? Grandgenett and co-workers (20Sinha S. Pursley M.H. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3105-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that HIV-1 integrase alone is sufficient to carry out concerted integration. However, because a significant fraction of integration products result from half-site integration, the possibility remains that cellular or viral factors may improve the fidelity of the reaction. We therefore tested the effect of several proteins that have been shown to be a component of the PIC or implicated in promoting concerted integration. NC, HMGA1, and BAF had no effect on the efficiency of concerted integration in our system. HMGB1 showed a stimulatory effect only at the highest concentration tested, a 20-fold molar excess over integrase. We conclude that these proteins are unlikely to play an important role in promoting concerted integration. We were surprised that several hundred base pairs of viral DNA substrates are required for maximal efficiency of concerted integration, because only 20 bp of substrates efficiently carry out half-site integration and less than 20 bp of the terminal sequence are protected by integrase in footprinting experiments (17Chiu R. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6482-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a very large multimer of integrase would be required to interact with several hundred base pairs of DNA. We speculated that nonspecific binding of integrase along DNA may facilitate the formation or stabilization of a specific complex of an integrase multimer with the terminal viral DNA sequence. We note that the integration efficiency of longer viral DNA substrates is more robust at higher salt concentrations compared with shorter substrates (data not shown). This is consistent with the idea that multiple interactions along the DNA stabilize the interaction of integrase with the viral DNA substrate. HIV-1 integrase exists as monomers, dimers, and tetramers in solution (29Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 38Deprez E. Tauc P. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Auclair C. Brochon J.C.

Although the functional relevance of the interfaces observed in the crystal and solution structures of the individual integrase domains is uncertain, the extensive dimer interface of the catalytic domain is conserved in all of the structures determined to date (41Bujacz G.

Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that this interface will also be present in the active complex. However, the spacing and location of the two active sites within this dimer suggest that this pair of active sites would be incapable of performing concerted integration. Because the sites of joining the two viral DNA ends to target DNA are separated by 5 bp, the nucleoprotein complex that carries out concerted integration is expected to include a pair of active sites with a similar spacing. However, the two active sites in the catalytic domain dimer are inappropriately positioned to span the two sites of joining to target DNA. A higher order multimer is likely required to juxtapose a pair of active sites with the correct spacing. The profound differential effects of mutation of Trp-235 on half-site versus concerted integration implicates this residue and the C-terminal domain in an interface that is required for concerted integration but not for the half-site reaction. Despite progress in understanding the biochemistry of integration and the structures of the individual domains of integrase, remarkably little is known about the nucleoprotein complex that mediates concerted integration. Elucidation of the organization of this complex will be necessary to understand how the integration of pairs of viral ends is coordinated. Furthermore, because inhibitors of integrase must recognize this complex in the cell, knowledge of its structure will be necessary to understand their mechanism of action.

Although the cellular target(s) of mutant SOD1 toxicity have not been precisely specified, evidence to date supports the hypothesis that ALS-related mutations may increase the burden of partially unfolded SOD1 species. Influences that may destabilize SOD1 in vivo include impaired metal ion binding, reduction of the intrasubunit disulfide bond, or oxidative modification. In this study, we observed that metal-deficient as-isolated SOD1 mutants (H46R, G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N) with disordered electrostatic and zinc-binding loops exhibited aberrant binding to hydrophobic beads in the absence of other destabilizing agents. Other purified ALS-related mutants that can biologically incorporate nearly normal amounts of stabilizing zinc ions (A4V, L38V, G41S, D90A, and G93A) exhibited maximal hydrophobic behavior after exposure to both a disulfide reducing agent and a metal chelator, while normal SOD1 was more resistant to these agents. Moreover, we detected hydrophobic SOD1 species in lysates from affected tissues in G85R and G93A mutant but not wildtype SOD1 transgenic mice. These findings suggest that a susceptibility to the cellular disulfide reducing environment and zinc loss may convert otherwise stable SOD1 mutants into metal-deficient forms with locally destabilized electrostatic and zinc-binding loops.

Hydrophobic SOD Implicated in Lou Gehrig's Disease♦Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 280Issue 33PreviewAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, causes degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem, and brain resulting in muscle wasting and death. Approximately 20% of the familial cases of ALS are caused by mutations in the gene for Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an enzyme that normally catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide radicals to O2 and H2O2. Although the cellular targets of mutant SOD1 are unknown, evidence suggests that misfolding or partial unfolding of mutant SOD1 proteins might be the cause of their toxicity.

The time to disease onset and rapidity of motor neuron degeneration in these models is accelerated by increased expression of the mutant SOD1s, suggesting a toxic effect of the mutant proteins. Mutant SOD1s may ultimately trigger preferential motor neuron death in ALS via complex molecular pathways and cellular interactions. Possible components of toxicity involve aberrant oxidative chemistry, formation of noxious oligomers or aggregates, saturation of proteasome or chaperone functions, impairment of glutamate re-uptake, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered neurofilaments or axonal transport, and triggering of inflammatory or apoptotic cascades (reviewed in Refs. 20Cleveland D.W.

Such avenues to motor neuron loss need not be mutually exclusive, and mutant SOD1s may perturb the functions of other cell types with differential severity or temporal course. Because individuals can express mutant SOD1s from birth until middle age before the clinical onset of motor neuron disease, it is apparent that tissues can compensate over years for the effects of mutant SOD1s. A precise understanding of the abnormal properties shared by SOD1 mutants and the defenses against these influences in specific tissues as a function of aging may help us to develop more effective therapies for both familial and sporadic forms of ALS. Evidence to date suggests that misfolding or partial unfolding of mutant SOD1 proteins in a cellular environment may be related to their toxicity. Subsets of mutant SOD1 enzymes exhibit accelerated turnover in vivo (23Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc.

Moreover, cell lines that are able to tolerate overexpression of mutant SOD1s induce chaperones such as hsp27, hsp70, and αB-crystallin, while hsp70 introduced by gene transfer can protect cultured motor neurons from mutant SOD1 toxicity (32Bruening W.

These chaperones can associate directly with a small fraction of G93A or G41S mutant but not WT SOD1 in tissue lysates (33Shinder G.A. Lacourse M.C. Minotti S. Durham H.D. J. Biol.

Accumulating evidence also indicates that purified forms of ALS-related SOD1 mutants have a more flexible structure than corresponding forms of the wild type (WT) enzyme (35Hart P.J. Liu H.

In previous studies, we characterized physicochemical properties of 14 different biologically metallated ALS SOD1 mutants expressed in insect cells (40Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A.

A group of “wild type-like” (WTL) mutants (A4V, L38V, G41S, D76Y, D90A, G93A, and E133Δ) are able to bind copper and zinc and retain specific enzymatic activity similar to the normal enzyme. In contrast, a group of “metal-binding region” (MBR) mutants (H46R, G85R, D124V, D125H, and S134N) are deficient in copper and zinc and exhibit dramatic thermal destabilization compared with metallated forms, as measured globally by differential scanning calorimetry (41Rodriguez J.A.

Because correct metal coordination is critical to SOD1 stability (42Forman H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results suggested that conditions in vivo which might impair metal binding by WT-like mutants could increase the burden of destabilized SOD1 in tissues. Consistent with this, preparations of several WT-like SOD1 mutants, with metals removed in vitro, unfold more readily upon exposure to chemical denaturants than does apo-WT SOD1 (43Lindberg M.J. Tibell L. Oliveberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16607-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we observed that both WT-like and metal-binding region SOD1 mutants are more susceptible than the normal enzyme to cleavage of the intrasubunit disulfide bond between Cys-57 and Cys-146 under conditions that mimic the cytosolic reducing environment (44Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5984-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This important disulfide linkage anchors the zinc-binding loop to the β-barrel of the protein. One part of this loop (residues 48–62) composes part of the dimeric interface and also interacts, via hydrogen bond networks involving Cys-57 and Gly-61, with Arg-143, a key residue that regulates the access of substrates to the catalytic copper ion. Another part of the loop (residues 63–83) contains the zinc-binding residues (His-63, His-71, His-80, and Asp-83) and can interact with regions of the electrostatic loop (residues 120–143) to form the active site channel for superoxide entry. Evidence of greater electrophoretic mobility and cysteine accessibility for these mutants suggested that they partially unfold or monomerize more easily than the WT enzyme, especially under reducing conditions (44Tiwari A. Hayward L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5984-5992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although the functional role of this disulfide bond is not fully understood (45Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), these structural features suggest that it could be important for either SOD1 dimerization or the metal binding process or both (46Arnesano F.

How might decreased global or local stability of mutant SOD1s be related to toxic cellular effects? Zinc-deficient WT or mutant SOD1 is toxic to motor neurons in vitro (48Estevez A.G. Crow J.P.

Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) and is also more susceptible than the WT SOD1 holoenzyme to oxidative damage and aggregation (49Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of metal-binding region SOD1 mutants apo-H46R and S134N (37Elam J.S. Taylor A.B. Strange R. Antonyuk S. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A. Hasnain S.S. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S.

This loop disorder may cause a reduction of β-sheet edge-strand protection and thereby promote self-association of SOD1 dimers (37Elam J.S. Taylor A.B. Strange R. Antonyuk S. Doucette P.A. Rodriguez J.A. Hasnain S.S. Hayward L.J. Valentine J.S. Yeates T.O. Hart P.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 50Strange R.W. Antonyuk S.

However, it has not been clarified whether SOD1 oxidative modification, dimer self-association, or other interactions of mutant SOD1 related to impaired zinc binding underlie the toxicity of these species in affected tissues. Recent analyses of mutations that facilitate protein aggregation associated with a variety of diseases have demonstrated that such mutations often increase the hydrophobicity of the protein or decrease its net charge (51Calloni G. Zoffoli S. Stefani M. Dobson C.M. Chiti F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10607-10613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Such changes can promote accumulation of aggregated species if competing equilibria between partially folded conformations and pathways to either native or aggregated states are perturbed. In this study, we observed that ALS-related SOD1 variants share abnormally increased surface hydrophobicity, especially under conditions favoring disulfide reduction and metal ion loss. Furthermore, a fraction of SOD1 in tissue lysates from G85R and G93A mutant but not WT SOD1 transgenic mice displayed strikingly increased binding to hydrophobic media. We propose that exposed hydrophobic residues of SOD1 mutants in vivo may promote aberrant interactions of the enzyme with itself or with other cellular constituents as part of the toxic mechanism in familial ALS.

The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 0.2% SDS was added to the supernatant, and samples were stored at -80 °C. Mouse tissues (spinal cord, forebrain, brainstem, cerebellum, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, or liver) were taken from at least three matched animals that were at the pre-muscle weakness stage (55Kong J.

https://openalex.org/W2030796378,"G-protein-coupled receptors are well known for converting an extracellular signal into an intracellular response. Here we showed that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) plays a dynamic intracellular role in signal transduction. Activation of endogenously expressed mGlu5 on striatal nuclear membranes leads to rapid, sustained calcium (Ca2+) responses within the nucleoplasm that can be blocked by receptor-specific antagonists. Extracellular ligands such as glutamate and quisqualate reach nuclear receptors via both sodium-dependent transporters and cystine glutamate exchangers. Inhibition of either transport system blocks radiolabeled agonist uptake as well as agonist-induced nuclear Ca2+ changes. Impermeable antagonists like LY393053 and LY367366 not only blocked [3H]quisqualate binding but also prevented nontransported agonists such as (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine from inducing intracellular Ca2+ changes in heterologous cells. In contrast, neither LY compound prevented quisqualate or glutamate from activating intracellular receptors leading to Ca2+ responses. Inasmuch as Ca2+ can enter the nucleoplasm via the nuclear pore complex or from the nuclear lumen, the presence of nuclear mGlu5 receptors appeared to amplify the latter process generating a faster nuclear response in heterologous cells. In isolated striatal nuclei, nuclear receptor activation results in the de novo appearance of phosphorylated CREB protein. Thus, activation of nuclear mGlu5 receptors initiates a signaling cascade that is known to alter gene transcription and regulate many paradigms of synaptic plasticity. These studies demonstrated that mGlu5 receptors play a dynamic role in signaling both on and off the plasma membrane.

Inhibition of either transport system blocks radiolabeled agonist uptake as well as agonist-induced nuclear Ca2+ changes. Impermeable antagonists like LY393053 and LY367366 not only blocked [3H]quisqualate binding but also prevented nontransported agonists such as (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine from inducing intracellular Ca2+ changes in heterologous cells. In contrast, neither LY compound prevented quisqualate or glutamate from activating intracellular receptors leading to Ca2+ responses. Inasmuch as Ca2+ can enter the nucleoplasm via the nuclear pore complex or from the nuclear lumen, the presence of nuclear mGlu5 receptors appeared to amplify the latter process generating a faster nuclear response in heterologous cells. In isolated striatal nuclei, nuclear receptor activation results in the de novo appearance of phosphorylated CREB protein. Thus, activation of nuclear mGlu5 receptors initiates a signaling cascade that is known to alter gene transcription and regulate many paradigms of synaptic plasticity. These studies demonstrated that mGlu5 receptors play a dynamic role in signaling both on and off the plasma membrane. The structure and function of G-protein-coupled receptors have received intense scrutiny over the past decades. These studies point to a dynamic environment in which receptors are not static but rather move on and off the plasma membrane according to environmental stimuli, specific targeting information, protein-protein interactions, etc. In this model, intracellular receptors are considered transitional, i.e. receptors that are either ready to be inserted into the plasma membrane or that have just been sequestered from such a site. Emerging data, however, suggest that some intracellular receptors may have intracellular functions as well. For example, a number of G-protein-coupled receptors such as the apelin, angiotensin AT1 and ATII, bradykinin B2, and lysophosphatidate LP1 receptors have been localized within the nucleoplasm itself (1Lee D.K. Lanca A.J. Cheng R. Nguyen T. Ji X.D. Gobeil Jr., F. Chemtob S. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol.

In contrast, prostaglandin E2 receptors have been found on the nuclear envelope together with their ligand-generating enzymes (4Bhattacharya M. Peri K. Ribeiro-da-Silva A. Almazan G. Shichi H. Hou X.

Similarly, endothelin receptors A and B are also localized to the perinuclear region of cardiac ventricular myocytes where they mediate nuclear Ca2+ levels and activate nuclear protein kinases (6Boivin B.

Jong Y.J. Gonchar Y. Burkhalter A. Romano C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28210-28219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Because most studies investigating the properties of nuclear receptors have been performed in heterologous cell types with overexpressed receptors, the question arises as to whether such phenomena are physiologically relevant and, in the case of mGlu5, how a ligand such as glutamate has access to this receptor. Widely expressed throughout the central nervous system, mGlu5 receptors play an important role in modulating neuronal excitability during critical processes such as development, synaptic plasticity, and learning. Typically, mGlu5 receptors couple to Gq/11 leading to phosphoinositide signaling and release of calcium from intracellular stores (8Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 465-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In heterologous cell types, mGlu5 activation leads to marked oscillatory responses (9Nakanishi S. Nakajima Y. Masu M. Ueda Y. Nakahara K. Watanabe D. Yamaguchi S. Kawabata S. Okada M. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 230-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), whereas more variable responses are seen in physiological environments, ranging from oscillations to initial transient increases with sustained plateaus (10Flint A.C.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1868-1873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Prothero L.S. Richards C.D. Mathie A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Marino M.J. Awad-Granko H. Ciombor K.J. Conn P.J. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Responses vary depending upon the neuronal subtype expressing the receptor and/or with the level of agonist stimulation (12Prothero L.S. Richards C.D. Mathie A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Numerous morphological and physiological studies have suggested that mGlu5 receptors are enriched in the striatum where they are expressed on postsynaptic neurons, subsets of interneurons, as well as at presynaptic sites (14Paquet M. Smith Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7659-7669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both at the light and electron microscopic level, large amounts of mGlu5 are intracellularly localized (40-70%) where receptors are predominantly associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or nuclear membranes (14Paquet M. Smith Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7659-7669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent staining of embryonic or neonatal striatal cultures shows widespread mGlu5 expression; agonist exposure elicits an intracellular rise in Ca2+ typified by an initial increase followed by a sustained plateau. This response can be blocked by application of the mGlu5-specific antagonist MPEP (15Mao L. Wang J.Q. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of striatal mGlu5 receptors leads to phosphorylation of the CREB transcription factor and subsequent activation of several immediate early genes (16Mao L. Wang J.Q. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, neonatal striatal cultures seem to be an ideal preparation to test the notion that endogenous mGlu5 receptors are expressed on nuclear membranes where they are coupled to signaling mechanisms within the nuclear membrane. For intracellular mGlu5 receptors to be of functional relevance, there must be a way to activate them. By using tagged receptor molecules, we have shown previously that the mGlu5 receptor topology is oriented such that ligand binding domains are within the lumen of the nuclear envelope. Thus, a ligand source from the extracellular milieu must traverse both the plasma membrane as well as an intracellular membrane. In theory, some combination of plasma membrane and intracellular transporter could transfer glutamate into the nuclear lumen. For example, there are five sodium-dependent glutamate transporter proteins that are present on the plasma membrane of glial and neuronal cells as well as many peripheral tissues (17Danbolt N.C. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar). Many other glutamate carriers exist, however, including the cystine-glutamate exchanger. Ubiquitously expressed throughout the body, the exchanger is a sodium-independent, anionic amino acid transporter composed of two separate proteins, xCT and 4F2 (18Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The former confers substrate specificity, and the latter is common to many amino acid transporters. Because the mGlu5 agonist, quisqualate, is a substrate for the xCT exchanger (19Patel S.A. Warren B.A. Rhoderick J.F. Bridges R.J. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it too is a plausible candidate for intracellular ligand delivery. Here we show that mGlu5 receptors are expressed on the cell surface and intracellular membranes of neonatal striatal neurons. Activation of nuclear receptors leads to increased nucleoplasmic Ca2+, which can be blocked by receptor-specific antagonists. Ligand delivery is via both sodium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Impermeable antagonists can block cellular responses to agonists that are not transported into cells but cannot block those that are. Finally, agonist-induced nuclear receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of CREB. Taken together, these data challenge existing paradigms by suggesting a new mode of intracellular signal transduction mediated in situ by G-protein-coupled receptors. Materials—2-Amino-2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-3-(9H-thioxanthen-9-yl) propanoic acid (LY367366) and 2-amino-2-(3-cis and trans-carboxycyclobutyl)-3-(9H-thioxanthen-9-yl)propionic acid (LY393053) were obtained from Lilly. Quisqualate and (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) were purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ellisville, MO). Unless otherwise indicated all other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture and Immunocytochemistry—The mGlu5/HEK stable cell line was generated and maintained as described (20Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mGlu5/GABABR1 chimera (mG5C1) as well as its mutant (mG5C1ASA) were kind gifts from Dr. J. P. Pin (Institute of Functional Genomics, CNRS, France). Primary striatal neuronal cultures using neonatal 1-day-old rat pups were prepared and maintained as detailed by Mao and Wang (15Mao L. Wang J.Q. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fixation, blocking, and antibody incubation were as described previously (20Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included affinity-purified polyclonal anti-C-terminal mGlu5 (1:300) (21Romano C. van den Pol A.N. O'Malley K.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 367: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-lamin B2 (1:100; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), monoclonal anti-GABA (1:1000; Sigma), polyclonal anti-phospho-CREB antibody (1:3000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), polyclonal anti-EAAT3 (1:1000; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), monoclonal anti-Na+,K+-ATPase (α-6F, 1:1000; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, Iowa City), and polyclonal anti-quisqualate antibody (1:250; Dr. J. Koerner, University of Minnesota). Secondary antibodies included goat anti-rabbit and/or anti-mouse Cy3 (both at 1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (1:300; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:750; Molecular Probes). Tissue Isolation, Subcellular Fractionation, and Western Blot Analysis—Postnatal day 1, 3, or 10 rodent striata were isolated and processed by mincing on ice with a razor blade followed by resuspension in 20 volumes of Buffer “A” medium containing 2.0 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and protease inhibitors (Complete Tablets; Roche Applied Science). Cells were homogenized, and nuclei and plasma membranes were prepared as described previously (7O'Malley K.L. Jong Y.J. Gonchar Y. Burkhalter A. Romano C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28210-28219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Aliquots from each fraction were used for gel electrophoresis as well as membrane binding. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Fractionated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-mGlu5 (1:1500) (21Romano C. van den Pol A.N. O'Malley K.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 367: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-lamin B2 (1:1000), or monoclonal anti-Na+,K+-ATPase. Anti-EAAT3 and xCT antibodies (Dr. J. Rothstein, The Johns Hopkins University) were used at dilutions of 1:200 and 1:150, respectively. A horseradish peroxidase conjugated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or anti-mouse IgG (1:2500; Sigma) was used in conjunction with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) to detect the signal. Densitometric analyses of mGlu5 proteins were performed by using the Storm 860 Imager (Amersham Biosciences) together with associated software. Extra- and Intracellular Buffers—Ca2+ and uptake measurements performed on intact cells were done in Krebs-Ringer solution (KRS, containing the following (in mm): 137 NaCl, 5.1 KCl, 0.77 KH2PO4, 0.71 MgSO4·7H2O, 1.1 CaCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES). To achieve chloride-free conditions (Cl--free), the buffer contained the following (in mm): 130 sodium gluconate, 5 potassium gluconate, 1.1 calcium gluconate, 0.77 KH2PO4, 0.71 MgSO4·7H2O, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES. To achieve sodium-free conditions (Na+-free) the buffer contained the following (in mm): 137.5 choline chloride, 5.36 KCl, 0.77 KH2PO4, 0.71 MgSO4·7H2O, 1.1 CaCl2, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES. Sodium- and chloride-free conditions (Na+,Cl--free) were achieved by using a buffer containing the following (in mm): 274 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 5 potassium gluconate, 1.1 calcium gluconate, 0.77 KH2PO4, 0.71 MgSO4·7H2O, 10 d-glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with 50% gluconic acid). Experiments using purified nuclei were done using intracellular buffer conditions. Intracellular buffers contained the following (in mm): 125 KCl, 2 KH2PO4, 2 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, 10 d-glucose, 1 ATP, and 40 HEPES (pH 7.0). 3H-Labeled Agonist Uptake—[3H]Quisqualate (26.0 Ci/mmol) and l-[3H]glutamate (43.0 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. In some cases, radiolabeled agonists (3.25 μCi/ml [3H]quisqualate or 43.08 μCi/ml l-[3H]glutamate) were added together with unlabeled drug to achieve a total quisqualate concentration of 120 and 500 nm, 1 or 10 μm, or a total concentration of 10 μm or 1 mm glutamate. The mGlu5/HEK stable cell line (5 × 104 cells/well) or primary striatal neurons (3 × 105 cells/well) were cultured at 37 °C for 3 or 9 days, respectively, before use. Purified nuclei were washed three times in the appropriate buffer and then incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of various concentrations of l-cystine or TBOA for 15 min before adding labeled agonist. Uptake was terminated after 15 min. Samples were rapidly rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized in 150 μl of 1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline, and then analyzed by liquid scintillation. [3H]Quisqualate Binding Assay—Plasma membrane fractions were prepared as described above from mGlu5-stable HEK cells. Membranes were subsequently washed three times in 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), with protease inhibitors followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 35 min. The final pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm Ca2+, and protease inhibitors. Binding was performed as described (20Romano C. Miller J.K. Hyrc K. Dikranian S. Mennerick S. Takeuchi Y. Goldberg M.P. O'Malley K.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Measurements of Intracellular Ca2+—For whole cell measurements, dissociated striatal neurons were grown on 35-mm dishes with glass grids (1.2 × 105cells/grid), washed with Neurobasal medium (NB; Invitrogen), and incubated with 5 μm Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-AM, 0.00l% pluronic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in NB for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with NB and observed using a laser confocal microscope (Olympus BX 50WI) with an Olympus LUMPlanFl/lR 40×/0.80w or 60×/0.90w objectives. The real time images were captured by an Olympus Fluoview FVX confocal laser scanning system using Fluoview 2.0 acquisition software. Images were converted to TIF files for processing with MetaMorph (version 5.0.7) Professional Image Analysis software, produced by Universal Imaging. Drugs at 100× concentrations were added to the side of the dish and allowed to diffuse over the cells at room temperature. Quisqualate was added at a final concentration of 10 μm together with 5 μm GYKI53655 (Research Biochemicals Inc., Natick, MA) and 20 μm 7-(hydroxyimino)-cyclopropan[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt; Tocris). The mGlu5-specific antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP; Tocris) was added at 1 μm. Initiation of Ca2+ responses was analyzed using MATLAB® 7.0.4. Specifically, agonist-mediated initiation was defined as the first detectable change in fluorescence 3 S.D. above the mean of 5-6 s of base-line fluorescence. Fluorescent Measurements of Ca2+ in Isolated Nuclei—To measure Ca2+ changes in individual nuclei, nuclei were prepared as described above using Buffer A medium containing 125 mm sucrose. Isolated nuclei, plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 35-mm dishes with glass grids, were loaded with 20 μm Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1AM, 0.00l% pluronic acid prepared in intracellular buffer together with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, and protease inhibitors for 20-30 min on ice. After loading, nuclei were washed three times with the same buffer minus the Ca2+ indicator and imaged immediately thereafter. Drug treatments were identical to whole cells. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted from P10 striatal tissue with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and reverse transcription was performed. Equal amounts of RNA were used for each reaction along with transporter-specific primers designed to cross intron junctions obtained from NCBI data bases. Resulting cDNA transcripts were amplified by PCR, fractionated by PAGE, and analyzed with Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitative fluorimaging. Agonist Treatment Triggers Cytosolic and Nuclear Ca2+ Responses in Striatal Neurons Expressing mGlu5 Receptors—As mGlu5 is abundantly expressed in embryonic or neonatal striatal neurons (15Mao L. Wang J.Q. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we established striatal cultures from P1 rat pups. The vast majority of neurons present in these cultures was GABA-ergic as determined by anti-GABA antibodies. Typically, about half of the GABA-ergic neurons were mGlu5-positive (Fig. 1A). Wells stained on the 9th day in vitro (DIV) showed numerous immunofluorescent neurons in which mGlu5 could be visualized on cell processes, intracellularly, and on the nuclear membrane (Fig. 1B). With increased length of time in culture, receptor levels appeared to increase particularly on the plasma membrane and cell processes, although nuclear receptors were always detectable even after 2-3 weeks in culture (not shown). No mGlu1a receptor staining was observed at any age in culture in agreement with reports that mGlu1b is the predominant subtype expressed (Ref. 22Ferraguti F. Conquet F. Corti C. Grandes P. Kuhn R. Knopfel T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 400: 391-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar; data not shown). Despite the presence of glia, no pronounced mGlu5 staining of this cell type was observed. To test the hypothesis that activation of mGlu5 receptors expressed on nuclear striatal membranes leads to changes in nuclear Ca2+, DIV 9 cultures grown on glass coverslips were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator, Oregon Green BAPTA-AM, and subsequently treated with the group 1 agonist, quisqualate (10 μm). Because quisqualate would also activate AMPA channels as well as mGlu1 receptors, it was bath-applied in the presence of 5 μm GYKI53655, an AMPA antagonist, and CPCCOEt, an mGlu1 antagonist (20 μm). Agonist application under these conditions led to a rise in Ca2+ in both the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus consisting of two phases, an initial rapid rise followed by a sustained elevation. Both sets of responses were terminated by the addition of the highly specific mGlu5 antagonist, MPEP (1 μm; Fig. 1D). Fig. 1E represents compiled data from multiple experiments on post hoc identified mGlu5-positive cells. Taken together, these data are consistent with nuclear mGlu5 receptors coupling to G-proteins localized on nuclear membranes, but they do not rule out the possibility that the observed rises in Ca2+ are because of other indirect causes. Agonist Treatment Directly Triggers Nuclear Ca2+ Responses—To assess more directly nuclear mGlu5 receptor function, isolated nuclei were prepared from DIV 9 cultures. Nuclei were resuspended in intracellular medium, and Oregon Green BAPTA-AM was allowed to accumulate while nuclei were attaching to coated coverslips (Fig. 2A). Individual nuclei were imaged to acquire base-line Ca2+ changes prior to agonist application in the presence of the AMPA and mGlu1 antagonists (Fig. 2B). Quisqualate application (10 μm) resulted in sustained nuclear Ca2+ rises that gradually plateaued between 10 and 12 min (Fig. 2B). MPEP (1 μm) blocked this response. To confirm mGlu5 receptor presence on responding nuclei, coverslips were fixed and processed for mGlu5 immunoreactivity combined with lamin B2 staining and then field-relocated immediately following imaging (Fig. 2A, lower panel). One hundred percent of responsive cells were mGlu5-positive. Data were compiled from multiple nuclei at 300 s (Fig. 2C). Approximately 30% of nuclei that post hoc stained for mGlu5 responded to agonist treatment (11:36), whereas non-mGlu5-positive nuclei never responded to quisqualate (n = 45). Presumably nonresponding mGlu5-positive nuclei were damaged in the course of nuclear preparation. The muscarinic agonist carbachol did not elicit a nuclear Ca2+ response nor did other agonists for other endogenous receptors such as Substance P, adenosine A1 and A2, or α1 adrenergic receptors (not shown). Because of the difficulty of preparation and low yield of nuclei from dissociated cultures, we developed an acute isolation procedure directly from brain tissue. Striata collected at postnatal (P) days 1, 3, and 10 were pooled and fractionated, and the nuclei were purified. Western blotting was used to determine the level of nuclear receptors present in striatal tissues. The mGlu5 receptor was clearly expressed in both nuclear and plasma membrane fractions as indicated by the membrane-specific markers lamin B2 and Na+,K+-ATPase, respectively (Fig. 3A). Levels of both cell surface and nuclear receptors increased throughout this time period consistent with previous reports (P10 versus P1, 165% increase, p < 0.02) (21Romano C. van den Pol A.N. O'Malley K.L. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 367: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Unlike heterologous cell types and/or P3 forebrain tissue (7O'Malley K.L. Jong Y.J. Gonchar Y. Burkhalter A. Romano C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28210-28219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), striatal nuclear receptors migrated slightly slower than plasma membrane mGlu5 (Fig. 3A). Purified nuclei were loaded with the Ca2+ fluorophore and assessed for agonist-induced changes in fluorescence. In 80% of the nuclei measured, slow, gradual Ca2+ rises were apparent at all developmental time points (Fig. 3, B and C). These were most pronounced at P10. Approximately 10% of the time an agonist-induced oscillatory response was observed that could be blocked by MPEP (Fig. 3, D and E). Results were essentially the same for nuclei prepared from either rat or murine striata (not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that activation of endogenous nuclear mGlu5 receptors increase nuclear Ca2+ levels, establishing the role of nuclear mGlu5 receptors in a native, physiological setting. xCT Mediates Nuclear mGlu5 Receptor Activation in Heterologous Cell Types—Does glutamate activate these intracellular receptors, and if so, how does it do so? To test the idea that an mGlu5 agonist could access intracellular receptors, we used two basic approaches, localization of bath-applied drug using anti-ligand antibodies as well as uptake of radiolabeled agonist using standard paradigms. Because antibodies directed against quisqualate have been shown to specifically stain quisqualate-treated neurons (23Chase L.A. Roon R.J. Wellman L. Beitz A.J. Koerner J.F. Neuroscience. 2001; 106: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), they provided a means by which quisqualate uptake could be visualized in treated cells. Specifically, agonist was rapidly taken up by HEK cells where it was detected within the cytoplasm and the nucleus within a minute of application (Fig. 4A). Thus quisqualate rapidly gets into the cell, but how is it doing so? To test directly whether HEK cells and/or nuclei could take up quisqualate, both were treated with radiolabeled ligand in the presence and absence of transport or exchange inhibitors. Although our previous results in HEK cells suggested that sodium-dependent plasma membrane transporters did not play a major role in this process, we tested their contribution as well as the cystine/glutamate exchanger that is widely expressed in the central nervous system as well as the periphery (18Kanai Y. Endou H. Curr. Drug Metab. 2001; 2: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). [3H]Quisqualate was readily taken up by intact HEK cells as well as nuclei (Fig. 4, B and C). By using whole cells in extracellular sodium-free buffer conditions (choline substitution), ∼20% of total quisqualate uptake was blocked,"
https://openalex.org/W1982023029,"The Affymetrix GeneChip platform was used to build a gene expression database of the normal human body. Postmortem human tissues represent a valuable source of biological materials for this type of study, but their use entails some delays before harvesting such tissues. We first evaluated the RNA quality obtained from tissues obtained 3-5 h postmortem and found variations that were both tissue and donor-dependent. RNAs extracted from brain regions were of higher quality than those obtained from the gut, while the cause of death was a significant factor in donor-dependent differences. To avoid these variables, we used rat duodenum to determine the effects of RNA degradation on the analysis of gene expression. Surprisingly, even samples exhibiting significant RNA degradation yielded robust gene expression results, comparable to those obtained using intact samples at a certain signal intensity cutoff. We extended these findings to our human expression database and obtained similar results, indicating that the Affymetrix platform, which is biased to the 3' end of transcripts for detection, can tolerate significant RNA degradation, while still yielding high quality expression data. Our resulting body index expression database is a valuable research tool. As examples of potential uses, we report novel expression sites for four potential therapeutic targets--CCL27, GPR22, GPR113 and GPR128--and as well as a set of thymus-specific genes, including three not previously associated with the thymus."
https://openalex.org/W2086483844,"Nipah virus (NiV) is a recently emerged and highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that causes a systemic infection in animals and humans and can infect a wide range of cultured cells. Interestingly, the NiV fusion (F) protein has a single arginine at the cleavage site similar to paramyxoviruses that are activated by exogenous trypsin-like enzymes only present in specific cells and tissues and therefore only cause localized infections. We show here that NiV F activation is not mediated by an exogenous serum protease but by an endogenous ubiquitous cellular protease after endocytosis of the protein. In addition to endocytosis, acidification of the endosome is a prerequisite for F cleavage. These results show that activation of the NiV F protein depends on a type of proteolytic cleavage that is clearly different from what is known for other paramyxoviral and orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a viral class I fusion protein whose activation depends on clathrin-mediated constitutive endocytosis.

Goh K.J. Wong K.T. Kamarulzaman A. Tan P.S. Ksiazek T.G. Zaki S.R. Paul G. Lam S.K. Tan C.T. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1257-1259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). In 1998, the virus was transmitted from bats, which are the most likely natural hosts (2Chua K.B. Koh C.L. Hooi P.S. Wee K.F. Khong J.H. Chua B.H. Chan Y.P. Lim M.E. Lam S.K. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), to pigs and then to humans, suggesting that the pig was required as an amplifying host. However, in more recent outbreaks in Bangladesh, NiV was also transmitted directly from bats to humans, and even human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out (3Choi C. Sci. Am. 2004; 291: 22PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hsu V.P. Hossain M.J. Parashar U.D. Ali M.M. Ksiazek T.G. Kuzmin I. Niezgoda M. Rupprecht C. Bresee J. Breiman R.F. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2004; 10: 2082-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Because of the broad host range and the high mortality rates associated with infection, NiV has been classified as a biosafety level 4 agent. Because of their unique genetic and biological characteristics NiV and the closely related Hendra virus form a new genus, Henipavirus, within the Paramyxoviridae family (5Harcourt B.H. Tamin A.

Michalski W.P. Eaton B.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9972-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). NiV encodes for two surface glycoproteins, the receptor-binding G protein and the fusion (F) protein. The G protein mediates attachment to a receptor on host cells that has not yet been identified. The F protein is responsible for virus entry into host cells by initiating pH-independent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. If coexpressed together with the G protein on the surface of infected cells or on cells expressing plasmid-encoded NiV glycoproteins, the F protein mediates fusion with adjacent cells, resulting in multinucleated syncytia (7Tamin A. Harcourt B.H. Ksiazek T.G. Rollin P.E. Bellini W.J. Rota P.A. Virology. 2002; 296: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Moll M. Diederich S. Klenk H.D. Czub M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9705-9712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is known that cleavage of paramyxoviral F proteins at basic amino acid residues is a prerequisite for fusion activity and, thus, for virus infectivity (9Klenk H.D. Garten W. Winner E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 241-280Google Scholar, 10Maisner A. Mrkic B. Herrler G. Moll M. Billeter M.A. Cattaneo R. Klenk H.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The F proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors (F0) and have to be activated by proteolytic cleavage into the disulfide-linked subunits F1 and F2, thereby releasing the hydrophobic fusion peptide at the amino terminus of F1 (Fig. 1). So far, two mechanisms of proteolytic F activation are known. Paramyxoviruses that cause systemic infections in vivo generally possess F proteins with multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site. These F proteins are ubiquitously activated during the transport through the secretory pathway by the Golgi protease furin. Because cleavage occurs intracellularly, F proteins with multibasic cleavage sites reach the cell surface as fusion-active molecules. In contrast, F proteins with only one basic residue at the cleavage site usually cannot be activated intracellularly but have to be activated by extracellular trypsin-like proteases after they have reached the cell surface. As a consequence, the in vitro growth of paramyxoviruses encoding F proteins with monobasic cleavage sites depends on the addition of trypsin to the cell culture medium. In vivo, replication of these viruses is restricted to the respiratory tract where suitable trypsin-like proteases are known to be expressed (11Tashiro M. Yokogoshi Y. Tobita K. Seto J.T. Rott R. Kido H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7211-7216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Murakami M. Towatari T. Ohuchi M. Shiota M. Akao M. Okumura Y. Parry M.A. Kido H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2847-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the NiV F protein has a single arginine at the cleavage site (Fig. 1), NiV infection is not restricted to the respiratory tract and does not require exogenous trypsin for its growth in cell culture (5Harcourt B.H. Tamin A. Ksiazek T.G. Rollin P.E. Anderson L.J. Bellini W.J. Rota P.A. Virology. 2000; 271: 334-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 7Tamin A. Harcourt B.H. Ksiazek T.G. Rollin P.E.

Virol. 2002; 76: 11186-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This suggests that activation of the NiV F protein differs from what is known for other paramyxoviral and orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. Supporting this view, we have shown recently that the NiV F protein is cleaved in all cell lines tested. Furthermore, this ubiquitous activation does not require a basic residue at the cleavage site and is, therefore, not mediated by a member of the trypsin- or furin-like protease families known to activate other paramyxoviruses (8Moll M. Diederich S. Klenk H.D. Czub M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9705-9712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Virus Infection—MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells were maintained in Eagle′s minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin. To adapt Vero cells to serum-free conditions, the cells were cultivated in virus production serum-free medium (VP-SFM; Invitrogen). Infections with NiV were performed under biosafety level 4 conditions as described previously (8Moll M. Diederich S. Klenk H.D. Czub M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9705-9712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Plasmid Vectors—cDNA fragments spanning the F gene and the G gene of the NiV genome (GenBank™ accession number AF212302) were cloned into the pczCFG5 vector as described earlier (14Moll M. Kaufmann A. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7274-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Generation of the endocytosis-negative mutant NiV FYA (Fig. 1) has been described previously (15Vogt C. Eickmann M. Diederich S. Moll M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The F gene of the measles virus (MV) Edmonston strain was cloned into the pCG vector (16Moll M. Klenk H.D. Herrler G. Maisner A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17887-17894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling—Cultures of Vero or MDCK cells in 35-mm diameter dishes were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding NiV F or MV F using the cationic lipid transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 24 h posttransfection, cells were incubated for 40 min with medium lacking cysteine and methionine followed by an incubation with medium containing [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine (Promix; Amersham Biosciences) at a final concentration of 100 μCi/ml for 10 min. Subsequently, labeling medium was replaced by non-radioactive chase medium for 2 h at 37°C. After radiolabeling, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 × g. NiV F protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a polyclonal antiserum derived from infected guinea pigs (a kind gift from M. Czub and H. Weingartl) at a final dilution of 1:500. After addition of a suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma), immune complexes were washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, suspended in reducing sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak BIOMAX films. Inhibitor Studies—To block NiV F protein transport along the secretory pathway, cells were metabolically labeled in the absence or presence of monensin (10 μm; Sigma), brefeldin A (15 μg/ml; Sigma), and a mixture of 30 mm NaF and 50 μm AlCl3 (Sigma). Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was examined in the presence of 50 μm chlorpromazine (Sigma). Surface Biotinylation Analysis—Surface labeling with biotin was performed as described previously (17Moll M. Klenk H.D. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7174-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding either the wild type NiV F or mutant NiV FYA gene. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were washed and incubated twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 2 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Calbiochem). Following cell lysis, F proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose, and biotinylated F proteins were detected by incubation with a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (dilution 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline; Amersham Biosciences) and chemiluminescence (West Dura extended; Pierce). Fusion Assays—Cells were infected with NiV or cotransfected with plasmids encoding the NiV G gene and either the wild type NiV F or the mutant NiV FYA gene. 24 h later, cell-to-cell fusion was visualized after fixation with ethanol for 10 min and staining with a 1:10 diluted Giemsa staining solution for 30 min. Representative microscopic fields were photographed. To analyze fusion after an external pH 5 shift, MDCK cells were cotransfected with the NiV FYA and the NiV G genes. At 24 h posttransfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with normal DMEM or with DMEM adjusted to pH 5 at 37 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 2% FCS and then incubated with DMEM containing 2% FCS at 37 °C for 7 h. Colocalization Studies—For colocalization studies, antibody uptake assays were performed essentially as described previously (15Vogt C. Eickmann M. Diederich S. Moll M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 24 h posttransfection NiV F-expressing HeLa cells were incubated with the polyclonal anti-NiV serum (dilution 1:1000) for 1 h at 4°C and then washed and shifted to 37 °C for 5 or 30 min to allow endocytosis to occur. Surface-bound primary antibodies were blocked by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (dilution 1:5; DAKO). After fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilization with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, internalized primary antibodies were stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. To analyze the colocalization of NiV F with transferrin, 50 μg/ml transferrin-tetramethylrhodamine (Tfn-TR; Molecular Probes) was added during the incubation at 37 °C for either 5 or 30 min. For lysosomal costaining, an antibody against the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Southern Biotech) was added after fixation and permeabilization for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected with rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies. Confocal fluorescence images were recorded using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 LSM 510. Proteolytic Activation of the NiV F Protein Is Not Mediated by Soluble Serum Proteases—We have shown recently that the NiV F protein is ubiquitously cleaved in cell culture by a protease that cannot be a member of the trypsin- or furin-like protease families (8Moll M. Diederich S. Klenk H.D. Czub M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9705-9712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To determine whether the ubiquitous activation is mediated by a host cell protease or by an exogenous serum protease, cleavage and fusion activity of the NiV F protein was analyzed in the absence of FCS. For this, Vero cells were cultivated for several weeks under serum-free conditions and either infected with NiV or cotransfected with the NiV F and G genes. Only if the F protein is proteolytically processed can fusogenic G/F1,2 complexes on the surface of infected or transfected cells form and mediate fusion with adjacent receptor-bearing cells (8Moll M. Diederich S. Klenk H.D. Czub M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9705-9712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 13Bossart K.N. Wang L.F. Flora M.N. Chua K.B. Lam S.K. Eaton B.T. Broder C.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11186-11198Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To analyze cleavage of the NiV F protein under serum-free conditions, transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine for 10 min and incubated for 2 h to allow the protein to be processed. After cell lysis, F proteins were immunoprecipitated, separated on a 12% SDS gel, and subjected to autoradiography. The results shown in Fig. 2A revealed that the F protein is cleaved with similar efficiency in the absence or presence of FCS. In agreement with these data, the formation of multinucleated syncytia was also observed in NiV-infected and in F + G-cotransfected cells in the absence or presence of FCS (Fig. 2B). These results clearly demonstrate that proteolytic activation of NiV is not mediated by an exogenous serum protease but rather by an endogenous host cell protease. NiV F Protein Cleavage Does Not Occur during Transport along the Secretory Pathway—To determine where NiV F cleavage takes place, F activation was tested in cells treated with inhibitors of the secretory pathway. As a control, processing of the MV F protein was analyzed. In contrast to the NiV F protein, MV F has a multibasic cleavage site and is, therefore, activated by furin in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (9Klenk H.D. Garten W. Winner E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 241-280Google Scholar, 10Maisner A. Mrkic B. Herrler G. Moll M. Billeter M.A. Cattaneo R. Klenk H.D. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Watanabe M. Hirano A. Stenglein S. Nelson J. Thomas G. Wong T.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3206-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To prevent transport of the F proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, F-expressing cells were pulse labeled and then chased for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of brefeldin A (19Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). To block the transport from the medial to trans-Golgi, the ionophore monensin was added to the chase medium (20Griffiths G. Quinn P. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, retention in the endoplasmic reticulum or the medial Golgi completely prevented cleavage of both MV F and NiV F, showing that NiV F activation does not occur before reaching the TGN. By using a mixture of NaF and AlCl3, trafficking of secretory vesicles from the TGN to the cell surface was blocked (21Barr F.A. Leyte A. Mollner S. Pfeuffer T. Tooze S.A. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As expected, furin-mediated cleavage of the MV F protein in the TGN was not affected by this treatment. In contrast, cleavage of the NiV F protein could no longer be detected (Fig. 3B), showing that the NiV F protein is not activated during the transport along the secretory pathway but needs to reach the plasma membrane before it can be cleaved. Endocytosis of the NiV F Protein Is Required for Proteolytic Cleavage—Very recently, we have shown that both NiV glycoproteins are internalized from the surface of infected and transfected cells. Whereas the G protein appeared to be internalized with the bulk flow during membrane turnover, constitutive endocytosis of the F protein was found to be signal mediated (15Vogt C. Eickmann M. Diederich S. Moll M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To test whether F uptake is required for proteolytic activation, F cleavage was analyzed in the presence of chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (22Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows that NiV F cleavage was completely prevented in the presence of 50 μm chlorpromazine whereas furin cleavage of the MV F protein was not affected. This clearly indicates that not only transport to the cell surface but also internalization via clathrin-coated pits is required for proteolytic activation of the NiV F protein. To demonstrate the intracellular localization of the NiV F protein after endocytosis, an antibody uptake experiment with F-expressing HeLa cells was performed. At 24 h posttransfection, surface-expressed F protein was labeled on ice with a NiV-specific antiserum. Then the cells were shifted to 37 °C for either 5 or 30 min to allow endocytosis to occur. As transferrin is known to be a specific marker for the recycling pathway (23Marsh E.W. Leopold P.L. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1509-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), rhodamine-labeled transferrin (Tfn-TR) was added to the F-transfected cells during incubation at 37 °C. After endocytosis of NiV F and Tfn-TR, surface-bound F-specific primary antibodies were blocked on ice with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were permeabilized, and internalized F protein was visualized using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. After 5 min of endocytosis, a punctuate staining pattern with an almost complete colocalization of NiV F and Tfn-TR was found, demonstrating that both proteins had been co-internalized and entered the early or sorting endosomal compartment (Fig. 4A). In agreement with this, both Tfn-TR and NiV F colocalized with the early endosomal antigen 1 marker protein, EEA-1 (not shown). After endocytosis for 30 min at 37 °C, both Tfn-TR and NiV F colocalized in a perinuclear area, indicating that both proteins had reached the recycling endosomal compartment (Fig. 4B). The marginal colocalization with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1, lamp-1 (Fig. 4C) confirmed that the F protein is not significantly targeted to the lysosomal compartment. NiV F Cleavage Requires Acidification of the Endosome—In contrast to the extracellular milieu and the cytoplasm, the pH in the endocytic-lysosomal compartment ranges from 6.5 in the early endosome to 4 in the lysosome. Weakly basic amines such as ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) inhibit acidification of the endosomes (24Oda K. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To test whether raising of the endosomal pH affects NiV F activation, 20 mm NH4Cl was added to NiV F-expressing cells at 8 h posttransfection. 16 h later, cells were surface biotinylated and the F protein was immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Surface-labeled F protein was detected by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and chemiluminescence. Fig. 5A shows that in the presence of NH4Cl almost no cleaved F protein was expressed on the cell surface (NiV F + NH4Cl). As a consequence, syncytia formation in NH4Cl-treated cells coexpressing NiV G and F was barely detectable (data not shown). This result shows that not only endocytosis but also acidification of the endosome is required for NiV F activation. A Decrease in the Extracellular pH Is Not Sufficient for Cleavage—As mentioned above, recent studies have shown that the NiV F protein possesses intrinsic internalization signals that ensure rapid endocytosis of the protein. The YSRL sequence in the F cytoplasmic domain (position 525-528) perfectly fits the YXXØ-type endocytosis signal consensus motif (where Y is a tyrosine, X can be any amino acid, and Ø is a large hydrophobic amino acid). These motifs are recognized by the cytosolic adaptor complex 2, which selectively concentrates proteins within clathrin-coated vesicles (25Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). In addition, the NiV F cytoplasmic domain contains a YY motif, which further increases the YRSL motif-mediated endocytosis rate to 2%/min (15Vogt C. Eickmann M. Diederich S. Moll M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By exchanging the three tyrosine residues in the F cytoplasmic domain against alanines (Fig. 1, FYA), we generated a mutant that was internalized with a rate of <0.1%/min (15Vogt C. Eickmann M. Diederich S. Moll M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To confirm that endocytosis is required for F cleavage, proteolytic activation of the endocytosis-negative FYA mutant was analyzed. The surface biotinylation of FYA-expressing cells showed that the mutant protein was abundantly expressed on the cell surface but was not cleaved at a detectable level (Fig. 5A, NiV FYA). Consequently, FYA was barely able to induce cell-to-cell fusion (Fig. 5B, control). Cleavage deficiency of the endocytosis-negative mutant is likely due to the fact that the F protein no longer encounters the activating protease in the endosomal compartment. Nevertheless, it could not be ruled out that the protease is a cell surface resident protease that cannot cleave non-endocytosed F protein because the protein must pass through the endosomal-recycling pathway to undergo a low pH-dependent conformational change before it can be activated on the cell surface. To test whether an acidic step can restore the fusion activity, FYA-transfected cells were subjected to an external pH 5 shift (26Huang R.T. Rott R. Klenk H.D. Virology. 1981; 110: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At 24 h posttransfection, medium adjusted to pH 5 was added for 10 min at 37 °C. Then the medium was again exchanged against normal culture medium (pH 7). When fusion was analyzed at 31 h posttransfection, cells expressing the NiV FYA protein together with the NiV G protein did not show increased syncytia formation (Fig. 5B, + pH 5 shift). This indicates that the deficient FYA cleavage on the cell surface is due not to the lack of a low pH-induced conformational change but to the lack of active protease on the cell surface. Class I fusion proteins, which are present in paramyxoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, filoviruses, and retroviruses, are proteolytically processed at basic cleavage sites either in the TGN by ubiquitous furin-like proteases or after arrival at the cell surface by exogenous trypsin-like proteases (9Klenk H.D. Garten W. Winner E. Cellular Receptors for Animal Viruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 241-280Google Scholar). In contrast to what is reported for other class I fusion proteins, activation of the NiV F protein is neither mediated during transport along the secretory pathway by a ubiquitous Golgi protease nor accomplished by an exogenous protease at the cell surface. Using intracellular transport inhibitors and the endocytosis-negative FYA mutant, we clearly demonstrated that activation of the NiV F protein occurs after internalization of the protein by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, showing for the first time that proteolytic activation of a paramyxoviral F protein can occur within the endosomal compartment. In addition to endocytosis, acidification of the endosome is required for NiV proteolytic activation. Fusion activity of the FYA mutant could not be restored by decreasing the extracellular pH, indicating that the activating protease is a low pH-dependent protease that is not present on the cell surface in an active form. In full agreement with the finding that endocytosis is an essential prerequisite for proteolytic activation, the surprising observation that endocytosis-deficient F mutants showed a decreased fusion activity despite an increased surface expression (15Vogt C. Eickmann M. Diederich S. Moll M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3865-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) can now be conclusively explained by the defective proteolytic processing of the surface-expressed mutant F proteins. The idea that proteolytic activation of the NiV F protein is completely different from what is known for other paramyxoviruses was already suggested by our earlier findings that cleavage of the NiV F monobasic cleavage site occurs ubiquitously and does not even require a basic residue at the cleavage site (8Moll M. Diederich S. Klenk H.D. Czub M. Maisner A. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9705-9712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, activation cannot be mediated by a trypsin- or furin-like enzyme such as those known to process other paramyxoviruses. We now know not only that activation of the NiV F protein is exceptional with respect to protease usage but also that the subcellular localization where proteolytic cleavage takes place is strikingly different. Similar to other F proteins with monobasic cleavage sites, the NiV F protein is not activated by the ubiquitous Golgi protease furin during transport and, thus, reaches the cell surface as fusion-inactive protein. However, whereas other paramyxoviral F proteins depend on exogenous trypsin-like proteases, making their activation on the cell surface restricted, the NiV F protein is ubiquitously internalized, activated within the endosomal compartment, and subsequently recycled to the cell surface as fusion-active protein. As recycled NiV F protein has not entered late endosomes or lysosomes, it must be concluded that activation occurs within early or recycling endosomes. The minor colocalization of endocytosed F protein with lamp-1 further supported the idea that only a small amount of the protein is transported to the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. As proteins that are recycled to the cell surface and proteins that are targeted to lysosomes have similar sorting signals, it must be assumed that the relative position of the signal within the NiV F cytoplasmic tail mediates internalization and recycling rather than lysosomal targeting (27Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Russell D. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 28White J.R. Lee J.M. Young P.R. Hertzberg R.P. Jurewicz A.J.

Although endosomes were originally thought to only function as a major sorting station of the endocytic pathway and receive endocytosed materials from the cell surface for recycling or transport to late endosomes and lysosomes, it is now well accepted that endosomes also represent a biologically important processing compartment within cells (29Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Clague M.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Endosomal cathepsins, metalloproteases, and secretases mediate cleavage or limited proteolysis of a variety of cellular proteins, leading either to degradation or activation of the respective proteins (31Authier F.

Furthermore, proteases of the endosomal compartment are known to be involved in the proteolytic processing of a few viral proteins such as the outer capsid proteins of reoviruses (39Ebert D.H. Deussing J. Peters C. Dermody T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24609-24617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, the NiV F protein is the first viral surface glycoprotein for which it is now shown that site-specific cleavage within endosomes takes place and is required for biological activation. This raises the interesting possibility that pharmacological drugs that block clathrin-mediated endocytosis might be potential tools for therapeutic treatment in the early phase of a NiV-induced encephalitis. In agreement with our findings, Pager et al. (40Pager C.T. Wurth M.A. Dutch R.E. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9154-9163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) recently reported that cleavage of the Hendra virus F protein is also sensitive to increases in intracellular pH levels. Because the Hendra virus F protein also contains a YSRL endocytosis motif in its cytoplasmic tail (6Wang L.F. Yu M. Hansson E. Pritchard L.I. Shiell B. Michalski W.P. Eaton B.T. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9972-9979Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), our results strongly suggest that the closely related Hendra virus F protein is also cleaved by a pH-dependent endosomal protease. Thus, activation in the endosomal compartment is likely to be a common property of the highly pathogenic henipaviruses, making these viruses unique not only within the Paramyxoviridae but also when compared with all enveloped viruses encoding for class I fusion proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2111894103,"Biological methylation reactions and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism are intimately linked. In previous work, we have shown that phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, an enzyme that methylates phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine, plays a significant role in the regulation of plasma Hcy levels through an effect on methylation demand (Noga, A. A., Stead, L. M., Zhao, Y., Brosnan, M. E., Brosnan, J. T., and Vance, D. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 5952–5955). We have further investigated methylation demand and Hcy metabolism in liver-specific CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-α (CTα) knockout mice, since flux through the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway is increased 2-fold to meet hepatic demand for phosphatidylcholine. Our data show that plasma Hcy is elevated by 20–40% in mice lacking hepatic CTα. CTα-deficient hepatocytes secrete 40% more Hcy into the medium than do control hepatocytes. Liver activity of betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase and methionine adenosyltransferase are elevated in the knockout mice as a mechanism for maintaining normal hepatic S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine levels. These data suggest that phospholipid methylation in the liver is a major consumer of AdoMet and a significant source of plasma Hcy. Biological methylation reactions and homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism are intimately linked. In previous work, we have shown that phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, an enzyme that methylates phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine, plays a significant role in the regulation of plasma Hcy levels through an effect on methylation demand (Noga, A.

Assoc.). 1995; 274: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). In humans, total plasma Hcy concentration normally ranges from 8 to 12 μm. However, a small elevation (∼5 μm) in plasma Hcy increases the risk of coronary artery disease by as much as 60% in men and 80% in women (3.Boushey C.J. Beresford S.A. Omenn G.S. Motulsky A.G. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 1995; 274: 1049-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). Hyperhomocysteinema has also been correlated with smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and impaired B vitamin status (1.Robinson K. Jacobson D.W. Homocysteine in Health and Disease.

Furthermore, altered Hcy metabolism has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (4.Clarke R. Smith A.D. Jobst K.A. Refsum H. Sutton L. Ueland P.M. Arch. Neurol. 1998; 55: 1449-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) and in the elderly with cognitive impairment (5.Selhub J. Bagley L.C. Miller J. Rosenberg I.H. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 71: 614S-620SCrossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Homocysteine is formed during the metabolism of methionine. Methionine is activated by methionine adenosyltransferase to form S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), an important biological methyl donor (6.Mudd S.H. Poole J.R. Metabolism. 1975; 24: 721-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Numerous methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet to a methyl acceptor, producing a methylated product and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), which is subsequently hydrolyzed to form adenosine and Hcy. Homocysteine has several metabolic fates; it can be remethylated to methionine using either betaine, catalyzed by betaine:Hcy methyltransferase (BHMT), or N5-methyltetrahydrofolate, catalyzed by methionine synthase (MAT), both of which are methyl donors. The catabolism of Hcy is accomplished by the transsulfuration pathway, which consists of two enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase. Finally, Hcy can be secreted from cells into the circulation. It is clear that biological methylation and Hcy metabolism are closely related. However, the potential of specific methyltransferases to regulate plasma Hcy levels has been understudied. We have previously utilized the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) knockout mouse to investigate the importance of phospholipid methylation in Hcy metabolism (7.Noga A.A. Stead L.M. Zhao Y. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). PEMT is a liver-specific enzyme that methylates one membrane lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), into another membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC) (8.Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Three AdoMet molecules are consumed in the course of this reaction. Since PEMT accounts for 30% of hepatic PC synthesis (9.Sundler R. Akesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29683-29688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that deletion of the gene would significantly alter Hcy metabolism. Indeed, plasma Hcy was reduced by 50% in the Pemt–/– mice compared with wild type controls (7.Noga A.A. Stead L.M. Zhao Y. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5952-5955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, hepatocytes isolated from Pemt–/– mice secrete less Hcy into the medium, providing clear evidence that Hcy production is reduced in the knockout mice. These studies illustrate the potential for PEMT to regulate plasma Hcy. Since there is no PEMT activity in the Pemt–/– mouse (12.Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), it is impossible to use this model to investigate how increased physiological demand for phospholipid methylation affects Hcy metabolism. As noted above, PEMT activity accounts for 30% of hepatic PC biosynthesis. The remaining 70% of hepatic PC is produced from choline by the enzymes of the Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway (9.Sundler R. Akesson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3359-3367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Reo N.V. Adinehzadeh M. Foy B.D. Biochim. Biophys.

Hepatic cells express two CT isoforms (16.Karim M. Jackson P. Jackowski S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1633: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), CTα (major expression), and CTβ (minor expression). We have generated a mouse model in which CTα is selectively deleted in the liver (17.Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In liver-specific CTα knockout mice, hepatic CT activity is 15% of normal, whereas PEMT activity is elevated 2-fold compared with controls. We hypothesized that induction of PEMT, while necessary to maintain close to normal hepatic PC levels, would increase hepatic Hcy production and result in elevated plasma Hcy. The results describe an important role for PEMT-derived PC biosynthesis in mice deficient in hepatic CTα and furthermore illustrate how physiological changes in PC metabolism influence Hcy metabolism. In Vivo Experiments—All procedures were approved by the University of Alberta's Institutional Animal Care Committee and were in accordance with guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. The liver-specific CTα knockout mouse was generated using the Cre/Lox technology as previously described (17.Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). All mice (12–20 weeks old) were fed ad libitum a chow diet (LabDiet, PICO laboratory Rodent Diet 20) and were exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle starting at 8:00 a.m. Primary Hepatocyte Cultures—Primary hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion (18.Davis R.A. Engelhorn S.C. Pangburn S.H. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2010-2016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and plated on 60-mm collagen-coated dishes at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum. 2–4 h after plating, the cultures were rinsed twice in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium over a 1-h period and then incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing 30 μm choline and 50 μm methionine) for 10 h. Medium was collected and frozen for Hcy measurements. Hcy export from hepatocytes was also assessed by measuring the formation of [14C]Hcy from [1-14C]methionine. Labeled Hcy was separated from methionine by thin layer chromatography (NH3/propanol, 30:70). Following visualization with 0.2% ninhydrin (dissolved in 95% ethanol), the band corresponding to Hcy was scraped, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. PC biosynthesis via PEMT was measured in hepatocytes that were incubated with either [3H]ethanolamine, [3H]methionine, or [14C]betaine. Medium was collected, and cells were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Protein analysis was performed with the BCA protocol (Bio-Rad) using albumin as a standard. Lipids were extracted using the Folch method (19.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 25:15:4:2). Following iodine visualization, bands corresponding to PE and PC were scraped, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In a separate set of experiments, the flux through the Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway was measured by incubating cells with [3H]choline for 2 h, after which the cells were sonicated in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Lipids were extracted using the Folch method, and phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 25:15:4:2). Following iodine visualization, bands corresponding to PC were scraped, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Radioactivity in soluble choline-containing compounds (choline and phosphocholine) was measured in the aqueous phase from the lipid extraction. The aqueous phase was first dried under constant air flow. The samples were then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and choline-containing compounds were separated by thin layer chromatography (CH3OH, 0.6% NaCl, NH4OH; 10:10:0.9). Following iodine visualization, bands corresponding to choline and phosphocholine were scraped, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Measurement of Amino Acid Concentrations and Enzyme Activities— Livers were removed from mice and flash-frozen. The protein content of the liver samples was determined by the Biuret method (20.Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thawed liver samples were homogenized in 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0). The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the following enzyme activities were measured in the supernatant: cystathionine β-synthase (21.Mudd S.H. Finkelstein J.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22831-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To determine CT activity, membranes were isolated by centrifugation of the liver homogenates at 600 × g for 10 min to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet, containing membrane-associated CT, was resuspended in the above homogenization buffer. The supernatant resulting from the 100,000 × g centrifugation contained non-membrane-associated CT. CT activity was measured in the homogenate, as well as in soluble and membrane fractions in the presence of PC-oleate vesicles, as previously described (26.Schneider W.J. Vance D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Total Hcy levels in plasma and media were measured by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection of ammonium 7-fluoro-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulfonate thiol adducts (27.Vester B. Rasmussen K. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 29: 549-554PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of free plasma amino acids was measured in samples that had been deproteinized by treatment with 10% sulfosalicylic acid. The protein was removed by centrifugation, and the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 2.2. The amino acids were analyzed on a Beckman 121 MB amino acid analyzer using Benson D-X 0.25 Cation Xchange Resin according to Beckman 121MB-TB-O17 application notes and quantitated using a Hewlett Packard Computing Integrator model 3395A following postcolumn derivatization with ninhydrin. AdoMet and AdoHcy Determination—The amounts of AdoMet and AdoHcy were measured in the liver as described previously (28.Jacobs R.L. Stead L.M. Brosnan M.E. Brosnan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43740-43747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, freeze-clamped liver was quickly added to 5 volumes of 8% cold trichloroacetic acid. Samples were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer for 10 s and were placed on ice for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C18 column (model 2187P54) that was equilibrated with 96% 50 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm heptane sulfonic acid (adjusted to pH 3.2 with concentrated sulfuric acid) and 4% acetonitrile. A 15-min linear gradient from 4 to 20% acetonitrile was used to separate AdoMet and AdoHcy. Peaks were monitored by UV detection at 258 nm and quantified using a 3390A Hewlett Packard integrator. Immunoblotting of Hepatic BHMT1 and MAT1—15 μg of liver homogenate was boiled in SDS buffer, and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nylon membranes and probed with anti-BHMT1 (dilution 1:3000), anti-MAT1 (1: 1200), or anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (1:5000) antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Quantification of the immunoreactive bands was performed using Image Gauge version 3.0 software by Fuji. RNA Isolation and Real Time PCR—Total liver RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to degrade any genomic DNA and was then reverse-transcribed using an oligo(dT)12–18 primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bhmt1, Bhmt2, Mat1a, Mat2a, Pemt, and cyclophilin (Cyc) transcripts were detected by real time PCR using a Rotor-Gene 3000 instrument (Montreal Biotech). Reaction mixtures contained Platinum® Quantitation PCR supermix (Invitrogen), a 0.25 μm concentration of each primer, and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in a total volume of 25 μl. Data analyses were performed using the Rotor-Gene 6.0.19 program (Montreal Biotech). The Pfaffl method (29.Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25597) Google Scholar) was used to compare the relative transcript levels using cyclophilin as the housekeeping gene.

Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.D. unless otherwise noted. Each experimental group contained 3–10 samples. Student's unpaired t test was performed to compare means unless otherwise specified. A p value of <0.05 was considered a significant difference. PC Synthesis from the CDP-choline Pathway Is Impaired in CTα-deficient Hepatocytes—The Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway has been shown to produce ∼70% of PC in a normal liver (9.Sundler R. Akesson B. J.

Interestingly, all hepatic CT activity was found in the membrane fraction in the knockout mice; however, the active form of CT was still only 15% of control levels (Fig. 1A). We sought to determine to what extent the decrease in CT activity in the knockout mice was reflected in flux through the CDP-choline pathway. To that end, we incubated primary hepatocytes with [3H]choline for 2 h and measured radiolabeled phosphocholine (a substrate for the CT reaction) and PC. We observed that the amount of [3H]phosphocholine was 2-fold higher in the knockout hepatocytes than in control hepatocytes (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the amount of newly formed PC was 65% less in hepatocytes deficient in CTα (Fig. 1B). These data provide clear evidence for impaired flux through the CDP-choline pathway in livers deficient in CTα. Increased PE Methylation and Homocysteine Secretion from CTα-deficient Hepatocytes—Despite the significant reduction in PC biosynthesis by the CDP-choline pathway, hepatic PC levels were only slightly lower (10–20%) in CTα-deficient mice than in their wild-type counterparts (17.Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that PE methylation may be compensating for the decreased CT activity. Indeed, in our previous work, we reported a 2-fold higher PEMT activity in the knockout mice that might have resulted in increased PC biosynthesis (17.Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we measured flux through the PEMT pathway in hepatocytes using [3H]ethanolamine and [3H]methionine. Incubation of hepatocytes with [3H]ethanolamine resulted in radiolabeled PE and PC. The amount of [3H]PE was the same in hepatocytes isolated from control and knockout mice; however, the level of [3H]PC was 80% higher in the knockout hepatocytes (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the ratio of radiolabel in PC and PE, a measure of PEMT flux, was 80% higher in CTα-deficient hepatocytes than in control hepatocytes. To confirm this result, we also incubated the hepatocytes with [methyl-3H]methionine. The amount of radio-labeled PC was nearly 2-fold higher in knockout cells than in the control cells (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these experiments show that induction of PEMT in CTα-deficient hepatocytes (17.Jacobs R.L. Devlin C. Tabas I. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47402-47410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) results in enhanced PE methylation and provides a compensatory mechanism for the decrease in PC biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway. Our model provides the opportunity to examine whether or not the physiological increase in flux through the PEMT pathway, driven by the absence of CTα, results in elevated Hcy secretion from hepatocytes. We therefore measured the secretion of Hcy from primary hepatocytes isolated from control and knockout mice. Following a 2–10-h incubation period, hepatocytes from knockout mice secreted 40% more Hcy into the media than did hepatocytes from control mice whether measured by radioactivity (Fig. 3A) or by mass (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that a physiological enhancement of methylation demand does indeed increase Hcy secretion from hepatocytes. Plasma Levels of Hcy Are Increased in Hepatic CTα-deficient Mice—Fig. 4 shows that mice deficient in hepatic CTα have higher levels of plasma Hcy than do control mice. We observed a 20% higher level of plasma Hcy in male knockout mice than in male control mice, whereas in female knockout mice, plasma Hcy was 40% higher than in their female littermates. The plasma concentration of methionine, cysteine, serine, glycine, and taurine were not significantly affected by genotype in either male or female mice (data not shown). The increase in plasma Hcy, coupled with an increase in Hcy secretion from the knockout hepatocytes, suggests that CTα deficiency in the liver appreciably alters Hcy metabolism. Therefore, we assayed the major enzymes involved in the production (transmethylation) and removal (transsulfuration and remethylation) of Hcy in the liver. The activity of BHMT, a key enzyme in choline oxidation, was increased by 80% in the livers of knockout mice compared with gender-matched controls (Table I). Similarly, the activity of MAT, which synthesizes AdoMet, was 2-fold higher in both male and female knockout mice. CTα deficiency did not alter the activity of methionine synthase, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, or cystathionine β-synthase in the livers (Table I).Table ISpecific activities of enzymes involved in methionine and homocysteine metabolismEnzymeControlKnockoutnmol/mg/minCystathionine β-synthaseMales11.4 ± 2.911.5 ± 2.9Females8.9 ± 3.210.0 ± 3.9Methionine adenosyltransferaseMales0.44 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.3aDifferences versus gender-matched controls, p < 0.05.Females0.35 ± 0.120.76 ± 0.15aDifferences versus gender-matched controls, p < 0.05.Methionine synthaseMales0.31 ± 0.040.29 ± 0.03Females0.25 ± 0.060.26 ± 0.05Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductaseMales0.061 ± 0.0040.061 ± 0.005Females0.066 ± 0.0050.064 ± 0.008Betaine:homocysteine methyltransferaseMales0.59 ± 0.130.83 ± 0.16aDifferences versus gender-matched controls, p < 0.05.Females0.44 ± 0.100.75 ± 0.09aDifferences versus gender-matched controls, p < 0.05.a Differences versus gender-matched controls, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab To address the possible mechanism(s) for the increased activity of MAT and BHMT, we measured the mRNA levels of their respective genes by real-time PCR (Fig. 5A). Bhmt1, Mat1a, and Pemt mRNA levels were increased by 2.2-, 1.7-, and 2.4-fold, respectively, as compared with controls. However, the mRNA levels of Bhmt2 and Mat2a were unaltered. Protein levels of BHMT1 and MAT1 were also elevated in knockout liver homogenate (Fig. 5B), which is consistent with the observed increase in enzyme activity. These data suggest that betaine (choline) oxidation is increased in the knockout mice, possibly as a mechanism for furnishing a supply of methyl groups for the increased rate of phospholipid methylation. To investigate this possibility, we incubated primary hepatocytes with [3H]choline in the presence of either 50 μm or 1 mm methionine. If choline oxidation had been stimulated to provide methyl groups for PE-methylation, a high concentration of unlabeled methionine would be expected to prevent the incorporation of radiolabel into PC. The amount of radiolabeled PC in control hepatocytes after a 2-h incubation was unaltered by incubation with 1 mm compared with 50 μm methionine (Fig. 6A). However, when knockout hepatocytes were incubated with 1 mm methionine, the amount of radiolabeled PC was 25% less than in hepatocytes incubated with 50 μm methionine (Fig. 6A). To confirm this result, hepatocytes were incubated with [14C]betaine, and radiolabeled PC was measured. [14C]PC production was increased 1.7-fold in knockout hepatocytes as compared with controls (Fig. 6B). These results clearly highlight the importance of choline (betaine) oxidation in the supply of methyl groups in CTα-deficient hepatocytes. The hepatic levels of AdoMet and AdoHcy were also measured. A deficiency of hepatic CTα did not change the amount of either metabolite (data not shown), suggesting that the induction of BHMT and MAT was successful in maintaining a normal hepatic ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy in the knockout mice. These results also indicate that AdoMet is not limiting for Hcy formation and that the increased secretion of Hcy from CTα-deficient hepatocytes is attributable to an increased flux through the PEMT pathway. Methylation Demand and Homocysteine—Studies on the role of PEMT in regulating Hcy production have been limited, in part, by the lack of an appropriate model. For example, modulation of dietary choline and methionine levels have been shown to regulate PEMT activity/expression (37.Ridgway N.D. Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol.

AMID was purified from a recombinant bacterial host, enabling biochemical analysis of the protein. AMID is a flavoprotein; possesses NAD(P)H oxidase activity; and catalyzes NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of cytochrome c and other electron acceptors, including molecular oxygen. NADPH binds approximately 10-fold tighter than NADH. AMID binds 6-hydroxy-FAD (a cofactor that accumulates only adventitiously and at low abundance in other flavoprotein enzymes) to form a stoichiometric cofactor.protein complex. AMID has a distinctive electronic spectrum due to the modified flavin. NAD(P)+ binding perturbed the spectrum, enabling determination of K(d) values for these coenzymes. 6-Hydroxy-FAD could be removed from AMID and the apoprotein reconstituted with FAD. FAD was converted to 6-hydroxy-FAD in reconstituted AMID during aerobic turnover with NADPH. AMID is a DNA-binding protein that lacks apparent DNA sequence specificity. Formation of the protein.DNA complex (i) effected a major protein conformational change and (ii) was prevented in the presence of nicotinamide coenzyme. Apo-AMID retains DNA binding activity. Our studies establish a link between coenzyme and DNA binding that likely impacts on the physiological role of AMID in cellular apoptosis."

For example, in response to UV damage HIPK2 interacts with and phosphorylates tumor suppressor p53 at serine 46, thus facilitating its acetylation at lysine 382 resulting in p53-dependent apoptosis (21D'Orazi G.

Furthermore, HIPK2 also regulates apoptosis independent of p53, either through direct phosphorylating and thus targeting the anti-apoptotic transcriptional corepressor CtBP for proteasomal degradation (26Zhang Q.

Cell. 2003; 115: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), or through activating the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and participating in TGF-β-induced JNK activation and apoptosis (30Hofmann T.G. Stollberg N. Schmitz M.L. Will H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8271-8277PubMed Google Scholar). A previous report revealed that murine HIPK2 interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and it has been suggested that HIPK2 is SUMO modified at an atypical, non-consensus SUMO acceptor site within its very C terminus (31Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, the functional impact of HIPK2 SUMO modification remained yet unclear. In this study we examined the site and the functional consequences of human HIPK2 SUMO modification. Unexpectedly, our results show that HIPK2 is SUMO modified in vitro and in vivo at a single, consensus modification motif at acceptor lysine 25. Interestingly, we found that SUMO-1 modification negatively regulates HIPK2 effector function on JNK and p53-independent apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that SUMO protease SuPr-1 interacts with HIPK2 and deconjugates SUMO from HIPK2, thereby antagonizing the inhibitory effect of SUMO-1 on HIPK2-mediated JNK activation. Thus, our findings indicate that HIPK2-induced JNK activation is modulated through dynamic SUMO-1 conjugation.

In brief, 293 cells were transfected with HA-JNK1 expression vector and the indicated FLAG-HIPK2 constructs. Total DNA amount was kept equal in all transfections using empty pcDNA3 vector. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were serum starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum overnight, and subsequently harvested. HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies (12CA5), and JNK assays were performed using [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μg of bacterially expressed GST-c-Jun-(5-89) as a substrate as published previously (30Hofmann T.G.

DNA was visualized by Draq5 (Apotech) or 4,6,diamidino-2-phenylindole. Stained cells were examined by using an epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan-2, Zeiss) or a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Zeiss). Coimmunoprecipitation—Transfected 293T cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, Complete protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min on ice, and cell debris was spun down. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatants using 2 μg of anti-GFP antibodies and 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 2 h and subsequently washed three times using 750 μl of lysis buffer. Precipitates were separated on 8.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the antibodies indicated. Colony Formation Assays—HeLa cells plated in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of the pcDNA3, pcDNA3-HA-SUMO-1, or pcDNA3-HA-Ubc9 in combination with 8 μg of either pcDNA3-Zeo or pcDNA3-Zeo-FLAG-HIPK2. One day post-transfection the cells were maintained for 14 days in double selection medium containing 50 μg/ml zeocin and 850 μg/ml G418. Cells were then fixed and stained with crystal violet as described previously (22Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat.

Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Cells were lysed in TOTEX+ buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide) supplemented with protease inhibitors and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and treated as described (22Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Western blot Femto, Pierce). In Vivo SUMO Conjugation—293 cells were transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged HIPK2 expression constructs along with HA-SUMO-1 and HA-Ubc9 as indicated. Cells were lysed in TOTEX+ buffer, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting as indicated. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were diluted with SDS-free buffer to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS and then precipitated by using 4 μg of anti-FLAG antibodies. Washed precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting. SUMO-1 modification of endogenous HIPK2 was analyzed by lysing U2OS or HT1080 cells in TOTEX+ buffer, diluting the lysates in SDS-free buffer to a final concentration of 0.1% SDS, and subsequent immunoprecipitation with 10 μg of anti-rabbit IgG antibodies or 10 μg of anti-HIPK2 antibodies. For the His6-SUMO-1 pull-down, 293 cells were transfected with a His6-SUMO-1 expression plasmid and either FLAG-HIPK2 or FLAG-HIPK2K25R, respectively. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions and His6-SUMO-1-linked proteins were isolated by Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography as described (32Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. In Vitro SUMO Conjugation and Deconjugation Assays—For in vitro SUMO conjugation assays, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, GST-SUMO-1, Ubc9, and SAE1/SAE2 were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli B834 as previously described (20Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L.A. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1043-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled forms of HIPK2 were generated in a wheat germ-coupled transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). SUMO conjugation assays were carried out essentially as described (20Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L.A. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1043-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and reaction products were analyzed by phosphorimaging. For SUMO deconjugation assays, 10 μl of SUMO-conjugated HIPK2 was mixed with 1 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, 1 μl of 150 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Finally, 2 μg of SuPr-1 solved in 8 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added, and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Reaction products were analyzed by phosphorimaging. HIPK2 Is SUMO-1 Modified at Lysine 25 in Vitro—Using human HIPK2 (amino acids 565-1191) in a yeast two-hybrid screen as bait, we isolated three full-length clones of the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 as the interaction partner from a human total brain cDNA library (Fig. 1A, and data not shown). This suggests that human HIPK2 is subject to SUMO modification. To provide evidence for SUMO modification of HIPK2, we made use of an in vitro SUMO-1 modification assay. Incubation of [35S]methionine-labeled, full-length HIPK2 with purified SAE1/2 (E1 enzyme), Ubc9, and SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 resulted in the appearance of a more slowly migrating species consistent with SUMO modification (Fig. 1B, lane 2, upper panel). Substitution of GST-SUMO-1 for SUMO-1 caused a further retardation of the modified species (Fig. 1B, lane 3, upper panel), and omission of SAE1/SAE2, Ubc9, or SUMO abrogated modification (Fig. 1B, lanes 7-9, upper panel). To map the SUMO acceptor site we generated various truncated HIPK2 proteins and performed in vitro SUMO modification analyses. Interestingly, the results from the in vitro modification assays revealed modification of the HIPK2ΔC protein (Fig. 1, lanes 9 and 10) but not of HIPK2ΔN (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Next, we generated two smaller deletions spanning the HIPK2ΔC protein (HIPK2-1-188) and HIPK2-KD) and performed in vitro SUMO modification assays. This approach enabled us to narrow down the SUMO acceptor site to the NH2-terminal 188 amino acids (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4, and 7 and 8). Next, we searched this amino acid stretch for potential consensus SUMO modification motifs (2Hay R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 332-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and identified a single site that conformed to the ΨKXE motif. To test whether lysine residue 25 within the identified consensus motif serves as the SUMO acceptor site, we changed this residue of arginine (K25R) using site-directed mutagenesis. The K25R substitution abolished in vitro SUMO-1 modification of full-length HIPK2 protein (Fig. 1B, lower panel) and of HIPK2ΔCK25R mutant protein (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, our data demonstrate that human HIPK2 is modified by SUMO in vitro at acceptor lysine residue 25. Strikingly, the SUMO modification motif identified in human HIPK2 was found to be conserved among all murine and human HIPK family members (Fig. 1D). Consistent with the results of the in vitro SUMO modification assays (Fig. 1, B and C), no additional consensus motifs were identified in the entire HIPK2 amino acid sequence, suggesting that HIPK2 is modified at a single site. In Vivo SUMO-1 Modification of HIPK2 at Lysine 25—To establish that lysine 25 serves as a SUMO acceptor site also in vivo, we coexpressed FLAG-HIPK2 and FLAG-HIPK2K25R along with His6-SUMO-1 in 293 cells. Cells were lysed in guanidine hydrochloride, and His6-tagged proteins were isolated by Ni-NTA-agarose chromatography. Immunoblot analysis of the eluted proteins indicated that HIPK2 was modified with His6-SUMO-1 in vivo (Fig. 2B). In contrast, HIPK2K25R was not found to be modified with His6-SUMO-1 (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that HIPK2 is SUMO-1 modified in vivo at lysine residue 25. To examine whether endogenous HIPK2 is SUMO-1 modified we immunoprecipitated HIPK2 from HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell lysates using conditions that preserve SUMO-1 modification. Immunoblot analysis of the immunocomplexes with a SUMO-1-specific mouse monoclonal antibody revealed a slightly upshifted SUMO-1-conjugated HIPK2 species (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, this result indicates that a fraction of endogenous HIPK2 protein is modified with SUMO-1. SUMO-1 Modification Does Not Influence HIPK2 Localization—SUMO modification has been implicated in regulating the subcellular distribution of some of its target proteins, including PML (8Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 33Zhong S. Müller S.

Melchior F. Feng X.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine whether SUMO modification may affect HIPK2 localization, we expressed FLAG-HIPK2 and FLAG-HIPK2K25R in HeLa cells and analyzed their subcellular distribution using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3, A and B). HIPK2K25R showed a similar subcellular distribution to wild type HIPK2 when expressed in HeLa cells or other cell lines tested (U2OS, H1299; data not shown), indicating that SUMO modification does not change the subcellular distribution of HIPK2. HIPK2 is recruited to PML-NBs by the PML isoform PML-IV (21D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence stainings revealed that HIPK2K25R was as efficiently recruited to PML-NBs as HIPK2WT (Fig. 3, C and D), demonstrating that SUMO conjugation is not required for PML-NB recruitment of HIPK2. SUMO-1 Regulates HIPK2-mediated JNK Activation and p53-independent Growth Suppression—Recently, we demonstrated that HIPK2 activates the JNK pathway (30Hofmann T.G. Stollberg N. Schmitz M.L. Will H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8271-8277PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether SUMO-1 modification would regulate HIPK2 effector function on JNK, we coexpressed HIPK2 with HA-JNK1 and GFP-SUMO-1 in 293 cells, immunoprecipitated HA-JNK1 from the cell lysates, and monitored JNK activation by in vitro kinase assays using recombinant GST-c-Jun as a substrate. Interestingly, SUMO-1 expression resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in HIPK2-induced JNK activation (Fig. 4A). Notably, this effect was not because of decreased HIPK2 protein levels (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Importantly, expression of SUMO-1 and Ubc9 showed no effect on JNK activity (Fig. 4D, lane 2, and data not shown), indicating that the effect of SUMO-1 on HIPK2 is specific. Similar to SUMO-1, enforced expression of the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 also resulted in decreased HIPK2-mediated JNK activation (Fig. 4B), and coexpression of SUMO-1 and Ubc9 decreased HIPK2-induced JNK activation in an additive manner (Fig. 4C). In contrast, JNK activation by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MLK-3 (35Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2146087470,"Abstract Human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (huPNP) is essential for human T-cell division by removing deoxyguanosine and preventing dGTP imbalance. Plasmodium falciparum expresses a distinct PNP (PfPNP) with a unique substrate specificity that includes 5′-methylthioinosine. The PfPNP functions both in purine salvage and in recycling purine groups from the polyamine synthetic pathway. Immucillin-H is an inhibitor of both huPNP and PfPNPs. It kills activated human T-cells and induces purine-less death in P. falciparum. Immucillin-H is a transition state analogue designed to mimic the early transition state of bovine PNP. The DADMe-Immucillins are second generation transition state analogues designed to match the fully dissociated transition states of huPNP and PfPNP. Immucillins, DADMe-Immucillins and related analogues are compared for their energetic interactions with human and P. falciparum PNPs. Immucillin-H and DADMe-Immucillin-H are 860 and 500 pm inhibitors against P. falciparum PNP but bind human PNP 15–35 times more tightly. This common pattern is a result of kcat for huPNP being 18-fold greater than kcat for PfPNP. This energetic binding difference between huPNP and PfPNP supports the kchem/kcat binding argument for transition state analogues. Preferential PfPNP inhibition is gained in the Immucillins by 5′-methylthio substitution which exploits the unique substrate specificity of PfPNP. Human PNP achieves part of its catalytic potential from 5′-OH neighboring group participation. When PfPNP acts on 5′-methylthioinosine, this interaction is not possible. Compensation for the 5′-OH effect in the P. falciparum enzyme is provided by improved leaving group interactions with Asp206 as a general acid compared with Asn at this position in huPNP. Specific atomic modifications in the transition state analogues cause disproportionate binding differences between huPNP and PfPNPs and pinpoint energetic binding differences despite similar transition states."

The integrin β hybrid domain acts as a lever for the transmission of activation signal. The displacement of the hybrid domain can serve to report different integrin activation states. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) MEM148 is a reporter antibody that recognizes Mg/EGTA-activated but not resting integrin αL β2. Herein, we mapped its epitope to the critical residue Pro374 located on the inner face of the β2 hybrid domain. Integrin αL β2 binds to its ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 with different affinities. Integrin is proposed to have at least three affinity states, and the position of the hybrid domain differs in each. We made use of the property of mAb MEM148 to analyze and correlate these affinity states in regard to αL β2/intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) binding. Our study showed that Mg/EGTA-activated αLβ2 can adopt a different conformation from that activated by activating mAbs KIM185 or MEM48. Unlike ICAM-1 binding, which required only one activating agent, αL β2/ICAM-3 binding required both Mg/EGTA and an activating mAb. This suggests that αLβ2 with intermediate affinity is sufficient to bind ICAM-1 but not ICAM-3, which requires a high affinity state. Furthermore, we showed that the conformation adopted by αLβ2 in the presence of Mg/EGTA, depicting an intermediate activation state, could be reverted to its resting conformation.

Real time analysis of integrin α4β1 binding to fluorescent-conjugated ligand mimetic via chemokine receptor activation on leukocytes also suggests integrin acquiring multiple affinity states (18Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For the integrin αLβ2, ligand ICAM-1 exhibits higher affinity for purified αLβ2 from T cells than ICAM-3 (19de Fougerolles A.R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Prior exposure of αLβ2 to ICAM-1 increased its binding to ICAM-3 (20Buckley C.D. Ferguson E.D. Littler A.J. Bossy D. Simmons D.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Soluble ICAM (sICAM)-3 binds to αLβ2 with 9-fold lower affinity than sICAM-1 (21Woska Jr., J.R. Morelock M.M.

We also reported the requirement of two αLβ2-activating mAbs, KIM185 and KIM127, for their adhesion to ICAM-3 as compared with ICAM-1 (22Al-Shamkhani A. Law S.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 3291-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Crystal structures of engineered intermediate affinity αL I-domain (L161C/F299C) and high affinity αL I-domain (K287C/K294C) in complex with ICAM-1 showed differences in their interactions (23Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Together, it is apparent that distinct αLβ2 affinity states could serve binding to different ICAM ligands. Structural data of intact αLβ2 inter-acting with ICAM are lacking. Hence, structural data derived from the studies of β3 and β1 integrin are useful as a hypothetical activation model to correlate αLβ2 functional states to its conformation. In this article we described the reporter mAb MEM148, which recognizes the free integrin β2 subunit or Mg2+/EGTA-activated αLβ2 but not resting αLβ2 (2Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y.

Immunobiology. 2001; 203: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We mapped the epitope of MEM148 to the hybrid domain, and the location of the epitope when modeled with the bent structure of αVβ3 faces the α subunit and could, therefore, be masked. Activation as a result of integrin extension could lead to the exposure of the epitope. In addition, we make use of the activation-reporter property of MEM148 to analyze the different αLβ2 affinity states required for ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 binding. Reagents and Antibodies—The following mAbs were gifts from different sources: MHM24 (anti-αL) and MHM23 (anti-β2, heterodimer dependent) were obtained from Prof. A. J. McMichael (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK); KIM185 (anti-β2, activating mAb) was from Dr. M. Robinson (CellTech, Slough, UK); MEM48 (anti-β2, activating mAb) and MEM148 (anti-β2) were from Prof. V. Horejsi (Prague, Czech Republic). ICAM-1/Fc and ICAM-3/Fc were prepared as described previously (25Simmons D. Hartley D. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-128Google Scholar). cDNA Expression Constructs—The αL and β2 cDNAs in the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were described previously (26Douglass W.A.

Lau Y.L. Higgins D. Davies K.A. Law S.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Previously, we had numbered the N-terminal Met of β2 as “1” (4Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and relevant references therein. For the purpose of clarity and ease of reference with other β2 and different β integrins functional and structural studies, herein β2 Met1 is re-numbered as Met-22 (28Barclay A.N. Brown M.H. Law S.K. McKnight A.J. Tomlinson M.G. van der Merwe P.A. The Leucocyte Antigen Facts Book. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Ltd., London1997: 177-178Google Scholar). Construction of β2 Hu/Mo A in which Met-22-Asn562 of human integrin β2 was replaced with the corresponding region from mouse β2 was described previously (4Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions on the mouse or human β2 constructs were made using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK and Research Biolabs sequencing service, Singapore). Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 (monkey kidney fibroblast) and MOLT-4 (human T lymphoblast) (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in complete media RPMI 1640 containing l-glutamine (JRH Biosciences Inc., Australia), 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For epitope mapping studies, COS-7 cells were transfected with wild-type β2 or variant cDNAs by the DEAE-dextran method (25Simmons D. Hartley D. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 93-128Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Flow cytometry analysis of integrin cell surface expression was performed as described previously (29Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml primary mAb in RPMI 1640 for 1 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated sheep anti-mouse F(ab′)2 secondary Ab (1:400 dilution; Sigma) for 45 min at 4 °C. Stained cells were washed once and fixed in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The expression index (EI) was calculated by % cells gated positive × geo-mean fluorescence intensity. Analysis of mAbs MEM148 and KIM127 Epitope Exposure—MOLT-4 cells were incubated in Mg/EGTA (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) at 37 °C for 0.5 h together with MEM148 or KIM127. Cells were washed once followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min at 4 °C. Treatment with EDTA was performed by subsequent incubation of Mg/EGTA-treated cells in 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 15 min followed by staining with the respective mAbs. Fluorescence staining was detected by flow cytometry. Washing experiments were performed by subjecting Mg/EGTA-treated cells to two or three washes in RPMI before incubating with antibodies. Cell Surface Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—-Briefly, MOLT-4 cells were washed twice in PBS followed by incubation in sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) at 0.5 mg/ml in PBS for 20 min on ice. The reaction was quenched by washing surface-labeled cells once in PBS containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (29Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thereafter, cells were incubated in Mg/EGTA (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (100 ng/ml) with mAbs (irrelevant mAb, MHM23, or MEM148) in RPMI media containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) with protease inhibitors followed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and protein bands were detected by ECL (GE Healthcare Amersham Biosciences) (29Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immobilized Ligand Binding Assay—Adhesion of MOLT-4 cells to ICAM-1 or ICAM-3 coated on Polysorb microtiter wells (Nunc, Rosklide, Denmark) were performed as reported previously (29Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, each microtiter well was coated with 0.5 μg of goat anti-human IgG (Fcspecific) in 50 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. ICAM-Fc at 1 ng/μl or other specified concentrations in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed twice in RPMI wash buffer (RPMI media containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) before assay. Cells labeled with 3.0 mm 2′7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6) carboxyfluorescein fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were incubated in RPMI wash buffer containing Mg/EGTA (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) and/or activating mAb (10 μg/ml) to activate αLβ2-mediated adhesion. The activating mAbs are MEM48 and KIM185. αL-Specific function-blocking mAb MHM24 (10 μg/ml) was included to demonstrate binding specificity. Cell fluorescence, which indicates the number of cells adhering to ligand-coated wells, is measured using FL600 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Soluble Ligand Binding Assay—sICAM-1 or sICAM-3 binding assay was performed as described with slight modifications (30Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2003; 19: 391-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Soluble ICAMs were prepared by incubating 20 μg/ml ICAM-Fc with 100 μg/ml FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG Fc antibody (Pierce) in 50 μl of RPMI 1640 media containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, purified mouse IgG was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml mAb for 20 min at room temperature. This was performed to quench cross-reactivity to mouse IgG, which was included in the experiment as activating or function-blocking mAb. Cells (2 × 105) were resuspended in this sICAM mixture with or without αLβ2-activating agents for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with RPMI media and fixed in 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS followed by flow cytometry analyses. For activating studies, Mg/EGTA (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) and/or activating mAbs (MEM48 or KIM185) (10 μg/ml) were used. For blocking studies, function-blocking αL-specific mAb MHM24 (10 μg/ml) was included in the samples. Mapping of mAb MEM148 Epitope—The epitope of mAb MEM148 resides in the integrin β2 hybrid domain and is not expressed in resting integrin αLβ2 but is exposed upon Mg/EGTA treatment (2Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because it may serve as a useful reporter mAb for subsequent analyses of integrin affinity states, we further characterize its epitope using a panel of integrin β2 human/mouse “knock-out” mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis (4Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These human integrin β2 mutants have their residues replaced by corresponding mouse β2 residues at positions where they differ in the mid-region (Fig. 1B). COS-7 cells, which can express β2 integrin in the absence of the α subunit (2Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), were transfected with the β2 human/mouse knock-out mutant cDNAs followed by immunofluorescence staining with mAb MEM148 and flow cytometry analyses. Expression of MEM148 epitope on transfectants was determined (Fig. 2A). The mAb MEM48, which maps to residues Leu534, Phe536, and His543 of human integrin β2 I-EGF 3 (32Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was included as the receptor expression control. An approximately 3-fold reduction in MEM148 epitope expression was observed for transfectants expressing β2Hu(H370S/R371I) or β2Hu(N372G/Q373K) as compared with β2Hu(wt). The β2Hu(P374S) variant showed significant (>90%) abrogation of MEM148 epitope expression. We next employed an integrin β2 human/mouse chimera (β2Hu/MoA) (Fig. 1A) in which Met-22-Asn562 of human integrin β2 is replaced by the corresponding region from mouse integrin β2 (4Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to generate two “knock-in” mutants. The β2Hu/MoA(S374P) has the Ser374 of the mouse mid-region substituted by the corresponding human Pro residue. The β2Hu/MoA(A368V-S374P) has the segment Ala368-Ser374 of the mouse mid-region replaced by the corresponding human segment Val368-Pro374. In this case, mAb KIM185, which maps to integrin β2 I-EGF 4 and β-tail domain (32Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was included as the receptor expression control because the epitope of MEM48 is absent in β2Hu/MoA. The expression of MEM148 epitope on β2Hu/MoA(S374P) was low as compared with β2Hu(wt) (Fig. 2B). However, transfectant bearing β2Hu/MoA(A368V-S374P) fully restored the epitope of MEM148. Thus, we may conclude that although human integrin β2 Pro374 is a critical residue, other residues, His370, Arg371, Asn372, Gln373, are also required for the effective presentation of MEM148 epitope. Model of αLβ2 Illustrating the MEM148 Epitope—Fine mapping of MEM148 epitope allows us to pinpoint its location in the quaternary structure of integrin. A model of integrin αLβ2 was generated by MODELLER using αVβ3 structural coordinates as the template (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The structure of an intact I-domain-containing integrin is not solved; hence, the αL I-domain was excluded from the model. For clarity, the αL Calf-2, β2 PSI, I-EGFs, and β-tail domains were not included. The critical residue Pro374 resides on the surface of the hybrid domain facing the αL subunit, in contrast to the epitope of mAb 7E4 (Val385) (4Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is located away from the αL subunit (Fig. 3B). This could explain why mAb MEM148 fails to bind resting αLβ2; presumably it assumes a severely bent conformation similar to the resting αVβ3 (3Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) because its epitope is shielded in this conformation (Fig. 3C). Along the same line of reasoning, the binding of mAb MEM148 to activated αLβ2 adopting an extended conformation would, therefore, be favorable in conjunction with previous observations (2Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Drbal K. Angelisova P. Cerny J. Hilgert I. Horejsi V. Immunobiology. 2001; 203: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Transition of αLβ2 from One Affinity State to Another Is Reversible—The mAb MEM148 does not bind to αLβ2 on MOLT-4 cells unless the cells were treated with Mg/EGTA (2Tan S.M. Robinson M.K. Drbal K. van Kooyk Y. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36370-36376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Divalent cations have a major influence on the α I-domain and β I-like domain, and it is widely accepted that the activated integrin should adopt an opened and/or extended conformation. However, defining the precise mechanism for the transition of integrin from one affinity state to the next in the presence of activating divalent cations remains challenging. Recently, several quaternary integrin conformations were proposed to depict such transitions (7Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Of note, the reversion from one conformation to another may be physiologically relevant to maintain a dynamic integrin population responding to different cellular activation milieu. To this end we determine whether Mg/EGTA-treated αLβ2 can revert to its resting state using MEM148 as the reporter mAb. MOLT-4 cells were incubated in Mg/EGTA-containing RPMI and either MEM148 or KIM127 at 37 °C. The epitope of KIM127 resides in β2 I-EGF 2, and like MEM148, its epitope expression depends on integrin activation (32Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 33Robinson M.K. Andrew D. Rosen H. Brown D. Ortlepp S. Stephens P. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1080-1085PubMed Google Scholar). Significant staining was detected for both mAbs only in the presence of Mg/EGTA (Fig. 4A). The integrin αL-specific mAb MHM24 was included as a control. Next, cells in the presence of Mg/EGTA were subsequently treated with EDTA to deplete existing Mg2+ before incubation with respective mAbs. Epitope expressions of MEM148 and KIM127 were significantly reduced in these samples, whereas control mAb MHM24 staining was not affected. We next tested whether Mg/EGTA-treated cells after washing in media could still express the epitopes of MEM148 and KIM127 (Fig. 4B). Mg/EGTA-treated cells were subjected to three washes in RPMI without additives followed by staining for either of the two mAbs. Low levels of MEM148 or KIM127 epitope expression were detected as compared with Mg/EGTA-treated cells without washing. Cell binding assay to ICAM-1 was investigated to determine whether Mg/EGTA-treated cells followed by washing could still adhere to ICAM-1 (Fig. 4C). In the presence of Mg/EGTA, cells adhered significantly to ICAM-1. However, adhesion was minimal when cells were treated with Mg/EGTA followed by two or three washes in RPMI wash buffer before allowing adherence to ICAM-1. Binding specificity was shown by including αL-specific function-blocking mAb MHM24. Together, our data suggest that reversion of Mg/EGTA-activated αLβ2 to its resting conformation is possible when the activating cation is depleted. We furthered our analyses by changing the order of MOLT-4 treatment with different agents to test whether MEM148 remains bound to Mg/EGTA-treated cells even in the presence of EDTA. Cells were first treated with Mg/EGTA in the presence of MEM148 with subsequent treatment with EDTA or additional washes in media (Fig. 4D). MEM148 staining was detected in both cases. This suggests that the αLβ2·MEM148 complex is stable even when divalent cations were depleted or by extensive washing in media. PMA is known to promote αLβ2 ligand binding (4Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 34Rothlein R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1132-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). PMA also induced the expression of MEM148 epitope on myeloid cells, and this was contributed by a proteolytically cleaved fragment of β2 unassociated with the αL, αM, or αX subunit rather than the respective heterodimers (35Drbal K. Angelisova P. Hilgert I. Cerny J. Novak P. Horejsi V. Blood. 2001; 98: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To test whether PMA induced MEM148 epitope expression on MOLT-4, cells were surface-labeled with biotin followed by treatment with Mg/EGTA"
https://openalex.org/W2056651612,"Ssq1, a specialized yeast mitochondrial Hsp70, plays a critical role in the biogenesis of proteins containing Fe-S clusters through its interaction with Isu, the scaffold on which clusters are built. Two substitutions within the Ssq1 substrate binding cleft, both of which severely reduced affinity for Isu, had very different effects in vivo. Cells expressing Ssq1(F462S), which had no detectable affinity for Isu, are indistinguishable from Δssq1 cells, underscoring the importance of the Ssq1-Isu1 interaction in vivo. In contrast, cells expressing Ssq1(V472F), whose affinity for Isu is at least 10-fold lower than that of wild-type Ssq1, had only moderately reduced Fe-S enzyme activities and increased iron levels and grew similarly to wild-type cells. Consistent with the reduced affinity for Isu, the ATPase activity of Ssq1(V472F) was stimulated less well than that of Ssq1 upon addition of Isu and Jac1, the J-protein partner of Ssq1. However, higher concentrations of Jac1 or Isu1, which form a stable complex, could compensate for this defect in stimulation of Ssq1(V472F). Expression of Isu1 was up-regulated 10-fold in ssq1(V472F) compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that formation of a Jac1-Isu1 complex can overcome a lowered affinity of Ssq1 for Isu in vivo as well as in vitro.

Chaperones of the Hsp70 family function in a number of essential cellular roles, including de novo protein folding, refolding of unfolded proteins, and protein translocation across intracellular membranes (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 2Mayer M.P. Brehmer D. Gassler C.S. Bukau B. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2002; 59: 1-44Google Scholar, 3Hartl F. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). These various activities rely on the ability of Hsp70s to reversibly bind hydrophobic segments of proteins. Affinity of Hsp70s for substrate depends on the conformation of the C-terminal substrate binding domain, which is regulated by the nucleotide bound to the N-terminal ATPase domain. When ATP is bound to Hsp70, an open conformation of the substrate binding domain allows fast binding and release; when ADP is bound, a closed conformation of the substrate binding domain results in slow binding and release. Under physiological conditions, when ATP concentrations are typically high substrate protein interacts with Hsp70 in the ATP conformation. This interaction is stabilized upon hydrolysis of ATP. The cycle of interaction is completed when ADP is replaced by ATP and the substrate is released. Thus, stimulation of the ATPase activity of Hsp70 is essential for stabilization of the Hsp70-substrate interaction. However, the rate of the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70 is low. ATPase activity is stimulated both by interaction of the substrate in the substrate binding cleft and J-protein co-chaperone interaction with the ATPase domain. Some J-proteins not only stimulate the ATPase activity of their partner Hsp70 but also bind substrates directly. This interaction has led to the suggestion that these proteins play an important role in targeting substrates for Hsp70 binding (4Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K.

Biogenesis of Fe-S clusters is a critical step in the maturation of the numerous cellular proteins that contain this prosthetic group. In yeast mitochondria, a specialized Hsp70, Ssq1, plays an important role in this process. It interacts with the scaffold protein, Isu, on which an Fe-S cluster is built prior to transfer to a recipient apoprotein (for review see Refs. 8Craig E.A. Marszalek J. Cell. Mol.

In contrast, Hsp70s specialized in biogenesis of Fe-S centers, both in bacteria (Hsc66) and yeast mitochondria (Ssq1), display high substrate specificity, interacting with the unique PVK tripeptide within the IscU/Isu protein (11Hoff K.G.

Ssq1 functions with the specialized J-protein partner Jac1. As expected of a J-protein partner, Jac1 specifically stimulates the ATPase activity of Ssq1 (13Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H.

In addition, alterations within the signature HPD motif of the J-domain result in a decrease of in vitro activity and have profound phenotypic effects in vivo (13Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H.

The role of Jac1 in Ssq1-Isu interaction is not limited, however, to the stimulation of ATPase activity, as Jac1 binds Isu1 (11Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 13Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol.

Thus the Ssq1-Jac1 chaperone pair shares many features with other chaper-one systems but is very unusual in that it is thought to have a single specific substrate protein. Most Hsp70s interact with many amino acid segments of hydrophobic character in many partially folded proteins. Previously, we found that alterations in the PVK tripeptide of Isu led to disruption of the interaction with Ssq1 and deleterious in vivo phenotypes (12Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Cheng S. Knieszner H. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29167-29174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, these preliminary results suggested that the cell could tolerate alterations that decreased the affinity for Ssq1 in in vitro assays to a surprising degree. Therefore, we set out to analyze the effect of alterations in the substrate binding cleft of Ssq1. A substitution that decreased the affinity for Isu more than 10-fold had only moderate effects in vivo. Our results suggest that up-regulation of Isu expression, coupled with highly specific interactions between it and the chaperones Ssq1 and Jac1, can compensate for a low affinity of Ssq1 for Isu. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Chemicals—The ssq1(V472F) and ssq1(F462S) alleles were constructed by site-directed PCR mutagenesis and cloned into pRS306 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These alleles were integrated into the chromosome using the two-step protocol. The vector was linearized using the XhoI site found in the 5′-untranslated region of SSQ1 or using the NcoI site found in the URA3 gene and transformed into a diploid strain heterozygous for Δssq1::LYS2 (21Schilke B. Forster J. Davis J. James P. Walter W. Laloraya S. Johnson J. Miao B. Craig E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using the lithium acetate protocol (22Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). Ura+ transformants were first patched onto YPD medium and then onto medium containing 5-FOA to identify candidates that had lost the vector sequence by homologous recombination when integration was directed to the SSQ1 locus. Cells that grew on 5-FOA were tested for growth on minimal medium lacking lysine, which is indicative of replacement of the SSQ1 gene deletion with the mutant copy of the gene. Ura– Lys2– diploids were sporulated and haploids obtained by dissection. When integration was directed to the SSQ1 locus, Ura+Lys+ transformants were sporulated and Ura+Lys+ haploids obtained by dissection. The presence of the ssq1(V472F) and ssq1(F462S) alleles was determined by sequencing the SSQ1 PCR products generated from chromosomal DNA isolated from the haploid strains. Integration of a mutant SSQ1 allele at the SSQ1 or URA3 locus resulted in similar phenotypes. To assess genetic interactions between ssq1(V472F) and isu1 mutants, the ssq1(V472F) strain was crossed to a Δisu1, Δisu2 strain carrying a wild-type copy of ISU1 on a URA3-marked plasmid. After sporulation and dissection, the haploid strain, ssq1(V472F) Δisu1, Δisu2 with pRS316-ISU1, was transformed with a TRP1-marked vector carrying mutant alleles of ISU1. The ability of the strains to grow in the absence of wild-type Isu1 was tested by streaking onto 5-FOA medium. Yeast were grown on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or on synthetic medium prepared as described (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B.

Mitochondrial Iron and Respiratory Enzyme Measurements—Mitochondrial iron levels were determined as described (18Voisine C. Cheng Y.C. Ohlson M. Schilke B. Hoff K. Beinert H. Marszalek J. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Activities of the respiratory enzymes were measured in isolated mitochondria. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was measured by using succinate as a substrate as described (24Watson K. Bertoli E. Griffiths D.E. Biochem.

Aconitase activity was measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance of the substrate isocitrate at 240 nm as described (26Li J. Kogan M. Knight S. Pain D. Dancis A. J. Biol.

The C terminus of SSQ1-(424–657), mutant V472F-(424–657), and F462S-(424–657) were cloned into the Escherichia coli plasmid pET3a. Wild-type and mutant protein expression was induced at 30 °C by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The E. coli cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm imidazole, EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 0.05% Triton X-100, and subjected to treatment in a French Press twice at 4 °C. Extracts were clarified by 12,000 × g centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The column was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A, two volumes of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 60 mm imidazole, 5 mm ATP), two volumes of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 60 mm imidazole), and two volumes of buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 60 mm imidazole). Bound proteins were eluted with buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 500 mm imidazole) and dialyzed against buffer F, (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol). Protein concentrations, determined using the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay system using bovine serum albumin as a standard, are expressed as the concentration of monomers. All wild-type His-tagged proteins used in this study were able to functionally replace untagged protein. Functionality was tested by constructing strains in which the only copy of a gene encoding a particular protein was a His-tagged version harbored on the low copy plasmid, pRS316 (20Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of such strains was indistinguishable from their wild-type derivatives in medium containing different carbon sources at different temperatures (data not shown). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—SPR 1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; WT, wild-type. studies were carried out at 25 °C with a Biacore 2000 instrument (Piscataway, NJ). Peptide P-PVK (LSLPPVKLHC) was cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip CM5 by thiol coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Purified protein Isu1 was randomly cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip CM5 by amine coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Binding experiments were conducted in buffer R (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20; Amersham Biosciences) containing 2 mm ATP or 2 mm ADP when indicated with the running buffer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. 60 μl of buffer R containing indicated purified proteins (Jac1, Ssq1, Ssq1(V472F)) was used for injections. Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Isu peptides LSLP-PVKLHC and LSLPAVKLHC were labeled at the C terminus with fluorescein to generate P-PVK-F* and P-AVK-F* as described (29Montgomery D. Morimoto R. Gierasch L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of either wild-type Ssq1-C terminus, V472F-C terminus, or F462S-C terminus proteins were incubated with P-PVK-F* and P-AVK-F* (10 nm) at 25 °C in buffer F for 45 min. After binding reached equilibrium, anisotropy measurements were made with the Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system (Panvera, Madison, WI) at 25 °C with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 535 nm. The data were fitted to one-site hyperbolic equation using Prism (GraphPad). Circular Dichroism and Partial Proteolysis—Measurements were performed on an Aviv 62A DS Circular Dichroism spectrometer from 196 to 260 nm with 5-s averaging times and 1-nm step size at 25 °C. The protein concentration was 5 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, in a quartz cuvette with 1-mm path length. Spectra were measured in millidegrees, corrected for buffer effects, and converted to mean residue ellipticity [Θ]. Proteolytic cleavage of Ssq1 and Ssq1(V472F) was carried out at 25 °C by incubating protein (4 μg) with trypsin (0.03 μg) in 40 μl of buffer consisting of 40 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.3 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, and 2 mm ATP. At specific times, samples were taken, and the reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. The samples were immediately boiled for 3 min. Other Techniques—Glycerol gradient centrifugation and steadystate ATPase assays were carried out as described previously (13Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the ATP assays release of radioactive inorganic phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP was measured. Control reactions lacking protein were included in all experiments. Phenotypic Effects of Alterations in the Substrate Binding Cleft of Ssq1—To investigate the functional importance of the interaction of Ssq1 with its protein substrate, Isu1, we introduced alterations in Ssq1 at residues analogous to those previously shown to be important for the ability of other Hsp70s to bind substrate proteins (29Montgomery D. Morimoto R. Gierasch L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 915-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct.

A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 32.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Valine 472 was replaced by phenylalanine, and phenylalanine 462 was replaced by serine to generate Ssq1(V472F) and Ssq1(F462S), respectively. Yeast cells expressing Ssq1(F462S) grew indistinguishably from SSQ1 deletion cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown). In addition, compared with wild-type mitochondria, levels of iron were 4-fold higher and the activity of the Fe-S cluster containing enzymes aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase was >10-fold lower in ssq1(F462S) mitochondria, similar to effects seen in Δssq1 mitochondria (Fig. 1, B and C). The similarity in phenotype caused by the complete lack of Ssq1 and a single amino acid alteration in the peptide binding cleft is consistent with the proposed importance of substrate binding ability of Ssq1 for its in vivo function. On the other hand, cells harboring ssq1(V472F) as the only copy of SSQ1 were able to grow nearly as well as wild-type cells (Fig. 1A, and results not shown). However, ssq1(V472F) mitochondria did accumulate 2-fold more iron than did wild-type mitochondria, indicating that iron homeostasis was affected to some degree (Fig. 1B). Moreover, activities of enzymes containing Fe-S centers were reduced in mitochondria isolated from ssq1(V472F): aconitase activity to 39% and succinate dehydrogenase to 54% of wild-type levels (Fig. 1C). The mild phenotypic effects of ssq1(V472F) were unexpected because homologous substitutions in DnaK and another mitochondrial Hsp70, Ssc1 (V436F and V459F, respectively) resulted in null phenotypes (30Mayer M.P. Schroder H. Rudiger S. Paal K. Laufen T. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Both Ssq1 (V472F) and (F462S) Have Reduced Affinity for Substrate—Because of the unexpected phenotypic differences between ssq1(V472F) and ssq1(F462S), we investigated the biochemical properties of the two mutant proteins. First, we utilized fluorescence anisotropy to measure substrate binding. The C-terminal 233-amino acid fragment, which contains the peptide binding domain, was utilized because of technical difficulties in obtaining large quantities of full-length Ssq1. The peptide LSLPPVKLHC labeled with fluorescein (designated P-PVK-F* throughout) was used as substrate. LSLP-PVKLHC encompasses amino acids 130–139 of the Isu1 sequence and contains the PVK tripeptide essential for interaction with Ssq1 (12Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Cheng S. Knieszner H. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29167-29174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Analysis of the C terminus of wild-type Ssq1 yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.81 ± 0.40 μm for P-PVK-F* (Fig. 2A). As a test of the specificity of this assay we utilized the fluorescein-labeled peptide LSPAVKLHC (P-AVK-F*), because Isu1 binding to Ssq1 was strongly reduced when residue Pro134 within the PVK motif of Isu1 was replaced by Ala (12Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Cheng S. Knieszner H. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29167-29174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Binding to P-AVK-F* peptide was significantly reduced compared with P-PVK-F*. In contrast, virtually no binding of either peptide was observed to Ssq1(F462S), indicating that this alteration within the peptide binding pocket severely interfered with substrate binding (Fig. 2A). The affinity of the C terminus of Ssq1(V472F) for P-PVK-F* peptide was also strongly reduced in comparison to the wild-type control, but changes in anisotropy were measurable. Because of practical limitations on protein concentrations, saturation was not attained. However, we estimated that the affinity of the C terminus of Ssq1(V472F) for P-PVK-F* was more than 10-fold reduced compared with wild-type. Moreover, the mutant C terminus displayed sequence specificity similar to the wild-type control, as binding of P-AVK-F* was significantly reduced in comparison to binding of P-PVK-F* (Fig. 2A). In addition, the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of wild-type and mutant Ssq1 C termini were indistinguishable, indicating that the differences in binding observed with the mutant proteins were not because of global misfolding (Fig. 2B). Because of the mild phenotypic effects of the V472F substitution, even though major effects on the ability of the C-terminal domain to bind peptide were observed we decided to assess substrate binding by full-length Ssq1. Because of difficulties in obtaining large amounts of full-length protein, we turned to SPR. When ADP-bound wild-type Ssq1 was passed over the surface of a sensor chip to which P-PVK peptide was immobilized, a strong increase in the response signal was observed, indicating efficient binding to P-PVK. However, consistent with known Hsp70 biochemical properties, the maximal signal obtained for Ssq1 in the ATP state was reduced by 80% (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the maximal signal measured when purified Ssq1(V472F) in the ADP state was passed over the chip with immobilized P-PVK was at least 10-fold lower than that detected for wild-type Ssq1 (Fig. 3A). A further 70% reduction of maximal response units was observed when Ssq1(V472F) was injected in the ATP state. To test whether binding of Ssq1 wild-type and mutant proteins to the immobilized P-PVK substrate was sequence-specific, increasing concentrations of peptide were passed over the chip together with Ssq1. As expected, binding of wild-type Ssq1 to immobilized P-PVK was strongly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3B, left panel), with 50% reduction in Ssq1 binding occurring at ∼24 μm. On the other hand, when P-AVK peptide was used as a competitor, less reduction was observed, with 60% binding observed in the presence of 300 μm P-AVK peptide. Similarly, when Ssq1(V472F) was tested, less reduction in the binding signal was observed in the presence of P-AVK than in the presence of P-PVK (Fig. 3B, right panel). Therefore, although the Ssq1(V472F) had reduced peptide binding affinity, the residual binding appears sequence-specific. To more closely mimic the normally occurring interaction between Ssq1 and Isu, we assessed the interaction of Ssq1(V472F) with full-length Isu1 protein, rather than peptide, using glycerol gradient centrifugation assays. Consistent with previous results (13Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), ∼20% of the Isu1 co-fractionated with wild-type Ssq1 following centrifugation in the presence of ADP (Fig. 3C, left panel). However, no co-migration of Isu1 was observed for Ssq1(V472F) (Fig. 3C, right panel), indicating that the mutant protein did not form a stable complex with the Isu1 substrate. We carried out limited proteolysis digestion as a means of comparing the global folding of full-length Ssq1 and Ssq1(V472F). Typical of an Hsp70, digestion of both mutant and wild-type protein proceeded over time, resulting in production of a stable 44-kDa fragment (Fig. 3D). Therefore, taken together, our results indicate that mutant Ssq1(V472F) was folded properly but had severely reduced affinity for both peptide and protein substrate. Reduced Affinity of Ssq1(V472F) for Substrate Binding Is Compensated in Vitro by High Concentrations of Both Jac1 and Isu1—Because a ssq1(V472F) strain grows nearly as well as a wild-type strain, we hypothesized that the reduced affinity of Ssq1(V472F) for substrate must be offset by other interactions among the components of the chaperone-substrate machinery, Isu, Jac1, and Ssq1. To test this idea, we assessed functional interaction between Isu1 and Ssq1 in vitro by determining the ability of Isu1 to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssq1. Efficient stimulation of the ATPase activity of Ssq1 requires the presence of the co-chaperone Jac1 and the nucleotide release factor Mge1, as well as the substrate protein Isu1. When equimolar (0.8 μm) concentrations of these proteins were used, severalfold stimulation of ATPase activity was observed (13Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Knieszner H. Walter W. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29719-29727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, no stimulation of Ssq1(V472F) ATPase activity was detected (data not shown), consistent with our observations that the mutant protein has a strongly reduced affinity for substrate To investigate whether Jac1 and/or Isu1 were capable of compensating for the lower affinity of Ssq1(V472F) for substrate, we examined the stimulation of the ATPase activity of Ssq1 and Ssq1(V472F) more thoroughly. Titration of Isu1 in the presence of 20-fold excess of Jac1 over Ssq1(V472F) resulted in 3-fold stimulation of ATPase activity (Fig. 4A), whereas under the same experimental conditions the ATPase activity of wild-type Ssq1 was stimulated 6-fold. Therefore, high concentrations of both Jac1 and Isu1 were able to partially compensate for the low affinity of Ssq1(V472F) for substrate. However, when wild-type Isu1 protein was replaced by mutant Isu1(P134A), no stimulation of Ssq1(V472A) ATPase was observed, whereas wild-type Ssq1 ATPase was stimulated 5-fold (Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with the observations that Ssq1(V472F) has a lower affinity for P-AVK than for P-PVK peptide (Figs. 2A and 3B). This reduction was not unique to a single amino acid alteration, because a similar reduction in the stimulation of ATPase was observed for the combination of Ssq1(V472F) and an mutant Isu1 protein having another alteration within the PVK recognition motif, Isu1(V135A) (Fig. 4A). When the reverse titration was performed using Ssq1 or Ssq1(V472F), with Jac1 being titrated in the presence of excess Isu1, similar stimulation of ATPase activity was seen as when Isu1 was titrated (Fig. 4B). Because in both titration experiments a hyperbolic relationship between protein concentrations and activation of ATPase was observed, the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. This fitting allowed calculation of the concentration of proteins giving half-maximal stimulation of the ATPase activity (C0.5), a parameter that can be taken as an approximate measure of Isu1 and Jac1 affinity for Ssq1. For wild-type Ssq1, C0.5 values for Isu1 (0.36 ± 0.04 μm) and Jac1 (0.087 ± 0.021 μm) differed by 4-fold, indicating that both proteins could interact independently with Ssq1. In contrast, Ssq1(V472F) C0.5 values determined for Isu1 (0.99 ± 0.18 μm) and Jac1 (0.91 ± 0.12 μm) were very similar. This similarity suggests that Jac1 and Isu1 do not bind to Ssq1(V472F) independently but instead that Jac1 binds to Isu1 first and then the Jac1-Isu1 complex interacts with Ssq1(V472F) as a single entity (12Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Cheng S. Knieszner H. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29167-29174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To test whether the J-domain of Jac1 is important in compensating for the low affinity of Ssq1(V472F) for Isu1 substrate, we used a Jac1 mutant in which three essential amino acids of the J-domain (HPD) were replaced by three alanine residues. Consistent with previous results (12Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Cheng S. Knieszner H. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29167-29174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) such a mutant protein Jac1(AAA), when present in excess, was able to stimulate Ssq1 ATPase activity 3-fold (Fig. 4C). However, when Ssq1(V472F) was tested, no stimulation of ATPase activity was observed in the presence of Jac1(AAA). Thus, compensation of the low affinity of Ssq1(V472F) for substrate requires Jac1 with a fully functional J-domain. We also tested the affinity of Jac1 for Ssq1(V472F) by assessing its ability to stimulate ATPase activity in the absence of Isu1. When in 50-fold excess, Jac1 stimulated wild-type and mutant Ssq1 similarly, 4.1- and 3.9-fold, respectively. We conclude that the V472F alteration does not affect the affinity of Jac1 for Ssq1. Up-regulation of Isu1 in ssq1(V472F)—Because the results of in vitro assays indicated that an increase in the concentration of Isu1 and Jac1 enhanced the ATPase stimulation of Ssq1(V472F), we asked whether such a mechanism might function in vivo. The levels of Jac1 and Isu1 were compared in extracts of mitochondria derived from wild-type and ssq1(V472F) cells. The amount of Jac1 in mitochondria from these strains was similar (Fig. 4D). However, the levels of Isu1 were ∼10-fold higher in both ssq1(V472F) and Δssq1 cells compared with wild-type cells. Synthetic Growth Phenotype of Cells Harboring ssq1(V472F) and Isu1 Mutations Encoding Alterations in the PVK Motif—Because biochemical analyses described above revealed enhancement of defects in ATPase stimulation when Ssq1(V472F) was combined with either Isu1(V135A) or Isu1(P134A) (Fig. 4A), we tested whether phenotypic enhancement would occur in vivo when these mutant proteins were present in the same cell. ssq1(V472F) has no growth defect (Figs. 1A and 5A). We tested the effect in vivo of combining either isu1(P134A), which causes slow growth, or isu1(V135A), which causes no phenotypic effect (12Dutkiewicz R. Schilke B. Cheng S. Knieszner H. Craig E.A. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29167-29174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), with ssq1(V472F). Combination of either isu1(P134A) or isu1(V135A) with ssq1(V472F) resulted in inviability (Fig. 5A). The synthetic lethal interaction between ssq1(V472F) and isu1(V135A) is particularly striking because of the very mild phenotypic effects of the individual mutations. However, because purified Isu1(V135A), even at high concentrations, did not significantly stimulate Ssq1 ATPase in the presence of Ssq1(V472F) mutant (Fig. 4A), the in vivo and in vitro results correlate well. The null phenotype of a ssq1 mutant encoding a single amino acid alteration in the predicted substrate binding cleft of Ssq1 underscores the importance of substrate binding in the physiological function of this Hsp70. This result is not surprising, as interaction with substrate proteins is fundamental to molecular chaperone function (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 2Mayer M.P. Brehmer D. Gassler C.S. Bukau B. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2002; 59: 1-44Google Scholar). However, the fact that a mutation causing greater than a 10-fold decrease in affinity for Isu substrate resulted in only mild phenotypic affects was surprising. What is behind the capacity for this chaperone machinery to tolerate so well a decrease in affinity for its substrate? First, we think the fact that Ssq1 and Jac1 appear to have only a single substrate protein, Isu, has allowed evolution of a system that is very robust. If an Hsp70 has only a single, or very few, substrates the Hsp70-substrate interaction can be highly specific. This high degree of selectivity likely prevents unproductive interactions with other proteins in the substrate binding cleft. On the other hand, general Hsp70 chaperones such as mitochondrial Ssc1 and bacterial DnaK, which interact with a wide variety of exposed hydrophobic sequences of partially unfolded proteins, must have relatively low sequence selectivity (1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar, 2Mayer M.P. Brehmer D. Gassler C.S. Bukau B. Adv. Prot. Chem. 2002; 59: 1-44Google Scholar). Similar arguments can be made for the J-protein partner of Ssq1, Jac1, as no evidence exists for substrates other than Isu1. Therefore, together the highly specific interactions of Jac1-Isu1 and Ssq1-Isu1 may explain the ability of this chaperone system to withstand a substantial decreased ability of Ssq1 to interact with its substrate. Moreover, very similar saturation curves obtained for the ability of Jac1 and Isu1 to stimulate the ATPase activity of Ssq1(V472F) indicate that the Jac1-Isu1 complex interacts with mutant Ssq1(V472F) as a single entity. Interaction as a complex would provide necessary orchestration of two critical interactions: Isu1 with the peptide binding domain and the J-domain of Jac1 with the ATPase domain. Such synchronization would likely increase the chance of productive substrate binding even when substrate affinity is reduced, as is the case with Ssq1(V472F). Although we propose that mutant Ssq1(V472F) interacts predominately with the Jac1-Isu1 complex, we do not mean to imply that normally this is the predominant mode of initiation of the Ssq1 ATPase cycle. Our analysis of interaction of wild-type Ssq1 with wild-type Isu1 indicates that independent interaction of Jac1 and substrate with Ssq1 can initiate ATP hydrolysis as Jac1 and Isu1 affinities for Ssq1, calculated from reverse titration experiments, differ by at least 4-fold. Indeed, taken together, our results support the idea that interactions among components of the Ssq1 system are highly flexible. Either Jac1 or Ssq1 could first interact with Isu1, depending on the relative rate of complex formation, binding affinities, and effective concentrations of the individual components. Flexibility of the timing of interactions among components of the Hsp70 chaperone system is not unique to the specialized Ssq1 chaperone system, as independent interactions of DnaK with protein substrate and DnaJ has been demonstrated (7Han W. Christen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19038-19043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the case of general Hsp70 systems, however, such flexibility of interaction might work against the robustness of the system, as it would increase chances for competition between different components able to interact with a particular Hsp70. A second reason that the Fe-S cluster chaperone machinery can tolerate decreases in affinity for its substrate Isu1 is that a mechanism exists for up-regulation of Isu1. The higher concentration of Isu1 found in mitochondria of ssq1(V472F) may be sufficient to overcome the decreased affinity for Isu1 caused by the alteration in the peptide binding cleft. Such an explanation is supported by the in vitro data and bolsters the idea that the ATPase cycle is a rate-limiting step in the biogenesis of Fe-S-containing proteins and iron homeostasis. However, elucidation of the exact role of molecular chaperones in this process, be it insertion of a cluster in the Isu1 scaffold or transfer of the cluster to recipient proteins (33Mansy S.S. Cowan J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Lill R. Muhlenhoff U. Trends Biochem.

The maximum leptin diurnal variation (acrophase) decreased (10.27+/-1.70 vs. 22.60+/-2.79 ng x ml(-1); P=0.001), while its pulsatility index (PI) increased (1.084+/-0.005 vs. 1.050+/-0.004 ng x ml(-1) x min(-1); P=0.02) after BPD. Plasma GH acrophase increased (P=0.0001) from 0.91+/-0.20 to 4.58+/-0.80 microg x l(-1) x min(-1) after BPD as well as GH PI (1.70+/-0.13 vs. 1.20+/-0.04 microg x l(-1) x min(-1); P=0.024). Whole-body glucose uptake (M), assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, almost doubled after BPD (from 0.274+/-0.022 to 0.573+/-0.027 mmol x kgFFM(-1) x min(-1); P<0.0001), while 24 h lipid oxidation was significantly (P<0.0001) reduced (131.94+/-35.58 vs. 44.56+/-15.10 g). However, the average lipid oxidation was 97.2+/-3.1% (P<0.01) of the metabolizable lipid intake after the bariatric operation, while it was 69.2+/-8.5% before. After the operation, skeletal muscle ACC2 mRNA decreased (P<0.0001) from 452.82+/-76.35 to 182.45+/-40.69% of cyclophilin mRNA as did the malonyl-CoA (from 0.28+/-0.02 to 0.16+/-0.01 nmol x g(-1); P<0.0001). Leptin changes negatively correlated with M changes (R2=0.69, P<0.001). In a stepwise regression (R2=0.87, P=0.0055), only changes in 24 h free fatty acids (B=0.105+/-0.018, P=0.002) and glucose/insulin ratio (B=0.247+/-0.081, P=0.029) were the best predictors of leptin variations. In conclusion, the reversion of insulin resistance after BPD might allow reversal of leptin resistance, restoration of leptin pulsatility, and consequent inhibition of ACC2 mRNA expression, translating to a reduced synthesis of malonyl-CoA, which, in turn, results in increased fatty acid oxidation. Finally, since leptin inhibits GH secretion, a reduction of circulating leptin levels might have produced an increase in GH secretion, as observed in our series."

To identify signaling intermediates involved in chemoattractant receptor-induced integrin activation, we analyzed the ability of LFA-1 integrin to associate with members of Src tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3Kinase (PI 3K) families following fMLP stimulation of a lymphoid T cell line stably expressing the fMLP receptor (fPR). fMLP-induced cell activation resulted in a rapid increase of integrin-associated PI 3Kinase activity in G protein and Src kinase dependent manner. We show, upon fMLP-stimulation, a rapid and transient association of the Src tyrosine kinase Fyn with LFA-1. Also, by transiently expressing mutant forms of this kinase, we demonstrated that Fyn is required for the integrin associated PI 3K activity. Furthermore, overexpression of the mutant form of Fyn resulted in a significant impairment of fMLP-induced cell migration through ICAM-1-coated filters, while ICAM-1 independent migration was not affected. Our observations indicate that chemoattractant receptor engagement induces Fyn-dependent PI 3K activation in association with LFA-1 and suggests that Fyn is necessary to initiate and/or to regulate chemoattractant-mediated LFA-1 activation to promote directional migration."
https://openalex.org/W1964041180,"Scattered groups of these ancient fish may all stem from a single remote population. The presumed home of African coelacanths, the ‘living fossil’ fish, is in the Comoros archipelago off Madagascar. Occasional sightings thousands of miles away, off South Africa, Tanzania and Kenya, raised the possibility of separate populations, even subspecies. But now a genetic study suggests that these disparate populations are all related to the Comoros fish. Coelacanths were discovered in the Comoros archipelago to the northwest of Madagascar in 1952. Since then, these rare, ancient fish have been found to the south off Mozambique, Madagascar and South Africa, and to the north off Kenya and Tanzania — but it was unclear whether these are separate populations or even subspecies. Here we show that the genetic variation between individuals from these different locations is unexpectedly low. Combined with earlier results from submersible and oceanographic observations1,2, our findings indicate that a separate African metapopulation is unlikely to have existed and that locations distant from the Comoros were probably inhabited relatively recently by either dead-end drifters or founders that originated in the Comoros."

Notch signaling occurs after binding of a TM ligand. In mammals, these ligands belong to the Delta or Jagged family. The binding of the ligand causes a series of events that lead to the release of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor (ICv). This intracellular domain then translocates to the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional activation of target genes. The complete mechanism allowing signal transmission through Notch receptors remains unclear. However, it is now widely accepted that two sequential proteolysis events are required after ligand binding. In mammals, the Notch receptor is first cleaved in its ectodomain by the TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) (1.Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israël A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) or possibly by another metalloprotease such as ADAM10 (2.Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lubke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Notch receptor is then cleaved in its TM domain by γ-secretase. Notch belongs to a family of proteins, such as APP, Delta, ErbB-4, and N-cadherin, which undergo TM cleavage (3.Landman N. Kim T.-W. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2004; 15: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). At least four proteins, presenilin (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin (Nct), Pen-2, and Aph-1, make up γ-secretase, forming a high molecular weight complex. The catalytic subunit of the complex is probably PS, but all four proteins are necessary for the maturation and the overall catalytic activity of γ-secretase (4.De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). APP, the other canonical γ-secretase substrate, can be cleaved at various sites within its TM domain (respectively called γ40, γ42, and ϵ), giving rise to Aβ40, Aβ42, or/and APP intracellular domain. The balance between these different cleavage products appears to be crucial, since changes in this equilibrium can contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease. These cleavages depend on a PS-containing complex, and mutations in PS can change the ratio between the different products. However, the parameters regulating the ratio between these events remains unknown (5.Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Other γ-secretase substrates, such as Notch, APLP1, or APLP2, also undergo multiple cleavages (6.Eggert S. Paliga K. Soba P.

Furthermore, some mutations affecting Nct strongly modulate γ-secretase activity on APP, but not on Notch (7.Chen F. Yu G. Arawaka S. Nishimura M. Kawarai T. Yu H. Tandon A. Supala A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Milman P. Sato C. Yu C. Janus C. Lee J. Song L. Zhang L. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and a number of drugs have been described as differentially inhibiting γ-secretase activity on Notch and APP (8.Petit A. Bihel F. da Costa C.A. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that several enzymes able to discriminate between various substrates and/or various cleavage sites may exist, grouped under the generic name of γ-secretase. The core complex of these enzymes may contain the four identified proteins, but other minor factors or specific modifications of these proteins could generate the diversity of γ-secretase activity. Although coimmunoprecipitation experiments allowed the purification and identification of Nct (9.Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T.

Therefore, we have used a genetic system allowing the identification of any event or component needed for γ-secretase activity, including proteins not part of the complex but regulating its activity. Here we describe the basis of this screening method. Following mutagenesis, we selected cells that no longer cleave a constitutively active form of Notch at the γ-secretase site.

The cell preparations were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem), and images were acquired using a confocal laser imaging system (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted from 106 AD6, clone 1, and clone 2 cells using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). We used the Superscript™ first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR to generate the cDNA (Invitrogen). PCR products were sequenced using the following primers: PS1 (5′-ACA GAG ATA CCT GCA CC-3′ and 5′-GAG AGG GAA GAG ACA C-3′), Nct (5′-ATG GCT ACG GCT AGG G-3′, 5′-CCA GAG CAC CTT CAG C-3′, and 5′-CGA CTT ACG TTG TGC AG-3′), Aph-1 (5′-ATT ATC CTG CTC CAT ACC-3′), and Pen-2 (5′-CTA TGA ACT TAG AGC GGG-3′). Chromatogram profiles were manually checked to determine whether a wild type and mutant allele were coexpressed. Genomic DNA was extracted from 106 cells with the QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen). The two mutated regions were genotyped by PCR using primers for clone 1 (5′-CCA ACA AGA CAG AGC GGC and 3′-CTA CGT GGG CCG AGA GC) and clone 2 (5′-CAG TGG AGA GGA AGA TC and 3′-GAT TTG TGT TTG TGG CC). Chromatogram profiles were manually checked to detect any allelic polymorphism. Total RNA was isolated from 107 AD6, clone 1, and clone 2 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. We separated 8 μg of total RNAs on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred them to Hybond-N+ membrane (Ambion), and hybridized them in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion) with a 32P-labeled DNA probe (Nct cDNA from nucleotide +341 to nucleotide +768) by incubation at 42 °C overnight. The membrane was washed twice with 0.1% SDS, 2× SSC buffer by incubation at 42 °C for 5 min, twice with 0.1% SDS, 0.1× SSC buffer by incubation at 42 °C for 5 min, and visualized by autoradiography. We used the random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 32P-labeling. AD6, clone 1, and clone 2 cells grown on 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 10 μg of total DNA. The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, washed in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After 20 min on ice, the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were carried out as described earlier (1.Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israël A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). AD6, clone 1, and clone 2 cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as described above. Immunoprecipitations were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl with Nct antibodies. Samples were resuspended in glycoprotein denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs), and endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) and N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) digestion were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 7% acrylamide gels and immunoblotted with Nct antibodies. Genetic Screening to Select Mutants of γ-Secretase Activity Acting on Notch—The γ-secretase-dependent, Notch-delivered signal is very labile. Therefore, we decided to transform it into an easily detectable, inducible and stable signal. We avoided the problem of the signal elicited by soluble or membrane-bound ligands being transient by using the Notch ΔE protein. This fragment of Notch1 lacks most of its extracellular domain but contains the signal peptide fused to the 21 amino acids N-terminal to the TM domain, the TM domain, and the intracellular domain. The ΔE protein is very similar to the TNF-α converting enzyme-processing product generated after ligand binding to Notch1. It is constitutively cleaved by γ-secretase, releasing the transcriptionally active nuclear form of Notch, ICv. Furthermore, we have recently shown (1.Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israël A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 14.Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israel A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) that 60 amino acids from the intracellular part of Notch are enough to allow the ΔE-like molecule to be processed by γ-secretase (i.e. to undergo all steps that occur between TNF-α converting enzyme cleavage and γ-secretase cleavage, such as ubiquitination, endocytosis, or other as yet unknown events). Therefore, such a molecule should allow us to identify mutations that affect any step occurring before γ-secretase cleavage. As we planned to complement the mutants cells with a retroviral library, we chose rodent diploid cells, Rat-1, as a host (15.Topp W.C. Virology. 1981; 113: 408Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These cells have been successfully used for this type of approach (16.Chinanonwait N. Miura H. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We established a cell line expressing a chimeric molecule containing a ΔE-like fragment of Notch1 (signal peptide plus 21 amino acids N-terminal to the plasma membrane plus TM domain plus 60 N-terminal amino acids of the intracellular part of Notch1; see Fig. 1), fused to a vesicular stomatitis virus epitope, the Cre recombinase, and a modified hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER-T2; mutated to respond only to 4-hydroxytamoxifen) (11.Feil R. Wagner J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 752-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 17.Indra A.K. Warot X. Brocard J. Bornert J.M. Xiao J.H. Chambon P. Metzger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4324-4327Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The delivery of Cre recombinase depends on any event, including γ-secretase processing, that releases ICv from the membrane, and then the nuclear activity of the Cre-ER-T2 chimera depends on the presence of tamoxifen. The reporter construct for the recombinase activity consists of an antibiotic resistance gene (hygromycin) driven by a strong promoter. Its transcription and translation are interrupted by the introduction, between the promoter and the gene, of two loxP sites separated by a transcription/translation STOP sequence and an SV40 enhancer-driven neomycin resistance gene in the reverse orientation (see Fig. 1B). Non-tamoxifen-treated wild-type cells do not display recombination between the two loxP sites and are resistant to neomycin and sensitive to hygromycin. After tamoxifen treatment, the activated Cre recombinase allows excision of the STOP sequence and the neomycin resistance gene, allowing the hygromycin resistance gene to be expressed. If γ-secretase is inactivated following mutagenesis, the cells will no longer be sensitive to neomycin and resistant to hygromycin, even in the presence of tamoxifen. Complementation of the defect will restore tamoxifen-dependent sensitivity to neomycin and resistance to hygromycin. Rat-1 cells stably expressing our effector and reporter constructs described above are called AD6. ICR191 Treatment Generates Mutant AD6 Cells Affected in γ-Secretase Activity—We exposed AD6 cells to several cycles of mutagenesis with the drug ICR191. This is a frameshift mutagen that preferentially causes single bp additions in stretches of G nucleotides (18.Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We carried out six rounds of mutagenesis. In these conditions, mutants can be isolated at a much higher frequency (more than 30 times higher) than after one cycle of mutagenesis (19.McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I. Stark G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We first selected clones growing on neomycin and tamoxifen-containing medium and then transiently transfected them with the ΔE expression vector. Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-Myc and V1744 antibodies allowed us to identify cells deficient in γ-secretase activity. We used anti-Myc antibodies as a control, since they recognize all the forms derived from ΔE, irrespective of their cleavage status or subcellular location. The V1744 antibodies specifically recognized the γ-secretase cleavage product, ICv (14.Gupta-Rossi N. Six E. LeBail O. Logeat F. Chastagner P. Olry A. Israel A. Brou C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, V1744 nuclear staining is a specific and sensitive assay that allows us to visualize γ-secretase activity acting on Notch. Some clones (e.g. clone 1 and clone 2 in Fig. 2) displayed a strictly non-nuclear localization of ΔE-derived products, as detected with anti-Myc antibody, and no labeling with the V1744 antibody. The other G418-resistant clones exhibited a nuclear staining with both antibodies (data not shown). Other components of the system, such as the Cre recombinase, the ER-T2 fragment, or the loxP sequences, were probably affected in these γ-secretase-positive clones. Of the 186 clones obtained after mutagenesis and selection, only 26 were γ-secretase-deficient. We chose two of them, clone 1 and clone 2, for further analysis. We investigated whether γ-secretase processing of APP was also impaired. Before TM cleavage, APP can be alternatively cleaved in its ectodomain at two different sites. The first cleavage, which involves β-secretase, generates a transmembrane β-stub fragment, whereas the second cleavage involves α-secretase and generates an α-stub fragment. These products are then direct targets of γ-secretase. We transiently expressed a β-stub fragment fused to six Myc epitopes (called C100) in AD6 cells and in clone 1 and clone 2 (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of AD6 cell lysates (Fig. 2B, lane 1) showed the C100 protein, a faster migrating fragment resulting from α-secretase processing of the C100 protein, and a third fragment corresponding to the intracellular domain of the C100 protein (indicated as AICD). In clone 1 and clone 2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3), we did not detect APP intracellular domain but detected the accumulation of the α-stub fragment. These data suggested that γ-secretase processing of APP was also impaired in these clones. Two Independent Mutants Are Complemented by Nct—The mutant phenotype of clone 1 and clone 2 may be due to loss of activity of one or more of the four known components of the PS complex or of an unknown protein necessary for γ-secretase activity. We transiently cotransfected Nct, Aph-1, PS1, or Pen-2 with a ΔE expression vector and assayed the γ-secretase activity by immunofluorescence. When Aph-1, PS1, or Pen-2 expression vectors were cotransfected, the ΔE-derived forms displayed no nuclear localization by anti-Myc antibodies and no staining with V1744 antibodies (see Fig. 2A, panels C for PS1; data not shown). However, after the co-expression of Nct in clones 1 and 2, ΔE-derived forms displayed nuclear immunostaining by V1744 antibodies in most transfected cells (Fig. 2A, panels B). Thus, Nct expression restored ΔE cleavage at the γ-secretase site, suggesting either a mutation in the Nct gene itself or a mutation in a gene encoding a protein acting upstream of Nct and necessary for Nct activity. Western blot analysis of AD6 cell lysates using an antibody raised against the N terminus of Nct revealed two bands with apparent molecular masses of about 130 and about 110 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In clone 1, we detected no immunoreactive band (Fig. 3A, lane 2), whereas we detected a single product of about 110 kDa in clone 2 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Furthermore, no soluble form was detected in the medium of the three cell lines (data not shown). The 110-kDa migrating form seen in clone 2-derived extracts was possibly an immature, not fully glycosylated Nct or a shorter Nct. Therefore, we examined the susceptibility of these Nct proteins to deglycosidase treatment. After endoglycosidase H digestion of AD6 Nct immunoprecipitates, Western blot analysis showed that two bands were replaced by two faster migrating ones, indicating that both forms contained high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 3B, lane 1). After removal of all N-linked oligosaccharide chains by N-glycosidase F digestion, Western blot analysis showed only one single species (Fig. 3B, lane 2, indicated as deglyc). The endoglycosidase H treatment only partially deglycosylates the mature Nct (upper band in Fig. 3B, lane 1), indicating that the mature Nct is modified by both endoglycosidase H-sensitive and endoglycosidase H-resistant N-linked oligosaccharides. The immature and partially glycosylated Nct contains only endoglycosidase H-sensitive N-linked oligosaccharides, confirming that it is only modified by high mannose oligosaccharides in the ER and does not reach the Golgi apparatus, where subsequent complex glycosylations occur. Endoglycosidase H or N-glycosidase F digestion of clone 2 Nct-immunoprecipitates similarly reduced their apparent molecular mass (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). Therefore, the Nct protein present in clone 2, being endoglycosidase H-sensitive and only modified by high mannose oligosaccharides in the ER, is similar to the immature Nct. The apparent molecular mass of deglycosylated AD6 and clone 2 Nct were identical. This indicated that clone 2 does not express a truncated Nct protein. We detected Nct mRNA in AD6 and clone 2 by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). However, we did not detect Nct mRNA in clone 1 (Fig. 3C, lane 2), although it could be amplified by RT-PCR in the three cell lines (data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the amount of Nct mRNA was 5 times lower in clone 1 than in AD6 cells (data not shown). Thus, the two clones exhibited different characteristics, clone 1 lacking the Nct protein and clone 2 having a defect in Nct protein maturation. Clones 1 and 2 Carry Different Mutations—The defects in Nct expression and maturation observed in clones 1 and 2 may be due to mutations in the gene encoding Nct itself and/or other γ-secretase complex proteins acting upstream of Nct in the formation of the complex. Therefore, we sequenced the PS1, PS2, Aph-1, Pen-2, and Nct cDNAs from RT-PCR of AD6, clone 1, and clone 2. We found Nct was mutated in both clones, whereas the other cDNAs were not. We identified an insertion of a C at position 1891 in the Nct cDNA in clone 1, leading to a frameshift (Fig. 4) and a new STOP codon 10 nucleotides downstream from the mutation. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay rules (20.Nagy E. Maquat L.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 198-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) state that a truncated protein would be produced only if a new STOP codon was located downstream from the last exon-exon junction or within 50-55 nucleotides upstream from this junction. If a new STOP codon is located more than 50-55 nucleotides upstream from the last exon-exon junction, as in this case, mRNA is mostly eliminated and not translated. Therefore, the Nct mRNA in clone 1 is likely to be transcribed but rapidly degraded. We identified a missense mutation at position 178 in the Nct cDNA in clone 2 that led to the replacement of a glycine by a leucine at position 60 (GGC to CTC, as indicated in Fig. 4). We investigated whether this mutation accounted for the mutant phenotype of the cell line. We inserted the cDNA encoding this mutant protein (named G60L) and its wild-type counterpart into an expression vector in frame with a C-terminal HA tag. We verified that the two sequences were strictly i"
