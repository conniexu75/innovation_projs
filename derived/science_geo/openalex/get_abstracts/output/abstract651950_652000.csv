https://openalex.org/W3020909574,"Intestinal organoids as an infection model Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes an influenza-like disease with a respiratory transmission route; however, patients often present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Moreover, the virus has been detected in anal swabs, and cells in the inner-gut lining express the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to gain entry to cells. Lamers et al. used human intestinal organoids, a “mini-gut” cultured in a dish, to demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 readily replicates in an abundant cell type in the gut lining—the enterocyte—resulting in the production of large amounts of infective virus particles in the intestine. This work demonstrates that intestinal organoids can serve as a model to understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and infectivity in the gut. Science , this issue p. 50"

Yin et al. focused on the viral polymerase essential for replicating viral RNA. They determined a structure of the polymerase bound to RNA and to the drug remdesivir. Remdesivir mimics an RNA nucleotide building block and is covalently linked to the replicating RNA, which blocks further synthesis of RNA. The structure provides a template for designing improved therapeutics against the viral polymerase. Science , this issue p. 1499"
https://openalex.org/W2913136103,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promise in hematologic malignancies, but its application to solid tumors has been challenging1-4. Given the unique effector functions of macrophages and their capacity to penetrate tumors5, we genetically engineered human macrophages with CARs to direct their phagocytic activity against tumors. We found that a chimeric adenoviral vector overcame the inherent resistance of primary human macrophages to genetic manipulation and imparted a sustained pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype. CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms) demonstrated antigen-specific phagocytosis and tumor clearance in vitro. In two solid tumor xenograft mouse models, a single infusion of human CAR-Ms decreased tumor burden and prolonged overall survival. Characterization of CAR-M activity showed that CAR-Ms expressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, converted bystander M2 macrophages to M1, upregulated antigen presentation machinery, recruited and presented antigen to T cells and resisted the effects of immunosuppressive cytokines. In humanized mouse models, CAR-Ms were further shown to induce a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment and boost anti-tumor T cell activity."
https://openalex.org/W3015914307,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was first reported in central China in December 2019. Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA-positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China, we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain because of low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size, and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required, because the number of cases imported from other countries has increased."
https://openalex.org/W3021032174,"Cells sense elevated temperatures and mount an adaptive heat shock response that involves changes in gene expression, but the underlying mechanisms, particularly on the level of translation, remain unknown. Here we report that, in budding yeast, the essential translation initiation factor Ded1p undergoes heat-induced phase separation into gel-like condensates. Using ribosome profiling and an in vitro translation assay, we reveal that condensate formation inactivates Ded1p and represses translation of housekeeping mRNAs while promoting translation of stress mRNAs. Testing a variant of Ded1p with altered phase behavior as well as Ded1p homologs from diverse species, we demonstrate that Ded1p condensation is adaptive and fine-tuned to the maximum growth temperature of the respective organism. We conclude that Ded1p condensation is an integral part of an extended heat shock response that selectively represses translation of housekeeping mRNAs to promote survival under conditions of severe heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W3022120179,"As of April 20, 2020, over time, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 157 970 deaths out of 2 319 066 confirmed cases, at a Case Fatality Rate of ~6.8%. With the pandemic rapidly spreading, and health delivery systems being overwhelmed, it is imperative that safe and effective pharmacotherapeutic strategies are rapidly explored to improve survival. In this paper, we use established and emerging evidence to propose a testable hypothesis that, a vicious positive feedback loop of des-Arg(9)-bradykinin- and bradykinin-mediated inflammation → injury → inflammation, likely precipitates life threatening respiratory complications in COVID-19. Through our hypothesis, we make the prediction that the FDA-approved molecule, icatibant, might be able to interrupt this feedback loop and, thereby, improve the clinical outcomes. This hypothesis could lead to basic, translational, and clinical studies aimed at reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality."

We recorded populations of dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) neurons across days to understand how sensory representations are modified by experience. We found representations of odors in DG GCs that required synaptic input from the LEC. Odor classification accuracy in DG GCs correlated with future behavioral discrimination. In associative learning, DG GCs, more so than LEC neurons, changed their responses to odor stimuli, increasing the distance in neural representations between stimuli, responding more to the conditioned and less to the unconditioned odorant. Thus, with learning, DG GCs amplify the decodability of cortical representations of important stimuli, which may facilitate information storage to guide behavior.

Thus, with learning, DG GCs amplify the decodability of cortical representations of important stimuli, which may facilitate information storage to guide behavior. Animals have a cognitive map of their surroundings that is constantly updated to optimize behavior (McNaughton et al., 2006McNaughton B.L. Battaglia F.P. Jensen O. Moser E.I. Moser M.-B.

Hippocampus, space, and memory.Behav. Brain Sci. 1979; 2: 313-322Crossref Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Any given element of their surroundings may not carry immediate meaning, but with reinforcement, animals will learn to approach or avoid cues that predict salient outcomes and ignore others. One way that neural populations may implement this form of encoding is by increasing the distance between neural representations of cues through the process of learning, effectively “separating” a salient from a non-salient stimulus. One potential locus of this computation may be the hippocampus (HPC), which not only contributes to spatial navigation and memory (Eichenbaum et al., 2007Eichenbaum H. Yonelinas A.P. Ranganath C.

However, how experience can impact the representations of non-spatial stimuli in the HPC has remained largely unexplored. Here, we turned to olfactory stimuli to investigate how dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) encode and separate incoming sensory information. Early anatomists noted the extensive connectivity and proximate location of the hippocampus with other parts of the olfactory system and accordingly included the hippocampus as a central node in the rhinencephalon or “nose brain” (Broca, 1878Broca P.

Müller-Schwarze D. Boston M.A. Chemical Signals in Vertebrates 6. Springer, 1992: 67-77Crossref Google Scholar). Subsequent electrophysiological studies revealed that odorants were uniquely capable as sensory stimuli in eliciting a burst of activity in the DG; however, technical constraints limited a more complete understanding of how the DG encodes and processes this information (Vanderwolf, 1992Vanderwolf C.H.

Anatomical studies suggest odor-related information is transmitted to the DG via inputs from the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) (Eichenbaum et al., 2007Eichenbaum H. Yonelinas A.P. Ranganath C.

In addition, the DG has been hypothesized to disambiguate cortical representation of sensory stimuli, so as to create less or non-overlapping outputs to the downstream CA3 subfield of the HPC (Aimone et al., 2011Aimone J.B.

However, how learning impacts this process, and whether olfactory representations are separated at the level of DG neural activity, remains largely unknown. In order to understand how the DG classifies cortical representations of salient olfactory stimuli, we performed in vivo chronic two-photon imaging of the LEC and DG. We investigated (1) how DG GCs and LEC neurons represent olfactory stimuli, (2) whether LEC is the main input for olfactory information to DG, and (3) how DG GCs and LEC neurons change their responses with learning. We found that odor identity is robustly represented in the DG and that the degree to which the DG classified odorants was directly related to discrimination of these cues during context recall. Odors were more accurately classified in populations of cells within the DG than LEC, and with learning, the DG GCs flexibly changed their representations of odor stimuli more so than LEC neurons, increasing the distance in neural representation between stimuli and responding more to the conditioned odorant. These data reveal that DG GCs may be a part of an extended network that represents the olfactory world and are involved in learning the associations between olfactory stimuli and behaviorally relevant outcomes. To determine whether odor information is represented in the DG, we performed chronic high-resolution, two-photon calcium imaging of DG GCs in awake, head-fixed mice (Danielson et al., 2016Danielson N.B. Kaifosh P. Zaremba J.D. Lovett-Barron M. Tsai J. Denny C.A. Balough E.M. Goldberg A.R. Drew L.J. Hen R. et al.Distinct contribution of adult-born hippocampal granule cells to context encoding.Neuron. 2016; 90: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We visualized GC activity by injecting an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing GCaMP6f into the DG and imaged fields of view (FOVs) within the DG granule cell layer (GCL) (Figures 1A and 1B ; Video S1). To characterize baseline responses to odorants, mice were imaged during delivery of a panel of diverse monomolecular odorants (Figure 1A). Olfactory stimuli evoked robust responses in a fraction of GCs (Figures 1C, S1D, S1G, S2B, and S2C) that remained stable across multiple trials (Figure 1D). As is also the case for odor-evoked responses in upstream piriform cortex (Roland et al., 2017Roland B. Deneux T. Franks K.M. Bathellier B. Fleischmann A.

LEC Imaging Field of View, Related to Figure 2 We next sought to compare odor responses in LEC neurons, DG GCs, and DG GCs in which input from LEC was inhibited. In our six-odor delivery design, we imaged DG GCs, LEC neurons, and DG GCs from mice in which we silenced LEC-DG synaptic transmission bilaterally using tetanus toxin light chain (LEC-DG TeLC) (see STAR Methods; Figures 3A and S1C). The identity of presented odorants could be accurately decoded using linear decoders (Bishop, 2006Bishop C. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. Springer-Verlag New York, 2006Google Scholar) from the population activity of DG GCs and LEC neurons, but not from LEC-DG TeLC mice (Figures 3B, 3C, and S2D–S2F; see STAR Methods), suggesting the LEC is the major source of odor input to the DG. By comparing decoding accuracies in LEC and DG, we found that a decoder trained on DG GC data could more accurately classify odor identity than one trained on LEC activities, suggesting that odor identity is more reliably represented in DG than LEC (Figure 3C). This was true both in experiments using a six-odor panel and a three-odor panel (Figures S2D and S2E). We obtained complementary results by constructing population vectors of DG GCs or LEC activity during odor presentations and measuring trial by trial similarity; we found responses across odors were less correlated in DG when compared to LEC (Figures 3E, S2G, and S2H), indicating that distinct odor representations are decorrelated in DG compared to LEC and that odor correlations were disrupted in LEC-DG TeLC mice (Figure 3E). Finally, we constructed a model based on random connectivity (Schaffer et al., 2018Schaffer E.S. Stettler D.D. Kato D. Choi G.B. Axel R. Abbott L.F. Odor perception on the two sides of the brain: consistency despite randomness.Neuron. 2018; 98: 736-742.e3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) between LEC and the target GCs (see STAR Methods) to determine whether this could recapitulate the high decoding accuracy in DG GCs seen in our data. The property of random connectivity in the model maintained correlations in odor representations within the input structure (LEC) and enabled expansion of the dimensionality of patterns onto its output structure (DG) via a non-linear transformation, which in general can be beneficial for decoding (Barak et al., 2013Barak O. Rigotti M. Fusi S. The sparseness of mixed selectivity neurons controls the generalization–discrimination trade-off.Journal of Neuroscience. 2013; 33: 3844-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, random connectivity alone, at all tested DG sparsity levels in our model, was not sufficient to obtain the high decoding performance we observed in our DG recordings, using either the six-odor panel or the three-odor panel (Figures S2G and S2H). These data suggest that LEC input to DG is required for odor classification and that local circuit operations within the DG itself may enhance odor representations rather than arising solely from random connectivity between LEC and DG. We next asked whether odor coding in the DG was related to the discrimination of odors when used as cues for contextual recall. In DG-dependent contextual fear discrimination/generalization experiments, a main cue used to distinguish contexts is the ambient odor cue present in each context (Danielson et al., 2016Danielson N.B. Kaifosh P. Zaremba J.D. Lovett-Barron M. Tsai J. Denny C.A. Balough E.M. Goldberg A.R. Drew L.J.

Hen R. Pattern separation: a common function for new neurons in hippocampus and olfactory bulb.Neuron. 2011; 70: 582-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the accuracy of odor classification in the DG was related to use of these cues for contextual recall. To test this, we developed an odor-guided contextual fear memory task where mice discriminated contexts that differed in the ambient odor present. We used two chemically similar odorants, ethyl butyrate (EB) and methyl butyrate (MB), and one distinct odorant, isoamyl acetate (IAA). On day 1, mice explored the three contexts in order to assess baseline levels of freezing. The next day, mice received mild footshocks in a novel context (context d) infused with the MB odor from context b and, finally on day 3, were re-exposed to the three pre-training contexts and tested for freezing in three contexts (Figure 4A). Compared to control mice, LEC-DG TeLC mice showed lower levels of freezing in the context infused with the odor present during conditioning and did not differ in freezing levels across contexts (Figure 4A). This suggests that LEC-DG TeLC mice did not use the odor as a cue for memory recall of the conditioned context. This was consistent with a role for the DG in context encoding and for the LEC in integrating contextual representations with non-spatial stimulus representations (Basu et al., 2016Basu J.

As the odor present was likely the primary cue that elicited recall of the conditioning context, we asked whether odor decoding accuracy in DG or LEC was related to contextual discrimination post-conditioning. For this, we ran mice in the same protocol, except that we imaged odor responses before (pre) and after (post) conditioning with the footshock. Analysis"

Our results support a model in which LetB establishes a physical link between the two membranes and creates a hydrophobic pathway for the translocation of lipids across the periplasm. The bacterial outer membrane (OM) constitutes a formidable barrier that protects the cell against antibiotics and other harsh environmental stresses. Understanding the machinery involved in building and maintaining the OM is critical for the development of new antimicrobials targeting these fundamental, conserved pathways. In Gram-negative bacteria, the OM is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, with a phospholipid inner leaflet and a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer leaflet, and this asymmetry is critical for its barrier function. To generate this barrier, membrane lipids, which are poorly soluble in water, must be transported across the hydrophilic periplasmic space between the inner membrane (IM) and OM. Protein-based macromolecular machines have evolved unique architectures and mechanisms to transport hydrophobic molecules across aqueous spaces, such as efflux pumps and lipid/lipoprotein transporters (Konovalova and Silhavy, 2015Konovalova A.

Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of one of the largest MCE proteins identified to date, a protein from E. coli that we name LetB for Lipophilic Envelope-spanning Tunnel B (formerly YebT; homologous to MAM-7 from Vibrio parahaemolyticus; Krachler et al., 2011Krachler A.M.

We show that LetB forms a dynamic tunnel sufficiently long to mediate lipid transport directly between the IM and OM without the need for a shuttle protein. Thus, like LPS, phospholipids may also be transported across the periplasm by large transenvelope complexes. LetB from E. coli is a large MCE gene encoded in an operon together with letA (formerly yebS), an integral IM protein (Figure 1A).

LetB encodes seven MCE domains in a single polypeptide chain (MCE1–MCE7), with an N-terminal transmembrane helix that anchors LetB to the IM and is required for its function (Figure S1D). Our previous low-resolution negative-stain EM data showed that LetB resembles an elongated, segmented rod (Ekiert et al., 2017Ekiert D.C. Bhabha G. Isom G.L. Greenan G. Ovchinnikov S. Henderson I.R. Cox J.S. Vale R.D. Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane.Cell. 2017; 169: 273-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To gain an understanding of how LetB may function to modulate OM integrity, we used cryo-EM to determine a high-resolution structure of LetB (residues 43–877, Figure 1A). We collected data on a Krios microscope equipped with a K2 camera (Table S1), which we processed in Relion (Fernandez-Leiro and Scheres, 2017Fernandez-Leiro R. Scheres S.H.W. A pipeline approach to single-particle processing in RELION.Acta Crystallogr. D Struct. Biol. 2017; 73: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 2D class averages clearly show the overall arrangement of LetB, which is an elongated, hollow, hexameric structure with seven layers (Figure 1B). Extensive 3D classification, signal subtraction, and refinement schemes yielded a final set of 8 maps covering various subvolumes (Figures S1E, S1F, and S2). The resolution of these maps ranged from ~3–4 Å, allowing us to build a complete structural model of LetB (Table S1; Figure S1G). After our preprint corresponding to this paper was published (Isom et al., 2019Isom G. Coudray N. MacRae M.R. McManus C.T. Ekiert D.C. Bhabha G.

Colors corresponding to local resolution are the same as in Figure S1. See STAR Methods for more details. The sequences of the seven MCE domains in LetB differ considerably, with sequence identity ranging from 17% to 28% in pairwise comparisons, and the domains of LetB are also highly diverged from the other E. coli MCE proteins, MlaD and PqiB (Data S1; Table S2). However, each MCE domain has a structurally conserved core, consisting of a seven-stranded β-barrel (Figures 1C and 1D), similar to the MCE domains of PqiB and MlaD (Ekiert et al., 2017Ekiert D.C. Bhabha G. Isom G.L. Greenan G. Ovchinnikov S. Henderson I.R. Cox J.S. Vale R.D. Architectures of Lipid Transport Systems for the Bacterial Outer Membrane.Cell. 2017; 169: 273-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, we identify two main regions that are variable between the structures of MCE domains (Figure 1E). The first variable region is the β6-β7 loop on the exterior surface of the β-barrel, which ranges from 9 to 15 residues in length and in which only MCE5 contains a helix. The second variable region is the β5-β6 loop, which ranges from 17 to 27 residues, with an average length of 20 residues in LetB and consists of a β-hairpin followed by a short ~two-turn helix. The seven MCE domains of a single protomer of LetB resemble seven beads on a string (Figure 1F), with the order of the domains in the primary sequence determining the order of MCE “beads” on the string. The seven MCE domains are stacked almost directly on top of one another, and each domain is connected to the next by a short helical linker. Six copies of this linearly configured LetB protomer associate laterally to form a homohexameric assembly (Figure 1G). In the assembly, each MCE domain associates with the five other equivalent MCE domains from adjacent protomers to form a ring. The seven MCE domains lead to a final assembly of seven distinct rings, with a ring of MCE1 domains at the N terminus and the MCE7 ring at the C terminus (Figure 2A). These seven MCE rings that make up LetB stack to form an elongated macromolecular barrel with each protomer extending the entire length of the barrel. The N-terminal transmembrane helix of each protomer is expected to be anchored in the IM, as previously reported (Isom et al., 2017Isom G.L. Davies N.J. Chong Z.-S. Bryant J.A. Jamshad M. Sharif M. Cunningham A.F. Knowles T.J. Chng S.-S. Cole J.A. Henderson I.R. MCE domain proteins: conserved inner membrane lipid-binding proteins required for outer membrane homeostasis.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7: 8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), with the MCE1 ring abutting the IM and the MCE7 ring closest to the OM. A continuous central tunnel runs through LetB, which is largely hydrophobic (Figure 2B), similar to that of the other two E. coli MCE proteins, PqiB and MlaD (Ekiert et al., 2017Ekiert D.C. Bhabha G. Isom G.L. Greenan G."

Synaptic transmission occurs via exocytosis of neurotransmitter-laden vesicles at nerve terminals. This membrane fusion process is catalyzed by soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) (Südhof and Rothman, 2009Südhof T.C. Rothman J.E.

Because each of these mechanistic findings continues to be the subject of debate, it is crucial to further address the precise biophysical action of syt1 in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie excitation-secretion coupling (Brose et al., 2019Brose N. Brunger A. Cafiso D. Chapman E.R. Diao J. Hughson F.M. Jackson M.B. Jahn R. Lindau M. Ma C. et al.Synaptic vesicle fusion: today and beyond.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Recently, a series of case reports has established a link between de novo heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding syt1 and a severe developmental syndrome (Baker et al., 2015Baker K. Gordon S.L. Grozeva D. van Kogelenberg M. Roberts N.Y. Pike M. Blair E. Hurles M.E. Chong W.K. Baldeweg T. et al.Identification of a human synaptotagmin-1 mutation that perturbs synaptic vesicle cycling.J. Clin.

Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Patients with syt1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder demonstrate infantile hypotonia, profound intellectual disability, disordered movement, and electroencephalographic abnormalities without epilepsy or gross neuroanatomic abnormalities (Baker et al., 2018Baker K. Gordon S.L. Melland H. Bumbak F. Scott D.J. Jiang T.J. Owen D. Turner B.J. Boyd S.G. Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The observed phenotypes vary widely in severity, but the basis for phenotypic heterogeneity in syt1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder is not well-defined. Previous studies indicate that other point mutations in syt1 can have dominant-negative effects in Drosophila (Mackler et al., 2002Mackler J.M. Drummond J.A. Loewen C.A. Robinson I.M. Reist N.E. The C(2)B Ca(2+)-binding motif of synaptotagmin is required for synaptic transmission in vivo.Nature. 2002; 418: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and in cultured mouse neurons (Wu et al., 2017Wu D. Bacaj T. Morishita W. Goswami D. Arendt K.L. Xu W. Chen L. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Postsynaptic synaptotagmins mediate AMPA receptor exocytosis during LTP.Nature. 2017; 544: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While existing work suggests that disease-associated syt1 mutations may have a graded impact on synaptic vesicle recycling (Baker et al., 2015Baker K. Gordon S.L. Grozeva D. van Kogelenberg M. Roberts N.Y. Pike M. Blair E. Hurles M.E. Chong W.K. Baldeweg T. et al.Identification of a human synaptotagmin-1 mutation that perturbs synaptic vesicle cycling.J. Clin.

Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whether and how these variants affect synaptic transmission are key issues that require further exploration. Moreover, it remains unclear why all disease-associated mutations are clustered in the Ca2+-binding, membrane-penetrating loops of C2B versus those of C2A. In the present study, we establish a molecular basis for syt1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder by showing that these mutant variants impair the function of syt1 in a dominant-negative, but also graded, manner. We extend these findings to define key mechanistic insights into the action of syt1, and we provide a plausible basis for pharmacotherapy of syt1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder using a clinically approved, centrally acting K+ channel antagonist. Table 1 summarizes three exemplary cases of syt1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder. Clinical histories for each patient with a mutant variant were obtained from published studies (I368T) (Baker et al., 2015Baker K. Gordon S.L. Grozeva D. van Kogelenberg M. Roberts N.Y. Pike M. Blair E. Hurles M.E. Chong W.K. Baldeweg T. et al.Identification of a human synaptotagmin-1 mutation that perturbs synaptic vesicle cycling.J. Clin. Invest. 2015; 125: 1670-1678PubMed Google Scholar) or clinical records and interviews with parents (D304G and D366E). Detailed clinical histories for patients D304G and D366E are reported in the STAR Methods. In each case, heterozygous de novo mutations in SYT1 were discovered by whole-exome sequencing, which excluded a causal role for inherited mutations (STAR Methods). Mutations for patients D366E and I368T were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Figure S1). As noted in the case series by Baker et al., 2018Baker K. Gordon S.L. Melland H. Bumbak F. Scott D.J. Jiang T.J. Owen D. Turner B.J. Boyd S.G. Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, these mutations are associated with a profound global developmental delay that varies widely in severity. All patients exhibited hypotonia and delayed motor development apparent in the first year of life. As with patient I368T, magnetic resonance imaging of the brains of patients D304G and D366E revealed no gross neuroanatomical abnormalities, and extensive testing in each patient did not reveal any underlying metabolic abnormalities (STAR Methods). Developmental regression and seizures were absent in all cases, but electroencephalograms (EEG) revealed background slowing and intermittent high-amplitude, low-frequency spiking activity in each case. Strikingly, the EEG disturbance was also graded, and the amplitude of spiking activity correlated with the severity of developmental delay (i.e., I368T > D366E). Two of these patients, D366E and I368T, underwent visual evoked potential recording, which demonstrated abnormally prolonged latency in both cases. Behavioral phenotypes also varied in type and severity, with two of these patients (D304G and I368T) exhibiting frequent agitation and self-injurious behavior. These cases highlight the phenotypic variability of syt1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder, with patient D366E demonstrating a substantially milder global phenotype than patients D304G and I368T. We note that the variants described here represent only a subset of disease-associated syt1 mutations, as two additional variants (M303K, N371K) have also been reported (Baker et al., 2018Baker K. Gordon S.L. Melland H. Bumbak F. Scott D.J. Jiang T.J. Owen D. Turner B.J. Boyd S.G.

Open table in a new tab Histories were obtained directly from patient records and interviews with family members (D304G, D366E) or from previously published case histories (I368T). Phenotypes associated with these mutations are highly variable; among these patients, mutation D365E is associated with a substantially milder phenotype. We first undertook a structural analysis to define the molecular phenotype associated with these three mutations, all of which occur in the cytoplasmic C2B domain of this tandem-C2 domain protein (Figure 1A). X-ray crystallographic structures of each C2B mutant variant are shown in Figure 1B, and the Ca2+-binding regions for each domain are shown in Figure 1C. Ca2+-free conditions were chosen to facilitate crystallization and because the conformational changes that occur upon Ca2+ binding are minimal (Shao et al., 1998Shao X. Fernandez I. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Solution structures of the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound C2A domain of synaptotagmin I: does Ca2+ induce a conformational change?.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16106-16115Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Compared with the wild-type (WT) domain, each mutant variant C2B is correctly folded in the β sandwich of a C2 domain (Figure 1B). While subtle differences in the position of Ca2+-binding/membrane-penetration loops were apparent (Figure 1C), these residues are likely to be highly mobile in solution, and the observed differences are likely attributable to differences in crystal packing. Figure 1 also highlights the physicochemical diversity of these mutations. D304G neutralizes a Ca2+-binding aspartic acid, while D366E preserves a carboxylate ligand but reduces the size of the Ca2+-binding pocket (Figure 1C). I368T substitutes a polar threonine for a bulky, hydrophobic isoleucine that normally penetrates the plasma membrane upon Ca2+ binding by syt1 (Bai et al., 2002Bai J. Wang P. Chapman E.R. C2A activates a cryptic Ca(2+)-triggered membrane penetration activity within the C2B domain of synaptotagmin I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 1665-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As other authors have emphasized (Baker et al., 2018Baker K. Gordon S.L. Melland H. Bumbak F. Scott D.J. Jiang T.J. Owen D.

Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the affected residues are highly conserved in syt1 homologs across the metazoan phylogeny. As noted above, each disease-associated mutation occurs at a residue with a defined biochemical function in the loops of C2B (Chang et al., 2018Chang S. Trimbuch T. Rosenmund C.

However, studies of synaptic transmission in neurons expressing syt1 with C2B loop mutations have only rarely examined single point mutations, and mutations at some of these sites appear inconsequential (Mackler et al., 2002Mackler J.M.

Because limited evidence points to deficits in vesicular recycling of disease-associated syt1 variants (Baker et al., 2018Baker K. Gordon S.L. Melland H. Bumbak F. Scott D.J. Jiang T.J. Owen D. Turner B.J. Boyd S.G. Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we assessed the trafficking and synaptic function of each variant using immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological recordings of synaptic currents in cultured mouse hippocampal and cortical neurons (Figure 2; please note: in these and all subsequent experiments, amino acid numbers for the rat and mouse syt1 sequences are used, so the designations hereafter are shifted by -1). Using a specific antibody against syt1 (Figure S2), we found that each mutant variant trafficked as effectively as WT to the presynaptic compartment (Figures 2A and 2B). We note that, while each of these variants trafficked normally and was thus assessed for synaptic function, other disease-associated mutations may act by causing mislocalization of syt1 (Baker et al., 2018Baker K. Gordon S.L. Melland H. Bumbak F. Scott D.J. Jiang T.J. Owen D. Turner B.J. Boyd S.G. Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We next measured evoked GABAergic postsynaptic currents (inhibitory postsynaptic currents [IPSCs]) from WT or syt1 knockout (KO) cortical neurons expressing mutant syt1 variants (Figure 2C). Despite localizing correctly to presynaptic terminals, mutant syt1 variants largely failed to support evoked synaptic transmission (Figures 2D–2G). However, this effect was graded: while the evoked-transmission phenotypes of D303G and I367T appeared nearly identical to the syt1 KO (Figures 2D–2G), D365E preserved the rapid kinetics of WT syt1 (Figures 2E and 2H), despite also exhibiting the low amplitude and total charge transfer properties of the KO (Figures 2F and 2G). Syt1 also regulates spontaneous neurotransmitter release by suppressing, or clamping, fusion under resting conditions (Courtney et al., 2019Courtney N.A. Bao H. Briguglio J.S. Chapman E.R. Synaptotagmin 1 clamps synaptic vesicle fusion in mammalian neurons independent of complexin.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, Liu et al., 2009Liu H. Dean C.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7395-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We observed that clamping of spontaneous vesicle fusion, as represented by the frequency of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs), also varied among the genotypes: variants I367T and D365E clamped mIPSCs more effectively than D303G (Figure 2I), consistent with an established but poorly understood role for Ca2+-binding loops in the clamping action of syt1 (Evans et al., 2015Evans C.S.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In summary, the pathogenic syt1 mutations affect spontaneous release rates and strongly impact evoked release. Importantly, and in correlation with the observed clinical phenotypes, D303G and I367T cause an even more severe impairment of evoked synaptic release than D365E. We next assessed the dominant-negative potency of each mutation with simultaneous lentiviral expression of mutant and WT syt1, in combination with optical imaging of evoked glutamate release (Figure 3) (Marvin et al., 2013Marvin J.S. Borghuis B.G. Tian L. Cichon J. Harnett M.T. Akerboom J. Gordus A. Renninger S.L. Chen T.-W. Bargmann C.I. et al.An optimized fluorescent probe for visualizing glutamate neurotransmission.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons cultured from Syt1fl/fl mice were transduced with lentivirus encoding Cre recombinase along with separate lentiviruses encoding WT and mutant syt1, respectively (Figures 3A and 3B). In each experiment the WT and mutant syt1 expression levels obtained using each dose of lentivirus were measured in separate, parallel samples by immunoblot analysis (Figures 3A and 3B). A range of WT:mutant expression ratios was assessed, and evoked glutamate release was measured as the normalized change in fluorescence across a field of view in response to a 10-AP, 10-Hz field stimulus (Figures 3C–3H). iGluSnFR fluorescence transient amplitudes were plotted against the relative expression of WT and mutant protein in Figure 3E, clearly demonstrating a dominant-negative action of each mutant syt1 variant. Even at sub-stoichiometric expression levels, mutant variants dose-dependently inhibited action-potential-evoked glutamate release (Figure 3E). Strikingly, and in accordance with the findings of Baker et al., 2018Baker K. Gordon S.L. Melland H. Bumbak F. Scott D.J. Jiang T.J. Owen D. Turner B.J. Boyd S.G. Rossi M. et al.Broad Center for Mendelian GenomicsSYT1-associated neurodevelopmental disorder: a case series.Brain. 2018; 141: 2576-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, we observed a graded dominant-negative potency (D303G ≈ I367T > D365E) that again correlated with the observed clinical phenotypes (Figures 3E and 3F). Comparison of iGluSnFR data from all samples demonstrated a similar effect even without controlling for expression level (Figure S3), and statistical tests supported the use of different log-linear functions to fit the data for each mutant (Table S2). We obtained nearly identical results recording GABAergic IPSCs from neurons transduced with lentivirus to target equal expression of WT and mutant variants (Figure S4), although the effect of coexpressing variant D365E did not reach statistical significance in those experiments. As a relative measure of synaptic release probability, we also measured the amplitude of the tenth iGluSnFR transient normalized to that of the first transient (dF/F0(tenth/first)) (Figures 3G and 3H). As expected, dF/F0(tenth/first) increased with the expression of mutant protein, indicating a dose-dependent reduction in relative release probability (Figure 3G). As with the amplitude of the first response, mutant syt1 variants exhibited graded, dominant-negative activity, with D365E expressing the mildest phenotype (Figures 3G and 3H). Together, these results unambiguously establish the dominant-negative action of each mutant variant and strongly suggest a physiologic basis for the phenotypic heterogeneity observed in these patients. Syt1 triggers SNARE-catalyzed membrane fusion in vitro and at neuronal synapses by Ca2+-dependent membrane insertion of residues in two flexible loops in both C2A and C2B (Bai et al., 2016Bai H.

PIP2, in particular, is a dynamically regulated phospholipid (Micheva et al., 2001Micheva K.D. Holz R.W. Smith S.J.

We sought to develop a fully automated dose-generation framework for IMRT of prostate cancer by entering the patient CT datasets without the contour information into a generative adversarial network (GAN) and to compare its prediction performance to a conventional prediction model trained from patient contours.We propose a synthetic approach to translate patient CT datasets into a dose distribution for IMRT. The framework requires only paired-images, i.e., patient CT images and corresponding RT-doses. The model was trained from 81 IMRT plans of prostate cancer patients, and then produced the dose distribution for 9 test cases. To compare its prediction performance to that of another trained model, we created a model trained from structure images. Dosimetric parameters for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were calculated from the generated and original dose distributions, and mean differences of dosimetric parameters were compared between the CT-based model and the structure-based model.The mean differences of all dosimetric parameters except for D98% and D95% for PTV were within approximately 2% and 3% of the prescription dose for OARs in the CT-based model, while the differences in the structure-based model were within approximately 1% for PTV and approximately 2% for OARs, with a mean prediction time of 5 seconds per patient.Accurate and rapid dose prediction was achieved by the learning of patient CT datasets by a GAN-based framework. The CT-based dose prediction could reduce the time required for both the iterative optimization process and the structure contouring, allowing physicians and dosimetrists to focus their expertise on more challenging cases."
https://openalex.org/W3021261673,"Introduction Anemia during pregnancy has a significant adverse effect on both the mother and fetus. Iron and folic acid supplementation (IFAS) is the feasible and cost effective strategy to control and prevent anemia in pregnancy. However, the success of this strategy is suboptimal due to poor maternal adherences to the regimen. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of anemia, rate of adherence to IFAS and associated factors among pregnant women at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH), Ethiopia. Method Institution based cross sectional study was conducted among 250 pregnant women who were selected using systematic random sampling from antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendants of TASH. Data was collected through interview and medical chart review by using structured questionnaire. The data was analyzed by SPSS v.24. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors for IFAS and P < 0.05 was used to declare the association. Results The prevalence of anemia was 4.8% and half of the study participants were knowledgeable about anemia. The rate of adherence to IFAS was 63.6%. Forgetfulness and fear of side effect were the commonest reasons for poor adherence to IFAS. Gestational age at first ANC visit and educational level were significantly associated with adherence to IFAS. Thus, pregnant women who started their ANC follow up at first trimester (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI (1.18–3.36)) and education level of college and above (AOR = 4.236, 95% CI (1.35–13.25)) and completed secondary education (AOR = 4.09, 95% CI (1.39–12.02)) were more likely to be adherent to IFAS compared with their comparators. Conclusion Even though anemia prevalence was very low among the study participants, adherence to IFAS was still a challenge during pregnancy. Therefore, counseling about IFAS and anemia prevention and promoting the benefits of early ANC visit are recommended to improve adherence to IFAS."

Recognizing that the words people use for their sexual and reproductive anatomy can vary, we programmed the survey to allow participants to input the words they use to describe their bodies, and then used those customized words to replace traditional medical terms throughout the survey. This process-oriented paper aims to describe the rationale for and collaborative development of an affirming, customizable survey of the SRH needs and experiences of sexual and gender minorities, and to present summary demographic characteristics of 3,110 people who completed the survey.

https://openalex.org/W3021353580,"Stress granules (SG) are cytoplasmic RNA granules that form during various types of stress known to inhibit general translation, including oxidative stress, hypoxia, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER), ionizing radiations or viral infection. Induction of these SG promotes cell survival in part through sequestration of proapoptotic molecules, resulting in the inactivation of cell death pathways. SG also form in cancer cells, but studies investigating their formation upon treatment with chemotherapeutics are very limited. Here we identified Lapatinib (Tykerb / Tyverb®), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of breast cancers as a new inducer of SG in breast cancer cells. Lapatinib-induced SG formation correlates with the inhibition of general translation initiation which involves the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α through the kinase PERK. Disrupting PERK-SG formation by PERK depletion experiments sensitizes resistant breast cancer cells to Lapatinib. This study further supports the assumption that treatment with anticancer drugs activates the SG pathway, which may constitute an intrinsic stress response used by cancer cells to resist treatment."

Male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with CAP administration for 8 weeks, gut microbiota, bile acid (BA) profiles and markers for BA, and glucose metabolism were investigated. CAP improved glucose homeostasis partially by enhancing the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). The gut microbiota was remodeled by CAP and was characterized by the increased abundance of Bacteroides genera, which is related with lithocholic acid (LCA) production. LCA is an endogenous agonist of Takeda G-protein coupled receptor 5 (TGR5); it may enhance GLP-1 secretion in intestinal L cells. Meanwhile, antibiotics experiment abolished the effects of CAP on glucose homeostasis and microbiota transplantation experiments demonstrated that the CAP-induced beneficial effects were transferable, indicating that the effects of CAP on glucose homeostasis were largely dependent on the gut microbiota. Additionally, we further identified that the improvements induced by CAP were attenuated by the antagonist of GLP-1 receptor, indicating that the activation of GLP-1 signaling contributes to the CAP-induced improvement in glucose homeostasis."

We assessed the efficacy and safety of Astodrimer Gel for treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Methods 132 women with bacterial vaginosis were randomized 1:1:1:1 to Astodrimer 0.5% (N = 34), 1% (N = 33), or 3% (N = 32) Gel or hydroxyethyl cellulose placebo gel (N = 33) at a dose of 5 g vaginally once daily for 7 days at 6 centers in the United States. The primary endpoint was clinical cure (no bacterial vaginosis vaginal discharge and no more than one of 1) vaginal pH ≥4.5; 2) ≥20% clue cells; or 3) positive whiff test) at study days 21–30. Secondary analyses included clinical cure at study days 9–12, patient-reported symptoms, acceptability and adverse events. Results The Astodrimer 1% Gel dose was superior to placebo for the primary and selected secondary efficacy measures in the modified intent-to-treat population. Clinical cure rates at day 9–12 were superior to placebo for the Astodrimer 3%, 1% and 0.5% Gel groups (62.5% [15/24; P = .002], 74.1% [20/27; P < .001], and 55.2% [16/29; P = .001], respectively, vs. 22.2% [6/27]). At day 21–30, clinical cure rates were 46.2% (12/26) for the 1% dose vs. 11.5% for placebo (3/26; P = .006). A greater proportion of patients reported absence of vaginal discharge and vaginal odor at day 9–12 and day 21–30 for Astodrimer Gel groups compared with placebo. Adverse events considered potentially treatment-related occurred in only 25% of Astodrimer Gel-treated patients vs. 22% of placebo patients. Conclusion Astodrimer Gel once daily for 7 days was superior to placebo for treatment of bacterial vaginosis and was well-tolerated. The 1% dose consistently showed the strongest efficacy across endpoints. These results support a role for Astodrimer Gel, 1%, as an effective treatment for bacterial vaginosis."
https://openalex.org/W3021920840,"Proteases have been implicated in the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of a variety of cancer types. In fact, proteases have proven to be very clinically useful as tumor biomarkers in the blood of patients. Proteases are typically involved in complex systems of substrates, activators, and inhibitors, thus making our ability to establish their exact function in cancer more difficult. Trypsin, perhaps the most famous of proteases, has been shown to play a role in cancer progression, but its functional role in ovarian cancer has not been much studied. PAR2, a transmembrane receptor that is known to be activated by trypsin, has been reported to be associated with ovarian cancer. Here, we found that stimulation of ovarian cancer cell lines with trypsin or PAR2 activating peptide markedly increased MAPK signaling and cell proliferation. Additionally, HE4, a WAP-family glycoprotein and ovarian cancer biomarker, was found to inhibit trypsin degradation, thereby retaining its activity. Patient data seemed to support this phenomenon, as the serum of ovarian cancer patients with high HE4 expression, revealed significantly elevated trypsin levels. These data support the hypothesis that trypsin plays a tumorigenic role in ovarian cancer, which can be mediated by its receptor PAR2, and potentiated by HE4."
https://openalex.org/W3023110083,"CR3 and CR4, the leukocyte specific β2-integrins, involved in cellular adherence, migration and phagocytosis, are often assumed to have similar functions. Previously however, we proved that under physiological conditions CR4 is dominant in the adhesion to fibrinogen of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs). Here, using inflammatory conditions, we provide further evidence that the expression and function of CR3 and CR4 are not identical in these cell types. We found that LPS treatment changes their expression differently on MDMs and MDDCs, suggesting a cell type specific regulation. Using mAb24, specific for the high affinity conformation of CD18, we proved that the activation and recycling of β2-integrins is significantly enhanced upon LPS treatment. Adherence to fibrinogen was assessed by two fundamentally different approaches: a classical adhesion assay and a computer-controlled micropipette, capable of measuring adhesion strength. While both receptors participated in adhesion, we demonstrated that CR4 exerts a dominant role in the strong attachment of MDDCs. Studying the formation of podosomes we found that MDMs retain podosome formation after LPS activation, whereas MDDCs lose this ability, resulting in a significantly reduced adhesion force and an altered cellular distribution of CR3 and CR4. Our results suggest that inflammatory conditions reshape differentially the expression and role of CR3 and CR4 in macrophages and dendritic cells."

An integrated proteomic-metabolomics analysis was applied to comprehensively understand the pathological changes and mechanism of MI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a mock surgery (MS) group and an MI group. The MI model was made by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, twenty-four hours after which, echocardiography was employed to assess left ventricular (LV) function variables. Blood samples and left ventricular tissues were collected for ELISA, metabolomics and proteomics analysis. The results showed that LV function, including ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), was significantly reduced and the level of cTnT in the serum increased after MI. iTRAQ proteomics showed that a total of 169 proteins were altered including 52 and 117 proteins with increased and decreased expression, respectively, which were mainly involved in the following activities: complement and coagulation cascades, tight junction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, MAPK signaling pathway, endocytosis, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, as well as phagosome coupled with vitamin digestion and absorption. Altered metabolomic profiling of this transition was mostly enriched in pathways including ABC transporters, glycerophospholipid metabolism, protein digestion and absorption and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. The integrated metabolomics and proteomics analysis indicated that myocardial injury after MI is closely related to several metabolic pathways, especially energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, vascular smooth muscle contraction, gap junction and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. These findings may contribute to understanding the mechanism of MI and have implication for new therapeutic targets."

However, the underlying mechanism of EDR impairment in diabetes is not fully understood. Present study defined the role of high-mobility group protein (HMGB1) in EDR related to diabetes. Serum level of HMGB1 was increased in diabetic patients and in db/db mice. Serum HMGB1 level was also positively correlated with HbA1c and negatively correlated with nitric oxide (NO) in diabetic patients. Results from wire myograph showed that recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1) was capable of impairing EDR of aortas from wild-type (WT) mice by an eNOS-dependent mechanism. Consistently, HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin acid (GA) decreased the serum level of HMGB1 and rescued EDR impairment partly in db/db mice. Furthermore, rHMGB1 mediated EDR impairment was abolished in aortas of TLR4−/− mice. In addition, high-glucose-induced HMGB1 upregulation and secretion in endothelial cells. In conclusion, HMGB1 contributes to the EDR impairment through TLR4/eNOS pathway in the setting of diabetes. GA as the HMGB1 inhibitor could attenuate EDR impairment in an animal model of diabetes."

We find that impact to service access and quality as well as impact to service supply results in greater severity of impact and a greater diversity of causal processes of impact than only considering impact to service supply. This suggests that limiting access to services and impacts to service quality may be important and understanding these kinds of impacts may complement our knowledge of impacts to biophysical systems that produce services. Some ecosystem services are at greater risk from climate stressors while others face greater risk from local activities.

This study compared morbidity and mortality patterns of newborns admitted to a regional and a district hospital in Ghana to determine outcome, risk and modifiable factors associated with mortality.This study compared morbidity and mortality patterns of newborns admitted to a regional and a district hospital in Ghana to determine outcome, risk and modifiable factors associated with mortality.A cross-sectional study involving a records-review over one year at the Upper West Regional Hospital, and three years at St Joseph's District Hospital, Jirapa was carried out. Age, sex, gestational age, weight, duration of admission, diagnosis, among others were examined. The data were analysed and statistical inference made.Altogether, 2004 newborns were examined, comprising 1,241(62%) from St Joseph's District Hospital and 763(38%) from Upper West Regional Hospital. The proportion of neonatal deaths was similar, 8.94% (St Joseph's District Hospital) and 8.91% (Upper West Regional Hospital). Prematurity, neonatal sepsis, birth asphyxia, low birth weight, neonatal jaundice and pneumonia contributed the most to mortality and suspected infections including malaria accounted for almost half (45.5%). Mortality was significantly associated with duration of stay of 48 hours, being premature, and being younger than 3 days.Majority of the mortality among the neonates admitted was due to preventable causes. Better stabilization and further studies on the epidemiology of sepsis, prematurity, low birth weight, including the contribution of malaria to these and outcome of transferred neonates are needed."

Iron (Fe) deficiency is the most common and widespread nutrition disorder affecting plants. Foliar Fe treatments of plants have been carried out with solutions devoid of fullerenol. In this study, the role of fullerenol [C60(OH)22–24] in alleviation of Fe deficiency in Cucumis sativus (a Strategy I plant) via foliar fertilization was investigated. Cucumber plants were grown hydroponically, either with (Fe) or in Fe-free (−Fe) nutrient solution. The following foliar spray treatments were applied: fullerenol at final concentrations of 1 (F1) and 10 (F10) mg L-1; Fe(II)SO4·7H2O; Fe(II)-EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid); and Fe(II)-F1 and Fe(II)-F10. The best used compound was a combination of Fe(II)-sulfate with fullerenol, especially Fe-F1. The addition of fullerenol to Fe(II)-sulfate solutions significantly increased leaf-active Fe (extracted by an Fe(II) chelator) and re-greening at the site of application. The fullerenol-induced mutual influences did not appear when fullerenol was sprayed alone, suggesting a beneficial role of Fe(II)–fullerenol interactions in the penetration of Fe(II) in the leaves and re-greening under Fe-limited conditions. The results are of importance to enhancing the potential of foliar Fe fertilization as the commonly used strategy for ameliorating Fe deficiency and improving crop yield and quality."
https://openalex.org/W3023083998,"Improved health, wellbeing and quality of life are associated with older adults living well at home. Enabling older adults to remain at home requires organisations to consider different workforce models to support these initiatives. Volunteers are often used by organisations providing such services. However, given the changing nature of the volunteer industry, volunteer recruitment and retention practices must be better understood. This study sought to understand individuals’ motivations to volunteer in aged care home support. Eighteen volunteers were recruited from not-for-profit aged support organisations in Perth, Western Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and five themes were thematically interpreted: What’s Important to Me?, Learning and Growth, Somewhere to Belong, Meet Me in the Middle, and Not Just a Number. Fulfilling volunteers’ desires for interest, social connection, self-growth, recognition, and support appeared conducive to positive volunteering experiences. These findings may suggest avenues to capture and retain volunteers in aged care home support."
https://openalex.org/W3020935456,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of incorporating different legume flours (faba bean, lentil or split pea flours) on the pasta protein network and its repercussion on in vitro protein digestibility, in comparison with reference dairy proteins. Kinetics and yields of protein hydrolysis in legume enriched pasta and, for the first time, the peptidomes generated by the pasta at the end of the in vitro gastric and intestinal phases of digestion are presented. Three isoproteic (21%) legume enriched pasta with balanced essential amino acids, were made from wheat semolina and 62% to 79% of legume flours (faba bean or F-pasta; lentil or L-pasta and split pea or P-pasta). Pasta were prepared following the conventional pastification steps (hydration, mixing, extrusion, drying, cooking). Amino acid composition and protein network structure of the pasta were determined along with their culinary and rheological properties and residual trypsin inhibitor activity (3–5% of the activity initially present in raw legume flour). F- and L-pasta had contrasted firmness and proportion of covalently linked proteins. F-pasta had a generally weaker protein network and matrix structure, however far from the weakly linked soluble milk proteins (SMP) and casein proteins, which in addition contained no antitrypsin inhibitors and more theoretical cleavage sites for digestive enzymes. The differences in protein network reticulation between the different pasta and between pasta and dairy proteins were in agreement in each kinetic phase with the yield of the in vitro protein hydrolysis, which reached 84% for SMP, and 66% for casein at the end of intestinal phase, versus 50% for L- and P-pasta and 58% for F-pasta. The peptidome of legume enriched pasta is described for the first time and compared with the peptidome of dairy proteins for each phase of digestion. The gastric and intestinal phases were important stages of peptide differentiation between legumes and wheat. However, peptidome analysis revealed no difference in wheat-derived peptides in the three pasta diets regardless of the digestion phase, indicating that there was a low covalent interaction between wheat gluten and legume proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3023705466,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major healthcare challenge contributing to high morbidity and mortality. Treatment options are still limited, mainly due to insufficient understanding of the underlying pathophysiology. Further research and the development of reliable animal models resembling the human disease phenotype is therefore necessary to develop novel, innovative and ideally causal therapies. Since ischaemic heart failure (IHF) is a major cause for AF in patients we investigated AF in the context of IHF in a close-to-human porcine ischaemia-reperfusion model. Myocardial infarction (AMI) was induced in propofol/fentanyl/midazolam-anaesthetized pigs by occluding the left anterior descending artery for 90 minutes to model ischaemia with reperfusion. After 30 days ejection fraction (EF) was significantly reduced and haemodynamic parameters (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right atrial pressure (RAP), left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (LVEDP)) were significantly elevated compared to age/weight matched control pigs without AMI, demonstrating an IHF phenotype. Electrophysiological properties (sinus node recovery time (SNRT), atrial/AV nodal refractory periods (AERP, AVERP)) did not differ between groups. Atrial burst pacing at 1200 bpm, however, revealed a significantly higher inducibility of atrial arrhythmia episodes including AF in IHF pigs (3/15 vs. 10/16, p = 0.029). Histological analysis showed pronounced left atrial and left ventricular fibrosis demonstrating a structural substrate underlying the increased arrhythmogenicity. Consequently, selective ventricular infarction via LAD occlusion causes haemodynamic alterations inducing structural atrial remodeling which results in increased atrial fibrosis as the arrhythmogenic atrial substrate in pigs with IHF."
https://openalex.org/W3022488301,"This study aimed to explore the association between malnutrition, clinical parameters, and health-related quality of life in elderly hospitalized patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).Cross-sectional study of 92 hospitalized elderly patients with PD (mean age 73.6 ± 6.7 years) without dementia. The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was used to evaluate nutritional status. Motor impairment and non-motor symptoms burden (Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire, and Hoehn & Yahr staging), depression (Becks Depression Inventory-II), and health-related quality of life (PD quality of life Questionnaire-39) were assessed.Every second patient was malnourished or at risk of malnutrition. In the multivariable analysis, male gender, longer disease duration, higher Hoehn & Yahr and depression were associated with total MNA score. Besides non-motor symptoms and motor impairment, malnutrition was an independent predictor of poor health-related quality of life. In the multivariate analysis, malnutrition had a statistically significant effect on emotional well-being, mobility, social support, stigmatization, and cognition. The strongest association was found between malnutrition and emotional well-being.Elderly male persons with longer PD duration and higher disease stages are more likely to be malnourished or at risk for malnutrition. Malnutrition was mainly associated with poor emotional well-being, suggesting that treatment of depression and anxiety beside diet and physical activity can help improving nutrition status in these subjects. The MNA should not be used independent of other measures of cognition and depression in people with advanced PD."
https://openalex.org/W3022480644,"The physiological actions of orally ingested peptides on the brain remain poorly understood. This study examined the effects of 39 orally administered synthetic Tyr-containing dipeptides on the enhancement of brain norepinephrine metabolism in mice by comparing the concentration of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG). Although Tyr-Tyr administration increased blood and cerebral cortex (Cx) Tyr concentrations the most, Tyr-Trp increased Cx MHPG concentration the most. The oral administration of Tyr-Trp ameliorated a short-term memory deficit of a mouse model of cognitive dysfunction induced by amyloid beta peptide 25-35. Gene expression profiling of mouse brain using a microarray indicated that Tyr-Trp administration led to a wide variety of changes in mRNA levels, including the upregulation of genes encoding molecules involved in catecholamine metabolism. A comparative metabolome analysis of the Cx of mice given Tyr-Trp or Tyr-Tyr demonstrated that Tyr-Trp administration yielded higher concentrations of Trp and kynurenine pathway metabolites than Tyr-Tyr administration, as well as higher L-dopa levels, which is the initial product of catecholamine metabolism. Catecholamines were not significantly increased in the Cx of the Tyr-Tyr group compared with the Tyr-Trp group, despite a marked increase in Tyr. Presumably, Tyr-Trp administration enhances catecholamine synthesis and metabolism via the upregulation of genes involved in Tyr and Trp metabolism as well as metabolites of Tyr and Trp. These findings strongly suggest that orally ingested Tyr-Trp modulates the brain metabolome involved in catecholamine metabolism and contributes to higher brain function."
https://openalex.org/W3022866083,"Suicide is a severe health problem, with high rates in individuals with addiction. Considering the lack of studies exploring suicide predictors in this population, we aimed to investigate factors associated with attempted suicide in inpatients diagnosed with cocaine use disorder using two analytical approaches.This is a cross-sectional study using a secondary database with 247 men and 442 women hospitalized for cocaine use disorder. Clinical assessment included the Addiction Severity Index, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, totalling 58 variables. Descriptive Poisson regression and predictive Random Forest algorithm were used complementarily to estimate prevalence ratios and to build prediction models, respectively. All analyses were stratified by gender.The prevalence of attempted suicide was 34% for men and 50% for women. In both genders, depression (PRM = 1.56, PRW = 1.27) and hallucinations (PRM = 1.80, PRW = 1.39) were factors associated with attempted suicide. Other specific factors were found for men and women, such as childhood trauma, aggression, and drug use severity. The men's predictive model had prediction statistics of AUC = 0.68, Acc. = 0.66, Sens. = 0.82, Spec. = 0.50, PPV = 0.47 and NPV = 0.84. This model identified several variables as important predictors, mainly related to drug use severity. The women's model had higher predictive power (AUC = 0.73 and all other statistics were equal to 0.71) and was parsimonious.Our findings indicate that attempted suicide is associated with depression, hallucinations and childhood trauma in both genders. Also, it suggests that severity of drug use may be a moderator between predictors and suicide among men, while psychiatric issues shown to be more important for women."
https://openalex.org/W3020939482,"Opioid analgesics remain the mainstay for managing intractable chronic pain, but their use is limited by detrimental side effects such as analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia. Calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity is a key determinant in opiates tolerance and hyperalgesia. However, the exact substrates for this calcium-dependent synaptic plasticity in mediating these maladaptive processes are largely unknown. Canonical transient receptor potential 1, 4, and 5 (TRPC1, 4, 5) proteins assemble into heteromultimeric nonselective cation channels with high Ca2+ permeability and influence various neuronal functions. However, whether and how TRPC1/4/5 channels contribute to the development of opiates tolerance and hyperalgesia remains elusive. Here, we show that TRPC1/4/5 channels contribute to the generation of morphine tolerance and hyperalgesia. Chronic morphine exposure leads to upregulation of TRPC1/4/5 channels in the spinal cord. Spinally expressed TRPC1, TPRC4, and TRPC5 are required for chronic morphine-induced synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as remodeling of synaptic spines in the dorsal horn, thereby orchestrating functional and structural plasticity during the course of morphine-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance. These effects are attributed to TRPC1/4/5-mediated Ca2+ elevation in the spinal dorsal horn induced by chronic morphine treatment. This study identifies TRPC1/4/5 channels as a promising novel target to prevent the unwanted morphine tolerance and hyperalgesia."
https://openalex.org/W3022559522,"Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer in postmenopausal and high-risk premenopausal women. Changes within the obese breast microenvironment may increase breast cancer risk. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1) is a major regulator of mammary epithelial stem/progenitor cells, and its activity is dysregulated under conditions of obesity. Using a high-fat diet model of obesity in mice and breast tissue from women, we observed that TGFβ1 activity is reduced in breast epithelial cells in obesity. Breast ducts and lobules demonstrated increased decorin in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding epithelial cells, and we observed that decorin and latent TGFβ1 complexed together. Under conditions of obesity, macrophages expressed higher levels of decorin and were significantly increased in number surrounding breast epithelial cells. To investigate the relationship between macrophages and decorin expression, we treated obese mice with either IgG control or anti-F4/80 antibodies to deplete macrophages. Mice treated with anti-F4/80 antibodies demonstrated reduced decorin surrounding mammary ducts and enhanced TGFβ1 activity within mammary epithelial cells. Given the role of TGFβ1 as a tumor suppressor, reduced epithelial TGFβ1 activity and enhanced TGFβ1 within the ECM of obese mammary tissue may enhance breast cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2910968808,"This study examined how trustworthiness impressions depend on vocal expressive and person characteristics and how their dependence may be explained by acoustical profiles. Sentences spoken in a range of emotional and conversational expressions by 20 speakers differing in age and sex were presented to 80 age and sex matched listeners who rated speaker trustworthiness. Positive speaker valence but not arousal consistently predicted greater perceived trustworthiness. Additionally, voices from younger as compared with older and female as compared with male speakers were judged more trustworthy. Acoustic analysis highlighted several parameters as relevant for differentiating trustworthiness ratings and showed that effects largely overlapped with those for speaker valence and age, but not sex. Specifically, a fast speech rate, a low harmonic-to-noise ratio, and a low fundamental frequency mean and standard deviation differentiated trustworthy from untrustworthy, positive from negative, and younger from older voices. Male and female voices differed in other ways. Together, these results show that a speaker's expressive as well as person characteristics shape trustworthiness impressions and that their effect likely results from a combination of low-level perceptual and higher-order conceptual processes."

Methods We conducted eight focus groups incorporating 75 women and their support networks in the Belagavi District, Karnataka State, India. We used a directed content analysis to guide the analysis. Results The specific facilitator that emerged as a theme, broad support for and knowledge about breastfeeding on the individual, family and community levels, was a seeming contraction to the identified specific challenge, the paradox of the common practice of supplemental feeds. Conclusions Despite voicing strong support for and knowledge about EBF, participants were familiar with a variety of supplemental feeding practices in their communities. In place of universal condemnation of all supplemental feeding, policy makers might consider strategies to address the most potentially dangerous of these practices."
https://openalex.org/W3022553672,"We previously reported that high levels of plasma neurotensin (NT), a gut hormone released from enteroendocrine cells of the small bowel, contribute to obesity and comorbid conditions. Gut microbiota has been implicated in the obesity development. Paneth cells are critical in maintaining gut microbiota composition and homeostasis by releasing antimicrobial proteins including α-defensins. The purpose of our current study was to determine the possible role of NT in gut microbiota composition and α-defensin gene expression associated with obesity. Here we show that the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B ratio) and intestinal proinflammatory cytokines is significantly increased in NT+/+ mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) which were improved in NT-deficient mice. HFD disrupted the intestinal Mmp7/α-defensin axis, which was completely prevented in NT−/− mice. In addition, NT treatment inhibited DEFA5 expression and concurrent NF-κB activity, which was blocked by a pan PKC inhibitor (Gö6983) or an inhibitor for atypical PKCs (CRT0066854). More importantly, the shRNA-mediated knockdown of atypical PKCτ reversed NT-attenuated DEFA5 expression and increased NF-κB activity. NT contributes to the HFD-induced disruption of gut microbiota composition and α-defensin expression. PKCτ/λ plays a central role in NT-mediated α-defensin gene expression which might be mediated through the inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathways in Paneth cells."

To develop new therapies such as stents to facilitate middle ear ventilation, a better knowledge on dimensions and positions of the ET in individual patients is necessary. Cone beam CT scans of 143 patients were retrospectively investigated. Parameters such as lengths of the ET and its cartilaginous and bony parts, diameters, angles as well as distance of the ostium from the nasal conchae were determined and evaluated for side, gender and age specific differences. The average length of the cartilaginous and bony tubes was smaller in women than men. The average deviation from the horizontal plane was 1.7° larger on the left side (35.4°) compared to the right side (33.7°). Tools to manipulate the ET or to insert stents into the ET should cover angles from at least 42° to 64°. The distance of the pharyngeal orifices from the conchae nasalis inferior increased with age, becoming most prominent above 70 years of age. This investigation provides necessary information to develop stents for human application and tools for safe positioning of the stents."
https://openalex.org/W3007076583,"In music education, women are present in great numbers. In professional settings, however, women musicians are not as predominant. With some exceptions, such as Scandinavian countries, women still pursue gender equality in professional music practice. To inquire about the causes of this, we considered if gender-differences in amotivation in conservatoire instrument practice could be associated with aspects of learning environment. Self-determination theory (SDT) posits that learning environments may influence motivation, by satisfying or thwarting students’ psychological needs and by selectively endorsing specific extrinsic goals. Thus, we analysed if–women and men–amotivation variations could be explained by differences in behavioural regulations and satisfaction of their psychological needs for competence and autonomy. Participants (67 women and 74 men, 18–47 years old) completed validated scales for amotivation, behavioural regulations, and needs satisfaction. Students exhibited high intrinsic and introjected regulations, and high autonomy and competence needs satisfaction. Students’ identified regulation levels were modest, and external regulation and amotivation levels were low. Women students’ perceived competence was lower, and their amotivation was higher than men’s. Amotivation variations were explained positively by identified regulation and negatively by context-derived satisfaction of the psychological needs for competence (and autonomy, only among women). Results suggest that internalization of extrinsic goals can pose difficulties and that psychological needs satisfaction may counteract amotivation (autonomy being potentially more important for women musicians)."

Here we consider ways in which a linear regression-like interpretation is not appropriate for Martingale and deviance residuals, and we develop a novel time-to-event residual which does have a linear regression-like interpretation. We illustrate the utility of this new residual via simulation of a time-to-event genome-wide association study, motivated by a real study seeking genetic modifiers of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. By virtue of its linear regression-like characteristics, our new residual may prove useful in other contexts as well."
https://openalex.org/W3021980609,"The main goal of the study was to assess the relationship between affective temperaments and meteoropathy among women and examine meteorosensitivity as a mediator in this relationship. The issue of affective temperaments and meteoropathy has not been considered in the literature. The sample consisted of 450 Caucasian women gathered via the online recruitment platform. The participants' ages ranged from 18 to 70 years (M = 30.01; SD = 9.10). The Polish version of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire was used to assess affective temperaments (depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable and anxious). Meteorosensitivity and meteoropathy were assessed using the Polish adaptation of the METEO-Q questionnaire. A large positive correlation was found between meteorosensitivity and meteoropathy. Medium positive correlations were found between meteorosensitivity/meteoropathy and cyclothymic and anxious temperaments. Small positive correlations were revealed between depressive and irritable temperaments and both meteorosensitivity and meteoropathy scales. No correlation was found between hyperthymic temperament and meteorosensitivity/meteoropathy. Mediation analyses indicated cyclothymic and anxious temperaments affected meteoropathy both directly and indirectly through meteorosensitivity as a mediator. The most severe meteoropathy symptoms in the studied sample were asthenia, an indefinite feeling of malaise and irritability. The results suggest affective temperaments may be related to meteoropathy symptoms in women."
https://openalex.org/W3020924955,"Introduction Survival rate after polytrauma increased over the past decades resulting in an increase of long-term complaints. These include physical and psychological impairments. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and risk factors for developing depression and anxiety more than twenty years after polytrauma. Methods We contacted patients who were treated due to a polytrauma between 1973 and 1990 at one level 1 trauma center after more than 20 years. These patients received a self-administered questionnaire, to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety. Analysis based on multivariable logistic regression models include injury severity and non-injury related factors to determine risk factors associated with the development of depression and anxiety. Results Patients included in this study (n = 337) had a mean ISS of 20.3 (4 to 50) points. In total, 173 (51.3%) showed psychiatric sequelae (depression n = 163, 48.2%; anxiety n = 14, 4.1%). Injury severity was not associated with the development of depression or anxiety. However, the patients, who required psychiatric therapy prior to the injury had higher risk of developing psychiatric symptoms (OR 1.3, 95%CI 1.1 to 1.8, p = 0.018) as did patients who suffered from additional psychiatric insults after the injury (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.2 to 2.0, p = 0.049). Conclusion More than half of polytrauma patients developed psychiatric sequelae. Risk factors include mainly non-injury related factors such as psychiatric comorbidities and additional psychiatric insults after the injury."
https://openalex.org/W3023944127,"Recent research on speech communication has revealed a tendency for speakers to imitate at least some of the characteristics of their interlocutor’s speech sound shape. This phenomenon, referred to as phonetic convergence, entails a moment-to-moment adaptation of the speaker’s speech targets to the perceived interlocutor’s speech. It is thought to contribute to setting up a conversational common ground between speakers and to facilitate mutual understanding. However, it remains uncertain to what extent phonetic convergence occurs in voice fundamental frequency (F0), in spite of the major role played by pitch, F0’s perceptual correlate, as a conveyor of both linguistic information and communicative cues associated with the speaker’s social/individual identity and emotional state. In the present work, we investigated to what extent two speakers converge towards each other with respect to variations in F0 in a scripted dialogue. Pairs of speakers jointly performed a speech production task, in which they were asked to alternately read aloud a written story divided into a sequence of short reading turns. We devised an experimental set-up that allowed us to manipulate the speakers’ F0 in real time across turns. We found that speakers tended to imitate each other’s changes in F0 across turns that were both limited in amplitude and spread over large temporal intervals. This shows that, at the perceptual level, speakers monitor slow-varying movements in their partner’s F0 with high accuracy and, at the production level, that speakers exert a very fine-tuned control on their laryngeal vibrator in order to imitate these F0 variations. Remarkably, F0 convergence across turns was found to occur in spite of the large melodic variations typically associated with reading turns. Our study sheds new light on speakers’ perceptual tracking of F0 in speech processing, and the impact of this perceptual tracking on speech production."

Previously, our group has demonstrated that synthesized (E)-N-(2-(3, 5-dimethoxystyryl) phenyl) furan-2-carboxamide (BK3C231) possesses potential chemopreventive activity specifically inducing NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) protein expression and activity. In this study, the cytoprotective effects of BK3C231 on cellular DNA and mitochondria were investigated in normal human colon fibroblast, CCD-18Co cells. The cells were pretreated with BK3C231 prior to exposure to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO). BK3C231 was able to inhibit 4NQO-induced cytotoxicity. Cells treated with 4NQO alone caused high level of DNA and mitochondrial damages. However, pretreatment with BK3C231 protected against these damages by reducing DNA strand breaks and micronucleus formation as well as decreasing losses of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and cardiolipin. Interestingly, our study has demonstrated that nitrosative stress instead of oxidative stress was involved in 4NQO-induced DNA and mitochondrial damages. Inhibition of 4NQO-induced nitrosative stress by BK3C231 was observed through a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) level and an increase in glutathione (GSH) level. These new findings elucidate the cytoprotective potential of BK3C231 in human colon fibroblast CCD-18Co cell model which warrants further investigation into its chemopreventive role."

We report that 3.76% of Taiwanese patients had TGM2-Abs and all had no CD's symptoms. In contrast to Caucasian's CD patients, DQ2/DQ8 only constituted ~4/5 of TGM2-Abs positive patients, while the other ~1/5 patients belonged to different HLA genotypes. Either anti-gliadin or anti-neoepitope Abs coexisted with ~3/4 of TGM2-Abs positive patients that were likely due to gluten-ingestion, while the cause of TGM2-Abs production for other ~1/4 of patients was unknown. Purified anti-TGM2 IgA (TGA) and anti-TGM2 IgG (TGG) could bind on endothelial cells surface, recognized native better than denatured forms of TGM2, and TGA inhibited TGM2's transamidation activity by up to 80% but TGG had no effects. Epitope mapping of all TGM2-Abs positive sera demonstrated that TGM2-Abs had heterogeneity in specificities. This is the first study on the differences between Taiwanese Han group and Caucasian in HLA genotypes and properties of TGM2-Abs."

Moreover, NF-κB2 played a key role in regulating glycolysis, exhibiting a metabolic shift when MGs had an excessive supply of glucose. In primary mammary epithelial cells, fermentative glycolysis, and intracellular concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were reduced by ganoderic acid A through blocking NF-κB2, while activation of NF-κB2 with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) upregulated fermentative glycolysis and increased cellular ROS accumulation under excessive glucose. Thus, we established an NF-κB2-targeting method to reform the metabolic shift toward glycolysis caused by glucose oversupply by integrating NF-κB2 blockade and intracellular ROS scavenging."

It remains, however, unclear whether a negative emotional state, one of the core symptoms of depression, causes this impairment in autobiographical memory coherence. The current study aimed to examine the causal relation between mood and memory coherence by means of a mood induction paradigm. A group of 165 students were randomly allocated to one of three mood groups: negative, positive, and neutral. We hypothesized that memory coherence would decrease following a negative mood induction. In addition, working memory capacity was expected to mediate the association between mood and memory coherence. Contrary to predictions, memory coherence increased following a negative mood induction. This increase was likewise observed in the positive mood group, though memory coherence remained consistent in the neutral mood group. This effect of mood on memory coherence was solely observed in female participants and not in the small male subsample. Results provided no support for the hypothesis that working memory capacity functioned as an underlying mechanism. Different theoretical explanations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3022855564,"ADAMTS13 regulates the hemostatic activity of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Determined by static assays, proteolytic activity <10IU/dL in patient plasma, in absence of ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, indicates Upshaw-Schulman syndrome (USS); the congenital form of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). We have recently functionally characterized sixteen USS-associated ADAMTS13 missense variants under static conditions. Here, we used two assays under shear flow conditions to analyze the activity of those seven mutants with sufficiently high residual secretion plus two newly identified variants. One assay determines cleavage of VWF strings bound to the surface of endothelial cells. The other, light transmission aggregometry-based assay, mimics degradation of VWF-platelet complexes, which are likely to be present in the circulation during TTP bouts. We found that 100 ng/ml of all variants were able to cleave about 80–90% of VWF strings even though 5 out of 9 exhibited activity ≤1% in the state-of-the-art static assay at the same concentration. These data indicate underestimation of ADAMTS13 activity by the used static assay. In simulated circulation, two variants, with missense mutations in the vicinity of the catalytic domain, exhibited only minor residual activity while all other variants were able to effectively break down VWF-platelet complexes. In both assays, significant proteolytic activity could be observed down to 100 ng/ml ADAMTS13. It is thus intriguing to postulate that most variants would have ample activity if secretion of 10% of normal plasma levels could be achieved."
https://openalex.org/W4252464772,"This study examined how trustworthiness impressions depend on vocal expressive and person characteristics and how their dependence may be explained by acoustical profiles. Sentences spoken in a range of emotional and conversational expressions by 20 speakers differing in age and sex were presented to 80 age and sex matched listeners who rated speaker trustworthiness. Positive speaker valence but not arousal consistently predicted greater perceived trustworthiness. Additionally, voices from younger as compared with older and female as compared with male speakers were judged more trustworthy. Acoustic analysis highlighted several parameters as relevant for being perceived as trustworthy (i.e., accelerated tempo, low harmonic-to-noise ratio, more shimmer, low fundamental frequency, more jitter, large intensity range) and showed that effects partially overlapped with those for perceived speaker affect, age, but not sex. Specifically, a fast speech rate and a lower harmonic-to-noise ratio differentiated trustworthy from untrustworthy, positive from negative, and younger from older voices. Male and female voices differed in other ways. Together, these results show that a speaker's expressive as well as person characteristics shape trustworthiness impressions and that their effect likely results from a combination of low-level perceptual and higher-order conceptual processes."

However, oxygen transport and utilization depends on an integrated organ response, to which the normal pulmonary system may influence overall capacity. This study aimed to investigate the associations between normal values of lung function measures and VO2peak in patients with exercise intolerance and CAD. We hypothesized that forced expiratory lung volume in one second (FEV1), transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO) and TLCO/alveolar volume (TLCO/VA) above lower limits of normal (LLN) are associated with VO2peak in these patients. We assessed patients with established CAD (n = 93; 21 women) referred for evaluation due to exercise intolerance from primary care to a private specialist clinic in Norway. Lung function tests and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) were performed. Z-scores of FEV1, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), TLCO and TLCO/VA were calculated using the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) software and LLN was defined as the fifth percentile (z = -1.645). Non-obstructive patients, defined by both FEV1 and FEV1/FVC above LLN, were assessed. The associations of FEV1Z-score, TLCOZ-score and TLCO/VAZ-score above LLN with VO2peak were investigated using linear regression models. Mean VO2peak ± standard deviation (SD) was 23.8 ± 6.4 ml/kg/min in men and 19.7 ± 4.4 ml/kg/min in women. On average, one SD increase in FEV1, TLCO and TLCO/VA were associated with 1.4 (95% CI 0.2, 2.6), 2.6 (95% CI 1.2, 4.0) and 1.3 (95% CI 0.2, 2.5) ml/kg/min higher VO2peak, respectively. In non-obstructive patients with exercise intolerance and CAD, FEV1, TLCO and TLCO/VA above LLN are positively associated with VO2peak. This may imply a clinically significant influence of normal lung function on exercise capacity in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3023802963,"Apoptosis of neurovascular cells, including astroglial cells, contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases in which neurovascular disruption plays a central role. Bim is a pro-apoptotic protein that modulates not only apoptosis but also various cellular functions such as migration and extracellular matrix protein expression. Astroglial cells act as an intermediary between neural and vascular cells facilitating retinal vascular development and remodeling while maintaining normal vascular function and neuronal integrity. We previously showed that Bim deficient (Bim -/-) mice were protected from hyperoxia mediated vessel obliteration and ischemia-mediated retinal neovascularization. However, the underlying mechanisms and more specifically the role Bim expression in astroglial cells play remains elusive. Here, using retinal astroglial cells prepared from wild-type and Bim -/- mice, we determined the impact of Bim expression in retinal astroglial cell function. We showed that astroglial cells lacking Bim expression demonstrate increased VEGF expression and altered matricellular protein production including increased expression of thrombospondin-2 (TSP2), osteopontin and SPARC. Bim deficient astroglial cells also exhibited altered proliferation, migration, adhesion to various extracellular matrix proteins and increased expression of inflammatory mediators. Thus, our data emphasizes the importance of Bim expression in retinal astroglia cell autonomous regulatory mechanisms, which could influence neurovascular function."
https://openalex.org/W3022821816,"The INTRABEAM Carl Zeiss Surgical system (Oberkochen, Germany) is a miniature accelerator producing low energy photons (50 keV maximum). The published dosimetric characterization of the INTRABEAM was based on detectors (radiochromic films or ionization chambers) not allowing measuring the absorbed dose in the first millimeters of the irradiated medium, where the dose is actually prescribed. This study aims at determining with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) the sensitivity of a paramagnetic gel in order to measure the dose deposit produced with the INTRABEAM from 0 to 20 mm. Although spherical applicators are mostly used with the INTRABEAM system for breast applications, this study focuses on surface applicators that are of interest for cutaneous carcinomas. The irradiations at 12 different dose levels (between 2 Gy and 50 Gy at the gel surface) were performed with the INTRABEAM and a 4 cm surface applicator. The gel used in this study is a new « sensitive » material. In order to compare gel sensitivity at low energy with high energy, gels were irradiated by an 18 MV photon beam produced by a Varian Clinac 2100 CD. T2 weighted multi echo MRI sequences were performed with 16 echo times. The T2 signal versus echo times was fitted with a mono-exponential function with 95% confidence interval. The calibration curve determined at low energy is a linear function (r2 = 0.9893) with a sensitivity of 0.0381 s-1.Gy-1, a similar linear function was obtained at high energy (0.0372 s-1.Gy-1 with r2 = 0.9662). The calibration curve at low energy was used to draw isodose maps from the MR images. The PDD (Percent Depth Dose) determined in the gel is within 5%-1mm of the ionization chamber PDD except for one point. The dosimetric sensitivity of this new paramagnetic ferrous gel was determined with MRI measurements. It allowed measuring the dose distribution specifically in the first millimeters for an irradiation with the INTRABEAM miniature accelerator equipped with a surface applicator."
