However, some animal studies and clinical trials have questioned whether elevating IGF1 chronically is beneficial. Secondary effects of increased serum IGF1 levels on other tissues may explain these unfavorable results. The aim of the current study was to examine the role of IGF1 in cardiac myocytes in the absence of secondary effects, and to elucidate downstream signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory effects of the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R). Transgenic mice overexpressing IGF1R in the heart displayed cardiac hypertrophy, which was the result of an increase in myocyte size, and there was no evidence of histopathology. IGF1R transgenics also displayed enhanced systolic function at 3 months of age, and this was maintained at 12-16 months of age. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-p70S6K1 pathway was significantly activated in hearts from IGF1R transgenics. Cardiac hypertrophy induced by overexpression of IGF1R was completely blocked by a dominant negative PI3K(p110α) mutant, suggesting IGF1R promotes compensated cardiac hypertrophy in a PI3K(p110α)-dependent manner. This study suggests that targeting the cardiac IGF1R-PI3K(p110α) pathway could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart failure.

Heart failure has become a major “epidemic” in Western society, and the majority of new therapies have failed to fulfill their original promise (1Packer M. J. Card. Fail. 2002; 8: 193-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The identification of signaling molecules and cascades that could be utilized to improve cardiac function will be critical for the development of new drugs for the treatment of heart failure.

(Oxf.). 2001; 54: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). IGFs are produced by many tissues, particularly by the liver in response to growth hormone stimulation. The importance of IGF1 in the regulation of post-natal growth and development has been well established (4DeChiara T.M. Efstratiadis A. Robertson E.J.

Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 2049-2061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that normal activation of the growth hormone-IGF1 axis is essential for myocardial performance (8Cittadini A.

Further, it appears that short term administration of IGF1 is beneficial in improving cardiac function in the setting of heart failure (10Duerr R.L. Huang S. Miraliakbar H.R. Clark R. Chien K.R. Ross Jr., J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 619-627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and IGF1 transgene expression has been reported to counteract the occurrence of apoptosis in a murine heart failure model (11Welch S. Plank D. Witt S. Glascock B. Schaefer E. Chimenti S. Andreoli A.M. Limana F. Leri A. Kajstura J. Anversa P. Sussman M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, conflicting results obtained from clinical trials in which IGF1 was chronically administered to humans have questioned the therapeutic value of IGF1 (2Ren J. Samson W.K. Sowers J.R. J. Mol.

Two independent groups have studied the role of IGF1 in the murine heart in vivo using a transgenic approach. Reiss et al. (12Reiss K. Cheng W. Ferber A. Kajstura J. Li P. Li B. Olivetti G. Homcy C.J. Baserga R. Anversa P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8630-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) generated transgenic mice in which the human cDNA for human IGF1B was placed under the control of the α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter. Transgenic expression was associated with increased IGF1 secretion from cardiac myocytes and resulted in a substantial rise in systemic plasma levels of IGF1 (∼80%). IGF1 transgenic mice had larger hearts and normal cardiac function. The authors also reported significant increases in the size of other organs including the brain and kidney. Thus, the large rise in systemic plasma levels of IGF1 most likely had affects on non-myocytes and other tissues. Delaughter et al. (13Delaughter M.C. Taffet G.E. Fiorotto M.L. Entman M.L. Schwartz R.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) generated transgenic mice expressing the human IGF1 cDNA under the control of the α-skeletal actin promoter (transgenic expression reported in heart and skeletal muscle). In contrast to the results reported by Reiss et al. (12Reiss K. Cheng W. Ferber A. Kajstura J. Li P. Li B. Olivetti G. Homcy C.J. Baserga R. Anversa P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8630-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), serum IGF1 levels were not elevated. Transgenic mice displayed cardiac hypertrophy, which was associated with enhanced cardiac systolic performance up to 10 weeks of age, but function was significantly depressed by 52 weeks. Despite the localized expression of IGF1 in skeletal and cardiac muscle, the effects of IGF1 were not confined to these tissues. There were also increases in gut, liver, and spleen, and changes in body composition of the animals as a whole (14Fiorotto M.L. Schwartz R.J. Delaughter M.C. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 59-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The aim of the current study was to define the role of IGF1 specifically in the heart by generating transgenic mice overexpressing the IGF1R in cardiac myocytes. The advantage of this model is that there would be no effect of IGF1 on non-myocytes or other tissues. Furthermore, we wanted to elucidate the signaling pathways that are critical for mediating the growth response of the IGF1R pathway, as well as examining the transcriptional regulatory effects of the IGF1R. Activation of a number of signal transduction pathways in response to IGF1 stimulation has been described (15Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V. Sapag-Hagar M. Sugden P.H. LeRoith D. Lavandero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19115-19124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), but the biological significance of these pathways in vivo is less clear. We previously reported that transgene expression of a constitutively active (ca) phosphoinositide (PI3K, p110α isoform) mutant resulted in “physiological” cardiac hypertrophy (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Because the PI3K pathway is one of the major signaling cascades downstream of IGF1, we hypothesized that PI3K(p110α) would be a critical downstream effector of IGF1R regulating heart size. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The cDNA insert for human IGF1R was cloned into a SalI-digested αMHC promoter construct (clone 26; a gift from J. Robbins; Ref. 17Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and transgenic mice were generated as previously described (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Animal care and experimentation were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Unless otherwise shown, experiments were performed on 3-month-old heterozygous IGF1R transgenic mice and non-transgenic (NTg) littermate controls (FVB/N background). Receptor Binding Assays—The density of IGF1R in hearts from NTg and IGF1R transgenics was measured by incubating125I-IGF1 (2000 Ci/mmol) with cardiac membrane fractions for 2 h at room temperature as described (18Guse A.H. Kiess W. Funk B. Kessler U. Berg I. Gercken G. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Competition assays were also performed to confirm the specificity of the assay.125I-IGF1 was incubated with cardiac membrane fractions (100 μg) from transgenic or NTg in the presence of various concentrations of unlabeled IGF1 (0-50 ng). In the presence of 10 ng of non-radioactive IGF1, the IGF1 binding activity of membrane fractions from transgenic mice was reduced to base-line levels, demonstrating the specificity of the assays. Histological Analysis—Histological analysis of hearts was performed as previously described (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Masson's trichrome stain was used to quantify fibrosis in the left ventricle (collagen fibers stain blue). Hearts were cut at the horizontal short axis plane and fixed as described (19Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Tarnavski O. Converso K. Sherwood M.C. Manning W.J. Izumo S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Images of the left ventricle were obtained with three to four fields per section (magnification, ×50). Analysis was performed using IPLab software (Scanalytics Inc.). Areas of fibrosis were divided by the total area of the left ventricle. Morphometric Analysis of Isolated Cardiac Myocytes—Cardiac myocytes were enzymatically dissociated from hearts of NTg and IGF1R transgenics. The long axis, short axis, cell area, and cell volume of myocytes were measured as described (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Echocardiography—Echocardiography was performed at 3 months of age and 12-16 months as previously described (20Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), except that 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Aldrich, 0.4-0.6 mg/kg) was used for anesthesia. Biochemical Analysis—Heart lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described (20Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) using 2 mg of protein, protein A-Sepharose, and an anti-insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) antibody (2 μl, 0.73 μg; Upstate Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and blots were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 antibody (100 μg/μl, 1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology) and the anti-IRS1 antibody (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology). IGF1R transgene expression was surveyed in a variety of tissues by Western blotting using an IGF1Rβ antibody (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200). PI3K activity, phosphorylation of Akt, p70S6K1 activity, phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and phosphorylation of p38 were measured as described (19Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Tarnavski O. Converso K. Sherwood M.C. Manning W.J. Izumo S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 20Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C.

A. 2003; 100: 12355-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). To measure the phosphorylation of phospho-Jnk, blots were probed with an anti-phospho-Jnk antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:100) followed by an anti-Jnk1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200). Activation of calcineurin was assessed as previously described (22Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Steinberg L. Taigen T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2431-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 246-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cross-breeding of IGF1R Transgenic Mice with Dominant Negative (dn) PI3K Transgenic Mice—PI3K(p110α) is an important downstream effector of IGF1R. To genetically examine the relationship of PI3K(p110α) and IGF1R in determining heart size, we crossed IGF1R transgenic mice with transgenic mice expressing a dnPI3K(p110α) mutant (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Response of IGF1R Transgenics to a Pathological Hypertrophic Stimulus (Aortic Banding) or a Physiological Hypertrophic Stimulus (Chronic Swimming Training)—Ascending aortic constriction was performed in 3-month-old IGF1R and NTg mice as previously described (19Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Tarnavski O. Converso K. Sherwood M.C. Manning W.J. Izumo S. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). One week after the operation, mice were sacrificed. For swimming training, 8-10-week-old NTg or IGF1R transgenic mice in groups of 14-16 were swum in water tanks for 4 weeks as described (21McMullen J.R. Shioi T. Zhang L. Tarnavski O. Sherwood M.C. Kang P.M. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12355-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Microarray Hybridization and Analysis—Total RNA from ventricles was isolated from 3-month-old NTg or transgenic mice (IGF1R, caPI3K, dnPI3K) and double transgenic mice (IGF1R×caPI3K, IGF1R× dnPI3K) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the instructions from the manufacturer. Expression profiles were generated using the murine Affymetrix GeneChip® MGU74Av2. Generation of biotinylated cRNA hybridization and processing of Affymetrix arrays was performed according to Affymetrix standard protocol. Three independent biological replicates were processed and analyzed (data were analyzed using Affymetrix Microarray Suite version 5.01 to assess the quality of RNA and hybridization). Data analysis was performed using the Affy R package (www.bioconductor.org) and Spotfire DecisionSite 7.1.1 (Spotfire, Cambridge, MA). Invariant set-based normalization (24Schadt E.E. Li C. Ellis B. Wong W.H. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2001; 37: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) on the probe level was performed using the Affy R package (25Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). After normalization, signal values were calculated as an expression index as described in the Affymetrix technical manual (Microarray Suite User Guide, Version 5). Expression index and detection calls were exported to Spotfire DecisionSite software where further clustering analysis was performed. 5172 probe sets, which were identified as “absent” in all 18 arrays, were excluded. The remaining 7250 genes were statistically filtered to detect significantly differently expressed genes across the experimental groups. One-way analysis of variance was performed to detect differences across the six groups. 822 probe sets of 12,422 (6.62%) were selected for cluster analysis with a significance level of p < 0.001. Hierarchical and k-means clustering analysis were done interactively within Spotfire DecisionSite software, and k = 9 for k-means clustering was used for further interpretation. Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Total RNA (7.5 μg) was electrophoresed in 1.3% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels and blotted onto Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were probed with atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), β-MHC, α-MHC, α-skeletal actin, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (Ptdss1), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and GAPDH-radiolabeled probes. The probes for mouse ANP (16Shioi T. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Hampe J. Yballe C.M. Lawitts J. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), α-skeletal actin (21McMullen J.R. Shioi T. Zhang L. Tarnavski O. Sherwood M.C. Kang P.M. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12355-12360Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), PAH, Ptdss1, and HB-EGF were cloned by RT-PCR using mouse heart cDNAs as a template with the following primers: PAH (forward, TGTTGTCCTGGAGAACGGAGTC; reverse, TCCTGAATGGTCCTTGGGAACC), Ptdss1 (forward, ATCAACGAGCAGCAAGTGGAGG; reverse, CCAAAAACCATTCGCCATAAGG), HB-EGF (forward, CCCCAAGCAAAGAAAGGAATG; reverse, GATGACAAGAAGACAGACGGACG). Mouse BNP and rat GAPDH probes were prepared as previously described (26Tanaka M. Chen Z. Bartunkova S. Yamasaki N. Izumo S. Development. 1999; 126: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kasahara H. Bartunkova S. Schinke M. Tanaka M. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 936-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Rat β-MHC 3′-untranslated region cDNA and mouse α-MHC 3′-untranslated region cDNA were kind gifts from M. Buckingham. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference post hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Overexpression of IGF1R Induced Compensated Physiological Cardiac Hypertrophy—From 17 potential founders, 2 lines (lines 7 and 17) by Southern analysis were identified. IGF1R transgenic mice are fertile and display no signs of heart failure at an age of 12-16 months. The IGF1R transgene was expressed specifically in the heart (Fig. 1A). IGF1R ligand binding assays were performed to confirm and quantitate transgenic expression of IGF1R. In lines 7 and 17, there were 20- and 16-fold increases, respectively, in the expression of the IGF1R in cardiac membrane fractions compared with that of NTg littermates. Both lines (i.e. 7 and 17) displayed a similar phenotype with significant increases in the heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW). Detailed analysis was subsequently performed on line 7. The HW/BW and HW/tibial length ratios of female IGF1R transgenics at 3 months of age were increased by ∼38 and 34%, respectively, compared with NTg littermate controls (Fig. 1B, Table I). There were no significant differences in the body, lung, or liver weights (Table I). Male IGF1R transgenics displayed a degree of cardiac hypertrophy similar to that of female transgenics (data not shown). Body and organ weights were also examined in mice up to 16 months of age. There were no significant differences in body, liver, kidney, or spleen weights (data not shown). This is consistent with the idea that IGF1 plasma levels are not elevated in IGF1R transgenic mice. On histological analysis, there was a proportional increase in the size of all chambers and ventricular wall thickness of hearts from IGF1R transgenics (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, there was no evidence of cardiomyopathic changes, such as necrosis, fibrosis, or myocyte disarray, in hearts from mice at 3 months of age (Fig. 1C) or mice at 6-12 months of age (data not shown).Table IPostmortem analysis of female IGFIR and dnPI3K transgenic mice at 3 months of ageNTgIGF1RdnPI3KIGF1R × dnPI3KNo. of animals7994Body weight (g)21.0 ± 1.020.5 ± 0.522.7 ± 0.620.9 ± 0.8Heart weight (mg)95.8 ± 3.4128.2 ± 3.1*81.6 ± 3.0*#80.6 ± 2.1*#Lung weight (mg)159.6 ± 12.2145.6 ± 5.5148.4 ± 7.0141.0 ± 6.1Liver weight (mg)908 ± 88850 ± 34975 ± 79941 ± 91Tibial length (mm)16.4 ± 0.116.4 ± 0.116.6 ± 0.116.3 ± 0.1HW/BW (mg/g)4.58 ± 0.116.30 ± 0.22*3.60 ± 0.07*#3.86 ± 0.11*#LW/BW (mg/g)7.60 ± 0.477.15 ± 0.356.56 ± 0.316.77 ± 0.44LiW/BW (mg/g)42.7 ± 2.041.6 ± 1.642.8 ± 2.744.7 ± 2.9HW/TL (mg/mm)5.83 ± 0.187.80 ± 0.19*4.91 ± 0.18*#4.95 ± 0.12*#LW/TL (mg/mm)9.72 ± 0.718.86 ± 0.348.93 ± 0.428.67 ± 0.40LiW/TL (mg/mm)55.2 ± 4.951.7 ± 2.058.6 ± 4.757.8 ± 5.4 Open table in a new tab Effect of IGF1R Transgene Expression on Myocyte Cell Size—In cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes, IGF1 was reported to result in hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia (28Kajstura J.

However, in transgenic mice expressing IGF1 specifically in the heart, an increase in myocyte number was reported (12Reiss K. Cheng W. Ferber A. Kajstura J. Li P. Li B. Olivetti G. Homcy C.J. Baserga R. Anversa P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8630-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). To examine whether the increase in heart size in the current study was the result of myocyte hypertrophy, we measured cell size in isolated adult cardiac myocyte preparations. The short axis and cell area of myocytes from IGF1R transgenics were significantly greater compared with myocytes from NTg mice (Fig. 1D, Table II). Based on the assumption that cardiac myocytes are cylindrical, the cell volume was calculated and found to be ∼46% greater in hearts of IGF1R transgenic mice (Table II). Thus, the increase in HW/BW ratio (∼40%) of IGF1R transgenics appears to be accounted for by the increase in cardiac myocyte volume.Table IIMorphometric analysis of isolated cardiac myocytes from female mice at 3 months of ageNTgIGF1RNo. of animals55Long axis (μm)95.8 ± 1.999.7 ± 2.7Short axis (μm)22.7 ± 0.726.7 ± 0.8*Cell area (μm2)1609 ± 832000 ± 115*Cell volume (× 103 μm3)41.2 ± 3.160.3 ± 5.3* Open table in a new tab Overexpression of IGF1R Was Associated with Enhanced Systolic Function—-Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography in mice at 3 and 12-16 months of age. At 3 months of age, IGF1R mice had a significantly greater diastolic posterior wall thickness and a significantly smaller left ventricle systolic diameter (Table III). Left ventricular systolic function, assessed by fractional shortening was significantly greater (∼16%) in IGF1R transgenics. Fractional shortening was maintained in mice at 12-16 months of age. Thus, mice overexpressing IGF1R display cardiac hypertrophy, which is characteristic of physiological hypertrophy, in that there is no evidence of histopathology and systolic function is enhanced.Table IIIEchocardiographic analysis of heart size and function of IGF1R transgenic mice3 months12-16 monthsNTgIGF1RNTgIGF1RNo. of animals7965Heart rate (bpm)454 ± 32463 ± 25508 ± 16501 ± 17IVS (mm)0.8 ± 0.00.9 ± 0.00.8 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.1*LVPW (mm)0.8 ± 0.01.0 ± 0.1*0.7 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1*LV diastolic diameter (mm)3.3 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.13.7 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.2LV systolic diameter (mm)1.7 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.1*1.9 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.2Fractional shortening (%)49 ± 257 ± 3*48 ± 158 ± 5* Open table in a new tab Recruitment of IRS Proteins and Activation of the PI3K Signaling Pathway—The IGF1R is a receptor tyrosine kinase that becomes activated upon IGF1 binding. The multisite tyrosine autophosphorylation of the IGF1R subsequently recruits the IRS adaptor proteins. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 expressed relative to IRS1 protein was increased ∼3.5-fold in IGF1R transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). The two major pathways of IGF1R signaling in cardiac myocytes are the PI3K pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (2Ren J. Samson W.K. Sowers J.R. J. Mol.

Res. 2001; 88: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). IGF1R activates the PI3K pathway via the interaction of the p85 PI3K subunit with phosphorylated IRS1/IRS2, which then activates the p110 catalytic subunit. In contrast, the Ras-MAPK pathway is activated by recruitment of the Grb2 adaptor that binds to a single unique tyrosine-phosphorylated consensus motif in the IRS proteins through its Src homology 2 domain (32Oldham S. Hafen E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 79-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In the current study, the p85 PI3K adaptor was significantly greater in hearts from IGF1R transgenic mice (Fig. 2B).

https://openalex.org/W2009540102,"A previously unrecognized nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain (NMHC II), which constitutes a distinct branch of the nonmuscle/smooth muscle myosin II family, has recently been revealed in genome data bases. We characterized the biochemical properties and expression patterns of this myosin. Using nucleotide probes and affinity-purified antibodies, we found that the distribution of NMHC II-C mRNA and protein (MYH14) is widespread in human and mouse organs but is quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from NMHC II-A and II-B. In contrast to NMHC II-A and II-B, the mRNA level in human fetal tissues is substantially lower than in adult tissues. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed distinct patterns of expression for all three NMHC isoforms. NMHC II-C contains an alternatively spliced exon of 24 nucleotides in loop I at a location analogous to where a spliced exon appears in NMHC II-B and in the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. However, unlike neuron-specific expression of the NMHC II-B insert, the NMHC II-C inserted isoform has widespread tissue distribution. Baculovirus expression of noninserted and inserted NMHC II-C heavy meromyosin (HMM II-C/HMM II-C1) resulted in significant quantities of expressed protein (mg of protein) for HMM II-C1 but not for HMM II-C. Functional characterization of HMM II-C1 by actin-activated MgATPase activity demonstrated a Vmax of 0.55 + 0.18 s–1, which was half-maximally activated at an actin concentration of 16.5 + 7.2 μm.

Myosins are protein molecular motors that bind to filamentous actin in an ATP-dependent manner. They are expressed as numerous classes in all eukaryotic cells (1.Sellers J.R. Myosins. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar). Nonmuscle myosins include the ubiquitous conventional myosins (class II), which form filaments at relatively low ionic strength and share a number of biological properties with skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle myosin (1.Sellers J.R. Myosins. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999Google Scholar). They are expressed in both muscle and nonmuscle cells and are hexamers, consisting of a pair of heavy chains (200 kDa) and two pairs of light chains (20 and 17 kDa). Nonmuscle myosin II is one of the main motors interacting with cytoskeletal actin and is involved in regulating cytokinesis, cell motility, and cell polarity in many eukaryotic cells (1.Sellers J.R.

II-A and II-B share the same or different light chain isoforms. There is one known form of NMHC II-A, whereas four alternatively spliced forms of NMHC II-B have been described (1.Sellers J.R.

Depending on the cell type, there appear to be areas that contain a particular myosin II isoform, but there are also areas where they clearly overlap at the light microscopic level. Some cells appear to express only one isoform, and a number of different approaches have been utilized to lower or remove one of the isoforms from both cultured cells (15.Wylie S.R. Wu P.J. Patel H.

These include the interaction of nonmuscle myosin II-B with the PBX family of homeodomain transcription factors (20.Huang H. Paliouras M. Rambaldi I. Lasko P. Featherstone M. Mol.

Analysis of genomic and cDNA data bases raised the possibility of the existence of previously unrecognized myosins, including myosin IIs (24.Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have occasionally been annotated as “moderately similar to nonmuscle myosin II-B” (or “II-A”), and a potential NMHC gene has been noted on human chromosome 19 (accession number AC020906) (24.Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Recently, Leal et al. (25.Leal A. Endele S. Stengel C. Huehne K. Loetterle J. Barrantes R. Winterpacht A. Rautenstrauss B. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 312: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) also found that this gene, MYH14, is transcribed into RNA and that this RNA is particularly abundant in human intestine and skeletal muscle. The purposes of the present study were: 1) to verify that the putative gene encoding a third NMHC, which we refer to as II-C, is translated into a previously unrecognized protein; 2) to determine what differentiates this protein from other nonmuscle myosin IIs; 3) to examine whether it is expressed in different alternatively spliced forms; and 4) to biochemically characterize its properties as a myosin. Identification of cDNA Sequence—BLAST searches of EST and genomic data bases were used to search for new nonmuscle myosins. The LEADS™ platform for clustering and assembly of DNAs and ESTs (www.labonweb.com) was used to cluster and assemble ESTs and for the search for alternative splices. This analysis led to the identification of human and mouse RNAs and ESTs encoding a previously unrecognized NMHC that we termed II-C. Sequences used to identify NMHC II-C included the human genomic sequence corresponding to nucleotides 63986279–64255191 of chromosome 19 (based on a BLAT search at genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat) and to accession numbers AC020906, AC010515, and AC019157 and the mouse genomic sequences AC073782 and AC073806, as well as different ESTs and annotated RNA sequences clustered in Unigene clusters Hs.115412/Hs.250389 and Mm.7124 (mouse chromosome 7). Comparison of the human ESTs BG829206 and BG468611 indicated that there are two alternatively spliced forms of NMHC II-C, the longer of which contains a cassette insert of 24 nucleotides derived from an additional exon. Electronic gene expression data were retrieved from the websites www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE and bodymap.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using Trizol B Reagent (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from total RNA using the NucleoTrap mRNA purification kit (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Reverse transcription was carried out in a final volume of 25 μl using 2 μg of total RNA and 2.5 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer, in the presence of 10 pmol of oligo(dT)15 and 10 units of RNasin (Promega). PCR was carried out using 2 μl of the RT reaction in the presence of 2 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol of primers, and 2.5 units of DNA polymerase (Expand high fidelity PCR System; Roche Applied Science). The PCR primers used to verify the alternative splicing of NMHC II-C in human skeletal muscle were 5′-ATGCTGCAGGATCGTGAGGACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGAATTTGCCGAATCGGGAGG-3′ (reverse). RNA Blot Analysis—Multiple Tissue Northern blots and Multiple Tissue Expression arrays were used (MTN 12 lane and MTE-2; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), containing poly(A+) RNA samples from different human and mouse tissues. A PCR product derived principally from the 3′-untranslated region of NMHC II-C (nucleotides 5965–6395 from the first ATG; see Fig. 1) was cloned, sequenced, and used as a specific probe. The probe was labeled using the Random Primer DNA labeling mix (Sigma) and [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization was carried out in the ExpressHyb-Hybridization Solution (Clontech) at 68 °C for 18 h. The membranes were rinsed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by two washes with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and to x-ray films. The results were confirmed using additional blots, with probes corresponding to nucleotides 1–759 of the noninserted NMHC II-C sequence. Analysis of Hybridization Results from Human Multiple Tissue Arrays—To enable a proper comparison of the general pattern of tissue distribution among the different NMHC mRNAs, PhosphorImager signal intensities were transformed in the following manner: 1) The NMHC hybridization signal intensity in each spot was divided by the ubiquitin hybridization signal intensity. 2) The data were normalized, so that the value of 100 defines the median of the signal intensities of the following organs: brain, heart, skeletal muscle, colon, thymus, spleen, kidney, liver, placenta, uterus, lung, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. 3) Each hybridization was repeated twice, with different multiple tissue array membranes and different probes. Determination of the Ratio of Inserted and Noninserted mRNA Encoding Mouse NMHC II-C—RT-PCR was carried out using the Gene-Amp RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems). The primer sets flanking the inserted region were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GCCCATGTGGCATCATCTCCA-3′; and reverse primer, 5′-CTCCCACGATGTAGCCAGCA-3′. Total RNA from the various tissues of 6-week-old mice was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using the above primers. The reaction profile included 35 cycles total of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min and annealing and extension at 65 °C for 1 min for the first four cycles followed by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for 45 s for the remaining 31 cycles. RNA samples subjected to PCR amplification in the absence of reverse transcriptase were used as a negative control for contamination by any DNA. The PCR product from liver was subcloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO vector for sequencing using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), which confirmed the presence of the inserted isoform. Products generated by RT-PCR were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel, and the presence of the inserted isoform in the RT-PCR products was confirmed by Southern blotting using an oligonucleotide corresponding to the 24-nucleotide inserted sequence as a probe. Preparation and Characterization of Antibodies—Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against specific NMHC II-C peptide sequences were generated. The sequences used for antibody generation and for affinity purification using an Affi-Gel 15 column (Bio-Rad) were: mouse N-terminal sequence, VTMSVSGRKVASRPGP (amino acid 4–19; see Fig. 1); mouse C-terminal sequence, APGQEPEAPPPATPQ (amino acids 1986–2000); and human C-terminal sequence, RQVFRLEEGVASDEEAEE (equivalent to amino acids 1962–1979 in mouse). The last of these antibodies appeared to cross-react with a non-myosin filamentous protein in cultured peripheral neurons when used for immunofluorescence studies. 2P. Bridgman, personal communication. The mouse sequence antibodies were raised in rabbits by Robert Wysolmerski (St. Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and affinity-purified by us. Antibodies to NMHC II-A and II-B have been described previously (7.Phillips C.L. Yamakawa K. Adelstein R.S. J. Muscle Res.

Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Tissue extracts from mouse organs were prepared using a buffer of 80 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 4 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (chymostatin, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, l-(tosylamido-2-phenyl)-ethyl chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, benzamidine, and pepstatin A), at 4 °C. The lysates were sedimented at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was used. In samples subjected to immunoprecipitation, the nonmuscle myosins were first purified by actin selection (see below). For immunoprecipitation, a 1:20 (v:v) ratio of affinity-purified antibody to the actin-selected sample was used as described previously (11.Kelley C.A. Sellers J.R. Gard D.L. Bui D. Adelstein R.S. Baines I.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 675-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The supernates and relevant immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 6% Tris-glycine gels or 8–16% gradient Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), transferred onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and subjected to immunodetection using the antibodies described above at a concentration of 0.025 μg/ml for NMHC II-A, 0.045 μg/ml for II-B and 0.13 μg/ml for II-C. Antibodies to nonmuscle actin (Sigma) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Biodesign, Kennebunk, ME; Ref. 18.Uren D. Hwang H.-K. Hara Y. Takeda K. Kawamoto S. Tullio A.N. Yu Z.-X.

For immunodetection of baculovirus-expressed, mouse FLAG-tagged, heavy meromyosin (HMM) II-C and HMM II-C1, both monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and the polyclonal antibody raised to a sequence near the N terminus of the mouse NMHC II-C were used (see above). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs were used as secondary antibodies. The proteins were visualized with the SuperSignal system (Pierce). The protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Distribution of NMHC II isoforms in developing mouse embryos was visualized by immunofluorescence staining. The embryos were collected in phosphate-buffered saline and then directly immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at room temperature. For better fixation, the brain and abdominal cavity were partially exposed. The fixed embryos were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm. For antibody staining, the samples were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with polyclonal antibodies against NMHC II-A (0.25 μg/ml), II-B (0.29 μg/ml), and II-C (1.3 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the coverslips were mounted using a Prolong antifade kit (Molecular Probes). The images were collected using a Leica SP confocal microscope (Leica). Baculovirus Expression of FLAG-tagged HMM II-C and HMM II-C1—Nucleotides 1–4071 of the coding region of HMM II-C, followed by the sequence coding for the FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) and an XbaI restriction site at the C terminus, were obtained by RT-PCR reactions using a FLAG-tagged oligonucleotide primer and cloned into baculovirus transfer vector pVL 1392 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). To generate a clone of the 8-amino acid inserted isoform, we used a PCR-derived clone of nucleotides 1–1227 in the TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and introduced the 24-nucleotide cassette insert into it by mutagenesis (QuikChange; Stratagene). The clone with the insert together with the 3′ portion of the HMM II-C was then introduced into pVL1392 and the virus was cotransfected along with a virus containing both light chains in Sf9 cells (26.Pato M.D. Sellers J.R.

Infected cells were harvested by sedimentation after 72 h of growth, and the pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Extraction and purification of HMM was as previously described (27.Wang F. Chen L. Arcucci O. Harvey E.V. Bowers B. Xu Y. Hammer J.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Actin Selection of Tissue Extracts and of Baculovirus-expressed Mouse Heavy Meromyosin II-C—The baculovirus-expressed HMMs were dialyzed overnight in a buffer of 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 3 mm NaN3, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A). F-actin (3 μm), stabilized with 5 μm phalloidin, was added to the expressed HMM, or to lung extracts prepared as outlined above, and the solution was sedimented for 15 min at 470,000 × g to pellet the actomyosin complex. The resulting pellet was solubilized in buffer A containing 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 μm phalloidin and resedimented to separate the released HMM from the polymerized actin (26.Pato M.D. Sellers J.R.

Identification and Sequencing of Mouse NMHC II-C—Based on the analysis of genomic and cDNA sequence data in the different gene banks, we predicted the amino acid sequences of the human and mouse NMHC II-C in two alternatively spliced forms. We cloned and verified the sequence of the mouse NMHC II-C using RT-PCR and mRNA from mouse lung and colon. Each PCR segment was generated and sequenced at least three times to verify the accuracy of the sequence. The resulting sequence of the cDNA encoding mouse NMHC II-C is presented in Fig. 1 (GenBank™ accession number AY205605, and AY363100 for the alternatively spliced isoform). The protein sequence derived from this cDNA contains the characteristic domains of a myosin II heavy chain (underlined in Fig. 1 and see legend in Ref. 31.Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar to Fig. 1). The cDNA encodes a gene product of 2000 amino acids with the inserted exon and 1992 without it.

The identity and similarity levels among NMHC II-A (MYH9), NMHC II-B (MYH10), and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MYH11) are higher than between any one of them and NMHC II-C. On the other hand, NMHC II-C is more related to this group of myosin heavy chains than to any other myosin heavy chain subfamily (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the percentage of amino acid identity of each myosin isoform between human and mouse ranges between 93.3% and 98.7%, which is considerably higher than the percentage of amino acid identity between the different isoforms within the same species.Table IPercent identity / similarity among the full-length human smooth muscle and NMHC amino acid sequencesII-AII-BSM-1aSM-1 isoform is the 204-kDa noninserted (SM-A) isoform.II-B80/89SM-176/8776/88II-C64/8164/8064/82a SM-1 isoform is the 204-kDa noninserted (SM-A) isoform. Open table in a new tab NMHC II-C mRNA Tissue Distribution—RNA blot analysis of human tissue poly(A+) RNA with either a probe from the 3′-untranslated region of human NMHC II-C (Fig. 3) or from the 5′ portion of the cDNA (data not shown) showed the presence of a single band of ∼7 kb, with highest expression in skeletal muscle. The gene is also expressed in brain, heart, colon, kidney, liver, small intestine, and lung. No detectable message is found in thymus, spleen, placenta, and lymphocytes (Fig. 3). This result is in agreement with the analysis of the tissue distribution of the human mRNA signal using the relative frequency of specific sequences in 3′-directed cDNA libraries (BodyMap website: bodymap.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp), which also showed that NMHC II-C is most abundant in skeletal muscle (score 4.0) and is absent in thymus, spleen, placenta, and lymphocytes. Hybridization of a probe from the 3′-untranslated region of human NMHC II-C to a human multiple tissue array blot generally agreed with the results in the RNA blot (Fig. 3) and revealed additional differences between the distribution of NMHC II-C and other nonmuscle NMHC mRNAs (Table II). The table shows that NMHC II-C mRNA is highly expressed in the corpus callosum, which is particularly enriched for glial cells. This finding is confirmed by the BodyMap tissue distribution website (bodymap.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp), which also shows high levels of this message (GS14638) in the corpus callosum (score = 4.1, which is comparable with a score of 4.0 in skeletal muscle; Fig. 3). Table II also shows that expression of NMHC II-C is low in organs composed mainly of smooth muscle, such as the aorta, uterus, and urinary bladder. NMHCs II-A and II-B are relatively abundant in these tissues (Table II and Ref. 7.Phillips C.L. Yamakawa K. Adelstein R.S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1995; 16: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas the mRNA encoding NMHC II-C is barely detectable. Finally, Table II shows that, in general, human fetal tissue contains little or no NMHC II-C mRNA compared with adult tissues (compare the values for fetal tissue in the last column with those found for adult organs). This hybridization experiment was repeated twice, with two different blots, yielding similar results.Table IILevels of NMHC II-A, II-B, and II-C mRNA in various human organs, using the multiple tissue array (Clontech)Central nervous systemMuscular organsOther organsFetal organsWhole brainHeart: left ventricleLungFetal lungII-A: 22II-A: 85II-A: 193II-A: 14II-B: 254II-B: 68II-B: 129II-B: 180II-C: 82II-C: 168II-C: 142II-C: 2Frontal lobeHeart: left atriumLiverFetal liverII-A: 15II-A: 67II-A: 68II-A: 70II-B: 207II-B: 105II-B: 42II-B: 92II-C: 50II-C: 86II-C: 193II-C: 0PonsAortaSpleenFetal spleenII-A: 11II-A: 156II-A: 107II-A: 240II-B: 162II-B: 504II-B: 12II-B: 0II-C: 254II-C: 6II-C: 0II-C: 0CerebellumSk"

This occurs by microbe-detecting receptors, such as CD14, that activate immune cells to eliminate the pathogens. Here, we link the lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14 with Alzheimer's disease, a severe neurodegenerative disease resulting in dementia. We demonstrate that this key innate immunity receptor interacts with fibrils of Alzheimer amyloid peptide. Neutralization with antibodies against CD14 and genetic deficiency for this receptor significantly reduced amyloid peptide induced microglial activation and microglial toxicity. The observation of strongly enhanced microglial expression of the LPS receptor in brains of animal models of Alzheimer's disease indicates a clinical relevance of these findings. These data suggest that CD14 may significantly contribute to the overall neuroinflammatory response to amyloid peptide, highlighting the possibility that the enormous progress currently being made in the field of innate immunity could be extended to research on Alzheimer's disease."

Apart from an overall increase in mitochondrial protein mass, the mitochondrial proteome remains remarkably constant, even in a major metabolic adaptation. This seemingly disagrees with results of the DNA microarray analyses, where a rather heterogenous up- or down-regulation of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins implies large changes in the proteome. We propose that the discrepancy between proteome and transcriptional regulation, apart from different translation efficiency, indicates a changed turnover rate of proteins in different physiological conditions.

This allows the investigation of how the transcriptional regulation, reported for this metabolic switch, is reflected at the protein level. Preparation of Mitochondria—For the analysis of the fermentative growth the S. cerevisiae wild type strain BJ1991 (45Jones E.W. Genetics. 1977; 85: 23-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was cultivated on rich YPD (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, and 2% (w/v) d-glucose) and collected at an optical density (600 nm) of 1.1. The glucose concentration of the culture media was monitored. For the study of the respiration a wild type culture was grown in YPD to an optical density (600 nm) of 1–2, pelleted, and transferred to YPG containing 3% (v/v) glycerol instead of d-glucose. After 16 h cells were collected, and mitochondria were prepared as described by Meisinger et al. (46Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in urea buffer (8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol, 0.8% (v/v) carrier ampholytes 3–10, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 14 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein concentration was determined with a commercially available kit (RotiNanoquant, C. Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the method of Bradford (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and protein aliquots (100 and 500 μg) were stored at –20 °C. For transcriptional analyses the RNA was isolated from collected cells using the hot acidic phenol extraction method (84Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston D.D. Moore J.G. Seidman J.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1989Google Scholar). The RNA was then further purified using the Qiagen RNeasy kit, following the RNA cleanup protocol provided by the manufacturer. The RNA was visually inspected on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel to confirm that it was not degraded. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Protein Identification— The protein solution was adjusted with urea buffer to a final volume of 350 μl. Proteins were then transferred into IPG strips (pH 3–10, nonlinear, 18 cm, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) overnight by in-gel rehydration. Isoelectric focusing was carried out at 20 °C with the Multiphor II system (Amersham Biosciences) under paraffin oil for 55 kVh (500 V 500 Vh, 500 V 2500 Vh, 3500 V 10 kVh, 3500 V 42 kVh) (48Buttner K. Bernhardt J. Scharf C. Schmid R. Mader U. Eymann C. Antelmann H. Volker A. Volker U. Hecker M. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 2908-2935Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Prior to separation in the second dimension the strips were equilibrated according to Görg et al. (49Görg A. Boguth G. Obermaier C. Posch A. Weiss W. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The electrophoresis was done overnight in polyacrylamide gels (12.5%) with the Ettan DALT II system (Amersham Biosciences) at 1–2 W per gel and 12 °C. The gels were silver-stained (50Bloom H. Beier H. Gross H. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3742) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the two-dimensional PAGE image analysis software Melanie 3.0 (GeneBio, Geneva, Switzerland). The apparent isoelectric points (pI) and molecular masses of the proteins were calculated with Melanie 3.0 (GeneBio) using identified proteins with known parameters as a reference. The same software was used for the comparison of fermentative and respiratory protein pattern. An expression change was considered significant if the intensity of the corresponding spot differed reproducibly more than 3-fold. Changes in protein abundance were compared with the transcriptional data of the same samples. Excised spots were digested in-gel and identified from the peptide fingerprints as described elsewhere (85Miinalainen I.J. Chen Z.J. Torkko J.M. Pirila P.L. Sormunen R.T. Bergmann U. Qin Y.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20154-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The identification of a protein was accepted if the peptides (mass tolerance, 20 ppm) covered at least 30% of the complete sequence. A sequence coverage between 30 and 20% or a sequence coverage below 20% for protein fragments was only accepted if at least three main peaks of the mass spectrum matched with the sequence and the number of weak intensity peaks was clearly reduced. Monoclonal antibodies were obtained as a gift from Alexander Tzagoloff (anti-Kgd1p), Benedikt Westermann (anti-Aco1p), and Bernard D. Lemire (anti-Sdh2p). Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis—Experimental procedures for GeneChip were performed according to the Affymetrix Gene-Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. In essence, using 10 μg of total RNA as template double-stranded DNA was synthesized by means of the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) and T7-(dT)24 primer. The DNA was purified using GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In vitro transcription was performed to produce biotin-labeled cRNA using a BioArray HighYield RNA Transcription Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Biotinylated cRNA was cleaned with an GeneChip Sample Cleanup Module (Qiagen), fragmented to 35–200 nucleotides, and hybridized to Affymetrix Yeast genome S98 array, which contains ∼6400 S. cerevisiae genes. After being washed, the array was stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Staining signal was amplified by biotinylated anti-streptavidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and second staining with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and then scanned on HP GeneArray scanner. The expression data was analyzed using Affymetrix MicroArray Suite version 5.0. Signal intensities of all probe sets were scaled to the target value of 500. Analysis of Protein Function and Sequence—Information about function, subcellular localization, and specific parameters of the identified proteins were obtained from the databases SWISS-PROT (www.expasy.org/sprot/), MIPS (mips.gsf.de/proj/yeast/CYGD/db/index.html), and SGD (genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/). Duplication of genes was analyzed with the Yeast Gene Duplications data base (acer.gen.tcd.ie/~khwolfe/yeast/nova/index.html). The subcellular localization and the putative MTS cleavage site of mitochondrial proteins were predicted by TargetP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/), PSORT II (psort.nibb.ac.jp/form2.html), and MITO-PROT (www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/cgi-bin/proj/medgen/mitofilter). The expected position (pI and molecular mass) of the protein spot within the two-dimensional gel was calculated with Compute pI/Mw (us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). Grand average of hydropathicity index (GRAVY) scores were predicted with SOSUI (sosui.proteome.bio.tuat.ac.jp/sosuiframe0.html). Mitochondria were purified from yeast cultures grown on a sufficient glucose concentration (at the beginning of the culture time 2% glucose and 1.2% glucose at the time of cell collection) to maintain glucose repression (Refs. 33DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar and 46Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal.

This resulted in about 800 intense spots detectable in a silver-stained two-dimensional gel. A two-dimensional pattern (reference gel) characteristic for fermentative growth, obtained from five mitochondrial preparations, is shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding two-dimensional gels specific for respiratory metabolism were obtained from seven mitochondrial preparations after growth on glycerol. Analyses of the detected proteins by tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analyses (see “Experimental Procedures” for details) allowed the identification of 253 proteins from 459 spots (Table I).Fig. 1Two-dimensional reference map of S. cerevisiae wild type BJ1991 mitochondria characteristic for fermentation.

https://openalex.org/W1996160406,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is followed by massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate secondary cellular damage. Low molecular weight antioxidants (LMWA) constitute one of the defense mechanisms of the brain, and their levels correlate with post-TBI outcome. Melatonin, the main pineal hormone, possesses antioxidant properties. We investigated the effects of melatonin on neurobehavioral recovery, brain LMWA, and activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and AP-1 in mice subjected to closed head injury (CHI). Given 1 h after CHI, melatonin facilitated recovery during at least 1 wk (P<0.05) and decreased lesion size by approximately twofold (P<0.01). The dose response displayed a bell-shape, i.e., neuroprotection was achieved with 5 but not 1 or 10 mg/kg. At the neuroprotective dose, melatonin treatment was associated with sustained (4 days) elevation of brain LMWA, including ascorbic acid (P<0.05). In contrast, LMWA were unaffected by the administration of the neuroprotective endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. Furthermore, melatonin did not alter early phase (24 h) CHI-induced activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1; however, it blocked the robust late-phase (8 days) activation of NF-kappaB and decreased that of AP-1 to below basal levels. Our results demonstrate that melatonin induces neuroprotection, presumably via potentiation of brain antioxidants and attenuation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2076503506,"Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations are increased in states of insulin resistance and impair endothelial function. Because the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, we examined selected, purified FFAs' (100-300 micromol/l, 24-48 h) action on apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and associated gene/protein expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Stearic acid, but not oleic acid, time and concentration dependently increased endothelial apoptosis by fivefold (n=6, P<0.01), whereas polyunsaturated FFAs (PUFAs; linoleic, gamma-linolenic, and arachidonic acid) exerted proapoptotic activity only at 300 micromol/l (P<0.05). Proapoptotic FFA action increased with FFAs' number of double bonds and with protein expression of the apoptosis promotor bak. The G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (n=6, P<0.05) induced by stearic acid (+14%) and PUFAs (+30%) is reflected by up-regulation of p21(WAF-1/Cip1). In addition, all FFAs concentration dependently reduced (P<0.05) gene/protein expression of clusterin (-54%), NF-kappaB's inhibitor, IkappaBalpha (-50%), endothelin-1 (-44%), and endothelial NO synthase (-44%). Plasma samples obtained from individuals with elevated plasma FFAs (372+/-22 micromol/l) increased endothelial apoptosis by 4.2-fold (P<0.001, n=10) compared with intra-individually matched low plasma FFA (56+/-21 micromol/l) conditions, underlining the results obtained by defined FFA stimulation. In conclusion, FFA structure differently affects endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis, both representing key factors in the development of micro- and macrovascular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2106371645,"Elevated tumor cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression is associated with increased angiogenesis, tumor invasion and promotion of tumor cell resistance to apoptosis. The mechanism(s) by which COX-2 exerts its cytoprotective effects are not completely understood but may be due to an imbalance of pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression. To analyze COX-2-dependent gene expression and apoptosis, we created cell lines constitutively expressing COX-2 cDNA in sense and antisense orientations. Whereas COX-2 sense cells have significantly heightened resistance to radiation and drug-induced apoptosis, COX-2 antisense cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis induction. We found that the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin correlated positively with COX-2 expression. A COX-2-dependent modulation of survivin ubiquitination led to its stabilization in COX-2 overexpressing cells, and this effect was replicated by exogenous PGE2 treatment of parental tumor cells. In contrast to previous studies in other cell types, in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells survivin was expressed in a cell cycle-independent manner. When established in SCID mice in vivo, COX-2 antisense-derived tumors had significantly decreased survivin levels while COX-2 sense-derived tumors demonstrated elevated levels compared with controls. In accord with these findings, survivin and COX-2 were frequently upregulated and co-expressed in human lung cancers in situ."

https://openalex.org/W2099397034,"The chemokine CXCL10 is produced by many inflammatory cells found in the diseased lung and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present study demonstrates elevated CXCL10 protein in the lungs of COPD patients, which appears histologically in airway smooth muscle (hASM). In primary cultured hASM cells taken from normal donors, CXCL10 protein expression was induced by IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, cytokines reported as elevated in COPD, and a synergistic response was obtained when they were combined. TNF-alpha stimulation of hASM enhanced accumulation of CXCL10 mRNA, indicating regulation at the transcriptional level, while IFN-gamma stimulation resulted in a smaller accumulation of CXCL10 mRNA. When these cytokines were applied simultaneously, an additive effect was obtained. TNF-alpha-induced CXCL10 expression in hASM was dependent on NFkappaB activation, and a salicylanilide NFkappaB inhibitor blocked the CXCL10 expression. In contrast, IFN-gamma stimulation resulted in transient NFkappaB activation, and the inhibitor had little effect on CXCL10 expression. When these cytokines were added simultaneously, NFkappaB was activated earlier and lasted longer, and the effect was blocked by the inhibitor. These data demonstrate a potential active role for hASM in pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as COPD by producing CXCL10."
https://openalex.org/W2048978352,"p94 (also called calpain 3) is the skeletal muscle-specific calpain and is considered to be a “modulator protease” in various cellular processes. Analysis of p94 at the protein level is an urgent issue because the loss of p94 protease activity causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. In this study, we enzymatically characterized one alternatively spliced variant of p94, p94:exons 6–15–16– (p94Δ), which lacks two of the p94-specific insertion sequences. In contrast to p94, which has hardly been studied enzymatically due to its rapid, thorough, and apparently Ca2+-independent autolytic activity, p94Δ was stably expressed in COS and insect cells. p94Δ showed Ca2+-dependent caseinolytic and autolytic activities and an inhibitor spectrum similar to those of the conventional calpains. However, calpastatin did not inhibit p94Δ and is a substrate for p94Δ, which is consistent with the properties of p94, presenting p94 as a possible regulator of the conventional calpain system. We also established a semi-quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay using the calpastatin sequence specifically to measure p94 activity. This method detects the activity of COS-expressed p94 and p94Δ, suggesting that it has potential to evaluate p94 activity in vivo and in the diagnosis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A. p94 (also called calpain 3) is the skeletal muscle-specific calpain and is considered to be a “modulator protease” in various cellular processes.

Two representative members, μ- and m-calpains, the so-called “conventional” calpains, are ubiquitously expressed and have been well characterized. These two calpains consist of a distinct larger catalytic subunit containing a protease domain (μ- or m-calpain large subunit, abbreviated as μCL 1The abbreviations used are: μCL, μ-calpain large subunit; mCL, m-calpain large subunit; p94Δ, p94:exons 6–15–16–; LGMD2A, limbgirdle muscular dystrophy type 2A; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; 2-ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CSTN, calpastatin; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescence protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescence protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HSP, heat shock proteins; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl.1The abbreviations used are: μCL, μ-calpain large subunit; mCL, m-calpain large subunit; p94Δ, p94:exons 6–15–16–; LGMD2A, limbgirdle muscular dystrophy type 2A; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; 2-ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CSTN, calpastatin; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescence protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescence protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; HSP, heat shock proteins; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl. or mCL, respectively) and a common smaller regulatory subunit (abbreviated as 30K according to its molecular weight). On the basis of amino acid similarities, the large and small subunits have been described as consisting of four and two domains, respectively, which agrees with the recently resolved three-dimensional structure of m-calpain (10.Hosfield M.C. Else S.J. Davies L.P. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6680-6889Crossref Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 11.Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H.

Conventional calpain has a specific endogenous proteinaceous inhibitor, calpastatin (12.Todd B. Moore D. Deivanayagam C.C. Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K. Narayana S.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 131-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Calpastatin contains four repetitive inhibitory units, each of which inhibits equimolar amounts of conventional calpain. The conserved reactive site interacts with the calpain protease domain, whereas the flanking α-helical regions bind to domains IV and VI of the large and small subunits, respectively. Synthetic oligopeptides (see Fig. 4D) corresponding to the calpastatin-reactive site specifically inhibit conventional calpain efficiently, although their inhibitory activity is weaker than that of the full-length inhibitory unit. The primary structure of p94 (also called calpain 3) is very similar to those of μCL and mCL throughout the entire molecule, beyond the p94-specific sequences NS, IS1, and IS2 (13.Sorimachi H.

Previous studies have revealed several unique characteristics of p94 that diverge greatly from those of the conventional calpains. For instance, 1) p94 undergoes very rapid, thorough, and apparently Ca2+-independent autolysis in solution (halflife in vitro is less than 10 min) (14.Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C.

The predominant expression of p94 in skeletal muscle, where its mRNA levels are ∼10 times higher than those of μCL and mCL, indicates the physiological importance of p94 in that tissue (13.Sorimachi H.

Consistent with this, a defect in the p94 gene causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), suggesting that p94 functions are indispensable for proper muscle functions (22.Richard I.

Therefore, it has become an urgent issue to determine the in vivo substrates of p94 to gain insight into the physiological functions of p94 and its relationships to molecular mechanisms of LGMD2A (27.Ono Y. Hata S. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Pochet R. Donator R. Haiech C. Heizmann C. Gerke V. Calcium: The Molecular Basis of Calcium Action in Biology and Medicine. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands2000: 443-464Google Scholar). However, the autolytic activity of p94 has hampered the study of the p94 protein. Therefore, we have focused on identifying the conditions that will allow us to analyze the proteolytic activity of p94. We have observed previously that deletion of either the IS1 or IS2 region, which is mainly encoded by exon 6 or exons 15 + 16, respectively, prevents the rapid autolysis of p94 (14.Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In accord with this, we have recently shown that alternatively spliced variants of p94 that lack either exon 6, exons 15 + 16, or all of these are detected as non-autolyzed forms, unlike the full-length p94, when they are recombinantly expressed in COS cells (16.Herasse M. Ono Y. Fougerousse F. Kimura E. Stockholm D. Beley C. Montarras D. Pinset C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Beckmann J.S. Richard I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4047-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In this study, we chose one of the splicing variants, p94:exons 6–15–16– (abbreviated as p94Δ in this paper, see Fig. 1A), which is produced from a transcript lacking exons 6, 15, and 16 and therefore lacks most of the p94-specific insertion sequences, IS1 and IS2, for in vitro enzymatic characterization on the basis of its stability and expression efficiency. The enzymatic properties of p94Δ were compared with those of p94, and μ- and m-calpains. We thus identified several novel enzymatic properties of p94. Notably, neither p94 nor p94Δ is inhibited by calpastatin, and moreover, both hydrolyze calpastatin. These results led us to predict that p94 participates in the regulation of the conventional calpain-calpastatin system in skeletal muscle. We used these findings to establish a calpastatin-based fluorescence assay specifically to measure p94 protease activity, showing a possibility of application of this assay as a diagnostic tool for LGMD2A. Materials—Enzymes used for manipulating recombinant DNA were purchased from Takara Shuzo Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). The cDNAs for mouse p94/calpain 3 and p94:exons 6–15–16– (p94Δ) (16.Herasse M. Ono Y.

Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies 2C4 and 12A2, which recognize N terminus and the region around the catalytic residue Asn-358 of p94, respectively, were purchased from NovoCastra (Newcastle, UK). Monoclonal antibodies that recognize μCL and mCL were purchased from Biomol and Chemicon, respectively. Recombinant domain 1 of human calpastatin protein and the peptides corresponding to its reactive site were purchased from Takara Shuzo (7316 and SP007) and Sigma (C9181). Recombinant Proteins Expressed in Insect Cells—The cDNA for p94Δ or p94:C129S, an active-site mutant, was inserted into the pFastBac1 vector using appropriate restriction enzyme sites. Recombinant baculovirus was generated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sf-9 cells were cultured and infected as described previously (28.Masumoto H. Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Nishino T. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were then shaken vigorously at 27 °C for 50 h at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified following the procedures described previously (28.Masumoto H. Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Nishino T. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with minor modifications as follows. The harvested cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The pellets were suspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME)) containing 0.1 mm leupeptin, and the cells were homogenized with a French press (SLM Aminco). The cell lysate was then ultracentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 40 min at 2 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified from the supernatant by the AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences) and placed in a cold chamber, using successive rounds of column chromatography: DEAE-Toyopearl (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), MonoQ (Amersham Biosciences), HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-200, and MonoQ. Fractions containing recombinant proteins were determined by Western blotting analysis and caseinolytic assays (for p94Δ). Recombinant μ- and m-calpains were prepared in the manner described in Ref 28.Masumoto H. Yoshizawa T. Sorimachi H. Nishino T. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biochem.

Bacterial Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—cDNA fragments corresponding to two different N2A regions of connectin/titin, IgI80-81, and IgI82-83, were amplified by PCR from human skeletal muscle cDNA and cloned into the pET vector. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (29.Sorimachi H. Freiburg A. Kolmerer B. Ishiura S. Stier G. Gregorio C.C. Labeit D. Linke W.A. Suzuki K. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A bacterial expression vector for the fusion protein generated from enhanced cyan and yellow fluorescence proteins (ECFP and EYFP, respectively) linked by a part of rabbit calpastatin domain 1 (residues 175–255, GenBank™ accession number A26615), Y-C-CSTN, was created by fusing the PCR-amplified coding sequences of ECFP, EYFP, and calpastatin and cloning the construct into the pET16b vector. The recombinant protein, Y-C-CSTN, expressed in E. coli. BL21(DE3), was purified by His-Bind Quick 900 Cartridges (Novagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein fractions eluted from the cartridge were desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated by Centricon (Millipore, MA). Protease Activity Assay—Caseinolytic activity of p94Δ was measured essentially according to Ref. 30.Ishiura S. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. Imahori K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar. In brief, the composition of the standard assay solution was 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 25 mm 2-ME, 10 mm CaCl2. CaCl2 was replaced with 10 mm EDTA for the control reaction. The reaction was carried out by incubating either p94Δ (3 μg), μ-calpain (0.2 μg), or m-calpain (0.4 μg) in 50 μl of the standard assay solution containing 3 mg/ml casein under the conditions indicated. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The tubes were incubated on ice for 20 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the A280 of the supernatant was measured. An increase in A280 of 1.0 in 1 h was defined as 1 unit of caseinolytic activity. The effect of Ca2+ on p94Δ was determined under the assay conditions described above, varying either the concentration of Ca2+, temperature, or pH. Tris acetate buffer was used instead of Tris-Cl buffer to measure the effect of pH. Protease inhibitors were added to the standard assay solutions at the concentrations indicated. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 45 min, and the caseinolytic activity was determined as described. The effect of each inhibitor was evaluated relative to the inhibitory effect of 10 mm EDTA set to 100. To determine the substrate hydrolyzing activity of p94Δ, various proteins were incubated with p94Δ in the standard assay solution. Hydrolysis of the proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining or Western blotting. In the proteolytic assay using Y-C-CSTN as substrate, 2 μg of Y-C-CSTN was incubated with p94Δ in the presence of 15 mm Ca2+ for 0–45 min at 37 °C in a solution containing 0.1 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm 2-ME in a volume of less than 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 m EDTA (pH 8.0) or an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. The fluorescence of the samples was measured by excitation at 434 nm (10 nm bandwidth), and the emission spectra were collected from 450 to 600 nm using an RF-1500 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The ratio of fluorescence at 477 nm to that at 527 nm was used to define proteolytic activity. To profile the dose-dependent changes in fluorescent signals, 0–2 μg of p94Δ was incubated with Y-C-CSTN (0.6 μg) in a buffer consisting of 28 mm Ca2+, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.1 mg/ml calpastatin (CSTN) domain 1, 20 mm 2-ME, and 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) in a total volume of 15 μl for 5–45 min. Cell Culture and Assays—COS-7 cells were maintained and transfected with each plasmid construct as described previously (24.Ono Y. Shimada H. Sorimachi H. Richard I. Saido T.C. Beckmann J.S. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17073-17078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was prepared by sonicating harvested cells in a solution consisting of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 25 mm 2-ME, 10 mm EDTA, and the proteinase inhibitors 10 μm Z-D-CH2-DCB, 10 μm YVAD-CMK, 1 mm AEBSF, 2 μm calpastatin peptide C9181, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). To detect p94 activity in the cell lysate, the following protease inhibitors were added to the standard assay mixture described above to inhibit the conventional calpains and other proteases: 10 μm Z-D-CH2-DCB, 10 μm YVAD-CMK, 1 mm AEBSF, 2 μm calpastatin peptide C9181, and 2 mm PMSF. The same number of COS-7 cells (2–3 × 105) transfected with each plasmid was incubated with Y-C-CSTN in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ or 10 mm EDTA in a total volume of 20 μl for 90 min at 37 °C, after which 0.5 ml of 0.1 m EDTA was added. To detect the autolysis of p94 and p94Δ by Western blotting, the reaction was stopped by the addition of half a volume of 3× SDS sample buffer. Other Protein Experiments—SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and subsequent procedures were performed as described previously (14.Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Inc.), as recommended by the supplier, and incubated with specific antisera as indicated. The secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Nichirei Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The antibody complexes were visualized using peroxidase substrate (POD Immunostaining Kit; Wako Inc., Osaka, Japan). To examine the autolytic activity of p94Δ, 1 μg of p94Δ was incubated in 15 μl of solution containing 100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 25 mm 2-ME, and 10 mm CaCl2, at either 0 or 30 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining or Western blotting, as described above. Protein concentrations were measured using a DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad) with BSA as the standard. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein fragments was determined on an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer type 477A/120A, according to manufacturer's instructions and the method described previously (31.Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S. Kawasaki H. Kolmerer B. Kimura S. Labeit S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), with some modification. Expression and Purification of p94Δ and p94:C129S—Recombinantly expressed p94Δ and p94:C129S (a protease-inactive point mutant of p94/calpain 3) were purified by four successive rounds of column chromatography, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Fig. 1A for structures of p94Δ and p94:C129S). The purity of these products was estimated to be more than 90% based on a CBB-stained gel after SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 1B. The N-terminal sequence of purified p94Δ revealed that, after 2 weeks storage at 2 °C, most of the purified p94Δ had been hydrolyzed on the N terminus of Ala-34 (Fig. 1A, arrow [4]) and that anti-pNS antiserum, raised against a peptide corresponding to N-terminal residues 2–19 (14.Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), no longer recognized the purified protein. The p94Δ sample was recognized by anti-pNS antiserum just after purification. p94:C129S, which was purified by a procedure identical to that used for p94Δ, showed no hydrolysis at the N terminus. Therefore, we concluded that the hydrolysis of p94Δ was autolytic. This autolysis occurred in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, even at 2 °C, which is consistent with our previous observation that p94 rapidly undergoes autolysis in the presence of excess EDTA (14.Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yields of totally purified p94Δ and p94:C129S proteins were ∼1.2 and 2.4 mg/liter culture, respectively. Although the N-terminal autolysis of p94Δ did not require Ca2+, p94Δ showed Ca2+-dependent caseinolytic activity (see Fig. 2; details are discussed later). Analysis of the degraded casein by SDS-PAGE indicated that p94Δ degrades casein in a manner similar to the caseinolysis by the conventional calpains (data not shown). The specific activity of p94Δ determined by caseinolysis was 9.0 units/mg, which is ∼1/80 of the value for recombinant human m-calpain determined with the same expression and purification systems (28.Masumoto H.

However, because most of the purified p94Δ underwent N-terminal autolysis as described above, we concluded that very low specific caseinolytic activity is one of the enzymatic properties of p94Δ and does not result from partial denaturation or aggregation of the protein. Enzymatic Properties of p94Δ: Effects of Temperature, pH, Ca2+ Concentration, and Protease Inhibitors—The caseinolytic activity of p94Δ was examined while varying either temperature, pH, or Ca2+ concentration and compared with the corresponding parameters for recombinant μ- and m-calpains. Fig. 2A shows the temperature dependence of p94Δ caseinolytic activity. The initial rate of p94Δ activity increased with temperature. In the range of temperatures examined here, the activity of p94Δ increased persistently with time up to 60 min. The optimal temperature for 20 min of incubation of p94Δ was about 42 °C, which contrasts with the decrease in activity observed for both μ- and m-calpains at temperatures above 25 °C (Fig. 2B). Although p94Δ shows maximum activity at around pH 7.5, as do other calpains, p94Δ maintains its activity even at pH 10 (Fig. 2C). Ca2+ dependence showed that a pCa for half-maximal activity for p94Δ was 2.9, which is lower than those of μ- and m-calpains (3.7 and 3.3, respectively) (Fig. 2D). The effects of various inhibitors on the activity of p94Δ and μ- and m-calpains were investigated (Table I). p94Δ has a spectrum of inhibitors very similar to those of μ- and m-calpains, except calpastatin. The calpastatin fragment inhibited μ- and m-calpains completely at molar ratios of almost 1:1, whereas p94Δ was not inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of the calpastatin fragment or calpastatin-related peptides (Fig. 2E). In fact, calpastatin was shown to be a substrate for p94Δ (see below). Because the IS1 region is a target for p94 autolysis (31.Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Tomioka S. Sorimachi H. Jeong S.Y. Amano S.

https://openalex.org/W2167228236,"Regulation of the Na/K ATPase by protein kinases is model-specific. We have observed a profound activation of the sarcolemmal Na/K ATPase during cardiac ischemia, which is masked by an inhibitor of the enzyme in the cytosol. The aim of these studies was to characterize the pathways involved in this activation in the Langendorff-perfused rat heart. Na/K ATPase activity was determined by measuring ouabain-sensitive phosphate generation by cardiac homogenates at 37 degrees C. In isolated sarcolemma, ischemia (30 min) caused a substantial activation of the Na/K ATPase compared with aerobic controls, which was abolished by perfusing the heart with staurosporine or H89. However, the alpha1 subunit of the Na/K ATPase was not phosphorylated during ischemia. The sarcolemmal protein phospholemman (PLM) was found associated with the Na/K ATPase alpha1 and beta1 but not alpha2 subunits, and PLM increased its association with the catalytic subunit of PKA following ischemia. In vitro 14-3-3 binding assays indicated that PLM was phosphorylated following ischemia. These results indicate that the ischemia-induced activation of the Na/K ATPase is indirect, through phosphorylation of PLM, which is an integral part of the Na/K ATPase enzyme complex in the heart. The role of PLM is analogous to phospholamban in regulating the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2026612033,"A single-molecule transcription assay has been developed that allows, for the first time, the direct observation of promoter binding, initiation, and elongation by a single RNA polymerase (RNAP) molecule in real-time. To promote DNA binding and transcription initiation, a DNA molecule tethered between two optically trapped beads was held near a third immobile surface bead sparsely coated with RNAP. By driving the optical trap holding the upstream bead with a triangular oscillation while measuring the position of both trapped beads, we observed the onset of promoter binding, promoter escape (productive initiation), and processive elongation by individual RNAP molecules. After DNA template release, transcription re-initiation on the same DNA template is possible; thus, multiple enzymatic turnovers by an individual RNAP molecule can be observed. Using bacteriophage T7 RNAP, a commonly used RNAP paradigm, we observed the association and dissociation (koff= 2.9 s–1) of T7 RNAP and promoter DNA, the transition to the elongation mode (kfor = 0.36 s–1), and the processive synthesis (kpol = 43 nt s–1) and release of a gene-length RNA transcript (∼1200 nt). The transition from initiation to elongation is much longer than the mean lifetime of the binary T7 RNAP-promoter DNA complex (koff > kfor), identifying a rate-limiting step between promoter DNA binding and promoter escape.

However, the details of transcription initiation are difficult to elucidate using conventional solution methods because (i) initiation consists of a series of transient intermediate steps between promoter binding and elongation, and (ii) within a population of actively transcribing RNAP molecules, only a small fraction is engaged in initiation at any given time. Most biochemical studies of transcription initiation utilize solution conditions which allow only a single enzymatic turnover, e.g. RNAP halted at a known position in the DNA sequence by ribonucleotide starvation or rapid mixing/quenching of the transcription assay. An attempt has been made to synchronize a population of T7 RNAP molecules in solution (1Protacio R.U. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 458-472Google Scholar); however, synchrony is rapidly lost as the transitions between states are probabilistic events. The challenges associated with synchronizing a population of molecules can be avoided by making measurements on a single molecule. Previous single-molecule studies of transcription by Escherichia coli RNAP have only allowed DNA binding (2Harada Y. Funatsu T. Murakami K. Nonoyama Y. Ishihama A. Yanagida T. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 709-715Google Scholar), elongation (artificially halted by ribonucleotide starvation) (3Schafer D.A. Gelles J. Sheetz M.P. Landick R. Nature. 1991; 352: 444-448Google Scholar, 4Yin H.

T7 RNAP is a common paradigm for studies of transcription initiation, as it is a single-subunit enzyme sharing many of the biochemical characteristics of the more complex multi-subunit RNAPs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes (10Chamberlin M. McGrath J. Waskell L. Nature. 1970; 228: 227-231Google Scholar, 11Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Google Scholar). Like those more complex RNAPs, T7 RNAP-mediated transcription initiation occurs in several distinct steps (12Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 117-123Google Scholar). First, the RNAP interacts intermittently and weakly with nonspecific sites on DNA until the promoter DNA sequence has been found and recognized through specific protein-DNA interactions. This specific, promoter-bound complex is known as the “closed” complex. Subsequently, the DNA helix undergoes RNAP-induced bending and melting in the promoter region to form the “open” complex (13Újvári A. Martin C.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1173-1184Google Scholar). In the presence of a single initiating ribonucleotide, abortive RNA synthesis occurs with the repeated release of short RNA chains 7–12 nt in length. After formation of the stable initial transcribing complex (14Liu C. Martin C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2725-2731Google Scholar), consisting of the nascent RNA transcript (∼10 nt), DNA template, and RNAP, promoter escape and transition to a stable, processive elongation complex (EC) occurs. Recent studies of T7 RNAP using a variety of solution biochemical techniques (15Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Google Scholar, 16Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3133-3144Google Scholar, 23Sastry S. Ross B.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4972-4981Google Scholar) have addressed some of the questions about the mechanism of initiation. It is known that the 17 promoters for T7 RNAP within the T7 genome (24Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Google Scholar) can be split into two groups, called class II and class III. These promoters differ in strength, with the class III promoters being stronger than class II (25Ikeda R.A. Lin A.C. Clarke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2640-2649Google Scholar). There are no significant differences in the stabilities of the binary complexes of T7 RNAP with the two classes of promoter in the absence of ribonucleotides (25Ikeda R.A. Lin A.C. Clarke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2640-2649Google Scholar). It has also been shown that formation of the initial collisional closed complex is diffusion-limited (20Újvári A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Google Scholar) and that local unwinding/melting of the DNA to form the open complex is rapid (19Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15715-15725Google Scholar), implying that neither of these steps is normally rate-limiting for transcription initiation by T7 RNAP. Promoter strand separation in the open complex is driven by binding of the +2 ribonucleotide (26Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Google Scholar). On a linear DNA template, the open complex is known to be unstable in both the absence and presence of initiating ribonucleotides (18Jia Y.P. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Google Scholar, 27Villemain J. Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 958-977Google Scholar). We used an optical tweezers-based force transducer to measure the mechanical interactions that occur between T7 RNAP and DNA during the whole course of transcription at the single-molecule level. To observe both intermittent and processive types of mechanical interaction, i.e. transcription initiation and elongation, respectively, we adopted an experimental geometry similar to that first used to study actomyosin interactions (28Finer J.T. Simmons R.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 113-119Google Scholar, 29Molloy J.E. Burns J.E. Kendrick-Jones J. Tregear R.T. White D.C.S. Nature. 1995; 378: 209-212Google Scholar). This “three-bead” geometry involves holding the DNA at either end by using two latex micro-beads as “handles,” which are manipulated using independently controlled optical tweezers (Fig. 1). The DNA can then be positioned above a third, surface-affixed bead to which RNAP has been coupled at a suitably low surface density. An additional advantage of the assay is that multiple transcription runs by one RNAP molecule on a single DNA template are followed, allowing several enzymatic turnovers by an individual enzyme molecule to be observed. Using this assay, the kinetics of promoter DNA dissociation, transcription initiation and elongation for T7 RNAP have been studied. Construction and Tethering of DNA Template—A 16,912 bp DNA fragment from bacteriophage T7 DNA (Fluka/Sigma) containing the ϕ13 promoter and no known termination sequences was labeled at the downstream end with biotin and at the upstream end with digoxygenin. Full-length T7 DNA was digested with SfiI (New England Biolabs) and then labeled at the 3′ ends with biotin-dCTP (Sigma) using terminal transferase (Invitrogen). To prevent further 3′ extension, excess dideoxy-TTP (Roche Applied Science) was added at the end of the terminal transferase reaction. This DNA product was digested with StuI (New England Biolabs) to yield unblocked 3′ ends. Differentially end-labeled DNA molecules were generated by labeling these fresh 3′ ends with digoxygenin-dUTP (Roche Applied Science) using terminal transferase. Finally, to prevent other labeled fragments from forming tethers, the DNA mixture was digested with BclI (New England Biolabs). The biotinylated downstream end of the DNA fragment was attached to a 1.0 μm streptavidin-coated polystyrene latex micro-bead (Interfacial Dynamics) by incubation on ice for 1 h in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl). Fluorescent anti-digoxygenin Fab/TRITC-BSA-coated (Roche Applied Science, Sigma) 1.1 μm micro-beads (Interfacial Dynamics) were added to this mixture. Attachment of the digoxygenin-labeled upstream end of the DNA fragment to one of these fluorescent beads was achieved using a custombuilt optical tweezers apparatus capable of generating two independent optical traps (30Veigel C. Bartoo M.L. White D.C.S. Sparrow J.C. Molloy J.E. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1424-1438Google Scholar). A non-fluorescent, streptavidin-coated, DNA-tagged bead was captured by using one of the optical traps, and a fluorescent anti-digoxygenin-coated bead was captured in the second optical trap. Non-fluorescent and fluorescent beads were visualized using bright-field and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively. The traps were brought close together, and the beads were incubated for 5–10 min, after which time they were found to be connected by DNA. The fluorescently labeled bead allowed the upstream end of the DNA molecule to be identified prior to transcription initiation by viewing in epifluorescence mode. To ensure that the observed connection was formed by only a single molecule of DNA, force versus extension data were obtained and fitted using the worm-like chain model (31Bustamante C. Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Smith S.B. Science. 1994; 265: 1599-1600Google Scholar), yielding Lo and Lp. Only tethers exhibiting approximately the expected Lo of the 16,912 bp fragment (5.72 μm) and the known Lp of DNA (∼50 nm; Ref. 32Hagerman P.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 265-286Google Scholar) in high monovalent salt were used to observe T7 RNAP activity. Immobilization of T7 RNAP—His12-tagged T7 RNAP was overexpressed from the plasmid pDL21 (33He B. Rong M. Lyakhov D. Gartenstein H. Diaz G. Castagna R. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 142-151Google Scholar) transformed into E. coli BL21 (Novagen) and purified using established protocols (34Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Google Scholar, 35Zawadzki V. Gross H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1948Google Scholar). The activity of the purified T7 RNAP was determined from bulk in vitro transcription assays with bacteriophage T7 DNA as a template (see below). 2.0 μm micro-beads (Interfacial Dynamics) were coated with protein-A (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These beads were incubated with mouse anti-His6 IgG2a (Amersham Biosciences) in transcription buffer-NTPs buffer. After washing to remove unbound antibodies, these beads were incubated with the His12-tagged T7 RNAP and then extensively washed with binding buffer to remove unbound T7 RNAP. They were then assayed as a suspension in vitro to determine the activity and loading of bound T7 RNAP. For single-molecule experiments, the T7 RNAP-coated beads were adsorbed to the nitrocellulose-coated coverslip of the microscope flow-cell. This surface was then blocked with acetylated BSA (Sigma). The solution concentration of T7 RNAP required to yield “active” bead preparations was determined empirically and tailored so that approximately one of 5–10 beads yielded DNA interactions in the single-molecule assay. Observation of T7 RNAP-DNA Interactions—A mixture of 1.0 μm DNA-labeled, streptavidin-coated micro-beads and 1.1 μm anti-digoxygenin-coated micro-beads was introduced into a flow-cell containing T7 RNAP-coated 2.0 μm micro-beads attached to the coverslip. A single DNA molecule was captured between two beads in binding buffer as described above. The flow-cell buffer was then exchanged for transcription buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 μm NTPs). The concentration of ribonucleotides was kept low to slow down the rate of initiation (Km for the initiating ribonucleotide GTP = 600 μm; Ref. 36Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2760-2762Google Scholar), while maximizing open complex stability on the linear, torsionally relaxed DNA template (27Villemain J. Guajardo R. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 958-977Google Scholar, 37Diaz G.A. Rong M. McAllister W.T. Durbin R.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10837-10843Google Scholar). The DNA molecule was stretched to x/Lo = 0.75 and maneuvered so that the central region was touching a 2.0 μm T7 RNAP-coated bead (starting positions of the optically trapped beads relative to surface bead were controlled and identical in each experiment). A triangular waveform (5 Hz frequency and 1 μm amplitude) was then applied to the bead upstream of the ϕ13 promoter, while the position of the downstream bead was monitored using a four-quadrant photodiode detector. Interaction events were detected as a “decoupling” of the motion of the passive downstream bead from the driven upstream bead. In the case of elongation events, the motion of the downstream bead along the x axis was corrected for DNA elasticity using the worm-like chain model discussed above (with Lp = 50 nm) and median filtered (12.5 Hz). We assumed that the T7 RNAP-bead and DNA-bead linkages did not significantly influence the total elasticity of the system. The position resolution of the downstream bead was limited by the root-mean-squared displacement because of Brownian motion. With a relative tether extension x/Lo = 0.75 and a trap stiffness of 0.01–0.02 pN nm–1, the full root-mean-squared noise before filtering was ∼11 nm, corresponding to ∼33 bp. The downstream bead displacement data was converted to transcript length in nucleotides by using a B-helix rise of 0.338 nm bp–1. Bulk Assays of Transcription—T7 RNAP activity was determined from in vitro transcription assays by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity from [3H]CTP or [3H]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) into acid-precipitable material (38Chamberlin M.J. Nierman W.C. Wiggs J. Neff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10061-10069Google Scholar). A DNA template with only the ϕ13 promoter present was prepared for the bulk assays using the Master-Amp PCR kit (Epicenter Technologies). The run-off transcript (7058 nt) generated was visualized by ethidium bromide staining (data not shown) after denaturing gel electrophoresis. Single-Molecule Assay for the Transcription Cycle—Before each experiment, a single 16,912-bp DNA molecule (Lo = 5.72 μm) containing a class III T7 promoter was tethered between two optically trapped micro-beads in a known orientation (Fig. 1). The tether was attached to the beads at each end through only one DNA strand, thus allowing independent rotation of the DNA duplex relative to the attached optically trapped beads. However, significant torsional stress may develop in a linear, anchored DNA template if the rate of RNA synthesis, i.e. axial rotation of the DNA strand, exceeds the rate at which transcription-generated supercoils diffuse off the free DNA end (39Nelson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14342-14347Google Scholar). To begin an experiment, the buffer was exchanged for one that would support transcription (250 μm for each NTP), and the DNA molecule was stretched to x/Lo = 0.75. The partially extended DNA molecule was maneuvered so that the central region was in close proximity to a third, T7 RNAP-coated, micro-bead attached to a microscope coverslip. The starting positions of the optically trapped beads relative to the surface bead were controlled (DNA template centered above and just touching the surface bead) and identical in each experiment. To allow intermittent RNAP-DNA binding interactions to be detected directly, the upstream bead was made to oscillate by applying a triangular waveform displacement to its associated optical trap, and the coupled motion of the downstream bead was monitored with a four-quadrant photodiode detector. Binding interactions were then manifested as changes in the connection stiffness between the two optically trapped beads. Temporal and spatial analysis of these mechanical interactions enabled the measurement of the kinetics of promoter dissociation, transcription initiation, and RNA transcript elongation, as well as the positions at which these interactions occur along the DNA template. As the RNAP molecule remained in close proximity to the DNA tether at all times, this novel methodology also has the added advantage that multiple transcription runs by an individual RNAP molecule on the same DNA template can be followed. Specific and Reversible Promoter DNA Interactions—When the DNA molecule was free from the surface, the motion of the two optically trapped beads was mechanically coupled by the DNA, and the oscillatory motion of the upstream bead was transmitted to the downstream bead (large amplitude regions of Fig. 2, a and b). However, when the DNA bound to a surface-immobilized RNAP molecule, the oscillation in the downstream bead ceased, as it was decoupled from the upstream bead (small amplitude regions of Fig. 2, a and b). Mechanical decoupling was not observed in control experiments where there was no T7 RNAP bound to the surface-immobilized bead (data not shown). A representative histogram of downstream bead positions (n = 44) during binding events (Fig. 2c) shows that these interactions occurred within a preferred region of the DNA (∼ 20 nm) close to the known ϕ13 promoter site. Each active T7 RNAP-coated surface bead was characterized by a unique downstream bead position where DNA binding occurred (Fig. 2c), implying that a single unique T7 RNAP molecule was probed repeatedly in each experimental data trace. A total of 690 such decoupling events were observed, ranging in lifetime from ∼50 ms (lower limit of detection) to >1 min, with many association and dissociation events recorded for each molecular pair tested. The majority of the binding events (∼98%) resulted in dissociation within 4 s. The lifetimes of these events (n = 676) plotted as a histogram (Fig. 2d) could be fitted well to a single exponential (n = No e–kt) with a decay constant of 2.9 ± 0.05 s–1, corresponding to koff for the T7 RNAP-promoter DNA complex (see Fig. 4). Transcriptional Elongation by T7 RNA Polymerase—A small number of the DNA-binding events (∼2%) lasted much longer than 4 s (Fig. 2d, inset). A number of these (Fig. 2d, inset, arrows) showed clear movement of the downstream bead toward the surface attachment point and against the restoring force (≤3 pN in all experiments) of the optical trap. Fig. 3a shows unfiltered data for the downstream bead displacement recorded during two elongation events that occurred consecutively within a single experimental run. The downstream DNA tether length, corresponding to the RNA transcript length, during elongation was obtained after a correction for the nonlinear elasticity of DNA by using the worm-like chain model (see “Experimental Procedures”). Plots of two events obtained with different DNA tethers are shown in Fig. 3b after correction for non-linear DNA elasticity, conversion to RNA transcript length, and median filtering (12.5 Hz). The rate of downstream DNA tether shortening, equivalent to the rate of transcript elongation, was evaluated from a linear regression of the displacement data in the region of continuous motion (time > 8 s) following the onset of the event (Fig. 3d). This was done to avoid the complications due to the stationary DNA-bound complex observed just prior to transcription elongation (see “Transition from Initiation to Elongation Phase”). The table in Fig. 3c shows the results of linear regressions for six of the longest events (mean run length = 1200 ± 330 bp), from which a kpol of 43 ± 3.2 nt s–1 was obtained (T = 22 °C). This rate was consistent with in vitro rates of ribonucleotide incorporation determined at 22 °C using a bulk transcription assay. During elongation, continuous movement of the downstream bead was observed until either the RNAP released the DNA tether in a sequence-independent manner, or the downstream bead reached the limit of the useable range of the trap, located ∼400 nm from the trap center, and the bead was pulled out of the trap. There was no evidence for reversible pausing during elongation by T7 RNAP in these experiments. Transition from Initiation to Elongation Phase—In those cases where transcript elongation was observed, the bead deflection did not begin immediately after the onset of DNA binding, but began only after a significant lag period lasting up to ∼5 s. During this lag period, the downstream bead remained stationary at the preferred binding position mentioned above (Fig. 3d). The lifetime of this stationary complex was determined from the duration of the lag period, beginning with the DNA-binding event, i.e. loss of mechanical coupling to the upstream bead, and ending at the intersection of the fitted straight line corresponding to the elongation phase (Fig. 3d). The lag times, ranging from 1.3 to 4.6 s in the events observed (n = 6), were significantly longer than the mean lifetimes of the DNA-bound T7 RNAP molecules (1/koff = 0.34 s), which reversibly dissociated without shortening the downstream DNA tether. The forward rate for the transition from closed complex to processive EC was 0.36 s–1, based upon the mean of the lag times (Fig. 4). We have developed a novel optical trapping method that allows promoter binding, initiation, and elongation by single RNAP molecules to be monitored, while permitting multiple transcription runs on a single DNA template. By using this assay (Fig. 1), we have observed transient decoupling of the oscillation in the downstream bead from the driven upstream bead when a DNA molecule containing a single ϕ13 promoter was held in contact with a T7 RNAP-coated micro-bead (Fig. 2, a and b). Decoupling events were not observed when beads devoid of T7 RNAP were used, and we conclude from this that these events report specific interactions between T7 RNAP and DNA. Within individual experimental runs, decoupling of the downstream bead occurred at a preferred position within the range of possible positions that the bead could explore. A representative histogram of downstream bead positions during binding events (Fig. 2c) shows that these interactions occurred within a specific region of the DNA close (∼20 nm) to the known ϕ13 promoter site. Therefore, we conclude that the observed interactions report the formation of binary T7 RNAP-ϕ13 promoter DNA complexes. The lifetimes of the observed events plotted as a histogram (Fig. 2d) were fitted by a single exponential with a decay constant of 2.9 ± 0.05 s–1, corresponding to the rate constant for dissociation of the binary T7 RNAP-promoter DNA complex (Fig. 4). This is in close agreement with earlier stopped-flow kinetic measurements of koff (3.4–4.0 s–1) for this class of T7 promoter under similar ionic conditions (18Jia Y.P. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Google Scholar). The value of koff for T7 RNAP bound nonspecifically to DNA is very large (within the dead-time of the aforementioned stopped-flow measurements, ∼0.002 s), and intermittent binding of this type (koff ≫ 5 s–1, the frequency of oscillation for the upstream bead) would be undetectable in these experiments. We conclude that the preferred position of intermittent binding on the DNA marks the location of the ϕ13 promoter, and these binding events denote the specific recognition of the promoter by surface-immobilized T7 RNAP. As this method yields a value for koff in agreement with previous kinetic studies, we also conclude that the continued oscillation of the upstream bead (and tether) does not greatly affect the kinetics of DNA dissociation from the RNAP. The majority of events involved T7 RNAP binding to the promoter, followed by dissociation at some subsequent time governed by koff. However, a small number of events (∼1 in 50) exhibited markedly different behavior (Fig. 2d, inset). The lifetimes of these events were much longer than the simple dissociation events, and in addition, a significant number of events (∼1 in 100; Fig. 2d, inset, arrows) showed movement of the downstream bead away from the optical trap center, which is characteristic of transcription by a surface-immobilized T7 RNAP. The long-lived complexes which did not move (Fig. 2d, inset, events without arrows) may represent ternary transcription complexes irreversibly engaged in abortive RNA synthesis and incapable of productive elongation, as has been observed with E. coli RNAP (40Kubori T. Shimamoto N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 449-457Google Scholar). After productive initiation, long stretches of DNA were transcribed into mRNA (mean run length = 1200 ± 330 bp), yielding a mean rate of 43 ± 3.2 nt s–1 at 22 °C. This value is consistent with the rate at which radio-labeled ribonucleotide was incorporated into acid-precipitable material at 22 °C, as determined by ourselves and others (41Chamberlin M. Ring J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2235-2244Google Scholar). During a transcription event, the downstream bead was pulled away from the trap center, thus increasing the restoring force which the RNAP worked against from ∼0.5 to ∼3 pN. As the mean rate was independent of transcript length, the rate of T7 RNAP is assumed to be independent of forces <3 pN opposing transcription, in accord with findings obtained for E. coli RNAP (5Yin H. Wang M.D. Svoboda K. Landick R. Block S.M. Gelles J. Science. 1995; 270: 1653-1657Google Scholar, 6Wang M.D. Schnitzer M.J. Yin H. Landick R. Gelles J. Block S.M. Science. 1998; 282: 902-907Google Scholar, 7Davenport R.J. Wuite G.J.L. Landick R. Bustamante C. Science. 2000; 287: 2497-2500Google Scholar). It was observed that, after a period of time, DNA template release could occur during elongation and transcription re-initiation on the same template (most probably by the same RNAP) was possible (Fig. 3a). This is a powerful feature of the present single-molecule assay, as it allows large numbers of events to be recorded with the same RNAP/DNA pair. It is significant that we observed a lag phase prior to the onset of elongation in which the T7 RNAP remained stationary. The lifetime of this stationary complex was determined from the lag time, beginning with the DNA-binding event and ending at the intersection of the fitted straight line corresponding to the elongation phase (Fig. 2d). The lag times observed ranged from 1.3 to 4.6 s (n = 6) and were significantly longer than the mean lifetime of the binary T7 RNAP-promoter DNA complex (1/koff = 0.34 s) and the short lifetime (∼0.01 s) of the open complex in the presence of initiating ribonucleotides (26Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Google Scholar). We conclude that they represent the rate-limiting transition (kfor = 0.36 s–1) on the pathway to the EC (Fig. 4). Such a rate-limiting step has been proposed based on the results from bulk studies of transcription initiation by T7 RNAP (15Jia Y. Patel S.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4223-4232Google Scholar, 25Ikeda R.A. Lin A.C. Clarke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2640-2649Google Scholar, 42Sousa R. Patra D. Lafer E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 319-334Google Scholar, 43Lopez P.J. Guillerez J. Sousa R. Dreyfus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 41-51Google Scholar, 44Temiakov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Google Scholar), but this is the first time that it has been observed directly. The ratio of the forward rate to the promoter dissociation rate (kfor/koff ≈ 0.12) yields an estimate for the probability of the transition from initiation to elongation (promoter escape) under conditions supporting synthesis of gene-length RNA transcripts, i.e. experimental ribonucleotide concentrations (250 μm) > Km for elongation. This estimate is consistent with our observation that the majority of T7 RNAP-promoter DNA complexes dissociate rather than undergo promoter escape. The transition from initiation to elongation is an important event as RNAP converts from an abortive to a processive mode of RNA synthesis, and it is this step which is often a key target of gene regulation, particularly in higher organisms. It is also the case that the process of promoter escape has not been easy to study using conventional solution approaches. The dual optical trap arrangement that we have developed allows both intermittent and processive modes of mechanical interaction between RNAP and DNA to be measured. Data from these single-molecule studies complement the recent x-ray crystallography (45Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S.

As a stationary initiation complex can be manipulated at the single-molecule level, it is now possible to probe the mechanics of promoter escape by using mechanical force to assist or hinder this process. The single-molecule method reported here should be readily adaptable for use with multi-subunit RNAPs from higher organisms and, in principle, could be adapted to any DNA-dependent molecular motor which intermittently binds to a cognate site on DNA and processively translocates along DNA.

https://openalex.org/W1975217943,"The loss of normal weight-bearing activity, which occurs during bed rest, limb immobilization, and spaceflight, stimulates a catabolic response within the musculoskeletal system, which results in a loss of skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral. The mechanism by which loading of muscle and bone is sensed and translated into signals controlling tissue formation remains a major question in the field of musculoskeletal research. In this investigation, we have examined the ability of two potentially anti-atrophic proteins, IGF-I and Shh, to inhibit disuse atrophy within muscle and bone, when electroporated into skeletal muscle. We have found that electroporation and ectopic expression of IGF-I and/or Shh within the gastrocnemius/soleus muscle significantly stimulated muscle fiber hypertrophy and increases in muscle size. In addition, we report that electroporation and ectopic expression of IGF-I and/or Shh within the gastrocnemius/soleus muscle attenuated the lost of muscle fiber area, muscle mass, and muscle mass density that normally occurs during disuse muscle atrophy. Finally, we found that ectopic expression of IGF-I and Shh within the gastrocnemius/soleus muscle inhibits parameters of osteopenia within the tibia and fibula associated with hindlimb unloading. These results support the theory that skeletal muscle can regulate bone maintenance and could offer potentially novel and efficient therapeutic options for attenuating muscle and bone atrophy during aging, illness and spaceflight."
https://openalex.org/W2126544765,"Location is a critical determinant in dictating the cellular function of protein kinase C (PKC). Scaffold proteins contribute to localization by poising PKC at specific intracellular sites. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified the centrosomal protein pericentrin as a scaffold that tethers PKC βII to centrosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that the native proteins interact in cells. Co-overexpression studies show that the interaction is mediated by the C1A domain of PKC and a segment of pericentrin within residues 494-593. Immunofluorescence analysis reveals that endogenous PKC βII colocalizes with pericentrin at centrosomes. Disruption of this interaction by expression of the interacting region of pericentrin results in release of PKC from the centrosome, microtubule disorganization, and cytokinesis failure. Overexpression of this disrupting fragment has no effect in cells lacking PKC βII, indicating a specific regulatory role of this isozyme in centrosome function. These results reveal a novel role for PKC βII in cytokinesis and indicate that this function is mediated by an interaction with pericentrin at centrosomes.

Their function is exquisitely regulated by subcellular location, mediated by both lipid and protein interactions (1Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

One key emerging function of PKC family members is the regulation of cell growth, cell cycle progression, and cell differentiation (5Black J.D.

Studies have shown that PKC α and PKC δ play an important role in negative regulation of the G1/S and G2/M transition (7Ashton A.W. Watanabe G. Albanese C. Harrington E.O. Ware J.A. Pestell R.G. J.

PKC βII has been shown to be critical for nuclear lamina disassembly at the G2/M transition through phosphorylation of lamin B in K562 erythroleukemia cells (9Thompson L.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15045-15053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). An essential role in cell cycling is illustrated in yeast, where there is only one PKC, and deletion of this gene traps cells in a G2-like arrest following completion of DNA synthesis (10Levin D.E. Fields F.O. Kunisawa R. Bishop J.M. Thorner J. Cell. 1990; 62: 213-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, the role of anchoring PKC to subcellular sites in the control of cell cycle progression is largely unexplored.Centrosomes are small organelles in vertebrate cells that serve primarily as organizers of microtubules. A number of converging studies suggest that centrosomes are involved in an increasing number of fundamental cellular processes including cell cycle progression, microtubule organization, spindle function, and cytokinesis (11Doxsey S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with phorbol esters, potent activators of PKC, has been long known to cause dramatic morphological changes (12Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Many of these changes result from alterations in cytoskeletal structure, and several lines of evidence implicate PKC in regulating microtubule function. First, a number of microtubule-associated proteins are substrates for PKC both in vitro and in vivo (13Correas I. Diaz-Nido J. Avila J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15721-15728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Robinson P.J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 5: 87-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); second, phorbol esters cause microtubule reorganization (15Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 231-242PubMed Google Scholar); third, PKC βI has been shown to co-localize with microtubules and bind microtubule-associated proteins (15Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016PubMed Google Scholar); and fourth, novel PKC isoforms ϵ and δ have been reported to localize to the centrosome (17Takahashi M. Mukai H. Oishi K. Isagawa T. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34592-34596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Volkov Y. Long A. Kelleher D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6487-6495PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, recent studies demonstrate that PKC β-deficient T cells failed to develop a polarized microtubule network, a defect that can be rescued by expressing PKC βI (19Volkov Y. Long A. McGrath S. Ni Eidhin D. Kelleher D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, PKC is emerging as a key regulator of microtubule organization. However, the molecular mechanism has remained elusive.Pericentrin is a coiled-coil protein that is thought to mediate microtubule anchoring at the centrosome by binding a multiprotein complex that nucleates microtubules, the γ-tubulin ring complex (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 21Dictenberg J.B. Zimmerman W. Sparks C.A. Young A. Vidair C. Zheng Y. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Pericentrin belongs to a family of related proteins, including CG-NAP/AKAP450 and kendrin (22Takahashi M. Shibata H. Shimakawa M. Miyamoto M. Mukai H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17267-17274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 23Flory M.R. Moser M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Davis T.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Functional studies have revealed a key role for pericentrin in microtubule organization, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Overexpression of pericentrin causes microtubule defects, chromosome missegregation, and aneuploidy (26Pihan G.A. Purohit A. Wallace J. Malhotra R. Liotta L. Doxsey S.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2212-2219PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we identified pericentrin as a binding partner for PKC from a yeast two-hybrid screen. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that the endogenous proteins interact in cells, and biochemical studies narrow the interaction domains to the C1A domain in PKC and residues 494-593 in pericentrin. We show that disruption of the pericentrin-PKC interaction by overexpressing the binding domain on pericentrin (residues 494-593) results in the mislocalization of PKC βII from the centrosome, microtubule disorganization, cytokinesis failure, spindle dysfunction, chromosome missegregation, and aneuploidy. These data suggest a novel role for PKC in controlling cell division through centrosomal anchoring by pericentrin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The large T-antigen-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (tsA201) were the generous gift of Dr. Marlene Hosey (Northwestern University). The rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1) were the gift of Dr. Alan Fields (Mayo Clinic). The cDNA of rat PKC βII was a gift of Dr. Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. (University of California, Berkeley), and the cDNA of wild-type and kinase-dead PKC α, ϵ, and ζ were gifts of Dr. Alex Toker (Harvard Medical School). A polyclonal antibody against PKC βII (C-18, α-PKC βII) and protein A/G-agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody against a determinant in the regulatory domain of PKC β (α-Reg) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. A monoclonal antibody 16B12 against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and a monoclonal antibody against the GFP epitope were purchased from Covance. PKC βII was purified from the baculovirus expression system, as previously described (27Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody, UM225, was made against the N-terminal peptide sequence of pericentrin (EAQEQHARELQL). Antibodies to α- and γ-tubulin were obtained from Sigma. Anti-HA polyclonal antibody was a gift from Joanne Buxton (University of Massachusetts Medical School). 5051 human autoimmune serum, and anti-pericentrin polyclonal antibody were used in this study (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against the GFP epitope was a gift from Pam Silver (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). Mouse anti-dynein cytoplasmic monoclonal antibody was purchased from Chemicon international Co.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The cDNA encoding rat PKC βII (residues 1-111) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the NcoI site (5′ site) and the BamHI site (3′ site) of pAS2.1 (Clontech). The resulting plasmid was used as bait to screen a cDNA library derived from 9.5- and 10.5-day mouse embryos (28Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Approximately 100,000 yeast CG1945 transformants were grown in the absence of tryptophan, leucine, and histidine at 30 °C for 8 days. Colonies that grew in this minimal selective medium condition were scored for β-galactosidase activity by colony lift assay according to the Clontech MatchMaker protocol. Prey plasmid DNA from the double-positive (His+/LacZ+) colonies was rescued by electroporation into Escherichia coli HB101 (Invitrogen) and then retransformed back into yeast strain SFY526 containing the original bait plasmid and various control plasmids for one-to-one interactions. Both strands of the DNA insert from these clones were sequenced by automated sequencing (DNA Sequencing Shared Resource, Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego).Plasmid Constructs—Mammalian expression constructs encoding the N-terminally HA-tagged full-length pericentrin and three segments of pericentrin in pcDNAI/Amp have been described previously (29Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HA-tagged Pc1-104 of pericentrin is constructed using HA-tagged full-length pericentrin, by cleaving the rest of the DNA and retaining only the first 104 amino acids of pericentrin. The cDNAs encoding the wild-type PKC βII, PKC βII K371R, and PKC βII T500E were subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector for expression in mammalian cells (31Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pseudosubstrate region (N-PS, residues 1-31) and the C1A domain (C1A, residues 32-111; N-C1A, residues 1-111) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in mammalian cells following PCR amplification of the relevant sequences using pcDNA3-PKC βII as the template. Specifically, the primers used for the PCR amplification introduced a BamHI site and a ClaI site at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The PCR products were subcloned into the pEBG vector digested with BamHI and ClaI. The cDNA encoding the PKC-binding region of pericentrin (residues 454-593) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI (5′ site) and the BamHI site (3′ site) of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech).In Vitro Pull-down Assay—The DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 454-593 of pericentrin (Pc454-593) was cloned into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences), and GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21, purified, and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described in the Amersham Biosciences instruction manual. 0.5 μg of pure PKC βII was incubated with 0.5 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, plus 1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Beads were then washed twice with the incubation buffer plus 500 mm NaCl and twice with the incubation buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.To examine the pericentrin-binding domain in PKC βII in vitro, the regulatory and catalytic domains of PKC were generated by incubation of purified PKC βII (2.5 μg/ml) with trypsin (2 units/ml) for 10 min at 30 °C in the incubation buffer with 1 mm CaCl2. The purified PKC βII protein pretreated with or without trypsin was incubated with GST or GST fusion protein of pericentrin (GST-Pc454-593) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h in the presence of trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml). After being washed three times with the incubation buffer plus 300 mm NaCl, the proteins that bound to the glutathione beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by the polyclonal anti-PKC βII antibody to detect full-length PKC βII and the catalytic domain and by the monoclonal anti-PKC β antibody to detect the regulatory domain of PKC βII.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK tsA201 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. RIE-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml purimycin. U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For biochemical studies, transient transfection of tsA201 cells and COS-7 cells were carried out using Superfect transfection reagents (Qiagen). The specific transfection procedures were performed according to the protocol suggested by Qiagen. Combinations of the different expression plasmids were used as stated, and 1 μg of each construct DNA was generally included in the transfection. For immunofluorescence studies, COS-7 cells were grown on 12-mm round glass coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA (GFP vector, GFP-Pc454-593, HA-Pc454-593, HA-Pc1-104, pEBG-Pc494-593, or no DNA) using LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen); transfection efficiency was ∼30-50%. Cells were fixed at 17, 42, and 66 h after transfection and processed for immunofluorescence staining. All of the transfected cells were recognized by using antibodies against respective tags of the overexpressing protein. Cell growth was determined by measuring the ratio of transfected cells to the total cell population; there was little change in this ratio over a 62-h time period. In all quantitative studies, only transfected cells were counted and presented as percentage of transfected cells.In Vivo GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—To map the binding region of PKC βII to pericentrin in vivo, the N-PS region (residues 1-31), the N-C1A region (residues 1-111), and the C1A domain (residues 32-111) of PKC βII were expressed as GST fusion proteins in tsA201 cells together with HA-tagged pericentrin. Approximately 40 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 nm microcystin-LR). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 22 °C, and the resulting supernatant is referred to as the detergent-solubilized cell lysate. 5% of the total cell lysate was kept in SDS sample buffer for further analysis, and the remaining whole cell lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C for overnight. After washing twice in buffer B (buffer A plus 500 mm NaCl) and twice in buffer A, the glutathione-Sepharose-bound proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Immunoprecipitation—tsA201 cells were transiently transfected with different combinations of indicated constructs. About 40 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in buffer A. 5% of the total detergent-solubilized cell lysates were kept in SDS sample buffer for further analysis, and the remaining detergent-solubilized cell lysate was incubated with appropriate monoclonal antibody and protein A/G-agarose at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in buffer B and twice in buffer A. The proteins in the immunoprecipitates were separated using SDS-PAGE and analyzed using immunoblotting.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Nontransfected cultured cells were rinsed in PBS, extracted with permeabilization buffer (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and fixed in methanol at -20 °C. Transfected cells were fixed in methanol at -20 °C as described previously (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Cells were observed under an Olympus IX-70 fluorescent microscope and imaged using a CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific). Optical sections were taken, and the images were deconvolved (Metamorph; Universal Imaging Corp.). Immunofluorescence images are two-dimensional projections of three-dimensional reconstruction to ensure that all stained material is visible.Flow Cytometry—For PKC βII mislocalization studies, U2OS cells were transfected with pEGFP (GFP) or pEGFP-Pc454-593 (GFP-Pc454-593) constructs using LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Cells were processed for live cell sorting at 34 h post-transfection. GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACStar plus (Becton Dickinson). Sorted cells were plated on 12-mm round glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C to facilitate attachment to the coverslip. Cells were permeabilized (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and fixed in -20 °C methanol. Some cells were fixed without extraction to estimate the purity of the GFP-positive cells. Purity of the GFP-positive cells ranged from 95 to 98%. Fixed cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining. Only G2/M stage cells were scored for the analysis. Cells that had duplicated and separated centrosomes were considered as G2/M stage cells.Time Lapse Imaging—COS-7 cells were plated on 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek Corp, MA) and transfected with GFP-Pc454-593 or HA-Pc454-593. 22-24 h post-transfection, cells were placed in a chamber (PDMI-2; Harvard Apparatus) in complete medium with CO2 exchange (0.5 liters/min) at 37 °C. Cells were imaged every 5 min for 20-22 h using a ×20 or ×30 phase-contrast lens on an inverted microscope (Olympus IX-70). Images were captured on a CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific) and concatenated using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.).Microtubule Regrowth Assay—The depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole (10 μg/ml) treatment and regrowth of microtubules in COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (29Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in methanol at -20 °C and processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of Pericentrin as a Novel Protein Kinase C-binding Protein—To identify novel PKC-binding proteins, we screened a mouse embryonic cDNA library with a fragment encoding the first 111 amino acids of PKC βII as bait. This sequence encodes the N-terminal tail, the pseudosubstrate sequence, and C1A domain of PKC (Fig. 1A; N-C1A). Approximately 100,000 clones were screened, with five positive clones obtained. Of these, one contained a 420-bp cDNA fragment encoding a 140-residue peptide corresponding to amino acids 454-593 of the centrosomal protein, pericentrin (Fig. 1A; Pc454-593).To address whether PKC interacts with pericentrin in vivo, we co-transfected tsA201 cells with PKC βII and HA-tagged pericentrin. Pericentrin was immunoprecipitated from the detergent-solubilized fraction of cell lysates using anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was analyzed for bound PKC βII by Western blot analysis. Analysis of cell lysates showed that recombinant pericentrin migrated as two bands of apparent molecular mass of 150 and 220 kDa on SDS-PAGE, as detected using either anti-pericentrin antibodies (data not shown) or anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lane 1). The lower band is truncated at the C terminus (retains HA tag), as previously observed (29Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and may reflect proteolysis or a partial transcript of pericentrin. Two species of PKC were also apparent in the lysates (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 1): a major slower migrating band (indicated by an asterisk) that represents fully phosphorylated PKC and a minor faster migrating species (labeled with a dash) that represents unphosphorylated PKC (32Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Both species were present in immunoprecipitates of pericentrin (Fig. 1B, upper panel); there was no apparent enrichment of either species of PKC in the immune complex. Control immunoprecipitates in which lysate was incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose had barely detectable amounts of bound PKC (lane 2). Conversely, we found that HA-pericentrin (also both bands) associated with immunoprecipitated PKC from tsA201 cells co-transfected with PKC and pericentrin (data not shown). These data reveal that PKC and pericentrin form a complex in cells.We next asked whether endogenous pericentrin and endogenous PKC interact in vivo. We examined K562 cells because PKC βII is relatively abundant in these cells (33Murray N.R. Baumgardner G.P. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15847-15853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that PKC βII migrated as a single band (Fig. 1C, lane 1); unlike the overexpressed protein, native protein was fully processed by phosphorylation. Fig. 1C shows that a polyclonal antibody to pericentrin, UM225, labeled a ∼220-kDa band corresponding to pericentrin (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and effectively immunoprecipitated the protein. PKC βII was present in the immune complex (lane 3) but was not associated with control beads incubated without antibody (lane 2).To examine whether PKC binds pericentrin directly, we performed an in vitro GST pull-down assay using recombinant PKC βII purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells and either GST alone or a GST fusion protein of pericentrin 454-593 (GST-Pc454-593) purified from bacteria. In addition, to test which domain of PKC mediates its binding to pericentrin, we treated purified PKC βII with trypsin to generate the regulatory and catalytic moieties (38 and 50 kDa, respectively) of PKC, prior to incubation with the GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4). Proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were identified by Western blot analysis using antibodies against the regulatory or catalytic domains of PKC. Fig. 1D shows that PKC βII bound to GST-Pc454-593 (lane 2) but not to GST alone (lane 1). Trypsin treatment of PKC yielded a 50-kDa catalytic fragment and 38-kDa regulatory fragment (upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). Only the regulatory fragment was precipitated by GST-Pc454-593 (lower panel, lane 4). These results indicate that PKC binds to pericentrin directly and that the binding determinants are located in its regulatory domain.The C1A Domain of Protein Kinase Mediates the Interaction with Pericentrin—The bait we used in the yeast two-hybrid screen comprised the first 111 amino acids of PKC including the pseudosubstrate sequence and C1A domain. To further delineate the docking site for pericentrin in PKC, we expressed a series of GST-tagged constructs of the amino terminus of PKC: N-PS (first 31 residues containing the pseudosubstrate); C1A (residues 32-111, which comprise the C1A domain); and N-C1A (first 111 residues up to and including the C1A domain). HA-pericentrin was co-expressed with these GST-tagged constructs in tsA201 cells, the expressed GST-fusion proteins were immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the bound proteins were analyzed by using anti-HA antibody to detect pericentrin (Fig. 2). The expression level of pericentrin was comparable in all of the cells transfected with different constructs (Fig. 2, upper panel). All GST-tagged constructs were expressed in tsA201 cells (Fig. 2, upper panel) and effectively precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 2, lower panel) as judged by staining with anti-GST antibodies. Pericentrin was associated with both of the PKC constructs that contained the C1A domain: GST-C1A (lane 3) and GST-N-C1A (lane 4). It did not interact with the construct lacking the C1A domain, GST-N-PS (lane 2); nor did it interact with the isolated C1B domain (data not shown). These data suggest that the C1A domain in the regulatory moiety of PKC provides the primary determinants in the interaction of PKC with pericentrin.Fig. 2The C1A domain of PKC binds pericentrin in vivo. The indicated GST-tagged fusion proteins encoding different regions of the regulatory moiety of PKC βII were co-expressed with HA-tagged pericentrin in tsA201 cells: GST vector, GST-N-PS, GST-C1A, and GST-N-C1A. Detergent-solubilized cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose to precipitate the GST fusion proteins. Upper panel, Western blot showing total expression of pericentrin (probed with anti-HA antibody) or fusion constructs (probed with anti-GST antibody). Lower panel, Western blot showing pericentrin bound to beads and amount of fusion protein bound to beads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PKC βII Is Localized to the Centrosome—The interaction of PKC βII with pericentrin suggested that pericentrin might anchor PKC at the centrosome (20Doxsey S.J. Stein P. Evans L. Calarco P.D. Kirschner M. Cell. 1994; 76: 639-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we examined the subcellular localization of PKC βII by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies (C-18 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) specific for the PKC βII isoform of the kinase (Fig. 3). PKC βII was localized to the centrosome in G2 and mitotic cells. Centrosome localization was observed in U2OS cells (Fig. 3) and in RIE-1 and COS-7 cells (data not shown). Centrosome staining was observed in methanol-fixed cells and was enhanced following a brief pre-extraction of cells with detergent to reduce PKC βII staining at other cellular sites (29Purohit A. Tynan S.H. Vallee R. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). During mitosis, the fluorescence intensity of PKC βII at the spindle poles/centrosomes increased from prophase to metaphase and then decreased to a minimum in telophase"

Hypoxia is associated with tissue inflammation and ischemia and, therefore, may modulate the effects of NO· on endothelial function. To examine the influence of hypoxia on NO·-mediated apoptosis, we exposed bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) to (Z)-1-[N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-ammonioethyl) amino]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (diethylenetriamine NONOate, DETA-NO) (1 mmol/liter) under normoxic or hypoxic conditions (pO2 = 35 mm of Hg) and measured the indices of apoptotic cell death. BAEC treated with DETA-NO under normoxic conditions demonstrated increased levels of histone-associated DNA fragments, which was confirmed by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and hypoxic conditions augmented this response. To determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction was one mechanism by which NO· initiated apoptosis under hypoxic conditions, we evaluated mitochondrial membrane potential in (Ψm). Exposure to DETA-NO resulted in a decrease in Ψm and concomitant release of cytochrome c and caspase-9 activation, which were enhanced by hypoxia. By utilizing Rho0 BAEC (Rho0-EC), which lack functional mitochondria, we demonstrated that dissipation of Ψm was associated with increased reactive oxygen species generation and peroxynitrite formation. Moreover, in Rho0-EC we identified activation of caspase-8 as part of the mitochondrial-independent pathway of apoptosis. To establish that peroxynitrite mediated mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, we treated BAEC and Rho0-EC with the peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid and found that the indices of apoptosis were decreased significantly.

Nitric oxide (NO·), an endogenous signaling molecule that modulates vessel wall function, has both cytoprotective and cytotoxic effects on the vascular endothelium (1Shen Y.H. Wang X.L. Wilcken D.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). At nanomolar concentrations, as are present under basal conditions, NO· is protective against apoptosis-inducing stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α, serum starvation, hydrogen peroxide, and hypoxia (1Shen Y.H. Wang X.L. Wilcken D.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and endothelial cells isolated from mice lacking the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase demonstrate increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (2Hoffmann J.

The mechanism(s) by which NO· modulates apoptosis highlights the central role of the mitochondrion in NO·-mediated cell death. Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of NO· suppresses mitochondrial respiration by inhibition of cytochrome oxidase (complex IV), resulting in a decrease in inner mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) and induction of mitochondrial permeability transition to effect release of cytochrome c into the cell cytosol. These events activate caspase-9, which in turn activates downstream executioner caspases to commence intracellular proteolysis, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and eventual cell death (9Ramachandran A.

ROS promote mitochondrial DNA damage, and inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis in vascular endothelial cells increases susceptibility to NO·-mediated apoptosis. ROS may also react with NO· in a diffusion-limited manner to form peroxynitrite and other reactive nitrogen species. In fact, long term incubation with NO· via peroxynitrite formation has been shown to inhibit NADH:ubiquinone reductase (complex I) activity (13Riobo N.A. Clementi E. Melani M. Boveris A. Cadenas E.

Peroxynitrite itself is a highly reactive oxidizing species and exerts its cytotoxic effects further by inducing mitochondrial membrane depolarization (14Li C.Q. Trudel L.J. Wogan G.N. Chem. Res.

Hypoxia, which is associated with tissue inflammation and ischemia, has been shown to increase mitochondrial ROS generation in endothelial cells (16Pearlstein D.P. Ali M.H. Mungai P.T. Hynes K.L.

To date the combined influence of hypoxia and NO· on mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in endothelial cells has not been determined. In the present study we examined the effect of hypoxia on NO·-mediated apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells and demonstrated the relevance of peroxynitrite formation in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) (Cell Systems Co.) were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were passaged twice weekly by harvesting with 0.5% trypsin/EDTA. Experiments were conducted on cells from passages 4-12. To generate endothelial cells devoid of mitochondria, so-called Rho0 BAEC (Rho0-EC), BAEC were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing ethidium bromide (100 ng/ml) and uridine (50 μg/ml) for 96 h. Normoxic conditions were defined as pO2 = 150 mm of Hg. Hypoxic conditions (pO2 = 35 mm of Hg) were achieved by purging a modular incubation chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) with 95% N2, 5% CO2 for 15 min. After purging, the chamber was sealed and maintained inside a humidified 37 °C incubator. Experiments on hypoxic cells were performed inside an inflatable glove bag purged with 95% N2, 5% CO2 to maintain hypoxic conditions. Measurement of Cell Death—Cell necrosis was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase levels in the media (Sigma). Apoptotic cell death was determined using the cell death detection ELISAPlus (Roche Applied Science) to detect cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes). Data were normalized for comparison by total protein concentration (Bio-Rad). Apoptosis was confirmed using the DeadEnd™ Fluorometric terminal dUTP nick-end labeling System (Promega). Apoptotic cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescent microscope (Nikon). Bcl-2 Family Member Immunoblotting—Bcl-2 family member expression was determined by loading 50 μg of total cell protein per lane and resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and blocked with 5% milk. The membranes were then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal anti-Bax (Stressgen) or anti-Bcl-X (Lab Vision) overnight at 4 °C and visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Ψm)—Inner mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) was assessed using the MitoTag JC-1 dye (Chemicon International). BAEC and Rho0-EC were grown to 90-95% confluence and treated in 96-well plates. After treatment, cells were incubated in the dark for 15 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing the JC-1 dye. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1%), and Ψm was determined in a microplate fluorimeter (SpectraMax Gemini, Molecular Devices). The dye localizes within the mitochondria in proportion to Ψm and, when in the mitochondria, forms aggregates that fluoresce red (excitation 550 nm; emission 600 nm). When Ψm dissipates, the JC-1 dye leaks into the cytoplasm and fluoresces green (excitation 485 nm; emission 535 nm). Inner mitochondrial membrane potential normalized to the number of cells was calculated by dividing mitochondrial (red) fluorescence by cytosolic (green) fluorescence. Cytochrome c Immunohistochemistry—BAEC were grown to confluence on glass chamber slides and exposed to experimental conditions. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed to the slide with methanol:acetone (1:1) for 15 min at 25 °C, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The cells were incubated for 2 h with 1 μg/ml anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (Lab Vision) at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, air-dried, incubated with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Chemicon International), and visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescent microscope. Measurement of Caspase Activity and Expression—Caspase-8 and caspase-9 enzymatic activities were measured with fluorometric assay kits using substrates specific to each caspase (R&D Systems). Data were normalized using total protein concentration. Caspase expression was determined by immunoblotting as described for Bcl-2 family members using a 1:500 dilution of a polyclonal anti-capase-9 (Stressgen) overnight at 4 °C. Dichorodihydrofluorescein Fluorescence—BAEC and Rho0-EC were grown to confluence and exposed to experimental conditions. One hour before treatment was completed, cells were washed with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated with 20 μmol/liter 6-carboxy-2′-7′ dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate di(acetoxymethyl) ester (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Reactive oxygen species accumulation was determined in a microplate fluorimeter (SpectraMax Gemini, Molecular Devices). Data were normalized for comparison by total protein concentration (Bio-Rad). Peroxynitrite ELISA—Peroxynitrite formation was determined using the Bioxytech® Nitrotyrosine® EIA assay (Oxis Int.). Data were normalized for comparison by total protein concentration (Bio-Rad). Peroxynitrite Immunohistochemistry—Cells were grown to confluence on glass chamber slides, subjected to experimental conditions, washed once in PBS, fixed in methanol:acetone (1:1) at 25 °C for 15 min, and incubated with 3% H2O2 for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the slides were incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 25 °C, washed in PBS, and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-3-nitrotyrosine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at a 1:50 dilution overnight at 4 °C. After the slides were washed in PBS, a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) was applied and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Nitrotyrosine was visualized using the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate method (Vector Laboratories). The slides were visualized using an Olympus BX41 microscope. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed in duplicate a minimum of three times. Continuous data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparison between groups was performed by Student's paired two-tailed t test. Two-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences in response to treatments between groups, with post hoc analysis performed by the method of Student-Newman-Keuls. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Hypoxia Enhances NO·-mediated Cell Death—To examine the effect of hypoxia on cell death in endothelial cells exposed to high concentrations of NO·, BAEC were treated with the NO· donor diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA-NO), which yields 3 μmol/liter NO· flux, comparable with amounts produced in vivo by the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (18Ameredes B.T. Zamora R. Gibson K.F. Billiar T.R. Dixon-McCarthy B. Watkins S. Calhoun W.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 730-736PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with DETA-NO (0 or 1 mmol/liter) for 24 h under normoxic (pO2 = 150 mm of Hg) or hypoxic (pO2 = 35 mm of Hg) conditions, and cell death was determined by lactate dehydrogenase release. At 24 h BAEC exposed to 1 mmol/liter DETA-NO under normoxic conditions did not display a marked increase in cell death as compared with BAEC in the absence of DETA-NO (345 ± 2 versus 356 ± 3 units/ml, p < 0.05). Under our experimental conditions, hypoxia alone did not increase cell death; however, BAEC treated with 1 mmol/liter DETA-NO under hypoxic conditions demonstrated a significant increase in cell death as compared with cells under normoxic conditions (356 ± 3 versus 516 ± 12 units/ml, p ≤ 0.001). This increase in cell death represented 26% of total cell mass as determined by lactate dehydrogenase levels measured after total cell lysis. Because there was evidence of ongoing cell necrosis at 24 h, we elected to examine cells for markers of apoptosis at 18 h. To determine whether cell death resulted from apoptosis, cytosolic histone-associated DNA fragmentation, a marker of apoptotic cell death, was measured in BAEC (Fig. 1A). Compared with untreated BAEC under normoxic conditions, BAEC exposed to 1 mmol/liter DETA-NO for 18 h demonstrated a significant increase in internucleosomal DNA fragments (323 ± 65 versus 1567 ± 236 units/mg of protein, p ≤ 0.001). Hypoxia alone caused a small increase in histone-associated DNA fragments (323 ± 65 versus 466 ± 27 units/mg of protein, p ≤ 0.05), and this effect was augmented by DETA-NO (466 ± 27 versus 8362 ± 200 units/mg of protein, p < 0.001). To confirm apoptosis in our system, we performed an in situ fluorometric terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay and calculated an apoptosis index based on the number of apoptotic nuclei/number of cells per high power field (Fig. 1B). Under normoxic conditions, compared with untreated cells BAEC exposed to 1 mmol/liter DETA-NO demonstrated a significant increase in apoptosis (2 ± 1 versus 48 ± 13 cells/high power field, p < 0.001). Under hypoxic conditions there was an increase in apoptosis (2 ± 1 versus 21 ± 5 cells/high power field, p < 0.01), and this effect was enhanced significantly in cells treated with DETA-NO (21 ± 5 versus 93 ± 6 cells/high power field, p < 0.001). Taken together, these data demonstrate that NO· induces apoptotic cell death in BAEC and hypoxia potentiates this response. Bcl-2 Family Member Expression Is Modulated by Nitric Oxide and Hypoxia—Members of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators have been shown to mediate mitochondrial function and thereby influence apoptosis (5Choy J.C. Granville D.J. Hunt D.W. McManus B.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1673-1690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of exposure to DETA-NO and hypoxia on Bcl-2 family member expression, we analyzed protein expression of Bax, a pro-apoptotic homologue, and Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic homologue (Fig. 2). In BAEC exposed to 1 mmol/liter DETA-NO under normoxic conditions for 18 h there was an increase in Bax expression that was enhanced under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, in BAEC treated with DETA-NO, there was a decrease in Bcl-2 expression, which was suppressed further under hypoxic conditions. These findings suggest that exposure to NO· under hypoxic conditions promotes expression of pro-apoptotic effectors and decreases expression of anti-apoptotic effectors. Nitric Oxide-mediated Cell Death Involves a Mitochondria-dependent Pathway—To determine whether NO·-mediated apoptosis occurred via a mitochondria-dependent pathway, we measured inner mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm) (Fig. 3A). After 18 h Ψm was significantly decreased in BAEC exposed to DETA-NO under normoxic conditions (100 ± 1 versus 89 ± 4% control, p < 0.05), an effect that was enhanced under hypoxic conditions (100 ± 1 versus 72 ± 4% control, p < 0.001). To demonstrate whether a decrease in Ψm resulted in release of cytochrome c, we performed immunohistochemistry with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig. 3B). Under normoxic conditions, in the absence of DETA-NO, cytochrome c was localized to mitochondria and appeared as punctate spots. In contrast, in BAEC exposed to DETA-NO and hypoxic conditions for 18 h, cytochrome c was released to the cytoplasm and appeared as diffuse staining. Because release of cytochrome c, a pro-apoptotic effector, activates pro-caspase-9, we next measured caspase-9 activity (Fig. 3C). Caspase-9 activity was increased significantly in BAEC after 18 h of exposure to DETA-NO under normoxic conditions (472 ± 5 versus 599 ± 36 units/mg of protein, p < 0.05) and increased further under hypoxic conditions (472 ± 5 versus 810 ± 68, units/ml/mg of protein, p < 0.01). These findings were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3D), which demonstrated an increase in both pro-caspase-9 and caspase-9 breakdown products (molecular mass = 37, 34, 18, and 10 kDa), consistent with apoptosis in BAEC treated with DETA-NO under hypoxic conditions as compared with untreated BAEC under normoxic conditions. These data demonstrate that high concentrations of NO· induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and that hypoxia enhances these effects. Mitochondria and NO·-mediated Apoptosis under Hypoxic Conditions—To evaluate the importance of functional mitochondria in our system, Rho0 cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA and functional mitochondria, were created from BAEC (Rho0-EC). To confirm Rho0 status, Ψm was measured (Fig. 4A) and found to be decreased by 75% compared with BAEC (4.4 ± 1.0 versus 1.1 ± 0.03 × 10-4 units, p < 0.05). Rho0 status was also confirmed by labeling cells with MitoTag JC-1 dye, which localizes within the mitochondria in proportion to Ψm and, when in the mitochondria, forms aggregates that fluoresce red; when Ψm dissipates, as occurs in Rho0 cells, the JC-1 dye leaks into the cytoplasm and fluoresces green (Fig. 4B). Rho0-EC were treated with DETA-NO (0 or 1 mmol/liter) under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 24 h and evaluated for markers of cell death. In the absence of DETA-NO under normoxic conditions there was no significant difference between BAEC and Rho0-EC with respect to cell death, as determined by media lactate dehydrogenase (349 ± 13 versus 359 ± 12 units/ml, p = NS). Interestingly, in Rho0-EC exposed to DETA-NO under normoxic conditions, there was an increase in cell death, and this effect was more pronounced than that observed in BAEC (556 ± 23 versus 356 ± 3 units/ml, p < 0.001). Similarly, Rho0-EC treated with DETA-NO under hypoxic conditions demonstrated increased cell death compared with BAEC (750 ± 20 versus 516 ± 12 units/ml, p < 0.001). This finding suggested that endothelial cells lacking functional mitochondria were more sensitive to NO·-mediated cell death under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We next examined Rho0-EC for markers of apoptosis at 18 h. There was no significant difference between Rho0-EC and BAEC in levels of histone-associated DNA fragments in the absence of DETA-NO under normoxic conditions (323 ± 25 versus 340 ± 13 units/mg of protein, p = NS); however, compared with BAEC, Rho0-EC cells exposed to the DETA-NO under normoxic conditions demonstrated a significant increase in internucleosomal DNA fragments (1567 ± 236 versus 4704 ± 260 units/mg of protein, p < 0.001) as did Rho0-EC treated with DETA-NO under hypoxic conditions (8362 ± 200 versus 12,663 ± 128 units/mg of protein). These observations confirm that endothelial cells lacking functional mitochondria demonstrate increased sensitivity to NO·-mediated apoptosis under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Exposure to High Levels of NO· Increases Oxidant Stress— Previous studies have suggested that increased ROS production is one mechanism by which NO· mediates mitochondrial damage to initiate apoptosis. To examine this hypothesis, we measured ROS accumulation under our experimental conditions (Fig. 5A). ROS accumulation was elevated significantly in BAEC exposed to the NO· donor under normoxic conditions compared with untreated cells (166 ± 13 versus 454 ± 94 arbitrary units/mg of protein, p < 0.001) and to a greater extent in BAEC treated with the NO· donor under hypoxic conditions (166 ± 13 versus 760 ± 63 arbitrary units/mg of protein, p < 0.001). To determine the source of ROS production, we treated BAEC with l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester. (1 mmol/liter), oxypurinol (100 μmol/liter), indomethacin (10 μmol/liter), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) (10 μmol/liter), or rotenone (10 μmol/liter) to inhibit endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, xanthine oxidase, cyclooxygenase, NAD(P)H oxidase(s), and mitochondria, respectively (Table I). Only the addition of indomethacin, DPI, or rotenone decreased ROS production, suggesting that mitochondria are in part a source of ROS production; however, indomethacin inhibits both cyclooxygenase and mitochondrial respiration, and DPI inhibits ROS production by all flavincontaining enzymes, including NAD(P)H oxidases as well as mitochondrial complex I (19Umeki S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Krause M.M. Brand M.D. Krauss S. Meisel C. Vergin H. Burmester G.R. Buttgereit F. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 1438-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm the role of mitochondria in ROS production, we next measured ROS accumulation in Rho0-EC that lack mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, ROS accumulation was increased in Rho0-EC cells exposed to DETA-NO under normoxic conditions (168 ± 24 versus 354 ± 34 arbitrary units/mg of protein, p < 0.001) and to a greater extent in cells exposed to the NO· donor under hypoxic conditions (168 ± 24 versus 567 ± 82 arbitrary units/mg of protein, p < 0.001), albeit ROS levels were significantly less than those observed in BAEC under the same conditions (567 ± 82 versus 1562 ± 112 arbitrary units/mg of protein, p < 0.001). To determine the source of ROS production in Rho0-EC, we exposed cells to the same inhibitors as BAEC (Table I). ROS production was attenuated in Rho0-EC treated with indomethacin or DPI, suggesting that cyclooxygenase and NAD(P)H oxidase may contribute to elevated ROS levels. Taken together these findings confirm that exposure to elevated levels of NO· increases both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial ROS production in endothelial cells, and hypoxia augments this response.Table ISource of ROS production in BAEC and Rho0-EC exposed to DETA-NO and hypoxic conditions ROS production is measured as arbitrary fluorescent units/mg of protein and expressed as mean ± S.E. l-NAME, l-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester.No additionap < 0.05 for means between treatment groups by analysis of variancel-NAMEap < 0.05 for means between treatment groups by analysis of variance (1 mmol/liter)Oxypurinolap < 0.05 for means between treatment groups by analysis of variance (100 μmol/liter)Indomethacinap < 0.05 for means between treatment groups by analysis of variance (10 μmol/liter)DPIap < 0.05 for means between treatment groups by analysis of variance (10 μmol/liter)Rotenoneap < 0.05 for means between treatment groups by analysis of variance (10 μmol/liter)BAEC Normoxia—DETA-NO193 ± 14196 ± 12214 ± 19216 ± 11182 ± 18200 ± 16+DETA-NO878 ± 30805 ± 54813 ± 42744 ± 27363 ± 15bp < 0.001 vs. No addition338 ± 18bp < 0.001 vs. No addition Hypoxia—DETA-NO762 ± 70624 ± 43678 ± 26580 ± 29cp < 0.01 vs. No addition355 ± 19bp < 0.001 vs. No addition318 ± 10bp < 0.001 vs. No addition+DETA-NO1562 ± 1121361 ± 971263 ± 731094 ± 51cp < 0.01 vs. No addition454 ± 26bp < 0.001 vs. No addition401 ± 20bp < 0.001 vs. No additionRho0-EC Normoxia—DETA-NO146 ± 3147 ± 4137 ± 3137 ± 3100 ± 3bp < 0.001 vs. No addition140 ± 6+DETA-NO341 ± 8343 ± 15331 ± 8230 ± 5bp < 0.001 vs. No addition208 ± 4bp < 0.001 vs. No addition327 ± 8 Hypoxia—DETA-NO217 ± 7224 ± 3223 ± 5178 ± 4cp < 0.01 vs. No addition156 ± 6bp < 0.001 vs. No addition223 ± 3+DETA-NO577 ± 19591 ± 13595 ± 9437 ± 16bp < 0.001 vs. No addition364 ± 15bp < 0.001 vs. No addition563 ± 15a p < 0.05 for means between treatment groups by analysis of varianceb p < 0.001 vs. No additionc p < 0.01 vs. No addition Open table in a new tab Peroxynitrite Is Formed in Cells Treated with DETA-NO—To determine whether increased mitochondrial ROS production was associated with peroxynitrite formation in our experimental system, we first measured 3-nitrotyrosine levels by ELISA (Fig. 6A).

To confirm these findings, we performed immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody to 3-nitrotyrosine (Fig. 6B). In BAEC treated with the NO· donor under normoxic conditions, there was increased 3-nitrotyrosine immunostaining that was enhanced under hypoxic conditions.

Here, we show that a continuous delivery of a low, but steady-state level of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) reduced inflammatory responses and inhibited tumor development in mice, phenomena that are induced by IL-1, mainly secretable IL-1beta. The IL-1Ra was delivered from microencapsulated genetically engineered cells, which overexpress and secrete this mediator. For a tumor model, we used fibrosarcoma cell line, which secretes high levels of IL-1beta; when injected s.c. into mice, the cells developed into large tumors characterized by very active angiogenic patterns. The proangiogenic features of IL-1beta were manifested at low levels of the cytokine, and release of 25 ng per day of the IL-1Ra was needed to oppose its effects and inhibit tumor development. The continuous delivery of the IL-1Ra contributed to improved biocompatibility of the microencapsulated cell systems; the fibrotic sac surrounding the systems was much thinner with significantly less blood capillaries and inflammatory cells. Not only do our findings point to the antiangiogenic properties of IL-1Ra in inflammation and tumor growth, but they also provide a more efficient and convenient way for treating diseases involving IL-1."

Pheromone binding proteins (PBP) are a sub-class of OBPs which carry pheromonal molecules to their receptors, which then induce sexual or endocrine responses to cognates (3Krieger J. von Nickisch-Rosenegk E.

In the honeybee antennae, three different classes of antennal-specific proteins (ASPs) have been identified as OBPs: ASP1, ASP2, and ASP3 (4Danty E. Arnold G. Huet J.C. Huet D. Masson C. Pernollet J.C. Chem. Senses. 1998; 23: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). ASP2 was assigned to be a general odorant binding protein (5Briand L. Nespoulous C. Huet J.C. Takahashi M. Pernollet J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), whereas ASP3 was classified as a chemosensory protein (6Briand L. Swasdipan N. Nespoulous C. Bezirard V. Blon F. Huet J.C. Ebert P. Penollet J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4586-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The blend corresponding to the major components of the queen bee mandibular gland extract is composed of 9-keto-2(E)-decanoic acid (9-ODA; 68.5%), 9-hydroxy-2(E)-decanoic acid (9-HDA R-(-) or S-(+); 25%), methyl p-hydroxybenzoate (6%), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylethanol (0.5%), as defined for the average amount of pheromone found in the gland of mated queen (7Slessor K.N. Kaminski L.A. King G.G.S. Borden J.H. Winston M.L. Nature. 1988; 332: 354-356Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Apis mellifera ASP1 (Amel-ASP1) was shown to be associated with the queen pheromone detection and able to bind 9-ODA and 9-HDA, the most active components of the queen pheromone blend (8Danty E. Briand L. Michard-Vanhee C. Perez V. Arnold G. Gaudemer O. Huet D. Huet J.C. Ouali C. Masson C. Pernollet J.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7468-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amel-ASP1 should, therefore, be considered as an hymenopter PBP. To date, three three-dimensional structures of insect OBP/PBPs are available: the first, originating from the Lepidopter Bombyx mori (BmorPBP), has been solved free or in complex with its pheromone bombykol, an alkyl unsaturated alcohol (9Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 10Horst R. Damberger F. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This crystallographic structure revealed a new α-helical fold delineating a buried cavity filled with bombykol. Two three-dimensional structures of the apo-protein were further solved by NMR (11Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Guntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The one at low pH (pH 4.5) revealed that the C terminus (residues 125-137) has switched from an elongated stretch conformation to an α-helix. Amazingly, this 7th helix occupies the internal cavity filled with bombykol in the x-ray structure of the complex (12Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In contrast, the other apo-form solved at neutral pH exhibits a three-dimensional structure close to that observed by x-ray diffraction in the complex, confirming thus the importance of the pH in triggering the 7th helix formation and internalization (11Lee D. Damberger F.F. Peng G. Horst R. Guntert P. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The structure of a PBP from a cockroach, Leucophea maderae (LmaPBP), has been solved free or in complex with a component of the pheromonal blend. Its structure with a fluorescence probe, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate, definitely assessed that the PBP cavity is titrated when performing probe-chasing ligand studies (13Lartigue A. Gruez A. Spinelli S. Riviere S. Brossut R. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30213-30218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). LmaPBP structure ends just after the sixth helix (helix F) and does not possess the amino acid stretch that forms the 7th internalized helix in BmorPBP. It has been proposed that the formation of the 7th internalized helix at low pH might mimic the physiological mechanism. The low pH observed near the cell membrane might provoke the PBP conformational change and expel the pheromone in the vicinity of the receptor. In LmaPBP, the absence of the amino acid stretch corresponding to this 7th helix together with evidence of a hydrophilic cavity binding a hydrophilic ligand suggested that a simpler mechanism of ligand binding and release might be used. Recently, the structure of the gene product of the Drosophila melanogaster lush gene has been solved in complex with short chain (C2-C4) alcohols (14Kruse S.W. Zhao R. Smith D.P. Jones D.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The Lush phenotype is characterized by the lack of avoidance toward high concentrations of short alcohols (15Kim M.S. Smith D.P. Chem. Senses. 2001; 26: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the absence of the lush gene, the OBP that binds the short alcohols in the antennal lymph is not expressed and, therefore, their presence is not transmitted to the olfactory receptor. Another example of function associated with PBP/OBPs was reported by Krieger and Ross (16Krieger M.J. Ross K.G. Science. 2002; 295: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) who identified in Solenopsis invicta (fire ants) two PBP alleles regulating alternative social behaviors. Their findings indicate that, at a molecular level, different receptors might be activated by a specific PBP allele in complex with the social pheromone. These two studies, structural and functional, are milestones concerning the role of OBPs/PBPs in receptor triggering. Here we report the crystal structure of Amel-ASP1, a protein of 13,180 Da. The crystals were obtained at pH 5.5 using the nano-drop crystallization technique (17Sulzenbacher G. Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Spinelli S. Valencia C. Pagot F. Vincentelli R. Bignon C. Salomoni A. Grisel S. Maurin D. Huyghe C. Johansson K. Grassick A. Roussel A. Bourne Y. Perrier S. Miallau L. Cantau P. Blanc E. Genevois M. Grossi A. Zenatti A. Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2109-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which was first developed to respond to the high demand of structural genomics programs, followed by a novel optimization procedure (18Lartigue A.

The crystals diffract to 1.6 Å at synchrotron sources, and the structure was solved initially with the SAD technique using sulfur anomalous dispersion. A serendipitous ligand, n-butyl-benzene-sulfonamide, was found in the cavity and identified by mass spectroscopy. This molecule, used as a plasticizer in polymers such as nylon polyacetyls and polycarbonates, was probably extracted during protein preparation. This illustrates the binding versatility of PBP/OBPs (19Campanacci V. Krieger J. Bette S. Sturgis J.N. Lartigue A. Cambillau C. Breer H. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20078-20084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and further suggests that receptor triggering is based on a more subtle mechanism than specific binding of a unique signaling molecule (20Bette S. Breer H. Krieger J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Amel-ASP1 Expression and Purification—Amel-ASP1 was expressed recombinant in Pichia pastoris and purified by reverse-phase chromatography as described previously (8Danty E. Briand L. Michard-Vanhee C. Perez V. Arnold G. Gaudemer O. Huet D. Huet J.C. Ouali C. Masson C. Pernollet J.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7468-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified protein was concentrated (Nanosep-3, Filtron) and washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl and 25 mm NaCl, pH 8.0 to a concentration of 40 mg/ml, which was determined by spectrophotometry using the theoretical ϵ280 = 15,580 m-1 cm-1. Crystallization of Amel-ASP1—Screening experiments were performed with several commercial kits (see Sulzenbacher et al. (17Sulzenbacher G. Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Spinelli S. Valencia C. Pagot F.

Campanacci V. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2109-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) for details). The nano-L crystallization experiments were performed by using the sitting drop method in Greiner plates (21Mueller U. Nyarsik L. Horn M. Rauth H. Przewieslik T. Saenger W. Lehrach H. Eickhoff H. J. Biotechnol. 2001; 85: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The initial crystallization droplet contained 200 nl of a 40 mg/ml protein solution in Tris 10 mm, NaCl 25 mm, pH 8.0, mixed with 100 nl of well solution containing 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 0.15 m sodium citrate at pH 5.5. First, thin crystals of ∼0.02 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm3 appeared after 1 to 3 weeks. Thicker crystals (0.2 × 0.1 × 0.7 mm3) have been obtained after optimization (18Lartigue A. Gruez A. Briand L. Pernollet J.C. Spinelli S. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Crystal improvement with nano-L drops was crucial because less than 3 mg of protein were available. We have tried to crystallize ASP1 with components of the pheromone blend. To date, however, all attempts to co-crystallize ASP1 with 9-ODA or 9-HDA led to small crystals not appropriate for structure determination. Data Collection and Structure Solution—Crystals were cryo-cooled at 100K within their crystallization liquor with the addition of 25% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Diffraction images collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble) were indexed and integrated with DENZO (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

With one molecule in the asymmetric unit, the Vm is 3.05 Å3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 60% (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar).

In addition, multiple isomorphous replacement or gas diffusion with Xenon also failed to provide a derivative. Se labeling was also tried (25Larsson A.M. Stahlberg J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 346-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the Se-labeled protein failed to crystallize. Therefore, we decided to try the SAD-phasing method at remote wavelengths using sulfur atom anomalous dispersion with native crystals. A strong theoretical Bijvoet ratio of 1.12% is expected from the 10 sulfur atoms of the protein that contribute to the anomalous signal at an x-ray wavelength of 1.77 Å. The sulfur-SAD data set was collected on beam line BM14 at ESRF, Grenoble, with an MAR charge-coupled device detector. The wavelength and the distance crystal detector were optimized to 1.77 Å and 73 mm, respectively, and a redundant data set was collected at 2.5-Å resolution. It includes 1308 images of 0.5° rotation, corresponding to 654°, completed by 300 images (300°) collected after a rotation of ∼15° of the goniostat κ angle (Table I). Data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 and Scalepack (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The data collection was followed with the XPREP program (26Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Turk D. Johnson L. Methods in Macromolecular Crystallography. IOS Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar) to estimate the anomalous signal versus the redundancy. Five sulfur atom sites were found by using either SHELXD (27Schneider T.R.

The quality of the phases was good enough (FOM = 0.67 for all reflections) to obtain an interpretable map at 3.5-Å resolution after solvent flattening using RESOLVE (Ref. 28Terwilliger T.C.

The identified location of the three disulfide bridges as well as two methionines (of the four expected) enabled us to build manually 52% of the model. This first model was subsequently used to extend the phases to 1.6 Å using a native data set collected on ID14-EH2 (18Lartigue A. Gruez A. Briand L. Pernollet J.C. Spinelli S. Tegoni M. Cambillau C.

The structure was refined by using REFMAC (Ref. 31Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar; see Fig. 2B). A serendipitous ligand was included in the refinement after GC/MS identification (see above, and see Fig. 2C). The final R and Rfree are 17.6 and 21.2%, respectively.

Amel-ASP1 was then digested with 750 μl of 30% (w/w) proteinase K (Sigma) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 by overnight incubation at 35 °C. The reaction mixture was then placed on ice and extracted with 50 μl of CHCl3. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the extract was analyzed by GC/MS. Aliquots of ammonium acetate buffer (50 μl) treated in the same way were analyzed by GC/MS as blank. Ligand analyses were conducted on a gas chromatograph (6890N, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a mass spectrometer detector (5973N, Agilent Technologies). Samples (2 μl) were injected into a non-polar capillary column (HP-5MS, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies). The column was directly connected to the mass-sensitive detector by an interface heated at 280 °C. The electron impact energy was set at 70 eV, and mass spectra were recorded in the range of 20-800 atomic mass units. Sulfur-SAD Structure Resolution—Sulfur-SAD sulfur phasing has been recently tried with success on a few known or unknown structures (32Ramagopal U.A. Dauter M. Dauter Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 33Debreczeni J.E. Bunkoczi G. Ma Q. Blaser H. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Amel-ASP1 possesses a large number of sulfur atoms: six in cysteines involved in SS-bridges and four in methionines. An extra sulfur atom is provided by the co-purified ligand. Eleven sulfur atoms for ∼13 kDa is a favorable situation. Besides the high redundancy, no special tricks were used for data collection: oscillations of 0.5° (versus 0.1-0.2° used for difficult cases), a single pass of which provided most of the data, and medium resolution data (2.4 Å). The structure solution was easy to obtain; this indicates that for small to medium proteins (100-200 residues) with a ratio kDa/S-atom of ∼1, sulfur-SAD should be the method of choice for obtaining the initial phases. Overall Structure—Amel-ASP1 has been found to be a dimer in solution at pH 7.5 (8Danty E. Briand L. Michard-Vanhee C. Perez V. Arnold G. Gaudemer O. Huet D. Huet J.C. Ouali C. Masson C. Pernollet J.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7468-7475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a monomer is contained in the asymmetric unit at the crystallization pH of ∼5.5. Another symmetry-related molecule was found to share an interface accessible surface area of 445 Å2, representing 7% of the total molecular surface. This value is too low to allow that the dimer is formed in solution in all environments and conditions. Furthermore, main contacts involved ion pairs of residues Arg-19, His-24, and Asp-61, which may depend on pH. Amel-ASP1 polypeptide chain was readily built in the electron density map between residues 3 and 119. In addition, 144 water molecules and a serendipitous ligand, N-butyl-benzene-sulfonamide, were identified and introduced. Overall, the B-factors are quite low, with an average value of 21.0 Å3/Da (Table I). Amel-ASP1 is formed of six helices as are the other PBPs; as seen in Fig. 2A, these are located between residues 7-24 (A), 28-35 (B), 43-55 (C), 67-72 (D), 79-89 (E), and 97-111 (F). The three classical PBPs disulfide bridges are observed between Cys-20-51, Cys-47-98, and Cys-87-107, locking together helices A and C, C and F, and E and F, respectively. Three irregular, independent β-strands are formed by residues 36-46, 91-95, and 114-119 at the C terminus. A quasi β-hairpin structure (extended-turn-extended) is also observed between residues 58-66. In contrast with Bmor-PBP and LmaPBP, the extended C terminus folds inside the internal cavity, along one of its wall (see below). The Cavity and the Bound Serendipitous Ligand—An L-shaped cavity is observed inside the protein, open wide to the solvent and filled in part by a ligand (see Fig. 2, B and C). One wall of the cavity is lined by the C terminus segment between residues 116 and 119. Pro-113 is located just after helix F (finishing at residue 111), re-orientating the polypeptide inside the protein. The last residue at the surface is Asp-114 and is followed by five hydrophobic residues: Val-115, part of the protein core, and by Trp-116, Phe-117, Val-118, and Leu-119, forming one of the internal cavity walls (see Fig. 2C). The rest of the cavity is covered exclusively by hydrophobic residues: Val-13, Met-49, Leu-53, Leu-74, Met-86, and Tyr-102. Val-9, Ala-55, Phe-56, Leu-58, and Leu-78 are located in the second branch of the L, which is closer to the cavity mouth. The lips of the cavity instead are formed of mixed types of residues: Trp-4, Pro-6 and -7, Glu-8, Leu-12, Asp-16, Ser-57, Leu-73, and Pro-75. To identify the ligand initially, we have built a pseudomolecule taking into account the shape of the electron density map. The resulting entity consisted of a phenyl ring, a tetrahedral moiety, and a short alkyl chain (Fig. 1C, red), a structure close to that of the identified ligand (Fig. 2B). Ligand identification was performed by gas chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Amel-ASP1 was denatured and digested with proteinase K to liberate the noncovalently bound ligand. A CHCl3 extract of the digest analyzed by gas chromatography yielded a prominent peak (Fig. 3A). Comparison of control and Amel-ASP1 showed a single peak difference in mass spectra. After comparison with the National Institute of Standards and Technology library of mass spectra, the electronic impact mass spectrum of this compound (M+ 213 plus characteristic ions at m/z 77, 141, 170) was found to correspond to an n-butyl-benzene-sulfonamide molecule (Fig. 3B). The shape of the serendipitous ligand, n-butyl-benzene-sulfonamide, fits well the cavity l-shape. Its B-factors are two times higher than those of the protein on average (39.9 Å3/Da versus 21.0 Å3/Da). Intriguingly, the phenyl ring is facing the bulk solvent in the cavity opening, whereas the polar SO2 and N-butyl moieties are more buried (Fig. 2B). One of the S=O group and the N-H group are engaged in hydrogen bonds with the C terminus backbone, the N-H group of Leu-119 (3.0 Å) and the C=O group of Phe-117 (2.6 Å), respectively (Fig. 2C). Besides these two strong and well oriented hydrogen bonds, the interactions are hydrophobic. Comparison with other PBPs and Functional Implications— Amel-ASP1 is the fourth PBP crystal structure available to date. Its root-mean-square deviations toward the other three structures vary between 1.9 and 2.2 Å for 110 residues included in the comparison. The closest is Lush, with an root-mean-square deviation of 1.9 Å; the others display root-mean-square deviation values of 2.2 Å. Many conformational changes are observed between these four structures (Fig. 4). The most significant are, indeed, at the C terminus: the shortest, LmaPBP, has no C-terminal stretch and stops at the protein surface just after helix F. BmorPBP has a long C terminus, is elongated on the protein surface in the presence of the ligand and at neutral pH, and folds as a 7th helix inside the protein at acidic pH. Both Lush and Amel-ASP1 possess a short, extended irregular β-structure that folds inside the protein and forms one wall of the cavity (residues 119-124 and 113-117, respectively). In the three previously solved PBP structures, the cavity walls are hydrophobic but also possess a few polar residues: Ser-56 in BmorPBP, Ser-52 and Thr-57 in Lush, and Tyr-5, Tyr-75, and Thr-111 in LmaPBP. These residues are used to anchor the pheromones or odors which all bear polar groups: bombykol, EtOH/butanol, and 3-hydroxy-butan-2-1, respectively. The cavities of the two closest structures, those of Lush and Amel-ASP1, present some analogy because of the presence of the C terminus inside. However, whereas the cavity of Amel-ASP1 is totally hydrophobic, that of Lush presents polar residues such as Ser-52 and Thr-57. Ser-52 is replaced by Leu-53 in Amel-ASP1, whereas Thr-57 has no topological equivalent because their backbones follow different tracks in this region. In Amel-ASP1, therefore, the hydrogen bonds with the ligand are established with backbone groups. Another striking difference between the two latter PBPs is the position of helix A, which is displaced 3-4 Å toward solvent relative to that of Lush (Fig. 4). This displacement also influences the position of the first disulfide bridge, whose position is 4 Å from that of Lush. Consequently, the cavity of Amel-ASP1 is larger that that of Lush, because the other secondary structure elements have similar positions. The four components of the pheromonal blend of Amel-ASP1 all possess polar groups. The two main components, ODA and HAD, have been found to bind to Amel-ASP1 but not to the two other honeybee antennal proteins, thus identifying Amel-ASP1 as a PBP. They possess a carboxylic group at one extremity, and a keto or hydroxyl group on the penultimate atom. Neither the cavity nor the cavity mouth bears any positively charged Lys, Arg, or His to accommodate the carboxylic group. It may be postulated that this group is simply exposed to the bulk solvent. Concerning the penultimate keto or hydroxyl groups, they might establish a hydrogen bond to the backbone N-H group of Leu-119. The rest of the molecule would be nicely accommodated by aromatic/hydrophobic residues of the cavity. Concluding Remarks—Amazingly, although PBPs display a similar fold, the diverse positions, lengths, and orientations of their helices provide a rather versatile scaffold. An additional element of this diversity is the wide variety of the loops. In contrast, the positions of the disulfide bridges are on average more conserved than the rest of the proteins. All of these features result in proteins having very different cavity shapes or nature (hydrophilic versus hydrophobic); hence, they are able to accommodate a large range of organic compounds. A single PBP has also been shown capable of accommodating various compounds with μm affinities, including fluorescent probes (19Campanacci V. Krieger J. Bette S. Sturgis J.N. Lartigue A. Cambillau C. Breer H. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20078-20084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). LmaPBP exhibits a side-chain flexibility that permits the cavity to adapt to bulky ligands (13Lartigue A. Gruez A. Spinelli S. Riviere S. Brossut R. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30213-30218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This versatility is confirmed with Amel-ASP1; a serendipitous ligand has been found in its cavity. The presence of functional or serendipitous ligands has been reported for several classes of lipid-binding proteins such as lipocalins (35Ramoni R. Vincent F. Grolli S. Conti V. Malosse C. Boyer F.D.

Schaeffer C. van Dorsselaer A. Moras D. Renaud J.P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the case of PBPs, it has been proposed that, although they are able to bind several compounds (19Campanacci V. Krieger J. Bette S. Sturgis J.N. Lartigue A. Cambillau C. Breer H. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20078-20084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), only the functional ligand would be able to let them achieve the conformation that would trigger their receptor. Such subtle conformational changes have been detected by using circular dichroism and differential spectroscopy (20Bette S. Breer H. Krieger J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 37Mohl C. Breer H. Krieger J. Invert. Neurosci. 2002; 4: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because several structures of PBPs are available at present, the challenge now is to document these subtle conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W2072704725,"Granin-family proteins, including chromogranin A (CgA) and secretogranin III (SgIII), are transported to secretory granules (SGs) in neuroendocrine cells. We previously showed that SgIII binds strongly to CgA in an intragranular milieu and targets CgA to SGs in pituitary and pancreatic endocrine cells. In this study, we demonstrated that with a sucrose density gradient of rat insulinoma-derived INS-1 cell homogenates, SgIII was localized to the SG fraction and was fractionated to the SG membrane (SGM) despite lacking the transmembrane region. With depletion of cholesterol from the SGM using methyl-β-cyclodextrin, SgIII was impaired to bind to the SGM. Both SgIII and CgA were solubilized from the SGM by Triton X-100 in contrast to the Triton X-100 insolubility of carboxypeptidase E. SgIII and carboxypeptidase E strongly bound to the SGM-type liposome in intragranular conditions, but CgA did not. Instead, CgA bound to the SGM-type liposome only in the presence of SgIII. Immunocytochemical and pulse-chase experiments revealed that SgIII deleting the N-terminal lipid-binding region missorted to the constitutive pathway in mouse corticotroph-derived AtT-20 cells. Thus, we suggest that SgIII directly binds to cholesterol components of the SGM and targets CgA to SGs in pituitary and pancreatic endocrine cells.

Currently, two models have been proposed for granule protein sorting: 1) sorting for entry and 2) sorting by retention (1Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 593-610Google Scholar, 2Glombik M.M. Gerdes H.-H. Biochimie. (Paris). 2000; 82: 315-326Google Scholar). In the sorting for entry model, secretory granule (SG) proteins are sorted at the TGN to immature SGs, which become mature SGs without losing cargo proteins. In the sorting by retention model, sorting takes place in the immature SGs, which become mature SGs after removing nongranule proteins, resulting in the retention of only SG proteins. Because granin-family proteins enter into immature SGs and reside in mature SGs, they must possess an entry and/or retention signal for the SGs. trans-Golgi network chromogranins A and B secretogranins II and III secretory granule secretory granule membrane methyl-β-cyclodextrin 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid immunoreactive insulin pro-opiomelanocortin carboxypeptidase E maltose-binding protein glutathione S-transferase 8-bromo-cyclic AMP inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylethanolamine sphingomyelin adrenocorticotropic hormone. Granin-family proteins include chromogranin A (CgA), CgB, secretogranin II (SgII), SgIII, and 7B2. They form an aggregation in a weakly acidic high Ca2+-intragranular milieu and display a high capacity for Ca2+ binding (3Yoo S.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 424-428Google Scholar, 4Taupenot L. Harper K.L. O'Connor D.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 348: 1134-1149Google Scholar). This aggregation-prone feature is important for condensing secretory proteins to SGs with co-aggregation (5Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21Google Scholar). However, aggregation itself is not sufficient for SG protein sorting to SGs, because sorting can occur without aggregation and constitutive secretion can occur with aggregation (5Dannies P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 3-21Google Scholar, 6Day R. Gorr S.-U. Trends Endocrinol. 2003; 14: 10-13Google Scholar). Thus, the sorting of granins may be directed by other factors such as specific protein-to-protein interactions or specific sorting domain structures such as the N-terminal disulfide loop (7Tooze S. Martens G.J.M. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that CgA binds to SgIII by the CgA sequence 41–109 and that SgIII targets CgA to SGs in pituitary and pancreatic endocrine cells (8Hosaka M. Watanabe T. Sakai Y. Uchiyama Y. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3388-3399Google Scholar). Thus, CgA is sorted to SGs by the lead of SgIII but the sorting of SgIII to SGs remains to be investigated. Regarding a sorting signal, the N-terminal disulfide loop of CgA, CgB, and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) has received much attention (9Tam W.W. Andreasson K.I. Loh Y.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 294-306Google Scholar, 10Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Google Scholar, 11Krömer A. Glombik M.M. Huttner W.B.

Disruption of the disulfide loop of CgB resulted in its missorting to a constitutive pathway in PC12 cells (13Chanat E. Weiss U. Huttner W.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 225-230Google Scholar). However, removal of the N-terminal loop from CgA did not affect its targeting to SGs in GH4C1 cells (14Cowley D.J. Moore Y.R. Darling D.S. Joyce P.B.M. Gorr S.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7743-7748Google Scholar), AtT-20 cells (8Hosaka M. Watanabe T. Sakai Y. Uchiyama Y. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3388-3399Google Scholar), and PC12 cells (15Taupenot L. Harper K.L. Mahapatra N.R. Parmer R.J. Mahata S.K. O'Connor D.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4827-4841Google Scholar). For recognizing the N-terminal loop of POMC, carboxypeptidase E (CPE) has been proposed for its sorting receptor (10Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Google Scholar) but the sorting of CgA was not disturbed in Neuro-2a cells depleting CPE (16Normant E. Loh Y.P. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2137-2145Google Scholar), Thus, the N-terminal loop-carrying CgA, CgB, and POMC appear to depend on distinct mechanisms for their sorting to SGs. Although CPE is not a common sorting receptor, CPE possesses a specific feature by which CPE is anchored to cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains through its C-terminal domain (17Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Google Scholar). It has been proposed that cholesterol- and glycosphingolipid-rich microdomains (lipid rafts) exist within the membrane of SGs (7Tooze S. Martens G.J.M. Huttner W.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 116-122Google Scholar). Cholesterol depletion resulted in the dissociation of CPE from the SG membrane (SGM) (17Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Google Scholar) and in the block of both regulated and constitutive secretory vesicle formation at the TGN in AtT-20 cells (18Wang Y. Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Traffic. 2000; 1: 952-962Google Scholar). PC2, a prohormone-converting enzyme localized to SGs, is reported to bind to the chromaffin granule membrane via lipid rafts (19Blàzquez M. Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Docherty K. Shennan K.I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 843-852Google Scholar). Thus, specialized lipid components may be required for the granule-destined membrane at the TGN to concentrate a number of the granule-associated proteins as seen in apical sorting (20Hansen G.H. Nies-Christiansen L.-L. Thorsen E. Immerdal L. Danielsen E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5136-5142Google Scholar, 21Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Google Scholar) and in endocytosis (22Takei K. Haucke V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 385-391Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the lipid-binding capacity of SgIII as seen in CPE and examined the interaction of SgIII, CgA, and CPE with lipid components of the SGM. We found that SgIII binds to cholesterol-rich microdomains in the SGM, suggesting that SgIII retains CgA to the SGs with this specific lipid binding. Cell Culture—A mouse corticotrope-derived AtT-20 cell line was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A rat insulinoma-derived INS-1 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% fetal bovine serum (23Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Google Scholar). Linear Sucrose Density Gradients and Granule Fractionation—A linear sucrose density gradient (20–70%, w/v) buffered with a solution containing 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 1.5 mm EDTA was formed using a tilt tube in a Gradient Master (BioComp Instruments) for 17.4 min at 58.5° and 25 rpm followed by 0.3 min at 83° and 25 rpm. INS-1 cells were detached from ten plastic plates (diameter, 100 mm) with a 20-min incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA at 37 °C, pelleted by light centrifugation, and homogenized in buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 4 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.005% DNase, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)). The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 2 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatant was recentrifuged at 26,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet, the crude organelle fraction, was resuspended in 0.8 ml of the buffer A with 1.5 mm EDTA. The crude organelle fraction was layered onto the sucrose density gradient and was centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C in a swing rotor. Gradients were fractionated by piston displacement from the top to bottom (24Yi Z. Yokota H. Torii S. Aoki T. Hosaka M. Zhao S. Takata K. Takeuchi T. Izumi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1858-1867Google Scholar) using the BioComp piston gradient fractionator. Samples for gel analysis were precipitated from fractionated samples by adding trichloroacetic acid to 7.5% and bovine serum albumin to 0.01%. Preparation of the Secretory Granule Membrane—Peak fractions with high immunoreactive insulin (IRI) were diluted and homogenized in 25-fold volume of buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with the buffer B and recentrifuge at 130,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was used as an SGM fraction. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin Treatment—The SGM fraction was resuspended in ice-cold buffer C containing an indicated concentration of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. Detergent Lysis and Differential Centrifugation—The SGM fraction was incubated for 30 min on ice in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer C (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris (pH7.5), and the protease inhibitor mixture) containing one of the following detergents: Triton X-100 (Sigma); Luburol WX (Luburol 17A17) (Serva); Brij 35 (Sigma); Tween 20 (Sigma); octylglucoside (Roche Applied Science), or CHAPS (Applichem). Unless otherwise indicated, each detergent was used at a concentration of 0.5% with the exception of Triton X-100 (1%), CHAPS (20 mm), and octylglucoside (60 mm). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting. In Vitro Liposome Binding Assay—A liposome binding assay was performed primarily as described elsewhere (25Hosaka M. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 377-387Google Scholar). Phospholipids (PC, PS, PI, PE, SM), cholesterol, and bovine brain total lipid were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. We used [3H]PC (1,2-dipalmitoyl,l-3-phosphatidyl-[N-methyl-3H]choline) (Amersham Biosciences) for a radioactive tracer. Lipids were dissolved in chloroform and then mixed in an indicated composition. A standard lipid mixture was as follows: 6.2 mol % PC; 17.7 mol % PE; 3.6 mol % PS; 1.0 mol % PI; 7.5 mol % SM; and 64 mol % cholesterol, which was dried under a stream of N2 and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer D (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) or 50 mm MES (pH 5.5) and 0.1 m NaCl). The mixture was shaken for 1 min and sonicated for 30 s using a probe sonicator. When a mixture with another composition was used, the composition was described separately. Liposomes were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min) before use to remove the aggregates. A standard liposome binding assay contained 25 μg of recombinant protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads (10 μl of wet volume). Beads were prewashed with buffer D containing 1.0 mm EGTA ± 10 mm Ca2+ and resuspended in 0.1 ml of the same buffer with 3H-labeled liposomes. A sample was incubated at room temperature for 10 min with vigorous shaking. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation (735 × g for 5 min) and washed three times with 1 ml of their respective incubation buffer, and bead-bound liposomes were quantitated by scintillation counting. For the binding of CgA to the SGM-type liposome via SgIII mediation, we added MBP-fused SgIII to the mixture of GST fusion proteins immobilized on GST beads and liposomes. The incubation and washing conditions were the same as those used in our standard methods. All of the experiments were performed at least three times and in triplicate. Construction of Bacterial Expression Vectors for Fusion Proteins— GST-fused granins and CPE were made using pGEX-KG (26Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar). The rat SgIII and CgA fragments were as follows: SgIII-(23–471); SgIII-(23–186); SgIII-(187–373); SgIII-(374–471); CgA-(1–444); and CPE. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) and were purified on glutathione beads. MBP-fused SgIII-(23–471) was made using pMAL-c2 (New England BioLabs). The MBP fusion proteins were purified by separation from amylose resin with 15 mm maltose. Antibodies—The antibodies we used included rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat CgA (Yanaihara Institute Inc.), mouse monoclonal antibody to FLAG (Sigma), rat monoclonal antibody to CPE (RDI), rabbit polyclonal antiserum to ACTH (Chemicon), fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG, and Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). We raised antiserum to SgIII (SgIII-C1) by injecting GST-fused rat SgIII-(373–471) protein into rabbits. Expression of FLAG-tagged SgIII Fragments—SgIII fragments fused to FLAG (Stratagene) were constructed in a pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with a putative signal sequence. The SgIII fragments used were as follows: 1) SgIII-(1–471); 2) SgIII Δ-(40–186) deleting SgIII-(40–186); 3) SgIII Δ-(187–373) deleting SgIII-(187–373); and 4) SgIII Δ-(374–471) deleting SgIII-(374–471). AtT-20 and INS-1 cells were cultured on an 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slide and were then expressed with FLAG-tagged SgIII fragment constructs with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Laser Confocal Microscopy—AtT-20 and INS-1 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with high salt TPBS (0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.3)) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with a mixture of guinea pig anti-insulin (1:700) or mouse anti-ACTH and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:2,500) antibodies for 18 h at 4 °C. For a second antibody reaction, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-labeled anti-guinea pig IgG. The coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol (v/v in phosphate-buffered saline) containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma). The stained cells were observed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Olympus). Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation—After transfection with the SgIII fragments, the AtT-20 cells were radiolabeled with 0.2 mCi of [35S]methionine and cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. After radiolabeling, the medium was changed to DMEM with or without 5 mm 8-Br-cAMP as a secretagogue for 1 h. Cell extracts and culture media were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for fluorography. The [35S] signals of blots were recorded in BAS2000 (Fuji film). An automatic integration method was used to calculate the intensity of each band, and the relative signals were obtained for each cell extract and medium. SgIII Is Concentrated to the Membrane Fraction of SGs—To examine the subgranular localization of SgIII in SGs, we separated subcellular organelles of INS-1 cells into 16 fractions using sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1, A and B). Because CgA, the binding partner of SgIII, localizes in the SGs, SgIII is presumed to localize in the same fraction. Insulin activity was used to identify the SG fractions (Fig. 1A), which were also expected to contain SG-associated proteins, SgIII, CgA, and CPE, and these proteins were in fact identified in the same fraction (fractions 11–13) by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). We used the antibody to CgA-(1–128) called betagranin to identify CgA molecules, because CgA is effectively processed to betagranin in β-cells (27Hutton J.C. Peshavaria M. Johnston C.F. Ravazzola M. Orci L. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1014-1020Google Scholar). Actually, ∼95% CgA molecules were processed to betagranin in the secretory granules of INS-1 cells (data not shown). Other subcellular organelle fractions were also identified with calnexin for ER, β-COP for cis-Golgi, synaptophysin for synaptic vesicle-like microvesicles, cytochrome c for mitochondria, and cathepsin D for lysosomes. The SG fractions of #11–13 had a buoyant density of 1.178 ± 0.005 g/cm3 (mean ± S.D. of five independent experiments). This value was similar to the previously reported density value for the SGs in PC12 cells (28Stinchcombe J.C. Huttner W.B. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 557-566Google Scholar). The SG fraction was lysed in hypotonic solution and then centrifuged to two fractions, a precipitated SGM fraction and a supernatant soluble fraction. An immunoblot study revealed the accumulation of SgIII, CgA, CPE, and phogrin to the SGM fraction (Fig. 1C), whereas insulin was accumulated to the soluble fraction (Fig. 1D). Thus, SgIII appears to associate with the SGM in INS-1 cells. Cholesterol Is Required for the Binding of SgIII and CgA to the SGM—Since SgIII was pulled down with the SGM despite lacking the transmembrane-spanning region, we attempted to find a partner protein for mediating SgIII binding to the SGM using a yeast two-hybrid system and a pull-down experiment using an antibody to SgIII. However, we were unable to find such candidate proteins (data not shown). We then hypothesized that SgIII may bind directly to the SGM through lipid components in the SGM. This hypothesis is based on the following four findings. 1) The SGM is composed of a specific lipid composition, which is markedly different from that of other organelles (17Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Google Scholar). 2) Depletion of cholesterol with lovastatin inhibits the SG formation in AtT-20 cells (18Wang Y. Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Traffic. 2000; 1: 952-962Google Scholar). 3) Lipid raft association of CPE results in its sorting to the secretory granule (17Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Google Scholar). 4) PC2, a prohormone-converting enzyme, binds to chromaffin granule membrane through lipid rafts (19Blàzquez M. Thiele C. Huttner W.B. Docherty K. Shennan K.I. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 843-852Google Scholar). We treated the SGM with increasing concentrations of mβCD to examine a binding characteristic of endogenous SgIII (Fig. 2). mβCD is known to complex with cholesterol and deplete it from membranes with high selectivity, leaving phospholipids unaffected (29Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Google Scholar). When we washed the SGM with mβCD, the three SGM-associated proteins, SgIII, CgA, and CPE, were gradually released from the precipitated SGM fraction to the supernatant soluble fraction (Fig. 2). Both SgIII and CgA were completely released from the SGM at 50 mm mβCD (Fig. 2, lane 5), whereas CPE was still partially retained in the SGM fraction even at 100 mm mβCD (Fig. 2, lane 7). Thus, the binding mechanism of SgIII and CgA to the SGM appears to differ from that of CPE. Because the insolubility of the proteins in detergents is a requisite of lipid raft-associated proteins (30Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Google Scholar), we investigated whether SgIII is associated with lipid rafts using a variety of detergents. When the SGM from INS-1 cells was treated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C, both SgIII and CgA were solubilized to the supernatant fraction (Fig. 3A, S), whereas with the same treatment, most of the CPE molecules remained in the precipitated membrane fraction (P). We further attempted to characterize the difference in solubility between SgIII and CPE using non-ionic detergents including Lubrol WX, Brij 35, octylglucoside, Tween 20, and the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS (31Röper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Google Scholar). However, both SgIII and CPE were solubilized in the same fashion (Fig. 3B, S). CgA also showed a similar solubility pattern to these detergents (data not shown). Thus, SgIII and CgA appear to use cholesterol for their binding to the SGM instead of lipid rafts, whereas CPE binds to the SGM through Triton X-100-resistant lipid rafts. Binding Specificity of SgIII to the SGM—To further prove the existence of the direct binding of SgIII to lipid components of the SGM without mediator proteins, we made GST-fused SgIII, CgA, and CPE and assessed their direct binding to 3H-labeled liposome incorporating [3H]PC ([3H]liposome) with specific membrane lipid similarity. We immobilized each GST fusion protein onto glutathione beads for incubation with [3H]liposome under an indicated condition. When total lipids from bovine brain was used for liposome components (Fig. 4A), SgIII and CPE bound to the brain-type liposome without Ca2+ dependence and pH preference (Fig. 4A). CgA bound to the liposome weakly but more so than did GST alone. We then employed the SGM-type liposome composed of 6.2 mol % PC, 17.7 mol % PE, 3.6 mol % PS, 1.0 mol % PI, 7.5 mol % SM, and 64 mol % cholesterol (17Dhanvantari S. Loh Y.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29887-29893Google Scholar). This SGM-type liposome constituted of highly enriched mol % cholesterol. By microscopic observation, however, the SGM-type liposome was similar to the brain-type one as well as to a standard liposome (76% PC, 24% PS) (data not shown). When the GST-SgIII and GST-CgA were incubated with the SGM-type liposome, only SgIII bound to the liposome at pH 5.5 irrespective of the presence of Ca2+, whereas CgA did not under any of the four sets of conditions. In contrast, CPE bound to the SGM-type liposome more in the presence of 10 mm Ca2+ than in its absence and more at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the binding characteristics of SgIII, CgA, and CPE to the SGM-type liposome differed from each other. Because the cholesterol-rich SGM-type liposome displayed the highest binding to the GST-SgIII at pH 5.5, we examined binding of a liposome with 0–64 mol % cholesterol to the GST-SgIII. The [3H]liposome increased in binding to the GSTSgIII with the increase of a cholesterol ratio, and the binding to the GST-SgIII was plateaued at 60 mol % cholesterol composition (Fig. 4C). Thus, the cholesterol ratio in the SGM appears to be crucial for SgIII binding to the SGM. Determination of Specific Binding Domain of SgIII to the SGM—We then determined a binding domain of SgIII to the SGM-type liposome using four sets of GST-fused SgIII fragments: SgIII-(23–471); SgIII-(23–186); SgIII-(187–372); and SgIII-(374–471). SgIII-(1–23), a signal sequence, was deleted from the GST-fused fragments. SgIII-(23–186) was as adherent to the SGM-type liposome as full-length SgIII-(23–471), whereas SgIII-(187–372) (binding domain for CgA) did not adhere to the liposome (Fig. 5A). Thus, GST-SgIII-(23–186) reflects the binding potency of the full-length SgIII-(23–471) to the liposome. The C-terminal domain, SgIII-(373–471), showed a weak but a significant level of binding capacity to the SGM liposome. When SGs are exocytosed by fusion to the plasma membrane, the intragranular pH milieu shifts from weakly acidic to neutral and granin proteins are released to the extracellular space. We examined the effect of pH on the dissociation of SgIII from the SGM-type liposome. After incubation of GST-fused SgIII with the SGM-type liposome at pH 5.5, the mixture was washed with pH 5.5 or 7.4 buffer. However, the binding of SgIII to the SGM-liposome was unchanged at either pH 5.5 or pH 7.4 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that other mechanisms are involved in the dissociation of SgIII from the SGM. We previously demonstrated that SgIII binds strongly to CgA in an intragranular milieu at pH 5.5 and 10 mm Ca2+ (8Hosaka M. Watanabe T. Sakai Y. Uchiyama Y. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3388-3399Google Scholar). In this study, we tested whether CgA requires SgIII mediation for the binding to the SGM-type liposome. We expressed SgIII-(23–471) as a MBP fusion protein and isolated a fusion protein with maltose-binding beads. GST-CgA immobilized on GST beads was incubated with the SGM-type liposome in the presence of MBP-SgIII or MBP alone at pH 5.5 and 10 mm Ca2+. GST-CgA bound to the liposome only in the presence of MBPSgIII (Fig. 6). MBP did not affect the binding of GST-CgA to the SGM-type liposome. These data indicate that CgA requires SgIII mediation for its binding to the SGM. SgIII Lacking the SGM-binding Domain Did Not Target to SGs—Because SgIII-(23–186) binds to the SGM effectively (Fig. 5A), this fragment may play an essential role in its targeting to the SGs. We made a series of deletion constructs of SgIII tagged with a FLAG epitope as shown in the left panel of Fig. 7. Their targeting to SGs was evaluated in AtT-20 cells by immunocytochemical staining and a pulse-chase labeling experiment. By immunostaining, we localized SgIII-(1–471) and SgIII Δ-(187–373) containing the binding domain SgIII-(23–186) for the SGM. They were localized densely at the tips of cell processes in addition to the perinuclear Golgi area (Fig. 7, A and C). They were virtually co-localized with ACTH. To further examine the functional significance of the domain 40–186, we made two additional constructs, SgIII Δ-(40–186) and SgIII-(1–186). Their intracellular localizations were strikingly distinct. SgIII Δ-(40–186) was virtually restricted to the Golgi area and failed to target to SGs (Fig. 7B). In contrast, SgIII-(1–186) was properly targeted to the SGs at the tips of cell processes (Fig. 7D). These findings suggest that the N-terminal sequence 40–186 is indispensable for SgIII targeting to SGs in AtT-20 cells. Although we attempted to investigate the functional significance of the C-terminal domain 374–471 of SgIII, we failed to express a construct SgIII Δ-(374–471) in AtT-20 cells for reasons unknown. We then confirmed these morphological data by 2 h of pulse labeling with [35S]methionine cysteine and 1 h of chasing with or without 8-Br-cAMP, a stimulant of ACTH secretion. As shown in Fig. 8, radiolabeled SgIII-(1–471) and SgIII-(1–186) were detected over 2-fold more often in the cell extract than in the culture medium in a non-stimulating state. In an 8-Br-cAMP-stimulating state, their radiocontent in the cell extract decreased to a third of that in the culture medium, indicating that it was secreted to the culture medium by stimulation. In contrast, there was approximately 2-fold more radiolabeled SgIII Δ-(40–186) secreted into the culture medium than in the cell extract, even in a non-stimulating state compared with the stimulating state. Thus, it appears that the SGM-binding domain, SgIII Δ-(40–186), is essential for the retention of SgIII inside the cells. Taken together with the immunocytochemical studies in Fig. 7, these data"

Using a 15N-dilution assay read-out by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that the majority of the bound guanine nucleotides do not turn over in vivo during one cell cycle period. In vitro, the isolated S. cerevisiae septin complexes have similar GTP binding and hydrolytic properties to the Drosophila septin complexes (Field, C. M., al-Awar, O., Rosenblatt, J., Wong, M.

We conclude that bound GTP and GDP play a structural, rather then regulatory, role for the majority of septins in proliferating cells as GTP does for α-tubulin.

Although the precise stoichiometry of each protein in the complex is not known, an approximate stoichiometry was calculated using gel filtration, sucrose gradients, and quantitation of Coomassie R-250-stained bands (19.Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These experiments suggest that Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, and Cdc12 are the major constituents of the septin complex, and the approximate stoichiometry of these proteins is 2:2:1:2, respectively (19.Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Septins have a characteristic domain structure: an N terminus with variable length and sequence, a conserved central region, and with a few exceptions, a C terminus predicted to form coiled-coils (15.Field C.M. Kellogg D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The conserved central region contains Ras-like GTP-binding motifs (4.Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Indeed, Field et al. (17.Field C.M. al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) showed that Drosophila septin complexes copurify with tightly bound GTP and GDP and have GTPase activity in vitro. However, GTP binding/exchange of the Drosophila septin complex was very slow in vitro when compared with the activities of generic Ras-like small GTPases (21.Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). In contrast, individual recombinant septins (Xenopus (22.Mendoza M. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1858-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), mammalian (4.Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M.

Sheng S. Shao Z. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3483-3488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)) show considerably faster GTP binding/exchange kinetics. The role of septins' GTP binding and hydrolysis is not well understood, and it constitutes the subject of this report. GTP might turn over rapidly and regulate the function of septins, as in the cases of β-tubulin (24.Hyman A. Salser S. Drechsel D. Unwin N. Mitchison T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 25.Davis A. Sage C. Dougherty C. Farrell K. Science. 1994; 264: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), FtsZ (26.Mingorance J. Rueda S. Gomez-Puertas P. Valencia A. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and small GTPases. Alternatively, GTP might incorporate once during folding or complex assembly and play no further role in the function of septins, analogous to GTP bound to α-tubulin (27.Nath J.P. Eagle G.R. Himes R.H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1555-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28.Spiegelman B.M. Penningroth S.M. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1977; 12: 587-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments implicate GTP binding in filament formation by an individual Xenopus septin (22.Mendoza M. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1858-1863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and possibly in the interaction between different septin polypeptides (23.Sheffield P.J. Oliver C.J. Kremer B.E. Sheng S. Shao Z. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3483-3488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo significance of these observations has not been tested. The cited papers echo the prevailing assumption in the field that GTP binding plays a regulatory role. Here we use in vivo exchange and biochemical assays to test whether GTP plays a regulatory or a structural role. Our data favor the latter model, which should trigger a significant change in the direction of the field. The YEF473 strain (a/α ura3-52/ura3-52 lys2-801/lys2-801 leu2-Δ1/leu2-Δ1 his3-Δ200/his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63/trp1-Δ63) (29.Bi E. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was used for isolating septin complexes for the in vitro GTP-binding experiments. The YEF473 strain was a gift from Prof. Mark Longtine (Oklahoma State University). FY4 strain (a prototroph, S288C background) was used for the in vivo nucleotide turnover experiment. The FY4 strain was obtained from Prof. Fred Winston's laboratory (Harvard Medical School). Anti-Cdc3 antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the Cdc3 protein ([C]NHSPVPTKKKGFLR), as described previously (19.Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Anti-Shs1 antibody was a gift from Prof. Douglas Kellogg (University of California at Santa Cruz) (30.Mortensen E.M. McDonald H. Yates III, J. Kellogg D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2091-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). (15NH4)2SO4 98+ atom %15N was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. S. cerevisiae septin complexes were purified using a variation of a purification method published previously (19.Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, YEF473 frozen yeast was pulverized with a liquid N2-chilled mortar and pestle. The resulting yeast powder was thawed shortly at room temperature. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. Extract buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.8% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm chymostatin, and 1 mm pepstatin) was added to the thawed powder in a ratio of 1:1.3 (mass/ml). The mixture was gently rotated for 1 h and then spun for 12 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm chymostatin, and 1 mm pepstatin and incubated for ∼210 min with (anti-Cdc3)-protein A beads (Affi-Prep Protein A Support, Bio-Rad; previously incubated with anti-Cdc3 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C). The beads were pelleted, and the supernatant depletion of Cdc3, as assessed by Western blotting analysis, was >80%. The beads were washed four times with eight volumes of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) over a period of ∼90 min. The spins during the washes were performed at 350 × g, 350 × g, 500 × g, and 3000 × g for 5 min each. The washed beads were incubated over night in 1.6 volumes of elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 4% sucrose, and 0.8 mg/ml Cdc3 peptide). The beads were pelleted at 500 × g, and the supernatant containing the septin complexes was used for further experiments. The purified septin complexes together with bovine serum albumin (BSA) standards were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie G-250 (31.Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar). The amount of Cdc12 in the sample was determined based on the Coomassie G-250 staining intensity of the BSA standards using Quantity One software. The precise stoichiometry of the septin complex is not known. Two extreme stoichiometries were assumed for determining the molarity of the GTP-binding sites (Table I): one was 2 Cdc3:2 Cdc10:1 Cdc11:2 Cdc12; and the other was 1 Shs1:2 Cdc3:2 Cdc10:2 Cdc11:2 Cdc12 (boldface used for clarity). The molar concentration of the septin complex is the same in both cases using our analysis method, but the molarity of the GTP-binding sites is different by a factor of 9/7 = 1.28. The molar concentration of the septin complexes in our preparations ranged from ∼100 to 300 nm.Table ISummary of nucleotide content analysis experiments The results of six independent experiments are shown. The yeast extract was obtained either by bead beating or by the mortar and pestle method, as indicated. The septin complexes were precipitated either by incubation with PEG 8000 for 2 h at 4°C followed by 25 min centrifugation at 390,880 × g, or by 2-h dialysis to 75 mm KCl at 4°C followed by 15 min centrifugation at 390,880 × g. Dialysis promotes the association of septin complexes into long filaments that can be pelleted using the above conditions. The bound nucleotide was quantified using co-injection with ATP standards into the SMART system (see “Experimental Procedures”). The septin protein retrieved from the 30-kDa cut-off filter (see “Nucleotide Content Analysis”) was quantified by running it on a 10% polyacrylamide gel together with BSA standards of known concentrations. Quantity One software was used for analysis. The protein concentration is probably underestimated by our method because the limitations of the technique (using BSA as a standard) and to the multiple inherent manipulations (spinning through the 30-kDa cut-off filter, transferring to tubes) before the final measurement. The nucleotide concentration is internally controlled using ATP and therefore much more accurate. Thus, the molar ratio of total nucleotide to protein is overestimated. The first number in the Total protein column and the first number in the Nucleotide/protein ratio columns were determined using the 2:2:1:2 stoichiometry, whereas the second one of each set was determined using the 1:2:2:2:2 stoichiometry (see “Experimental Procedures”).ExperimentTotal nucleotideTotal proteinNucleotide/proteinGDP/GTPpmolpmolPEG precipitation/Bead beating101.780.5/103.51.26/0.982.17PEG precipitation/Bead beating11495.2/122.41.2/0.932.19PEG precipitation/Bead beating14697.5/125.31.5/1.162.12PEG precipitation/Bead beating136.596.2/1241.4/1.11.97PEG precipitation/Mortar and pestle300225/289.51.33/1.042.24Dialysis/Mortar and pestle240140/1801.7/1.332.28 Open table in a new tab The nucleotide content of the septin proteins was determined using a variation of a procedure published previously (17.Field C.M. al-Awar O.

The following manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 1The abbreviations used are: PEG, poly(ethylene glycol); SA, specific activity; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; SPE, solid-phase extraction; FWHM, full width at half maximum; BSA, bovine serum albumin. 8000 was added to the septin complex preparation at a final concentration of 10%. The mixture was incubated for 2 h and then spun for 25 min at 390,880 × g using a TLA 100 rotor and a Beckman Coulter Optima TL Ultracentrifuge. Most of the septin proteins were pelleted in this way. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 8 m urea, heated at 100 °C for 1 min, and diluted with 20 μl of water. The resulting 40 μl were spun through a 30-kDa cut-off filter (Microcon, Millipore) at 10,000 × g. Water (40 μl) was then added to the top of the filter, and the spin was repeated. The total filtrate was applied to a Pharmacia Biotech SMART system MonoQ PC 1.6/5 column. The nucleotide bound to the column was eluted using a gradient of NH4HCO3 (from 100 to 500 mm over 3 ml). The supernatant of the PEG 8000-pelleted septins was supplemented with 8 m urea, heated 1 min at 100 °C, diluted to 2 ml in water, and then applied to the MonoQ column. We found that the supernatant contained only trace amounts of nucleotides. Alternatively, the septin complex was dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% sucrose, and the resulting septin filaments (most of the septin protein) (19.Frazier J.A. Wong M.L. Longtine M.S. Pringle J.R. Mann M. Mitchison T.J. Field C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) were pelleted at 390,880 × g for 15 min. The septin pellet was resuspended in 8 m urea, and the nucleotides were isolated as above. For nucleotide quantitation, we added known amounts of ATP to the septin pellet prior to urea denaturation, injected the total isolated nucleotides on the SMART system, and monitored the absorbance at 254 nm. The ATP signal was corrected for the difference in extinction coefficient between ATP and guanine nucleotides and was used to calculate the absolute amounts of GTP and GDP. Septin complexes in 1 m KCl (as eluted from the antibody beads) were dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4% sucrose. The dialyzed septins were supplemented with [α-32P]GTP at a final concentration of 2 μm (specific activity (SA), 150-300 Ci/mmol). The samples were incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at specific times, diluted in ice-cold wash buffer, and applied to 1.3 cm × 1.3 cm nitrocellulose filters (Scheicher & Schuell, 0.45 μm) connected to a vacuum system. Two to three aliquots were used for every time point. The filters were then washed with 5 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2) and dissolved in 250 μl of acetone. Scintillation mixture (ScintiSafe Plus 50%, Fisher Scientific, 5.6 ml) was added to each of them. The mixture was briefly vortexed and counted for 2 min. This experiment was performed in parallel to the filter-binding assay. Two extra samples were taken at each time point. These samples were filtered through nitrocellulose and washed as above. Urea solution (8 m, 50 μl) was added immediately to each filter to denature the bound protein. Samples of the nucleotides released (25 μl) were spotted onto a TLC plate (Baker-flex, cellulose PEI-F) together with GTP and GDP standards (34.Randerath K. Randerath E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12A: 323Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The plates were washed ascendantly in water to separate urea from the nucleotides. The plate was air dried and then developed in 1 m LiCl until the front reached 11 cm from the sample application line. The TLC plate was dried and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimager screen. The screen was analyzed using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager and Quantity One software. Samples of the dialyzed septin complexes were incubated with [α-32P]GTP (2 μm GTP SA, 300 Ci/mmol) and 300 μm ATP at 30 °C with or without competing GTP at 300 μm. Aliquots (25 μl) were taken at each time point and used as follows. Three samples of 5 μl each were counted using the filter-binding assay. The remaining 10 μl were mixed with additional ATP and 2-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 300 μm ATP and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The resulting mixture was incubated on ice for 1 min and then cross-linked on ice for five periods of 3 min each (with 1-min pause between each cross-linking period) using a 254-nm Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400. The sample was set at 7 cm from the UV lamps, and the power of the instrument was ∼1640 μW/cm2. The cross-linked sample was quenched with 3.7 μl of 4× sample buffer and heated for 30 s at 100 °C. 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgCl2 solution was added to each sample. The mixture was filtered through a 30-kDa cut-off Microcon filter until 98% of the liquid went through (∼15 min at 8,000 × g). The top of the filter was resuspended in 30 μl of 1× sample buffer, heated for 1 min at 100 °C, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained using Colloidal Coomassie G-250 (31.Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to the phosphorimager screen. Yeast Growth, Collection, and Processing—An FY4 yeast strain was grown in liquid minimal medium containing 2.5 g/l (15NH4)2SO4, 1.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and (NH4)2SO4, and 20 g/l glucose. The culture was grown for ∼24 h to a final A600 of 7. Four flasks containing 600 ml of 15N minimal medium were inoculated with 45 ml of the overnight culture each. The cultures were grown 5 h at 30 °C until A600 was 1.2. The cultures were filtered through a 90-mm Durapore membrane filter (0.22 μm GV, Millipore), and the filters were transferred to new flasks containing 650 ml of chase medium (5 g/l (14NH4)2SO4, 1.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and (NH4)2SO4, 0.06 g/l guanosine, and 20 g/l glucose) each. The doubling time was ∼3 h under these conditions. The cultures were grown for 0, 1, 2, and 3 h in the chase medium, respectively. From each culture, 600 ml were spun at 2,600 × g for 25 min. The pelleted yeast was frozen in liquid N2. The remaining 45 ml were filtered through a 47-mm Millipore membrane (type GS, 0.22 μm). The membrane was immersed in 1 ml of ice-cold 1 m formic acid saturated in 1-butanol to lyse the cells, precipitate the proteins, and release the intracellular pool of small molecules (35.Varma A. Freese E.B. Freese E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 201: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mixture was kept on ice for 20 min. The liquid and the precipitate scraped from the membrane were spun at 20,800 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was frozen in liquid N2 and lyophilized. The cellular GTP and GDP were isolated from the other small molecules by dissolving the lyophilized sample in water, running it over a SMART system MonoQ column, and pooling together the fractions containing GTP and GDP (see “Nucleotide Content Analysis”). The pooled fractions were lyophilized and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Septin Polypeptides and Septin-bound Nucleotide Preparation—Purified septin complex was obtained from the frozen yeast samples essentially as described above for the YEF473 yeast. However, the yeast was broken by bead beating at 4 °C using 0.5-mm glass beads (BioSpec Products). The Mini Bead Beater (BioSpec Products) was set to “homogenize.” Three pulses of 15 s each were applied to the yeast-and-beads slurry. Between each of the pulses, the tubes were cooled on ice for 5 min. The nucleotides bound to the purified samples were isolated by precipitating the septins with PEG 8000, denaturing them with 8 m urea, and filtering the released nucleotide through a 30-kDa cut-off filter (see “Nucleotide Content Analysis”). The filtrate containing the bound nucleotides was further purified on a capillary immobilized metal affinity (IMAC) solid-phase extraction (SPE) device (as described below) and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Sample buffer (1×, 30 μl) was added to the top of the filter, and the filter was heated at 100 °C for 1 min. The sample buffer solution containing the septin polypeptides was removed and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The resulting gel was stained with Coomassie R-250. The septin protein bands were cut out of the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry. IMAC Purification and Precursor-Ion Nanoelectrospray of GDP and GTP—IMAC SPE devices were prepared as described previously using gel-loader pipette tips for a total bed volume of ∼1 μl (36.Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The filtrate containing the bound nucleotide (∼40 μl) was diluted 1:1 with 0.3 m acetic acid and slowly loaded onto a washed and equilibrated IMAC SPE device (load rate, <3 μl/min). The SPE device was then washed with 40 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid, followed by 40 μl of a 3:1 mixture of 0.1 m acetic acid and acetonitrile. Immediately before analysis, the SPE bed was washed with 3 μl of a 3:1 mixture of acetonitrile and water, followed by elution with 1 μl of 0.1 m ammonia/50% methanol/water directly into a medium tip-length nanoelectrospray emitter (Proxeon Biosystems) and negative-ion nanoelectrospray. The lyophilized cellular GTP + GDP sample was reconstituted in 75 μl of purified water, of which 1 μl was diluted in 3 μl of 0.1 m ammonia/50% methanol/water and loaded into a nanoelectrospray emitter and negative-ion nanoelectrospray. Precursor-ion scanning was performed on a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum triple quadrupole mass spectrometer at optimum spray voltages between -575 and -800 V. The nozzle-skimmer (declustering) offset was 15 V. The negative PO3- product ion at 79 m/z (Q3 resolution, 0.8 full width at half maxim (FWHM)) was used to scan for precursors containing phosphate esters (Q2 argon pressure, 1.5 mtorr; collision energy, 40 V). For GDP, Q1 resolution was 0.6 FWHM, and the scan was performed from 420 to 470 m/z; for GTP Q1 resolution of 0.2 FWHM, a scan was performed from 250 to 275 m/z. Optimum spectral signal-to-noise and peak resolution was obtained using long scan times (30 s) for 10 scans. Nanoscale Microcapillary Peptide Liquid Chromatography-Selected Ion Monitoring—Sections of gel corresponding to Cdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, and Cdc12 migration at each time point were excised individually and trypsinized as described previously (37.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The final peptide extracts were dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at - 20 °C until immediately before analysis. For analysis, peptide samples were reconstituted with 20 μl of 6% acetic acid/5% methanol/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid solution, of which 5 μl was transferred to deactivated glass limited volume inserts (Agilent) and crimp-sealed in 2-ml autosampler vials. Each peptide sample (4 μl) was analyzed by nanoscale microcapillary liquid chromatography-selected ion monitoring on in-house fabricated, 100 μm × 12 cm fused silica reverse-phase microcapillary columns (200 Å pore, 5 μm particle C18-AQ, Michrom Bioresources). A FAMOS capillary autosampler (LC Packings), an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatograph, and a ThermoFinnigan TSQ Quantum (ThermoElectron) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer were used. The peptide selected ion monitoring windows (in m/z) for each protein were first determined via sequencing analysis of each individual native protein tryptic digest by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ DecaXP ion trap mass spectrometer. Peptide ions for selected ion monitoring were chosen so that they exhibited a favorable combination of high signal-to-noise and lack of interfering ions in the m/z space corresponding to any combination of 15N incorporation, based on the peptide sequence. In addition, the sequences of selected peptides were confirmed by comparison of the corresponding tandem mass spectra against the non-redundant yeast protein database using the computer algorithm SEQUEST (38.Yates III, J.R."
https://openalex.org/W2004869188,"Abstract Villin, an epithelial cell actin-binding protein, severs actin in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies report that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) regulates actin severing by villin, presumably by interaction with villin. However, direct association of villin with PIP2 has never been characterized. In this report, we presented mutational analysis to identify the PIP2-binding sites in villin. Villin (human) binds PIP2 with a Kd of 39.5 μm, a stoichiometry of 3.3, and a Hill coefficient of 1. We generated deletion mutants of villin lacking putative PIP2-binding sites and examined the impact of these mutations on PIP2 binding and actin dynamics. Our analysis revealed the presence of three PIP2-binding sites, two in the amino-terminal core and one in the carboxyl-terminal headpiece of human villin. Synthetic peptides analogous with these sites confirmed the binding domains. Circular dichroism and quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence revealed a significant conformational change in these peptides ensuing in their association with PIP2. By using site-directed mutagenesis (arginine 138 to alanine), we demonstrated the presence of an identical F-actin and PIP2-binding site in the capping and severing domain of villin. In contrast, the mutants lysine 822 and 824 to alanine demonstrated the presence of an overlapping F-actin and PIP2-binding site in the actin cross-linking domain of villin. Consistent with this observation, association of villin with PIP2 inhibited the actin capping and severing functions of villin and enhanced the actin bundling function of villin. Our studies revealed that structural changes induced by association with PIP2 could regulate the actin-modifying functions of villin. This study provided biochemical proof of the functional significance of villin association with PIP2 and identified the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of actin dynamics by villin and PIP2."

https://openalex.org/W2161467578,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a major transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53, plays a critical role in cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 after DNA damage. It was previously shown that in some human cell lines when S phase is arrested, p53 is transcriptionally impaired such that some p53 targets including p21 are only weakly induced. We show here that during S phase arrest proteasome-mediated turnover of p21 is significantly increased in a manner that is independent of p53. It is well established that p21 can interact both with cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Interestingly, the scant amount of p21 detected during S phase block cannot fully saturate cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complexes and does not interact detectably with PCNA. Importantly, DNA elongation assays in isolated nuclei show that the C terminus of p21 containing the PCNA-binding domain effectively blocks this process. This implies that p21 down-regulation could be an essential requirement for efficient restart of DNA synthesis. In line with this, only cells expressing low levels of p21 immediately progress through the cell cycle upon release from S phase arrest, whereas the remaining few high p21 producing cells move much more slowly through S. Thus, p21 down-regulation is multiply determined and is required for the reversibility of the arrest in S phase. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a major transcriptional target of the tumor suppressor p53, plays a critical role in cell cycle arrest in G1 and G2 after DNA damage. It was previously shown that in some human cell lines when S phase is arrested, p53 is transcriptionally impaired such that some p53 targets including p21 are only weakly induced. We show here that during S phase arrest proteasome-mediated turnover of p21 is significantly increased in a manner that is independent of p53. It is well established that p21 can interact both with cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Interestingly, the scant amount of p21 detected during S phase block cannot fully saturate cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 complexes and does not interact detectably with PCNA. Importantly, DNA elongation assays in isolated nuclei show that the C terminus of p21 containing the PCNA-binding domain effectively blocks this process. This implies that p21 down-regulation could be an essential requirement for efficient restart of DNA synthesis. In line with this, only cells expressing low levels of p21 immediately progress through the cell cycle upon release from S phase arrest, whereas the remaining few high p21 producing cells move much more slowly through S. Thus, p21 down-regulation is multiply determined and is required for the reversibility of the arrest in S phase. Stress signals arising from various pathways such as DNA strand breaks, stalled DNA replication forks, ribonucleotide deprivation, and hypoxia (1Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7637-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) all appear to converge on the activation of p53 leading to transcriptional activation of p53 target genes such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1 (hereafter referred to as p21). Transcriptional targets of p53 play crucial roles in both G1 and G2 checkpoints. Generally, when p53 is stabilized cells arrest irreversibly in G1 and/or G2 but not in S phase.

Interestingly, however, although p53 protein levels are increased as a consequence of these treatments, it is at least partially held in check because transcriptional targets such as p21 do not accumulate (7Gottifredi V.

Transcriptional induction of p21 is regulated by p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms (20Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). p21 is also a substrate of the proteasome (21Blagosklonny M.V. Wu G.S. Omura S. el-Deiry W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), instead N-terminal ubiquitination seems to play a key role in its degradation (26Bloom J. Amador V. Bartolini F. DeMartino G. Pagano M. Cell. 2003; 115: s71-s82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Additional complexity to the mechanism of p21 degradation is added by a recent report describing direct p21/proteasome interaction (28Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).The turnover of many cyclins and CDK inhibitors is regulated throughout the cell cycle (29Li A. Blow J.J. Nat.

Regarding p21, it has been recently reported that cyclin D1 may have a direct role in p21 turnover (31Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2036-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, when released from serum starvation SKP2-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts display decreased p21 turnover (24Bornstein G.

Serum stimulation of quiescent cells, however, also results in up-regulation of p21 protein (20Macleod K.F. Sherry N. Hannon G. Beach D. Tokino T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Jacks T.

Jacks T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). On the other hand, stress signals that cause arrest in G1 such as γ or UV irradiation or actinomycin D do not increase the half-life of p21 (22Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), suggesting that under these conditions its accumulation depends exclusively on increased transcription. Recently, however, it was shown that low (but not high) doses of UV irradiation up-regulate SKP2-dependent degradation of p21 (25Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A.

Our results indicate that such alterations in p21 levels are required to allow efficient cellular DNA elongation when the block is removed, thus ensuring the reversibility of S phase arrest.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Regulation of p21 Expression—H1299 human lung epithelial carcinoma cells (p53 null) expressing tetracycline-regulated wild-type p21 (clone p21-4 and p21-1) were previously described (34Baptiste N. Friedlander P. Chen X. Prives C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma), 300 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and 4.5 μg/ml tetracycline. H1299 cells expressing tetracycline-regulated wild-type p53 were previously described (34Baptiste N. Friedlander P. Chen X. Prives C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Parental H1299 or RKO and HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell lines with wild-type p53 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.When indicated, genotoxic agents were added at the time of tetracycline removal. These agents include: daunorubicin (Oncogene Research Products), adriamycin (Sigma), actinomycin D (Calbiochem), γ irradiation (35Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C.

Stark), hydroxyurea (Sigma), aphidicolin (Calbiochem), camptothecin (Sigma), and deferoxamine mesylate (Sigma) (used and described in Ref. 36Gottifredi V. Karni-Schmidt O. Shieh S.S. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For protease inhibition the following compounds were added as described before (37Blagosklonny M.V. An W.G. Melillo G. Nguyen P. Trepel J.B. Neckers L.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6460-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) at the indicated hours before cell lysis: N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CH2 (50 μm; Calbiochem), MG132 (30 μm; Calbiochem), β-lactone (10 μm; Boston Biochem), ammonium chloride (2.5 mm; Sigma), chloroquine (100 μm; Sigma), and bafilomycin (100 nm; Sigma).Protein Analysis—The extracts were prepared by incubating ∼2 × 105 cells in 100 μl of protein extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 5 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors for 20 min at 4 °C. The low stringency buffer contains 25 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, Triton 0.5%, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors. In sequential immunoprecipitations, the first incubation was with anti-p21 monoclonal antibody (AB-1; Oncogene Science) for 3 h at 4 °C. The second incubation was with anti-p21 polyclonal antibody (C19; Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C. Anticyclin A (Sigma) or anti-PCNA (AB-1; Oncogene Sciences) antibodies were used for5hat4 °C. The antibodies used for immunoblotting were: AB-1 and C19 for human p21, AB-1 for PCNA (Oncogene Research Products), HA.11 for hemagglutinin epitope (Covance), anti-CDK2 (Santa Cruz), anti-cdc2 (Santa Cruz), cyclin A (Santa Cruz), and anti-actin (Sigma).Half-life Measurement—After incubation of cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine (10% dialyzed serum) for 45 min, [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) (Amersham Bioscience) was added. 30 min later, the cells were washed and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 400 mg/ml methionine. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (the high stringency buffer) containing 10 mm Tris, 25 mm NaF, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate NaDOC, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors as described before (27Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). RIPA extraction was followed by sonication before centrifugation, and immunoprecipitations were performed with a mixture of p21 monoclonal antibodies AB-1 (Oncogene Science) and C19 (Santa Cruz). After SDS-PAGE, quantification of [35S]methionine-labeled p21 was performed by phosphorimaging using ImageQuant software. [35S]Methionine incorporation at each point was expressed as a fraction of the maximal value obtained before chasing. For experiments using cycloheximide treatment to measure half-life, the cells were treated or not with DNA damaging agents for 24 h, at which point they were lysed with protein extraction buffer. Cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) was added to cultures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h before lysis. The protein content of the extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. The cell extracts (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for p21 protein and actin as loading control followed by densitometry using Scion Image software. To derive the half-life of p21, at each time point the amount of actin-normalized p21 was expressed as a fraction of the initial levels in the absence of cycloheximide. To obtain more accurate analysis, film exposures were chosen so that the initial levels of p21 were similar.Northern Blotting—RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), resolved on agarose gels, transferred to nylon, and hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled p21 and HDM2 plasmid probes. For RNA loading controls the blots were stripped and then rehybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe.Cell Cycle Analysis and Bromodeoxyuridine Incorporation—The cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol. When indicated, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with p21 AB-1 and then with a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 633 (Molecular Probes). The cells were resuspended in 0.9 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing RNase I (50 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (PI) (25 μg/ml, Sigma). The stained cells were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) using the ModFit LT program.Preparation of Nuclei and DNA Synthesis Reactions in Vitro—The nuclei were prepared as described before (38Krude T.

RKO cells (2.5 × 105) were washed twice with ice-cold hypotonic buffer (20 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm potassium acetate, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT), followed by Dounce homogenization (20 strokes) and centrifugation at 3.000 rpm for 5 min. The nuclei were permeabilized by incubation with 0.1% TritonX-100 in SuNaSpBSA (39Krude T. J. Biol.

The isolated nuclei were pelleted through a 1-ml cushion of 30% sucrose onto coverslips coated with polylysine. The coverslips were incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h in 50 μl of reaction mixture (40 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgCl2,3mm ATP, 0.1 mm of each GTP, CTP, and UTP, 0.1 mm of each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.25 mm biotin-16-dUTP, 0.5 mm DTT, 40 mm creatine phosphate, and 5 μg of phosphocreatine kinase; all from Roche Applied Science) containing the indicated amounts of recombinant proteins. Expression vectors for His-tagged p21 were kindly provided by B. Stillman, and the GST-tagged N- and C-terminal regions of p21 were kindly provided by A. Dutta. His-p21, His-HMGB1-box B mutant K96E protein, GST, GST-N-p21, and GST-C-p21 were purified according to previously described protocols (35Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 40McKinney K. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6797-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Replicating DNA and total genonic DNA were visualized by incubation with streptavidin-Alexa fluor 594 (Molecular Probes) and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Applied Science) respectively.RESULTSp21 Levels Are Reduced during S Phase Arrest—We previously reported that when DNA replication in RKO cells is blocked by HU or yidicolin (APH), p53 is efficiently induced but is transcriptionally impaired (7Gottifredi V. Shieh S. Taya Y. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). When we subsequently pursued these findings using HCT116 colorectal cancer cells, some differences in the regulation of p53 transcriptional targets were observed. An inefficient but detectable accumulation of p21 mRNA that did not result in any increase in p21 protein accumulation was observed after HU treatment (Fig. 1A). This suggested that p21 is down-regulated at a post-transcriptional level (Fig. 1A). The effect seemed quite selective for p21 because a moderate induction of HDM2 mRNA was correlated with a modest but detectable accumulation of Mdm2 protein (Fig. 1A). Further supporting the selectivity of the effect of HU on p21 protein down-regulation was our observation of a p53-dependent increase in levels of PIG3 mRNA and protein under these conditions (7Gottifredi V. Shieh S. Taya Y. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To confirm a direct effect of HU treatment on p21, a p53 null H1299 cell line (p21-4) engineered to express tetracycline-regulated p21 protein was used (34Baptiste N. Friedlander P. Chen X. Prives C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In p21-4 cells the maximum p21 protein levels obtained by complete tetracycline removal are similar to those observed after DNA damage-dependent induction of p21 in RKO or HCT116 p53+/+ cells (data not shown). Thus, p21 is not expressed at supraphysiological levels in p21-4 cells. To arrest p21-4 cells in early S phase, we used HU and found that a marked reduction of p21 protein but not p21 mRNA occurred when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1B). This was also observed in another independently derived p21-inducible H1299 cell line (clone p21–1; data not shown).To avoid the complexity of stress induced alterations in p21 mRNA levels in cells with wild-type p53, we used p21-4 cells to further study the down-regulation of p21 protein after HU treatment. We first examined the effect on p21 protein of a number of different chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 1C). Of these, only HU, APH, and deferoxamine mesylate (DFX) caused reduction in p21 protein but not mRNA levels (Fig. 1C). HU, APH, and DFX were also the only treatments that caused arrest at the beginning of S phase (Fig. 1C, lower panels). This suggested a link between p21 down-regulation and the cell cycle phase in which cells are arrested.To determine whether p21 down-regulation requires arrest in S phase, HU was added to p21-4 cells either 24 h before (HU 36), at the same time (HU24), or 12 h after (HU12) the induction of p21 by tetracycline removal (diagram in Fig. 2). When HU was added either before or at the same time of p21 induction, arrest in early S phase occurred independently of p21 status (Fig. 2A, compare +tet and -tet profiles). In contrast, when p21 was induced before HU treatment (HU12) the p21-positive population (- tet) was arrested mainly in G1, whereas the p21-negative population (+ tet) arrested in early S phase. Although p21 mRNA levels were not affected by any of these combinatorial treatments (Fig. 2, bottom panels), p21 protein levels were differentially affected (Fig. 2, middle panels). Only when HU treatment caused accumulation of cells in early S phase (HU36, HU24) was p21 protein diminished. Reciprocally, when the cells were not arrested in the S phase, there was no detectable reduction of p21 protein levels (HU12). This supports the likelihood that S phase arrest is required for p21 down-regulation.Fig. 2p21 down-regulation is cell cycle-dependent. p21-4 cells were treated with HU (1.5 mm) 12 h before (HU36), at the same time (HU24), or 12 h after (HU12) induction of p21 (- tet). HU was added in parallel to plates in which tetracycline was not removed (+ tet). A timeline of this experiment is shown at the top left. 24 h after p21 induction parallel cultures were processed for FACS analysis (top panels), Western blotting (WB, middle panels), and Northern blotting (NB, bottom panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p21 Turnover by the Proteasome Is Increased during S Phase—To further characterize the increased rapidity of p21 turnover in S phase, we determined the half-life of p21 and proteasome involvement in its turnover. First, pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine incorporation showed a clearly discernable reduction in p21 half-life when cells were treated with HU (Fig. 3A). Second, this analysis was also extended to other cell lines (a p53-inducible cell line as well as RKO and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells) in experiments using cycloheximide after different treatments. Although the absolute values for p21 half-life varied between [35S]methionine pulse-chase and cycloheximide chase experiments because of intrinsic differences in experimental protocols (data not shown), the fold reduction in the presence of different agents was similar between the two protocols. As shown in Fig. 3B, p21 turnover was not affected by γ irradiation, actinomycin D, and daunorubicin, but HU, APH, and DFX treatment reduced the half-life of p21 by approximately a factor of two when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Third, by testing a number of proteolysis inhibitors (37Blagosklonny M.V. An W.G. Melillo G. Nguyen P. Trepel J.B. Neckers L.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6460-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we observed that only agents that block the proteasome counteracted p21 degradation in S phase (Fig. 3C). Thus, accelerated p21 turnover in S phase results from up-regulation of its normal degradation by the proteasome. Taken together these results indicate that proteasome-directed p21 degradation is increased during S phase arrest.Fig. 3p21 turnover is increased when cells are arrested in S phase.A, p21 degradation increases during HU treatment. After washing, p21-4 cells were either not treated (-) or treated with HU (1.5 mm) as indicated. 24 h later pulse-chase incorporation of [35S]methionine was performed. The cells were lysed at the indicated time points, and immunoprecipitations using AB-1 and C19 monoclonal antibodies were performed. The amount of [35S]methionine incorporated in each sample was determined and plotted as a fraction of the maximal value obtained at time 0 after chase. B, S phase arrest leads to increased p21 turnover in multiple cell lines. Clones of H1299 cells expressing either p21 (P21-4) or p53 (P53-14) proteins 24 h after tetracycline withdrawal, or RKO and HCT116 cells were treated with the indicated agents as in Fig. 1C. Cycloheximide treatment and half-life determination were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After normalization of p21 to actin loading controls, the half-life of p21 was calculated and expressed as relative values compared with untreated controls. C, p21 degradation is regulated by the proteasome after HU treatment. After washing, p21-4 cells were treated with HU (1.5 mm). Proteasome inhibitors N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CH2 (L; 50 μm), MG132 (M; 30 μm), and β-lactone (β; 10 μm); calpain protease inhibitor PD150606 (P; 20 μm); and acidic cathepsin protease inhibitors bafylomicin (B; 100 nm) and ammonium chloride (A; 2.5 mm) were added to cells 6 h before lysis. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-p21 and actin antibodies.

Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, although markedly reduced, p21 never completely disappeared during S phase arrest of p21-4 cells. It was of interest to examine the distribution of the residual p21 in CDK2 and PCNA complexes (Fig. 4). Our experimental design was based on a previous report (32Cai K. Dynlacht B.D. Proc. Natl.

A monoclonal antibody (AB-1) whose epitope maps within amino acid residues 58–77 of human p21 near the CDK2 binding site and a polyclonal antibody (C-19) that binds to the C terminus of p21 and cannot recognize p21 bound to PCNA were used (32Cai K.

https://openalex.org/W2152541580,"VEGF-A is a key regulator of inflammatory and tumor-associated angiogenesis. H. pylori plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of benign and malignant gastric diseases. It has been suggested that H. pylori infection is associated with activation of host angiogenesis, however, underlying mechanisms as well as angiogenic growth factors activated by the bacterium have not yet been identified. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the bacterium on VEGF-A as a candidate host target gene in vivo and in vitro. We show that H. pylori potently up-regulates production and release of VEGF-A protein as well as vegf-A mRNA levels, and we provide strong evidence that enhanced recruitment of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to two proximal GC-rich vegf-A promoter elements mediates H. pylori-triggered vegf-A gene expression. In addition, H. pylori infection increased the transactivating capacity of both Sp1 and Sp3, which suggests additional mechanism(s) of vegf-A gene regulation by the bacterium. Signaling studies identified the MEK>ERK1/-2 kinase cascade as principal host signaling pathway mediating H. pylori-stimulated vegf-A transcription. By identifying H. pylori as potent activator of vegf-A gene expression and characterization of underlying molecular mechanisms, our results provide novel insights into pathways linking the bacterium to host angiogenesis and may help to develop strategies to influence vegf-A gene expression in the setting of H. pylori infection."

https://openalex.org/W2167926695,"A sensory nerve supply is crucial for optimal tissue function. However, the mechanisms for successful innervation and the signaling pathways between nerves and their target tissue are not fully understood. Engineered tissue substitutes can provide controllable environments in which to study tissue innervation. We have therefore engineered human corneal substitutes that promote nerve in-growth in a pattern similar to in vivo re-innervation. We demonstrate that these nerves (a) are morphologically equivalent to natural corneal nerves; (b) make appropriate contact with target cells; (c) can generate action potentials; (d) respond to chemical and physical stimuli; and (e) play an important role in the overall functioning of the bioengineered tissue. This model can be used for studying the more general topics of nerve ingrowth or regeneration and the interaction between nerves and their target cells and, more specifically, the role of nerves in corneal function. This model could also be used as an in vitro alternative to animals for safety and efficacy testing of chemicals and drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1963630554,"We investigated the expression and activity of arginine transporters and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human placental microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC). Using RT-PCR amplification products for eNOS, CAT1, CAT2A, CAT2B, CAT4, 4F2hc (CD98), rBAT and the light chains y+LAT1, y+LAT2, and b0+T1 were detected in HPMEC, but not B0+. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting confirmed the presence of 4F2hc and CAT1 protein in HPMEC. 4F2hc-light chain dimers were indicated by a shift in molecular mass detected under nonreducing conditions. L-Arginine transport into HPMEC was independent of Na+ or Cl- and was inhibited by the neutral amino acid glutamine, but not by cystine. The Ki for glutamine inhibition was greater in the absence of Na+. Kinetic analysis supported a two-transporter model attributed to system y+L and system y+. Expression of eNOS in HPMEC was detectable by immunohistochemistry and ELISA but not by Western blotting. Activity of eNOS in HPMEC, measured over 48 h, either as the basal production of nitric oxide (NO) or as the accumulation of intracellular cGMP was not detectable. We conclude that HPMEC transport cationic amino acids by systems y+ and y+L and that basal eNOS expression and activity in these cells is low."

Cells deficient in PML are resistant to apoptosis induced by multiple apoptotic stimuli (1.Wang Z.G. Delva L. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Giorgio M. Gordon-Cardo C. Grosweld F. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 1998; 279: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed the existence of p53-dependent PML-induced apoptosis pathways, as well as a p53-independent pathway (2.Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 3.Pearson M. Pelicci G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7250-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PML represses the transactivation function of Nur77, an essential protein necessary for apoptosis in thymocytes (4.Wu W.S. Xu Z.X. Ran R. Meng F. Chang K.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3925-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, PML has also been shown to interact with nuclear factor (NF)κB, potentiating tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis by inhibition of the NFκB survival pathway (5.Wu W.S. Xu Z.X.

In this study, PML was found to interact with RelA and possibly sequester it to PML nuclear bodies (NBs), thus preventing its binding to the cognate enhancer to activate its target genes. PML has also been reported to repress the NFκB downstream target gene A20 by interfering with RelA binding to the promoter element (6.Wu W.S. Xu Z.X. Chang K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31734-31739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CHK2 interacts with and phosphorylates PML at Ser-117, which is required for ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis (7.Yang S. Kuo C. Bisi J.E. Kim M.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This finding links PML function to a p53-independent, CHK2-mediated, IR-induced apoptosis through the ataxia telangiectasia mutated CHK2-PML pathway. PML is the major component of the macronuclear structure designated PML NB, PML oncogenic domain (POD), or nuclear domain-10 (ND-10) (8.Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PML gene is involved in the nonrandom chromosomal translocation t(15;17), which is found in more than 98% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (8.Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In APL, the normal PML NBs are disrupted as a result of heterodimer formation with PML-retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) (9.Perez A.P.

Recent studies have shown an important role of PML in genome stability and DNA-damage response (22.Carbone R. Pearson M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.P.

Many of the enzymes involved in double-strand-break DNA repair, including Brca1, ataxia telangiectasia mutated, Mre11, Rad51, Rad9, TopBP1, H2AX, and the product of the Bloom's syndrome gene, have been found to colocalize with the PML NBs in response to IR-induced DNA damage (20.Zhong S.

Biol. 2003; 23: 4247-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PML was shown to recruit the DNA damage response protein TopBP1 to the PML NBs and significantly stabilize the protein (29.Xu Z.X. Timanova-Atanasova A. Zhao R.X. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4247-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PML and TopBP1 were shown to colocalize with the IR-induced single-stranded DNA at the sites of double-strand-break DNA damage repair. However, the mechanism of how PML is involved in DNA damage responses is not clear. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins. Its expression is low or undetectable in most normal adult tissues but high in most cancer cells (30.Kawasaki H. Altieri D.C. Lu C.D. Toyoda M. Tenjo T. Tanigawa N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5071-5074PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Survivin inhibits apoptosis and promotes cancer cell survival (31.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat.

Leech S.H. Fabbro D. Stahel R.A. Zangmeister-Wittke U. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism through which Survivin inhibits apoptosis has been a controversial issue (34.Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A recent report demonstrated that Survivin does not bind caspase 3 or inhibit its activity (35.Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It was convincingly demonstrated that Survivin interacts with cofactor cellular hepatitis B X-interacting protein and that the heterodimer then binds to procaspase 9 and prevents it from binding to Apaf1. This study clearly showed that Survivin inhibits apoptosis by preventing the activation of caspase 9 and downstream effector caspases (35.Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Regulation of Survivin gene expression involving multiple Sp1 sites has been found along the basal Survivin promoter elements. Mutagenesis analysis of these sites revealed the importance of Sp1 in the activation of the Survivin gene (36.Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor p53 represses transcription of the Survivin gene (37.Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol.

Because overexpression of Survivin is cancer cell-specific, strategies for targeted disruption of Survivin function are potential tools for cancer gene therapy (39.Mesri M. Wall N.R. Li J. Kim R.W. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To continue to explore the role of PML in apoptosis, we performed a microarray analysis and identified Survivin as one of the downstream target genes of PML. Our study demonstrated an important role of PML in the repression of Survivin expression in vivo. Consistently, PML–/– mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) expressed a substantially higher level of Survivin, a finding that may partially explain why these cells are resistant to multiple pathways of apoptosis (1.Wang Z.G.

The full-length cDNAs of PML1a and PML3 were constructed by PCR amplification of the cDNAs and subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector at the BamHI/EcoRI sites. The PML2 and PML5 isoforms were constructed by PCR amplification of the 3′ portion of the cDNAs and replaced the MluI/EcoRI fragment of pSG5/PML4 (23.Vallian S. Chin K.V. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell.

U2OS, Saos2, MO59K, and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The immortalized PML–/– MEFs and normal MEFs were established by continuous culture over a period of 2 months in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Experiments presented in Fig. 2 were performed using the immortalized cells at passage 15. Gene Transfer and Luciferase Reporter Assay—U2OS and Saos2 cells were cultured to semiconfluence and transfected with the plasmid constructs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Cells continued to culture in a humidified CO2 incubator for 48 h. Total proteins were isolated, and the reporter activity in each transfection assay was determined. Luciferase activity assay was performed using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). In each cotransfection assay, 50 ng of the expression plasmid pCMV/β-Gal was included, and β-galactosidase activity was determined to normalize transfection efficiency. Cell Death Analysis—Cell death was determined using trypan blue exclusion assay and a cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cell death ELISA kit was obtained from Roche Diagnostics Corp. A549 cells were cultured to semiconfluence and infected with recombinant PML adenovirus, Ad-PML, or control virus, Ad-ASPML, as described previously (43.Reed J.C. Bischoff J.R.

Cell death was determined 24 h after infection with the recombinant adenovirus. Cell death by apoptosis was also determined by examining the activation of caspase 9, caspase 7, and caspase 3 by Western blotting. Small Interfering RNA Inhibition of PML Expression—Two pairs of small interfering RNA (siRNA) were synthesized (Xeragon-Qiagen, Germantown, MD) for targeting the PML mRNA: 5′-AAGCACGAAGACAGACCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-AACGACAGCCCAGAAGAGGAA-3′. Cells cultured to semiconfluence were transfected with two pairs of siRNA (3.2 μg/well in a 6-well plate) using Transmessager RNA transfection reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transfected cells continued to culture for an additional 48 h, total proteins were isolated, and the effect of siRNA on PML protein expression was determined by Western blotting. Immunofluorescent Staining and Western Blotting—Double color immunofluorescent staining was performed using the PML polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit as described previously (29.Xu Z.X. Timanova-Atanasova A. Zhao R.X. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4247-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PML and Survivin monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and Novus (Littleton, CO), respectively. Survivin Is a Downstream Target Gene of PML—To identify the downstream target genes of PML, we performed a DNA microarray analysis using RNA isolated from U2OS/pMEP4 (negative control) and U2OS/PML4 established previously in our laboratory (5.Wu W.S. Xu Z.X. Hittelman W.N. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Chang K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12294-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expression of PML4 was induced by treatment with 100 μm Zn2+. Many genes up-regulated and down-regulated by PML4 were identified. One target gene significantly down-regulated by PML4 is Survivin, which plays an important role in the inhibition of apoptosis and enhancement of cell survival. It is interesting that Survivin is not expressed in most adult tissues but is overexpressed in most cancer cells. A role of Survivin in promoting cancer cell survival and inhibition of cell death by apoptosis has been well documented (31.Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (2981) Google Scholar, 32.Grossman D. Kim P.J. Blanc-Brude O.P. Brash D.E. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33.Olie R.R. Simoes-Wust P. Baumann B. Leech S.H. Fabbro D. Stahel R.A. Zangmeister-Wittke U. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We sought to further explore the effects of PML in the repression of Survivin expression and its possible function in mediating apoptosis. Repression of Survivin Protein Expression by PML—Our previous study showed that the induced expression of PML4 in U2OS cells did not result in a significant increase in cell death in the absence of tumor necrosis factor α (5.Wu W.S. Xu Z.X. Hittelman W.N. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Chang K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12294-12304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The results presented in Fig. 1A show that induced PML4 expression by Zn2+ moderately decreased the protein expression of Survivin in these cells. However, a substantially lower level of Survivin protein was found after SiHa cells were treated with increasing concentrations of interferon (Fig. 1B). We next examined the effects of PML knockdown by siRNA on the expression of Survivin. The results presented in Fig. 1B show that the two sets of PML siRNAs substantially reduced the expression of PML. We found that the down-regulation of PML in SiHa cells was associated with a significant increase in Survivin expression. This result strongly supports the notion that Survivin is a direct downstream target gene of PML. Deregulation of Survivin Gene Expression in PML-deficient Cells—We next sought to examine whether the Survivin gene is deregulated in PML-deficient cells. If PML regulates the expression of Survivin in vivo, the absence of PML should lead to increased expression of Survivin. The NB4 cell line was derived from the blast cells of a patient with APL. The PML gene is disrupted by the nonrandom chromosomal translocation t(15;17), which occurs in more than 98% of APL cases (8.Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PML gene fuses the RARα gene, which encodes the leukemia-specific fusion protein PML-RARα. ATRA induced differentiation of NB4 cells, degradation of the PML-RARα fusion protein, and reorganization of normal PML functions (8.Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether Survivin expression in NB4 cells was altered, Western blot analysis of Survivin expression was performed using total protein isolated from NB4 cells and cells treated with ATRA. The results presented in Fig. 1C show that the expression of Survivin protein level in NB4 cells was high and that ATRA induced a significant reduction of Survivin protein level. We next examined whether expression of the Survivin gene was deregulated in PML–/– MEFs. The results presented in Fig. 2, A and B, demonstrate that the immortalized PML–/– MEFs indeed expressed substantially higher levels of Survivin protein than the normal MEFs did. Treatment of MEF cells with IR or interferon (IFN) increased the expression of PML, resulting in a reduction of Survivin expression. We next reexpressed the PML protein in PML–/– MEFs by recombinant PML adenovirus (Ad-PML)-mediated gene transfer (40.Le X.F. Vallian S. Mu Z.M. Hung M.C. Chang K.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As expected, re-expression of PML in the PML–/– MEFs significantly repressed Survivin expression (Fig. 2, C and D). PML–/– cells have been shown to be resistant to multiple pathways of apoptosis (1.Wang Z.G. Delva L. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Giorgio M. Gordon-Cardo C. Grosweld F. Pandolfi P.P. Science. 1998; 279: 1547-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), and the high expression of Survivin in PML-deficient cells (Fig. 2, A–C) may have contributed to their resistance to cell death by apoptosis. PML Represses Transactivation of the Survivin Promoter— To understand how PML4 represses expression of the Survivin gene, we analyzed the effects of PML4 on the transactivation function of the Survivin promoter. Fig. 3B shows that PML4 represses Survivin promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. The repression effects of PML4 on the Survivin promoter and two deletion mutants (36.Li F. Altieri D.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) were analyzed in two different cell lines (Fig. 3, C and D). Significant repression of Survivin promoter activity was found in both cell lines tested. Because Saos2 cells lack p53 and retinoblastoma protein, Rb, the transcription repression of the Survivin promoter mediated by PML4 is p53-independent (Fig. 3D). To further elucidate how PML4 represses transactivation of the Survivin promoter, we performed a series of cotransfection experiments using PML4 and various PML4 mutants. The results presented in Fig. 4A demonstrate that the C-terminal portion (amino acids 555–633) of the PML4 protein is responsible for the repression effects. This finding suggests that PML repressed Survivin promoter in a PML isoform-specific manner. The cotransfection experiment was repeated using various PML isoforms (41.Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Expression of the respective proteins encoded from the transfected PML4 mutants and various PML isoform-specific cDNAs was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 4, B and D). The results presented in Fig. 4C show that PML4 is the only isoform that repressed transactivation of the Survivin promoter. Although p53 has been shown to be a transcriptional repressor of the Survivin gene promoter (37.Hoffman W.H. Biade S. Zilfou J.T. Chen J. Murphy M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3247-3257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 38.Mirza A. McGuirk M. Hockenberry T.N. Wu Q. Ashar H. Black S. Wen S.F. Wang L. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. Nielsen L.L. Pickett C.B. Liu S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), our study revealed a PML4-specific transcriptional repression of the Survivin promoter that was independent of p53 function.Fig. 4The PML domain necessary for transcriptional repression of the Survivin promoter. A, the Survivin promoter luciferase construct SpII (0.2 μg) was cotransfected with 0.8 μg of the PML mutants into U2OS cells. Total proteins were isolated 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each cotransfection experiment also included 50 ng of pCMV/β-Gal, and β-galactosidase activity was determined to monitor transfection efficiency in each assay. B, expression of the PML mutants in each cotransfection assay was determined by Western blotting using the PML polyclonal antibody raised against the GST-PML fusion protein. C, PML isoform-specific repression of the Survivin promoter. Cotransfection experiments were performed as described in A. The results represent the average of three separate experiments. Expression of various PML isoforms in the transfection assay was determined by Western blotting (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of PML and Survivin at Various Phases of the Cell Cycle—Survivin is not expressed in normal adult tissues but is highly expressed in many types of cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (30.Kawasaki H. Altieri D.C. Lu C.D. Toyoda M. Tenjo T. Tanigawa N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5071-5074PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Carter B.Z. Milella M. Altieri D.C. Andreeff M. Blood. 2001; 97: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In cancer cells, Survivin is expressed at the highest levels during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (43.Reed J.C. Bischoff J.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 545-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To further explore the inverse relationship between PML and Survivin, MO59K cells were synchronized at various phases of the cell cycle, and levels of PML and Survivin were determined by Western blotting. The results presented in Fig. 5A show that serum starving and mimosine treatment arrested 77.3 and 80.6% of the cells at the G1 phase, hydroxyurea and thymidine arrested 86.5 and 80.1% of the cells at the S phase, and nocodazole arrested 80.5% of the cells at the G2/M phase. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Survivin was expressed at significantly higher levels in the G2/M phase, as expected (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, a significant down-regulation of PML in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle was found. To further understand the expression of PML and Survivin during cell cycle progression, U2OS cells were synchronized at the G1 phase of the cell cycle by treatment with mimosine. The cell cycle progression was monitored by flow cytometry after release from G1 arrest (Fig. 5C). This study showed that 71.4% of the cells were at the G2/M phase 12 h after being released from G1 arrest. Western blot analysis demonstrated an increase in Survivin and a significant down-regulation of PML at the G2/M phase. This finding provides further support for the role of PML in the negative regulation of Survivin expression in vivo. PML Represses Survivin Expression and Induces Cell Death by Apoptosis—To further investigate the effects of PML on the expression of Survivin and apoptotic cell death, we used the cell line A549, which expresses a high level of Survivin. It has been shown previously that antisense inhibition of Survivin expression induced apoptosis in this cell line (33.Olie R.R. Simoes-Wust P. Baumann B. Leech S.H. Fabbro D. Stahel R.A. Zangmeister-Wittke U. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Chen J. Wu W. Tahir S.K. Kroeger P.E. Rosenberg S.H. Cowsert L.M. Bennett F. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Welsh K. Reed J.C. Ng S.C. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A549 cells were infected with recombinant PML adenovirus Ad-PML (40.Le X.F. Vallian S. Mu Z.M. Hung M.C. Chang K.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A significant increase in PML expression was found in these cells 36 h after infection, and a substantial reduction of Survivin expression was observed (Fig. 6A). No noticeable increase in PML or down-regulation of Survivin was found in cells infected with the adenovirus control. We next examined the effects of PML on apoptosis in these cells by trypan blue exclusion assay and by using a Cell Death Detection ELISA-plus kit (Roche Applied Science). Massive cell death was seen in PML-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6, B and C), which was associated with the activation of pro-caspase 9, caspase 7, and caspase 3. Survivin has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of pro-caspase 9 by interacting and preventing it from binding to Apaf1 (35.Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that PML induces apoptotic cell death through the down-regulation of Survivin, a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. Our study convincingly demonstrated that the apoptosis inhibitor Survivin gene is a direct target of PML. Survivin overexpression has been found in many types of cancers, promoting survival and contributing to the continued proliferation of these cells (45.Adida C. Berrebi D. Peuchmur M. Reyes-Mugica M. Altieri D.C. Lancet. 2000; 351: 882-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 46.Grossman D. McNiff J.M. Li F. Altieri D.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 1076-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 47.Monzo M. Rosell R. Felip E. Astudillo J. Sanchez J.J. Maestre J. Martin C. Font A. Barnadas A. Abad A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that PML represses transactivation of the Survivin promoter. Overexpression of PML significantly reduced the expression of the Survivin protein. Inhibition of PML expression by siRNA was associated with a significant increase in Survivin expression. Furthermore, PML-deficient cells express high levels of Survivin. Adenovirus-mediated re-expression of PML in PML–/– MEFs significantly down-regulated Survivin expression in these cells. Altogether, our study demonstrated that Survivin is a downstream target gene of PML, and inhibition of the Survivin function by PML contributes to its pro-apoptotic function. It is interesting to note, however, that in the APL-derived NB4 cells in which PML function is disrupted as a result of the t(15;17) translocation, the expression of Survivin is high. After ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells, PML reorganizes into the normal functional NB (8.Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Xu Z.X. Timanova-Atanasova A. Zhao R.X. Chang K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4247-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the expression Survivin is reduced significantly (Fig. 3C). A similar high level of Survivin was also found in the bone marrow of patients with APL and responded to ATRA in a similar fashion to what we saw in NB4 (42.Carter B.Z. Milella M. Altieri D.C. Andreeff M. Blood. 2001; 97: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear why Survivin was also overexpressed in 16 of the 18 AML cases tested (42.Carter B.Z. Milella M. Altieri D.C. Andreeff M. Blood. 2001; 97: 2784-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). There was no indication of whether PML expression was down-regulated in these cells, and it was not clear whether the overexpression of Survivin in cancer cells was related to PML. Our study showed that the variable C-terminal region of PML4 is necessary for transcriptional repression of the Survivin gene. It is therefore likely that PML represses Survivin gene expression in an isoform-specific manner. We have tested four other PML isoforms and have found that none of these isoforms repressed the Survivin gene promoter. Although it was reported previously that the mRNAs of all the PML isoforms are expressed in the same cell line, no information is currently available concerning the expression of various PML isoforms. Our Western blot analysis using the PML antibody against the common domain of all PML isoforms demonstrated that PML was expressed in cell lines expressing Survivin (data not shown). However, it is not known whether PML4 was expressed in these cells or not. The availability of PML isoform-specific antibodies will facilitate our understanding of how Survivin is regulated at the endogenous levels. Analysis of PML expression in various primary tumors has been reported. In hepatocellular carcinoma, PML was found to be delocalized to the cytoplasm, indicating a loss of PML function in these cells (48.Terris B. Baldin V. Dubois S. Degott C. Flejou J.-F. Henin D. Dejean A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1590-1597PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Chan J.Y.H. Chin W. Liew C.-T. Chang K.S. Johnson P.J. Eur J. Cancer. 1998; 34: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the expression of PML was lost when malignant cells became invasive (50.Koken M.H.M. Linares-Cruz G. Quignon G. Viron A. Chelbi-Alix M.K. Sobczak-Thepot J. Juhlin L. Degos L. Calvo F. de The H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1315-1324PubMed Google Scholar). Low PML expression was also found in several solid tumors (51.Gambacorta M. Flenghi L. Fagioli M. Pileri S. Leoncini L. Bigerna B. Pacini R. Tanci N.L. Pasqualucci L. Ascani S. Mencarelli A. Liso A. Pelicci P.G. Falini B. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 2023-2035PubMed Google Scholar), and it would be interesting to examine whether high levels of Survivin exist in these cells. It is important to keep in mind that Survivin expression could also be regulated in vivo by other mechanisms unrelated to PML. It is clear that Survivin plays an important role in the inhibition of cell death, prolonging survival of these cancer cells (32.Grossman D. Kim P.J. Blanc-Brude O.P. Brash D.E. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33.Olie R.R. Simoes-Wust P. Baumann B. Leech S.H. Fabbro D. Stahel R.A. Zangmeister-Wittke U. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2805-2809PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of Survivin expression and its function induced cell death by apoptosis. Our findings demonstrated that PML inhibits the expression of Survivin in A549 cells and induces apoptosis (Fig. 6). This apoptotic event involved the activation of pro-caspase 9 and other effector caspases, including caspase 3 and caspase 7. Recent studies have suggested that Survivin plays a major role in inhibiting the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway (34.Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 35.Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). This inhibitory effect requires interaction of Survivin with the cofactor hepatitis B X-interacting protein. The heterodimer complex then binds to pro-caspase 9, preventing its binding to Apaf1 and inhibiting pro-caspase 9 activation. In Survivin-overexpressing cancer cells, the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway is therefore impaired. Numerous reports have found that overexpression of PML in cancer cells inhibited cell/tumor growth and induced apoptosis (40.Le X.F. Vallian S. Mu Z.M. Hung M.C. Chang K.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 52.Mu Z.M. Le X.F. Vallian S. Glassman A.B. Chang K.S.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1868-1872PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrated a new mechanism of PML-induced apoptosis by repressing Survivin expression in these cancer cells. PML is one of the primary targets of IFNs, which induce apoptosis in many types of cancer cells (54.Chawla-Sarkar M. Lindner D.J. Liu Y.F. Williams B.R. Sen G.S. Silverman R.H. Borden E.C. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Our findings raise the possibility that IFN-induced apoptosis may be executed through PML-mediated repression of Survivin expression in cancer cells. We thank Dr. Maureen Murphy and Dr. Gerd G. Maul for providing the Survivin promoter constructs and the mouse-specific PML monoclonal antibody. DNA microarray analysis was performed in the Cancer Genomics Core laboratory at M. D.

https://openalex.org/W2148377603,"We describe enzymological and structural analyses of the interaction between the family 18 chitinase ChiB from Serratia marcescens and the designed inhibitor N,N′-diacetylchitobionoxime-N-phenylcarbamate (HM508). HM508 acts as a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme with a Ki in the 50 μm range. Active site mutants of ChiB show Ki values ranging from 1 to 200 μm, providing insight into some of the interactions that determine inhibitor affinity. Interestingly, the wild type enzyme slowly degrades HM508, but the inhibitor is essentially stable in the presence of the moderately active D142N mutant of ChiB. The crystal structure of the D142N-HM508 complex revealed that the two sugar moieties bind to the -2 and -1 subsites, whereas the phenyl group interacts with aromatic side chains that line the +1 and +2 subsites. Enzymatic degradation of HM508, as well as a Trp → Ala mutation in the +2 subsite of ChiB, led to reduced affinity for the inhibitor, showing that interactions between the phenyl group and the enzyme contribute to binding. Interestingly, a complex of enzymatically degraded HM508 with the wild type enzyme showed a chitobiono-δ-lactone bound in the -2 and -1 subsites, despite the fact that the equilibrium between the lactone and the hydroxy acid forms in solution lies far toward the latter. This shows that the active site preferentially binds the 4E conformation of the -1 sugar, which resembles the proposed transition state of the reaction.

Chitin, a structural component of invertebrate exoskeletons and fungal cell walls, is an abundant, rigid, linear carbohydrate polymer consisting of β(1, 4)-linked N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) units. In nature, chitin is degraded by chitinases and β-N-acetylhexosaminidases belonging to families 18 and 19 and families 3 and 20 of glycoside hydrolase, respectively (1Henrissat B. Biochem.

Chitinases occur in a variety of organisms from bacteria and fungi to plants and vertebrates. It has been shown that inhibitors of family 18 chitinases affect the life cycles of insects (4Arai N.

Thus, family 18 chitinases have been proposed as targets for the development of drugs and insecticides. Structural and enzymological studies of several family 18 chitinases have provided detailed insight into the catalytic center and mechanism of these enzymes (11Terwisscha van Scheltinga A.C.

Leaving group departure is promoted by a glutamate residue that acts as catalytic acid (Glu-144 in chitinase B (ChiB) 1The abbreviations used are: ChiBchitinase BWTwild type ChiBHM508N,N′-diacetyl-chitobionoxime-N-phenylcarbamateESI-MSelectrospray ionization mass spectroscopyBSAbovine serum albumin. from Serratia marcescens, the enzyme used in this study). The emerging positive charge on the anomeric carbon is stabilized by concomitant nucleophilic attack of the N-acetyl group of the -1 sugar on the anomeric carbon, which leads to formation of an oxazolinium ion intermediate (Fig. 1). Glu-144 is located near the end of β-strand 4 of the catalytic (βα)8 barrel and is preceded by other conserved acidic residues that are located in the core and are essential for catalysis (Asp-140 and Asp-142 in ChiB) (13van Aalten D.M.F.

Asp-142 contributes to the correct positioning of the N-acetyl group of the -1 sugar, modulation of the pKa of Glu-144 during the catalytic cycle, and stabilization of the oxazolinium ion intermediate.

The best known inhibitor of family 18 chitinases is allosamidin (18Sakuda S. Isogai A. Matsumoto S. Suzuki A. Koseki K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1986; 27: 2475-2478Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), a pseudotrisaccharide that inhibits with Ki values in the 1 nm-1 μm range (19Sakuda S. Muzzarelli, R.A.A Chitin Enzymology. Vol. 2.

The only other known high affinity inhibitors of family 18 chitinases are the naturally occurring cyclopentapeptides argadin (4Arai N. Shiomi K. Yamaguchi Y. Masuma R. Iwai Y. Turberg A. Koelbl H. Omura S. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 2000; 48: 1442-1446Google Scholar) and argifin (23Shiomi K. Arai N. Iwai Y. Turberg A. Koelbl H. Omura S. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 2141-2143Google Scholar). Structural and enzymological analyses have shown that these peptides bind intimately to the active site of ChiB with affinities in the 10 nm (argadin) and 10 μm (argifin) range (24Houston D.R. Shiomi K. Arai N. Omura S. Peter M.G. Turberg A. Synstad B. Eijsink V.G.H. van Aalten D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9127-9132Google Scholar). Although total syntheses of allosamidin have been reported (reviewed in Ref. 25Berecibar A. Grandjean C. Siriwardena A. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 779-844Google Scholar), these syntheses are lengthy and do not offer a practical access to the inhibitor. Until recently, allosamidin was commercially available at a cost of $500 (United States currency) per milligram, but it is currently not being sold. No total synthesis of the cyclic pentapeptides argifin and argadin has been reported. Attempts to synthesize oligo-GlcNAc-based chitinase inhibitors have had limited success to date, mainly due to the fact that the affinity of chitinases for short, non-hydrolyzable chitooligosaccharides (e.g. GlcNAc2) is usually low and that longer oligosaccharides with higher affinities are too readily degraded. Thus, effective sugar-based inhibitors need to be based on the introduction of non-hydrolyzable bonds between the sugar moieties and/or on combining short chito-oligosaccharides with other structural elements that increase affinity while preventing degradation of the inhibitor. To the best of our knowledge, such designed inhibitors of family 18 chitinases with an affinity in the μm range have not yet been identified. Here, we study the interaction between the family 18 chitinase ChiB from S. marcescens and the previously designed and synthesized GlcNAc2-derivative N,N′-diacetyl-chitobionoxime-N-phenylcarbamate (HM508; Fig. 1) (26Beer D. Maloisel J.L. Rast D.M. Vasella A. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1990; 73: 1918-1922Google Scholar). We show that HM508 inhibits ChiB with a Ki in the 50 μm range. The crystal structures of complexes between HM508 and ChiB and ChiB-D142N reveal details of the interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme. The importance of some of these interactions was probed by studying the effects of two site-directed mutations (M212A, W220A) in the active site of ChiB on the affinity for HM508. We also show that ChiB is capable of slowly hydrolyzing HM508 to chitobionolactone/chitobiono-hydroxy acid and that the enzyme's active site is optimized for binding the lactone form of this degradation product. Overexpression, Purification, and Crystallization of ChiB from S. marcescens—Wild type chitinase B and the D142N mutant were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (27Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1581-1589Google Scholar). The pure protein of wild type and D142N was lyophilized, dissolved to 1.0 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, dialyzed overnight in the same buffer, and concentrated to 10 mg/ml before it was used in hanging drop vapor diffusion crystallization experiments. Crystals for wild type appeared within 3 days in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7, 10% glycerol, and 1.5 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals for the D142N mutant appeared within 3 days in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7, 15% glycerol and 1.3 m ammonium sulfate. Wild type and D142N crystals were soaked with 100-fold molar excess of HM508 for 1 month and 3 h, respectively, before being frozen in a nitrogen stream. Data were collected at beamline ID14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. Further mutants of ChiB were produced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange kit, as described previously (13van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B.

Structure Determination—The data were processed using DENZO and scaled using SCALEPACK from the HKL suite (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). The previously published structure of the wild type enzyme in complex with allosamidin (13van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The starting structure and molecular topology for HM508 were created using the PRODRG server (31van Aalten D.M.F. Bywater R. Findlay J.B.C. Hendlich M.

For the D142N-HM508 data set, the full ligand was observed in the unbiased |Fo| - |Fc|,ϕcalc density (Fig. 4) and included in the refinement. For the WT-HM508 data set, the unbiased |Fo| - |Fc|,ϕcalc density in the active site and ESI-MS data (see below) showed a product of hydrolysis of HM508, viz. chitobionolactone.

Synstad B. Brurberg M.B. Hough E. Riise B.W. Eijsink V.G.H. Wierenga R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5842-5847Google Scholar). As with previous complexes, comparison of the monomers did not reveal significant conformational changes or differences in the binding site. The monomer best defined by the electron density maps was used for further analyses (the B monomer for the ChiB-HM508 complex and monomer A for the ChiB-D142N-HM508 complex). Inhibition Studies—Before being used in enzyme assays, the lyophilized inhibitor was dissolved in doubly distilled water to yield a working solution of 1 mm. Chitinase activity was measured using 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N,N′-diacetylchitobioside (Sigma) as a substrate. It has previously been shown that this assay permits accurate determination of kinetic parameters despite the fact that substrate inhibition necessitates the use of a relatively narrow range of (low) substrate concentrations (27Brurberg M.B. Nes I.F. Eijsink V.G.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1581-1589Google Scholar). At first, inhibitor affinity was estimated by determination of IC50 values at 20 μm substrate concentration. Subsequently, Ki values were approximated by determining kinetic parameters (Km, kcat) in the presence of inhibitor at a concentration close to the IC50. Calculation of kinetic and inhibitory parameters was performed using the curve fit option in the Enzyme Kinetics!Pro software package (ChemSW, Fairfield, CA). Reaction mixtures for measurement of kinetic parameters contained 1.15 nm WT, 26 nm W220A, 10 nm D142N, or 16 nm M212A substrate at a concentration ranging from 5-20 μm (WT), 30-120 μm (W220A), 2.5-10 μm (D142N and M212A), and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. HM508 concentrations used were 100 μm (WT), 125 μm (W220A), 1 μm (D142N), and 1 μm (M212A). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and 50-μl samples were taken after 0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 min and transferred immediately to 1.95 ml of 0.2 m Na2CO3 to stop the reactions. The amount of liberated 4-methylumbelliferyl was measured by fluorometry. Product formation was linear over time for all ChiB variants at all substrate concentrations. Analysis of HM508 Degradation—To investigate degradation of HM508, wild type ChiB, ChiB-M212A, ChiB-D142N, and ChiB-W220A were incubated for 17 days at room temperature with and without HM508 under normal assay conditions without substrate. To accelerate the rate of degradation, the enzymes were used at a concentration higher than that for the published standard assay. The reaction mixtures contained 3.6 nm WT, 19 nm M212A, 57 nm D142N, or 98 nm W220A and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, in 50 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. HM508 concentrations used were 75 μm (WT), 2 μm (M212A), 5 μm (D142N), and 200 μm (W220A). After 10 min and 1, 3, 9, 13, and 17 days of incubation, 45-μl samples were removed from these enzyme-inhibitor mixtures and from parallel control mixtures (enzyme without inhibitor) for determination of enzyme activity. Activities were determined by the addition of 5 μl of substrate (final concentration 20 μm) and by using standard conditions (T = 37 °C; pH = 6.3; incubation time = 10 min). All measurements were performed in duplicate. Activities in the enzyme-inhibitor mixtures are expressed as a percentage of the activity in the corresponding control sample (no inhibitor). The control reactions did not show any significant loss of activity during the incubation period. ESI-MS was used to analyze degradation products of HM508 in the absence and presence of ChiB. 1 μm ChiB (wild-type or the D142N mutant) was incubated with 100 μm HM508 in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6 (the specific activity of ChiB in this buffer is similar to the specific activity in the citrate-phosphate buffer used in standard activity assays). We used high concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor to mimic the conditions during crystallization and soaking and to abolish the need for the addition of BSA as an enzyme stabilizer (BSA gave a dramatic increase in background noise in subsequent analyses). Samples were analyzed by ESI-MS at the start of the incubation and at various time points up to 30 days later. ESI-MS analysis was conducted using a Micromass Quattro LC triple quadrupole instrument. The sample was introduced directly into the source using a syringe pump at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Mass spectra were obtained in positive mode, with cone voltage at 30 V, capillary voltage at 3 kV, and multiplier voltage at 650 V. The desolvation and source block temperatures used were 160 and 80 °C, respectively. The mass scan range was 50-650 m/z. Inhibitor Stability—Initial crystallographic soaking studies of wild-type ChiB with HM508 suggested that the inhibitor was degraded. Therefore, we studied the possible degradation of HM508 by ChiB and a less active variant of ChiB (D142N) (13van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Google Scholar, 17Synstad B. Gaseidnes S. Vriend G. Nielsen J.E. Eijsink V.G.H. Peter M.G. Muzzarelli R.A.A. Domard A. Advances in Chitin Science. Vol. 4. University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany2000: 524-529Google Scholar) using relatively high concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor (thus mimicking to some extent the conditions during the crystal-soaking experiments). ESI-MS analyses of mixtures of ChiB and HM508 showed that a 557 peak corresponding to the intact inhibitor (557 for HM508 + H+) and the K+ adduct peak (595 for HM508 + K+) disappeared over time, whereas a new set of peaks (441 for M + H and 479 for M + K+) appeared (Fig. 2). As explained below, a hydrolytic reaction that would generate a compound with mass 440 would be the generation of a chitobionolactone (Fig. 1) in equilibrium with its hydroxy acid. The equilibrium between these compounds is expected to lie far toward the hydroxy acid at neutral pH (33Secemski I.I. Lienhard G.E. Lehrer S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4740Google Scholar). The degradation of the inhibitor was a slow process; after 17 days ∼50% of the inhibitor had been degraded by the enzyme (Fig. 3). Conversion of HM508 to a compound with a molecular mass of 440 was not observed in the absence of enzyme (Fig. 2) nor in the presence of the less active D142N mutant of ChiB (not shown).Fig. 3Effect of HM508 degradation on enzyme inhibition. Enzyme activities are expressed relative to the activity in the samples without inhibitor; ChiB wild type (triangles), ChiB-M212A (squares), ChiB-D142N (diamonds), and ChiB-W220A (crosses).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To explore the significance of the enzymatic HM508 degradation in our standard enzyme inhibition assays, ChiB, ChiB-M212A, ChiB-W220A, and ChiB-D142N were incubated for 17 days with and without HM508 under normal assay conditions with no substrate. Fig. 3 shows that the ChiB-D142N HM508 mixture was the only one with stable enzyme activity throughout the incubation period. For the remaining enzyme-inhibitor mixtures, activities gradually increased until they reached levels close to what was observed in the corresponding samples without HM508. These results confirm that degradation of the inhibitor is a slow process. Because degradation of the inhibitor occurs on a significantly longer time scale (days) than experiments for determination of kinetic parameters (minutes), the Ki values determined in this study apply to intact HM508. Structural Analysis—Because of the degradation of HM508 in the wild type enzyme, the interaction of HM508 with ChiB was analyzed by solving the structure of HM508 in complex with the less active ChiB mutant (D142N) that did not show degradation of the inhibitor within the time scale of our experiments. In addition, we solved the structure of ChiB using a crystal that had been soaked with HM508 for several months to determine the structure of the degradation product. The ChiB-HM508 and ChiB-D142N-HM508 complexes were refined to 1.90 and 1.80 Å, respectively, with R-factors converging at R (Rfree) = 0.209 (0.245) and 0.205 (0.255), respectively. Statistics of the refinement and the final models are shown in Table I. Both structures showed well defined unbiased |Fo| - |Fc|,ϕcalc density in the -1 and -2 subsites that corresponded to the sugar moieties of the inhibitor (Fig. 4). In addition, the ChiB-D142N-HM508 maps showed density for the HM508 phenylcarbamate moiety, which interacts with the +1 and +2 subsites of the enzyme (Trp-97 and Trp-220; Fig. 4). In the D142N-HM508 structure, the -1 sugar lies toward the 1,4B conformation, close to the conformation seen for the -1 sugar in a complex between an inactive mutant of ChiB (E144Q) and GlcNAc5 (13van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In general, the active site architecture and the interactions between the disaccharide moiety and the enzyme are similar to those observed in the E144Q-GlcNAc5 complex (13van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 4 and Table II. One of two major differences concerns residue 142, which, in the E144Q-GlcNAc5 complex and in most other ChiB-ligand complexes, hydrogen bonds to Glu-144 (13van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8979-8984Google Scholar, 24Houston D.R. Shiomi K. Arai N. Omura S. Peter M.G. Turberg A. Synstad B. Eijsink V.G.H. van Aalten D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9127-9132Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond does not exist in the D142N-HM508 complex because the side chain of Glu-144 is in a different position (rotated 14° around χ1, 32° around χ2, and 86° around χ3 compared with E144Q-GlcNAc5) to hydrogen bond the N1 of the HM508 oxime (Fig. 4; Table II). A second difference concerns the position of the glycosidic oxygen in the E144Q-GlcNAc5 structure and the equivalent N1 nitrogen of the HM508 oxime (shift of 1.1 Å). The electron density and the planar conformational restraints for the sp2-hybridized C1 carbon place the oxime N1 0.9 Å closer to the conserved Met-212 than the equivalent glycosidic oxygen in the E144Q-GlcNAc5 structure (Table II; Fig. 4). Although this does not directly generate a steric clash (distance between N1 and Met-212-Sδ is 3.7 Å compared with 4.6 Å for the equivalent distance in the E144Q-GlcNAc5 complex), it does appear to distort the linker between the -1 sugar and the phenyl ring in HM508 from planarity (by as much as 27° over the oxime bond).Table IIInteractions observed in the -2, -1 and +1 subsites in the E144Q-GlcNAc5, D142N-HM508, and WT-HM508 structures Hydrogen bond donor-acceptor distances (D-A column) were calculated with WHAT IF (43Vriend G.

The hydrophobic phenyl ring is located close to Trp-97 and Trp-220 that line the +1 and +2 subsites of ChiB. These two aromatic residues are shifted toward the ligand (up to 0.5 Å compared with the apo-D142N structure) (34Kolstad G. Houston D.R. Rao F.V. Peter M.G. Synstad B. van Aalten D.M.F. Eijsink V.G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). A similar, but larger displacement (shifts up to 1 Å) has previously been observed upon substrate binding to E144Q (13van Aalten D.M.F. Komander D. Synstad B. Gåseidnes S. Peter M.G. Eijsink V.G.H.

Additionally, main chain movements of the loops covering the active site indicate a closure of the roof of the active site tunnel, equivalent to what was observed in the E144Q-GlcNAc5 structure (13van Aalten D.M.F.

The phenyl group does not form the triple sandwich with Trp-97 and Trp-220, as was observed in the E144Q-GlcNAc5 structure for the +1/+2 sugars; rather, it interacts with these tryptophans in an orthogonal orientation. A similar interaction has been observed for the phenylalanine side chain in the cyclic pentapeptide inhibitor argifin (24Houston D.R. Shiomi K. Arai N. Omura S. Peter M.G. Turberg A. Synstad B.

https://openalex.org/W2132192626,"Hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) plays a central role in the control of food intake, energy balance, and modulation of neuroendocrine functions. In particular, an increase in NPY expression participates in the inhibition of the reproductive activity under poor nutritional conditions. The present study was designed to evaluate further the involvement of the Y1 subtype of NPY receptors in these effects. Food intake, body weight gain, and the onset of puberty were studied in groups of wild-type and Y1 deficient mice that were either fed ad libitum or subjected to a 30% restriction in food intake. This moderate feeding restriction induced a similar deficit in body weight gain in wild-type and in Y1 knockout mice. However, although wild-type mice experienced the expected delay of puberty, all mice in the food restriction group and lacking Y1 could go through puberty over the time of the experiment despite decreases in circulating leptin levels and increases in hypothalamic NPY expression. This observation demonstrates that the absence of Y1 impairs the perception of decreasing energy stores by the gonadotrope axis, demonstrating a physiological role for Y1 in the sensing of endogenous metabolic parameters by the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2099960145,"The Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in many mammalian tissues, including the long bone's growth plate. CaR knockout mice exhibit growth retardation, suggesting that CaR may promote skeletal growth. However, the complex phenotype of these knockout mice, which includes hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hypophosphatemia, may confound the effects of CaR activation. To determine whether CaR regulates growth plate chondrogenesis and longitudinal bone growth, we chose an organ culture model. Fetal rat metatarsal bones (dpc 20) were cultured in serum-free medium for 7 days in the presence or absence of NPS-R-568, a CaR agonist. The addition of 10 nM NPS-R-568 increased the cumulative longitudinal growth of the metatarsal explants. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we then assessed the effects of NPS-R-568 on growth plate chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation and chondrocyte proliferation. After 7 days in culture, NPS-R-568 increased the height of the growth plate hypertrophic zone and the expression of collagen X, a marker of growth plate chondrocyte differentiation (assessed by immunohistochemistry). NPS-R-568 also induced a significant increase of the height of the growth plate proliferative zone and of the total thymidine incorporation in the metatarsal bone. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the activation of CaR in the growth plate accelerates longitudinal bone growth by stimulating growth plate chondrogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2072796784,"Here we describe the isolation of C33/CD82/KAI1 in a screen for apoptosis-inducing genes. C33 is a gene that is downregulated in many metastatic tumor cells and the expression of which can attenuate the process of metastases formation in a variety of tumors. In accordance, we observed cell death induction by C33 in many different cell types. C33 seems to promote cell death by the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). These ROIs, however, are not derived from the mitochondrial respiratory chain as in most other scenarios leading to apoptosis. We observed that C33 renders cells sensitive to ROIs by causing the specific release of the intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) from cells. Moreover, C33 activates the GTPase Cdc42, which mediates GSH release and apoptosis induction and allows to detect the formation of ROIs."
https://openalex.org/W1972282946,"Long-term drug-induced alterations in neurotransmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core may underlie relapse to drug-seeking behavior and drug-taking upon re-exposure to drugs and drug-associated stimuli (cues) during abstinence. Using an open screening strategy, we recently identified 25 gene transcripts, encoding for proteins involved in neuronal functioning and structure that are down-regulated in rat NAc shell after contingent (active), but not after non-contingent (passive), heroin administration. Studying the expression of the same transcripts in the NAc core by means of quantitative PCR, we now demonstrate that most of these transcripts are up-regulated in that NAc subregion long (3 weeks) after heroin self-administration in rats. A similar up-regulation in gene expression was also apparent in the NAc core of animals with a history of non-contingent heroin administration (yoked controls). These data indicate that heroin self-administration differentially regulates genes in the NAc core as compared with the shell. Moreover, whereas cognitive processes involved in active drug self-administration (e.g., instrumental learning) seems to direct gene expression in the NAc shell, neuroplasticity in the NAc core may be due to the pharmacological effects of heroin (including Pavlovian conditioning), as expressed in rats upon contingent as well as non-contingent administration of heroin."
https://openalex.org/W2052255849,"CARMIL, also known as Acan 125, is a multidomain protein that was originally identified on the basis of its interaction with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of type I myosins from Acanthamoeba. In a subsequent study of CARMIL from Dictyostelium, pull-down assays indicated that the protein also bound capping protein and the Arp2/3 complex. Here we present biochemical evidence that Acanthamoeba CARMIL interacts tightly with capping protein. In biochemical preparations, CARMIL copurified extensively with two polypeptides that were shown by microsequencing to be the α- and β-subunits of Acanthamoeba capping protein. The complex between CARMIL and capping protein, which is readily demonstratable by chemical cross-linking, can be completely dissociated by size exclusion chromatography at pH 5.4. Analytical ultracentrifugation, surface plasmon resonance and SH3 domain pull-down assays indicate that the dissociation constant of capping protein for CARMIL is ∼0.4 μm or lower. Using CARMIL fusion proteins, the binding site for capping protein was shown to reside within the carboxyl-terminal, ∼200 residue, proline-rich domain of CARMIL. Finally, chemical cross-linking, analytical ultracentrifugation, and rotary shadowed electron microscopy revealed that CARMIL is asymmetric and that it exists in a monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium with an association constant of 1.0 × 106m-1. Together, these results indicate that CARMIL self-associates and interacts with capping protein with affinities that, given the cellular concentrations of the proteins (∼1 and 2 μm for capping protein and CARMIL, respectively), indicate that both activities should be physiologically relevant.

In 1995, Zot (1.Xu P. Zot A.S. Zot H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25316-25319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and colleagues identified a ∼125-kDa protein from Acanthamoeba on the basis of its ability to bind to the isolated Src homology 3 (SH3) 1The abbreviations used are: SH3, Src homology domain 3; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; CP, capping protein; DSG, disuccinimidyl glutarate; DSP, dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate]; EDAC, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; RSEM, rotary shadowed electron microscopy; S-NHS, N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TLCK, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone. domain of Acanthamoeba myosin IC (1.Xu P. Zot A.S. Zot H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25316-25319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This protein, which they called Acan 125, coimmunoprecipitated with myosin IC and appeared to colocalize with the myosin in cellular surface projections involved in pinocytosis. The subsequent cloning of the Acanthamoeba gene for Acan 125 (2.Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) revealed a multidomain protein dominated by a central, ∼460-residue leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. LRRs are ∼29-residue sequences that contain a loose consensus dominated by leucines, form amphipathic α-β-structural units and mediate protein-protein interactions, either by serving as the ligand binding sites themselves or by increasing the affinity and/or specificity of binding at a separate site (3.Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The second most striking structural feature of Acan 125 is its ∼200-residue, proline-rich COOH-terminal domain. Consistent with the fact that SH3 domains mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich target sequences containing the core element PXXP (4.Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 259-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), Xu et al. (2.Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that a fusion protein containing the COOH-terminal 344 residues of Acan 125 bound to the isolated SH3 domain of myosin IC and that this interaction was abrogated by an 18-residue deletion spanning two PXXP motifs fitting the consensus for SH3 domain target sequences (2.Xu P.

Biophys. 2000; 375: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have estimated an affinity of 20-150 nm for the interaction between Acan 125 and the SH3 domains of Acanthamoeba myosins IA (6.Lee W.L. Ostap E.M. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35159-35171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and IC (5.Zot H.G. Bhaskara V. Liu L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These values, together with the cellular concentrations of myosin I and Acan 125 (∼1 and ∼2 μm, respectively), suggest that type I myosins and Acan 125 may be largely associated in vivo, barring some type of regulation (6.Lee W.L. Ostap E.M. Zot H.G. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35159-35171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Parallel efforts in our laboratory to purify and characterize proteins that bind to the SH3 domains of type I myosins from Dictyostelium led to the identification of p116, the Dictyostelium homolog of Acan 125 (7.Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, the eluates of the Dictyostelium myosin I SH3 domain affinity columns contained on a consistent basis not only p116, but also the seven-member Arp2/3 complex, the central player in the de novo nucleation of actin filament assembly and in the formation of branched filament networks, and capping protein, the central player in the termination of actin filament assembly. Immunoprecipitation reactions and other experiments provided evidence that Dictyostelium myosins IB (myoB) and IC (myoC) form a complex with p116, Arp2/3, and capping protein in vivo and that p116 serves as the scaffold for assembly of the complex, binding myosin I, capping protein, and Arp2/3 at independent sites. Given its central role in complex formation, we proposed the name CARMIL for p116, which stands for Capping protein, ARp2/3, Myosin I Linker. In further work by Jung et al. (7.Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), CARMIL was shown to localize along with the Arp2/3 complex, myoB, and myoC in dynamic actin-rich cellular extensions, including the leading edge of cells undergoing chemotactic migration and dorsal, cup-like macropinocytic extensions. Moreover, cells in which the CARMIL gene was rendered nonfunctional by homologous recombination exhibited striking defects in the formation of these macropinocytic structures, a concomitant reduction in the rate of fluid phase pinocytosis, and a significant decrease in the efficiency of chemotactic aggregation. Together, these results identified a complex that links key players in the nucleation (Arp2/3) and termination (capping protein) of actin filament assembly with a ubiquitous barbed end-directed motor (myosin I), indicated that the protein responsible for the formation of this complex (CARMIL) is physiologically important, and suggested that previously reported myosin I mutant phenotypes in Dictyostelium might be due, at least in part, to defects in the assembly state of actin. In the present study we sought to purify CARMIL to homogeneity and to begin to characterize its biochemical properties. We chose to purify the protein from Acanthamoeba given our laboratory's previous success in using this organism for large scale preparations of cytoskeletal proteins. We show by a variety of methods that Acanthamoeba CARMIL is a bona fide capping protein (CP) interactant that could bind a significant fraction of cellular CP in vivo. CARMIL Purification—The purification of CARMIL was based on a method described by Xu et al. (2.Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Acanthamoeba castellanii were grown in suspension culture to late-log phase, harvested, washed, and resuspended in 1:2 (w/v) Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, 20 μg/ml TLCK, 50 μg/ml AEBSF), and broken in a Parr bomb at 375 p.s.i. for 5 min. After clarification of the lysate by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3 h (“high speed supernatant”), proteins were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The fraction between 25 and 55% (NH4)2SO4 was collected, resuspended in TBS supplemented with 1 m ammonium sulfate and protease inhibitors, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 6B column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 1.0 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in TBS. Fractions were tested for the presence of CARMIL by Western blotting, and positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against TBS. CARMIL was bound to a SH3 affinity column and eluted with 5 × TBS. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml TLCK, 50 μg/ml AEBSF), loaded on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences), bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0-500 mm KCl gradient, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. CARMIL-containing fractions were loaded on a HiPrep® Sephacryl S300 column (Amersham Biosciences; for analytical gel filtration a Superdex 200 column was used) equilibrated with either buffer L (500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm MES, pH 5.4, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml AEBSF) or buffer P (500 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml AEBSF). Positive fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE, dialyzed against buffer A, and subjected to a final anion exchange chromatography step on Mono Q to reconcentrate the protein. Other Proteins—Acanthamoeba actin was purified according to Gordon et al. (8.Gordon D.J. Eisenberg E. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 4778-4786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a final gel filtration step on HiPrep® Sephacryl S200. Actin was labeled with N-(1-pyrene)-iodoacetamide (Molecular Probes) according to Kouyama and Mihashi (9.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and stored lyophilized at -80 °C. Before use it was resuspended in G buffer (0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.75 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) and dialyzed in the dark against the same buffer. Recombinant Proteins—Generation of the GST fusion protein containing the SH3 domain of Acanthamoeba myosin IC (hereafter referred to as GST-SH3) was described previously (7.Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Portions of the carboxyl-terminal end of Acanthamoeba CARMIL were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase, a full-length CARMIL cDNA clone as template (a kind gift from Henry Zot, Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti), and the following primers (5′-oligonucleotides contained an SmaI site, and 3′-oligonucleotides contained an EcoRI site): VAP, 5′-TGC ACC CGG GCG AGG ACT TCT CCC AGC ACA TCT CC-3′ and 5′-TGC AGA ATT CAG CCC ACC TCC AAG CAA GGC GCT-3′; AP, 5′-TGC ACC CGG GCG CCC CGA CCC CGA GGA GCC AG-3′ and 5′-TGC AGA ATT CAG CCC ACC TCC AAG CAA GGC GCT-3′;P,5′-TGC ACC CGG GCG GCG TGG CGC TGC CCT TCG GGG CC-3′ and 5′-TGC AGA ATT CAG CCC ACC TCC AAG CAA GGC GCT-3′; VA, 5′-TGC ACC CGG GCG AGG ACT TCT CCC AGC ACA TCT CC-3′ and 5′-TGC AGA ATT CCT ACA TCG GCA CGC CGG TCG GTC G-3′. PCR products were digested, ligated into pGEX-2T, and transformed into Escherichia coli host strain BL21(DE3) for production of GST fusion proteins. Construction of the GST-LRR construct, which contains the complete LRR domain of Dictyostelium CARMIL, will be described elsewhere. 2G. Jung and J. A. Hammer, manuscript in preparation. Recombinant proteins were prepared as described previously (7.Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In brief, overnight cultures were diluted 1:10 into 200 ml of fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, grown to an A600 nm of 1.0, and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration) for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm AEBSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and lysed in a French pressure cell. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Loaded beads were used for CP pull-down experiments after four washes in 1 × TBS. Protein Microsequencing—Peak fractions of the CARMIL-CP complex from the Mono Q eluate (see above) were pooled, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and the 30- and 32-kDa bands excised. After digestion with trypsin, peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography, and sequenced by Edman degradation (Harvard Microchemistry Facility). Peptide sequences were compared with multiple protein data bases (BLASTP 2.0.13, which includes all nonredundant GenBank CDS translations + PDB + SwissProt + PIR + PRF) by BLAST search (10.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed on minigels using either Tris-acetate- or Tris-glycine-buffered polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were denatured in SDS-sample buffer (2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% SDS, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 0.75% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) by boiling for 5 min. After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred onto nitrocellulose by semidry electroblotting (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at 4 °C overnight and incubated with polyclonal antibodies against CARMIL or CP (1:10,000 and 1:1,500, respectively) in 2% bovine serum albumin and TBST for 3 h at room temperature. Specific binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody against Acanthamoeba CP was raised using a compound peptide containing two α-subunit sequences that were obtained by microsequencing (see above; DESILNDSAPATFR and FGEVGNGEYLDPR) and three glycine residues as linker. This peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and the resulting serum was affinity purified using the immunogenic peptide immobilized on nitrocellulose. Polyclonal antibodies against the α- and β-subunits of Dictyostelium CP were a kind gift from John A. Cooper (Washington University, St. Louis). Generation of the polyclonal antibody against a portion of the LRR domain of Acanthamoeba CARMIL was described previously (7.Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed in Optima models XL-A and XL-I analytical ultracentrifuges (Beckman Inc.) equipped with a four-place An-Ti rotor. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 and 4 °C, respectively. The density (ρ) of the dialysate, buffer A (25 mm MOPS, 250 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) was determined to be 1.0101 g/ml at 20.00 ± 0.01 °C with the Anton Paar model DMA 58 densitometer, and the relative viscosity was determined to be 1.0139 (11.Shapiro B.M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2153-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A partial specific volume of 0.720 ml/g for CARMIL was calculated from the amino acid composition and the values of Zamyatnin (12.Zamyatnin A.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Specific absorbance coefficients for CARMIL and CP were determined as described previously (13.Nosworthy N.J. Peterkofsky A. Konig S. Seok Y.J. Szczepanowski R.H. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6718-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 18 spectrophotometer and the model XL-I equipped with interference optics. A capillary synthetic boundary cell centerpiece and sapphire windows were employed with 0.140 ml of dialyzed protein (1.144 mg/ml CARMIL or 0.767 mg/ml CP) loaded in the right side and 0.400 ml of buffer A on the left side. After formation of the boundary by slow acceleration to 15,000 rpm, the speed was decreased to 3,000 rpm for CARMIL and 5,000 rpm for CP, while maintaining the temperature at 20 °C. Repetitive interference scans were taken 20 or 30 s apart for 15 min during which time solvent base line and the protein plateau remained flat. The calibration value of 3.191 ± 005 fringes (mg/ml)-1 (13.Nosworthy N.J. Peterkofsky A. Konig S. Seok Y.J. Szczepanowski R.H. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6718-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was corroborated with a solution of 3.428 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Specific absorbances (A280 nm, 1 cm) of 0.474 ± 001 (cm2/mg) or ϵ280 nm = 57,640 m-1 cm-1 for CARMIL and 1.140 ± 002 or ϵ280 nm = 70,520 m-1 cm-1 for CP were determined. After determination of the absorbance coefficient for CARMIL, the speed was increased to 44,000 rpm, and 20 scans at 1 min apart were taken to determine the sedimentation coefficient under conditions where >90% of CARMIL was dimeric. For time derivative analysis (14.Stafford W.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the procedures of Zolkiewski et al. (15.Zolkiewski M. Redowicz M.J. Korn E.D. Hammer III, J.A. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were used. Observed sedimentation coefficients (sobs) were corrected to the density and viscosity of water at 20 °C, where s20,w = 1.0457 sobs (reported in Svedberg units, S). For sedimentation equilibrium runs in the XL-A, liquid columns of 0.080 or 0.110 ml of CARMIL in buffer A (with 0.015 ml more dialysate buffer A in the reference channel) and a speed of 7,500 rpm were used. Scans at 280 nm were collected at 2-h intervals in step mode (0.001-cm steps) with 11 or 13 averages/scan. Equilibrium was attained in 28 h, as determined by overlaying scans at different times. Global, weighted fits of sedimentation equilibrium data obtained at two concentrations of CARMIL in different runs to a model of reversible monomer-dimer association (with fully competent species present) were made using software provided by Allen P. Minton (NIDDK, NIH). Higher oligomeric forms than dimer were not detected. The monomer molecular weight of CARMIL (calculated from the amino acid composition) and base lines at zero 280 nm absorbance were held constant. Residuals from fits of the data to a monomer ↔ dimer equilibrium were randomly distributed around zero with < 0.01 absorbance deviations. For conversion of the observed association constant (Kobs′) to a true molar concentration-dependent association constant (expressed per mole subunit), Ka′, Equation 1 was used, logKa'=4.539+logKobs'(Eq. 1) where the constant was calculated from log 2/ϵ, where ϵ is the molar extinction coefficient of the monomer for a 1.2-cm path length and the dimer was assumed to equal 2ϵ. Purified CARMIL and CP were mixed together in 0.15 ml of buffer A to give final concentrations of 1.93 and 3.28 μm, respectively (corresponding to a molar ratio of 1.7:1, CP to CARMIL). The mixture was equilibrated versus the same volume of buffer A in a double sector centerpiece in a 12-mm cell with sapphire windows for 48-54 h at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C. Interference optics were used to collect data and later analyzed for the equilibrium components present, where the molecular weights for CP and the CARMIL dimer were 61,860 and 243,200, respectively (see “Results”). Far UV circular dichroism spectra measurements were performed with a Jasco J-710 spectrometer using a water-jacketed cylindrical cell with a path length of 0.01 cm. The temperature of the cell was controlled at 20 °C by an external programmable water bath (Neslab RTE-111). Spectra were corrected for the CD signal of solvent (buffer A without β-mercaptoethanol). For determining secondary structure, far UV spectra were the average of 30 accumulations taken at 200 nm/min. Mean residue molecular weights of 108.5 for CARMIL were used for calculations of [θ]. Secondary structural components were calculated using the SELCON analysis program in Softsec™ applications (Softwood Company). Rotary Shadowing—Purified CARMIL, CP, and mixtures of both proteins at an initial concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml were diluted with 2 parts of glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica chips (16.Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and rotary shadowed at room temperature and at an angle of 9° in a Balzers 301 freeze fracture apparatus, or an RMC RFD 9010 (Boeckeler Instruments Inc., Tucson, AZ). Chemical Cross-linking—DSG, DSP, EDAC, and S-NHS were obtained from Pierce and used at final concentrations of 2.5 mm for DSG and DSP and 5 mm for EDAC and S-NHS. Stock solutions (10×) of DSG and DSP were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide whereas EDC and S-NHS were dissolved in H2O. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in cross-linking reactions never exceeded 10%. Cross-linking reactions were incubated for a maximum of 30 min at 24 °C. Products were resolved on 3-8% NuPAGE gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue or processed for Western blotting. Actin Polymerization Assay—The kinetics of actin polymerization were followed at 24 °C by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity of pyrene-labeled actin upon incorporation into the growing filament (9.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 17.Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In brief, G-actin and pyrene-actin were mixed at a ratio of 20:1 and polymerized at a final actin concentration of 4 μm by adding 10× actin polymerization buffer (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0). CP was dialyzed into 1× actin polymerization buffer and added to the actin solution immediately before the polymerization reaction was started. Fluorescence intensities (ex, 365 nm; em, 407 nm) were measured at a rate of 0.2 point/sec in a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Santa Clara, CA) over 30 min. Capping Protein Copurifies with CARMIL—The procedure we used for the isolation of Acanthamoeba CARMIL was based in part on a protocol devised by Xu et al. (2.Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The key steps in that procedure were hydrophobic-interaction chromatography followed by affinity chromatography that takes advantage of the tight and highly specific association between PXXP motifs located in the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal region of CARMIL and the SH3 domain of Acanthamoeba myosin IC (2.Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates the enrichment of CARMIL we obtained with a modified procedure that made use of these two steps. In brief, a high speed supernatant of the crude lysate (lane 1) was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and the 25-55% precipitate (lane 2) was subjected to a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (lane 3). CARMIL-containing fractions were identified by Western blotting with an antibody raised previously against the Acanthamoeba protein (7.Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions were subjected to SH3 domain affinity chromatography (lane 4). Three predominant polypeptides elute from the GST-SH3 resin: a ∼125-kDa band (filled arrowhead) corresponding to CARMIL and two unknown polypeptides of ∼32 and ∼30-kDa molecular mass (open arrowheads). After a final ion exchange chromatography step using Mono Q (lane 5), we consistently obtained peak fractions containing essentially the three afore-mentioned polypeptides. The fact that the smaller proteins copurified with CARMIL throughout the entire procedure and that their abundance appeared to be roughly equimolar to each other and to CARMIL led us to speculate that they might form a stable complex with CARMIL. In this regard it is interesting to note that these two smaller proteins were not described in the previous study by Xu et al. (2.Xu P. Mitchelhill K.I. Kobe B. Kemp B.E. Zot H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3685-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We reported previously that CP is present along with CARMIL in GST-SH3-domain pull-down experiments made using Dictyostelium cell lysates (7.Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Given those findings, and our observation here that the ∼32-kDa and ∼30-kDa polypeptides are always approximately equimolar, we reasoned that they corresponded to the two chains of heterodimeric CP. Consistent with this, polyclonal antibodies raised against the α- and the β-subunits of CP from Dictyostelium cross-react in a subunit-specific fashion with the ∼32- and ∼30-kDa Acanthamoeba polypeptides, respectively (Fig. 2A). Moreover, using a purified, CARMIL-free fraction of the ∼32/30-kDa proteins (see below) and actin assembly assays, we observed a dose-dependent stimulation of actin nucleation in accordance with the nucleation activity of CPs (Fig. 2B (18.Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To confirm absolutely that the ∼32/30-kDa doublet is CP, both bands were excised from polyacrylamide gels, digested with trypsin, and the resulting fragments subjected to microsequencing by Edman degradation. As shown in Fig. 2C (top), the partial sequences of two peptides derived from the ∼32-kDa band were found to be highly similar to sequences in the α-subunits of CP from Dictyostelium and various vertebrates. Likewise, three peptides obtained from the ∼30-kDa band (Fig. 2C, bottom) exhibited extensive sequence similarity to the β-subunits of CP from various species. Taken together, these results establish unequivocally that the ∼32/30-kDa polypeptides copurifying extensively with CARMIL are the α- and β-subunits of Acanthamoeba CP. CARMIL and CP Can be Separated by Gel Filtration at Low pH—Preparations of CARMIL which are free of CP are required to investigate the biochemical properties of the protein. Given the large difference in the molecular masses of CARMIL (∼125 kDa) and CP (∼60 kDa for the obligate heterodimer), we chose size exclusion chromatography as an appropriate method for their separation.

https://openalex.org/W2030054084,"Bordetella pertussis dermonecrotic toxin (DNT), which activates intracellular Rho GTPases, is a single chain polypeptide composed of an N-terminal receptor-binding domain and a C-terminal enzymatic domain. We found that DNT was cleaved by furin, a mammalian endoprotease, on the C-terminal side of Arg44, which generates an N-terminal fragment almost corresponding to the receptor-binding domain and a C-terminal remainder (ΔB) containing the enzymatic domain. These two fragments remained associated even after the cleavage and made a nicked form. DNT mutants insensitive to furin had no cellular effect, whereas the nicked toxin was much more potent than the intact form, indicating that the nicking by furin was a prerequisite for action. ΔB, but not the nicked toxin, associated with artificial liposomes and activated Rho in cells resistant to DNT because of a lack of surface receptor. These results imply that ΔB, dissociated from the binding domain, fully possesses the ability to enter the cytoplasm across the lipid bilayer membrane. The translocation ability of ΔB was found to be attributable to the N-terminal region encompassing amino acids 45-166, including a putative transmembrane domain. Pharmacological analyses with various reagents disturbing vesicular trafficking revealed that the translocation requires neither the acidification of the endosomes nor retrograde vesicular transport to deeper organelles, although DNT appeared to be internalized via a dynamin-dependent endocytosis. We conclude that DNT binds to its receptor and is internalized into endosomes where the proteolytic processing occurs. ΔB, liberated from the binding domain after the processing, begins to translocate the enzymatic domain into the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W2024116583,"Selectins mediate leukocyte rolling and may represent good anti-inflammatory drug targets. Detailed knowledge regarding the structure of selectin ligands has permitted development of selectin antagonists with varying specificities and activity. Efficacy of monovalent selectin antagonists may be increased by presenting them on a polymer backbone. We have synthesized a range of multivalent selectin antagonists and characterized their activity by using intravital microscopy of the mouse cremaster muscle. The monovalent inhibitor CGP77175A inhibited E-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Multivalent presentation of CGP77175A on a modified polylysine backbone (degree of polymerization = 1200; 50% of the polylysines carry the inhibitor) greatly enhanced in vivo activity giving an inhibitor that produced an equivalent effect at 0.1 mg/kg. The polylysine conjugate was also longer acting than the monovalent antagonist. In spite of greatly enhanced activity against E-selectin compared with monovalent inhibitor, the multivalent inhibitor had no measurable effect on P- or L-selectin-dependent leukocyte rolling."
