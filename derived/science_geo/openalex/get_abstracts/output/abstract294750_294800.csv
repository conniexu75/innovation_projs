https://openalex.org/W1970435913,"Random structures often exhibit fractal geometry, defined in terms of the mass scaling exponent, D, the fractal dimension. The vibrational dynamics of fractal networks are expressed in terms of the exponent d, the fracton dimensionality. The eigenstates on a fractal network are spatially localized for d less than or equal to 2. The implications of fractal geometry are discussed for thermal transport on fractal networks. The electron-fracton interaction is developed, with a brief outline given for the time dependence of the electronic relaxation on fractal networks. It is suggested that amorphous or glassy materials may exhibit fractal properties at short length scales or, equivalently, at high energies. The calculations of physical properties can be used to test the fractal character of the vibrational excitations in these materials."
https://openalex.org/W1983401849,"The mechanism by which the stems of trees recover after being bent or tilted out of the vertical is considered. The mechanical consequences of the tendency for the main stem apex to reerect itself and grow vertically or to be replaced by a vertically growing lateral branch, and of the asymmetrical radial growth of displaced stems, are pointed out. The asymmetry usually develops on the upper side of a bent or tilted hardwood stem and on the under side of a softwood stem. Since such asymmetry can usually be accounted for on the basis of accentuated development of wood rather than bark, the question of the possible functional significance of the wood arises. Experiments are cited to demonstrate that the wood (reaction wood) is effective as a means for assisting displaced stems to recover, contracting longitudinally on the upper side of a hardwood stem and expanding on the under side of a softwood stem. Consideration is then given to the structure, differentiation, and chemical composition of the reaction wood formed by hardwoods and softwoods with a view to locating the force active in aiding recovery and determining its origin. The consequences of associating the support of a still-growing stem displaced from the vertical with the idiosyncracies of secondary wall formation of reaction wood cells, and the reerection of such a stem with lignification of these walls, are explored. On this basis, the hypothesis is advanced that the recovery force is located in the region of differentiating reaction wood cells undergoing lignification, the active force arising from the swelling of cell walls as a result of deposition in them of lignin. Objections to the hypothesis are mentioned."

It results in the extracellular formation of a colloidal substance, and most of the nonparticulate phosphorus in lake water is in this form."

This calibration was used to determine the cation-ratio dates of 167 artifacts. Although cation-ratio dating is an experimental method, some dates suggest human occupation of the Mojave Desert in the late Pleistocene."

Methane shows by far the highest concentration, followed in order by the C(2), C(3), and C(4) fractions. In general, the concentration tends to decrease with depth, but there is a strong indication that a maximum may exist about 30 to 50 meters below the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2116846008,"Ten Nicotiana species were assayed for the proportion of DNA that is complementary to ribosomal RNA. This proportion varies from 0.27 to 0.9 percent, with tetraploid species having lower values than the diploid species. The tetraploid species have about twice as much DNA per cell as do diploid species. Thus, the absolute number of genes for ribosomal RNA varies less than the proportion of complementary DNA. Further, the number of genes for the RNA in 80S ribosomes varies less among species than does that for the RNA in 70S ribosomes. The data indicate that loss of DNA complementary to ribosomal RNA is associated with tetraploidy in the genus Nicotiana."

https://openalex.org/W2065902361,"The 250,000 sources in the recently issued Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) all-sky infrared catalog are a challenge to astronomy. Many of these sources will be studied with existing and planned ground-based and airborne telescopes, but many others can no longer even be detected now that IRAS has ceased to operate. As anticipated by advisory panels of the National Academy of Sciences for a decade, study of the IRAS sources will require the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), a cooled, pointed telescope in space. This instrument may be the key to our understanding of cosmic birth-the formation of planets, stars, galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quasars. Compared with IRAS and existing telescopes, SIRTF's power derives from a thousandfold gain in sensitivity over five octaves of the spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2037476437,"The reaction of ferricytochrome c with hydrated electrons produced at pH 6.8 by radiolysis with electron pulses lasting 50 to 1000 nanoseconds has a specific rate constant of 5.5 x 10(10) liter mole(-1) sec(-1) for the formation of the primary adduct. By using appropriate wavelengths, another fast, consecutive process was demonstrated, with the pure first order rate constant 1.0 x 10(5) sec(-1). Its characteristics agree with it being an intramolecular process within the enzyme. Approximately 50 percent of all electrons which add to ferricytochrome c end in forming ferrocytochrome c."

Br. emphasizes other unique features of this monotypic Queensland fern and provides new evidence of its possible relationships. Other characteristics of this plant, which are not known among terrestrial ferns, are incipient heterospory-having two sizes of spores and a dioecious condition of the gametophytes. These and other morphological features show relationships of Platyzoma to members of the Schizaeaceae and Marsileaceae and relationships of these families to the Polypodiaceae, in which it is treated under the subfamily Platyzomatoideae."

https://openalex.org/W2042889380,"An analysis of the infrared spectrum of Uranus' disk between 7 micrometers and 3 millimeters suggests a volume mixing ratio for helium in the atmosphere of 40 +/- 20 percent, more than for the sun, Jupiter, or Saturn. Alternative explanations require even more extreme assumptions regarding gas abundances or aerosol vertical distribution and spectral properties. The most serious difficulty with a model containing large amounts of helium is devising a credible evolutionary or chemical model explaining the absence or segregation of so much hydrogen."

https://openalex.org/W1976345926,"It has been reported that a preparation obtained from prothlalli of the fern species Anemia phyllitidis controls antheridium formation in this species. If this same preparation is applied at the spore stage it induces a physiological state antagonistic to antheridium formation. The inhibitory state is inducible only at a very early stage of development, but, once induced, it remains manifest at much later stages. Quite possibly, the inhibitory state arises in response to the factor that induces formation of anitlheridia. The inhibitory state may have an important function in fern development."

https://openalex.org/W1988573749,"I have stressed the importance of economic growth and employment policies for the furtherance of women's career objectives. Legal action to remove discrimination, as well as transformation of attitudes and expectations, will prove but hollow successes if adequate career opportunities do not become available. For this reason, the employment outlook for professional women in the 1970's has been examined on the basis of three alternative views of the future. All three involve elements of uncertainty and would require adjustments in the labor market. In the first alternative, although the BLS projected an overall balance in the labor market, supply and demand were expected to be ill-matched in several professional sectors, entailing burdensome retraining for those finding themselves in the areas of excess supply. The more pessimistic variant, based either on failure to reach growth and employment goals or on deliberate pursuit of reduced growth goals-combined with population stabilization and increased productivity-would require such fundamental adjustments in the labor market as work-sharing and early retirement or deemphasis of career objectives. The optimistic variant posits economic and social needs great enough to warrant high growth rates and views an expanded labor supply as a factor enabling the economy to attain such growth rates and to extend the utilization of professional personnel in new as well as in established areas (31). The major burden posed by the optimistic variant involves the need to achieve social consensus on the goals of society and to maintain the commitment to those goals with energy and intelligence."
