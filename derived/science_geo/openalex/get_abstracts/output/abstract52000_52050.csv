https://openalex.org/W2014741978,"A sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay has been used to measure the distribution of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in rat brain. All areas of brain tested, except cerebellum, contained readily measurable amounts of TRH. The hypothalamus contained only 31.2 percent of the total brain content of TRH. These results support recent suggestions of central actions for TRH in addition to its hypophysiotropic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2040860320,"The regional distribution of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in rat brain was studied. The greatest concentration of TRH was found in the median eminence. High concentrations were also found in several hypothalamic nuclei. Outside the hypothalamus, relatively large amounts of TRH were found in the septal and preoptic areas."

When the purified histones are compared with analogous vertebrate histones in amino acid composition, the extent of difference varies widely among the different histone classes, the order from most to least conserved being F2a1, F3, F2a2, F2b, and F1. The compositional differences between mammalian and Drosophila F1 histones are particularly large, exceeding 30% for all amino acids except lysine and arginine. The F1 histone of Drosophila was cleaved with CNBr, and the COOH-terminal peptide, representing 60% of the molecule, was isolated. It was found to be enriched in lysine, as in rabbit F1 histone. These results suggest that despite the high rate of evolutionary change of this histone, the general arrangement of positively charged residues is largely conserved, possibly to satisfy requirements for correct binding to DNA. However, this COOH-terminal peptide contains less than one-half of the number of prolyl residues present in the corresponding portion of rabbit F1, indicating that the lysine-, alanine-, and proline-rich portion of this region, believed to be very constant among mammalian F1 histones, can undergo striking evolutionary changes."

https://openalex.org/W1486212748,"Abstract Homogeneous ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase from Rhodospirillum rubrum has a molecular weight of 114,000 and is composed of two subunits of approximately 56,000 daltons. No evidence for the presence of smaller polypeptide chains was obtained. The amino acid composition of the R. rubrum enzyme resembles that of the large subunit from the spinach enzyme and of the enzyme from the hydrogen bacteria. Four of nine half-cystines of the R. rubrum enzyme are titratable with 5,5'-dithiobis(2'-nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of 8 m urea. Hyperbolic velocity versus substrate concentration curves are obtained when ribulose 1,5-diphosphate is the varied substrate. However, in the presence of EDTA or in the presence of EDTA and dithiothreitol, sigmoidal curves are obtained when CO2 is the varied substrate. A sigmoidal response is not seen with enzyme activated by dithiothreitol alone. Interaction coefficients are approximately one for the enzyme activated by dithiothreitol, EDTA or EDTA plus dithiothreitol at higher (0.33 to 1.1 mm) CO2 concentrations. However, at low levels of CO2 (0.11 to 0.33 mm CO2) interaction coefficients are 3.8 and 2.6 for the enzyme activated by EDTA or EDTA plus dithiothreitol, respectively. Initial velocity studies with the dithiothreitol-activated enzyme are compatible with an ordered reaction catalyzed by ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase. The R. rubrum ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase is immunologically unusual in that antibodies do not form precipitates in immunodiffusion with the enzyme from any source outside of the Athiorhodaceae."

https://openalex.org/W1512429676,"Abstract Ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase has been purified 15-fold from derepressed butyrate-grown Rhodospirillum rubrum to a specific activity of 1.76 µmoles of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylated per min per mg of protein at pH 8.0 and 30°. The enzyme, which is recovered in 30 to 35% yield, is homogeneous by the criterion of electrophoresis in gels polymerized from several concentrations of acrylamide. Immunochemical procedures were also used to establish homogeneity. The carboxylase is strongly activated by EDTA and dithiothreitol after storage if Mg2+ is present. There is an absolute requirement of Mg2+ for catalysis as only 0.05% activity is detected in its absence. Other divalent cations cannot be substituted for magnesium. Preincubation with Mg2+ plus bicarbonate and initiation of catalysis with ribulose 1,5-diphosphate is required to achieve maximal rates. Homogeneous preparations could be stored without activity loss in the frozen state or at 2° in either phosphate or Tris buffers."
https://openalex.org/W1532520741,"The mechanism of penetration of the toxic plant proteins abrin and ricin into Ehrlich ascites cells has been studied by measuring, under different experimental conditions, the lag occurring from the time the cells have been incubated with the toxins until protein synthesis in the cells is inhibited. When Ehrlich ascites cells were incubated with abrin or ricin at 37°, a lag time of at least 30 min occurred before protein synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of labeled leucine into acid-precipitable material, was reduced. At 20° the lag time was 6 hr. In a cell-free system from rabbit reticulocytes, the inhibition occurred immediately, indicating that the lag time observed in whole cells is due to slow penetration of the toxic principle into the cells. When antisera against the toxins were added to the cell suspension after preincubation with the toxins, the toxic effects could be prevented for different lengths of time, depending on the incubation temperature and the nature of the antitoxin used. With antisera prepared against the whole toxins, the toxic effects were partially prevented when the antitoxins were added after less than 30 min of preincubation with the cells at 20°. Specific antisera against the isolated A chains (the toxic principle of the toxin) were able to rescue the cells after a longer preincubation with toxins than specific antisera against the B chains which are involved in the binding of the toxins to the cells. Abrin and ricin did not inhibit protein synthesis in reticulocytes, even though the toxins do bind readily to the surface membrane of these cells. The results are consistent with our two-step model for the entry of abrin and ricin into the cells; in the first step of this model the toxins bind to receptors on the cell surface by their B chain (here denoted the haptomer), whereas in the second step the toxic A chain (here denoted the effectomer) penetrates into the cytoplasm, where it exerts its action. The latter process appears to be the slower one, and the data indicate that endocytosis may be involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1482105093,"Abstract In continuation of our studies on the inactivation of tryptophan synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by proteinases from the same organism, two protein inhibitors of the tryptophan synthase inactivating yeast proteinase B were purified from boiled bakers' yeast extract. The molecular weight of both inhibitors is 10,000 and both inhibit specifically proteinase B, but not proteinases A and C. The inhibitors form tight complexes with proteinase B. With the substrates Azocoll and N-acetyltyrosine ethyl ester, noncompetitive inhibition patterns are obtained. The inhibitors are proteins with isoelectric points of 8.0 and 7.0, respectively. They are very stable in the pH range of 1 to 10, but they are easily destroyed by incubation with proteinase A and, less effectively, with proteinase B at pH 5.0. A close molecular relationship of both inhibitors is indicated by the cross-reaction of inhibitor I with antiserum prepared against inhibitor II."

https://openalex.org/W1548417016,"Abstract The molecular weight of IgG3 myeloma proteins is about 170,000 as judged by gel filtration analyses of the light and heavy chains in 5 m guanidine-1 m acetic acid. The heavy chain of IgG3 has a molecular weight of about 60,000, which is larger by 9,000 to 10,000 than the molecular weight of the heavy chain of IgG1. Under nondenaturing conditions, an apparent molecular weight of 200,000 is obtained for the intact IgG3 protein. A similar molecular weight discrepancy is found when the pepsin fragment, F(ab')2, is analyzed by gel filtration under dissociating and nondissociating conditions. In contrast, the papain fragments, Fc and Fab, showed no anomalous gel filtration behavior when molecular weights were determined in the presence or in the absence of guanidine HCl. On the basis of these observations, and from immunological comparisons and amino acid compositions of the IgG3 proteins and their enzymic fragments, it is proposed that the IgG3 heavy chain has a hinge region of increased length. It is suggested that this extended hinge region results in an unusual molecular size and shape for the protein, which consequently behaves abnormally during gel filtration. This abnormal hinge region explains the appearance of Fab'-like and Fch fragments, obtained by pepsin and papain treatment, respectively. Both fragments contain partly intact hinge regions and on gel filtration under nondissociating conditions behave as species with an apparent molecular weight of about 100,000, while the correct values are 60,000 to 70,000."

https://openalex.org/W1565363013,"Abstract Mitochondria isolated from starved or stationary phase cells (strain SB-1) have 40 to 60 % fewer associated cytoplasmic ribosomes than mitochondria isolated from log phase cells. A similar reduction in the amount of associated ribosomes was obtained when the initiation of cytoplasmic protein synthesis was inhibited using a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant. A change in the amount of mitochondria-bound cytoplasmic ribosomes was correlated directly with a change in the isopyknic density of the isolated mitochondria; moreover, the amount of cytoplasmic ribosomes associated with mitochondria could be predicted from the mitochondrial density. Mitochondria prepared from log phase cells contain 7.6 A260 units of cytoplasmic rRNA per mg of protein and will bind in vitro no more than 0.4 A260 unit of cytoplasmic ribosomes per mg of mitochondrial protein. From these results we calculate that only about 5 % of the ribosome binding sites are vacant in these mitochondrial preparations. On the other hand, mitochondria obtained from starved cells have only 4.7 A260 units of cytoplasmic rRNA per mg of protein and have a considerably greater capacity to bind ribosomes than mitochondria isolated from log phase cells. The binding of free cytoplasmic polysomes or cytoplasmic polysomes extracted from mitochondria to a preparation of EDTA-washed mitochondria was completely inhibited by either 10-4 m aurintricarboxylic acid or 350 mm KCl. However, the addition of 10-3 m aurintricarboxylic acid or 350 mm KCl to the medium used for the isolation of mitochondria had little effect on the amount of cytoplasmic rRNA recovered with the mitochondria. These data support the conclusion that cytoplasmic ribosomes are bound to yeast mitochondria in vivo."

The flagellar tubulin is similar to other tubulins in molecular weight (55,000), amino acid composition, electrophoretic mobility, and nucleotide composition. However, the protein contains 2 moles of guanine nucleotide per 55,000 g of protein, twice that usually found in tubulin. A rabbit antiserum against flagellar tubulin was shown to contain antibodies specific for tubulin. Purified tubulin iodinated with 125I was used in a radioimmune assay to measure levels of flagellar tubulin antigen in cells. The measurements indicate that the antigen increases 35- to 55-fold during differentiation of amebae to flagellates."

These compounds were used for purification of anti-glycosphingolipid antibodies from serum of immunized rabbits. The antibodies bound to the substrate were released by 1 m sodium iodide and their immunological properties were studied. Anti-globoside is directed toward the terminal β-(N-acetyl)galactosaminosyl-(1→3)α-galactopyranosyl structure, while anti-hematoside is directed predominantly toward the sialosyl residue of hematoside."

https://openalex.org/W1602975231,"Abstract Phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase (UDP-MurNAc-Ala-γdGlu-Lys-dAla-dAla:undecaprenylphosphate phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide transferase) catalyzes the initial membrane reaction in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan. In addition, the enzyme catalyzes the exchange of [3H]uridine monophosphate with the uridine monophosphate moiety of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. A specificity profile towards the peptide subunit of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide has been established for the exchange and transfer reactions catalyzed by the translocase from Staphylococcus aureus Copenhagen. A good correlation between Vmax/Km in the transfer reaction and Rmax/Km in the exchange reaction was observed. On the basis of glycine substitution, the enzyme has a high specificity for l-alanine in position 1 (R1) and d-alanine in position 4 (R4) and a low specificity for d-alanine in position 5 (R5). For example, when compared with UDP-MurNAc-Ala-dGlu-Lys-dAla-dAla, glycine replacement in either R1 or R4 results in a 9- and 15-fold decrease in Vmax/Km, respectively. In contrast, glycine substitution in R5 results in only a 1.5-fold decrease in Vmax/Km. These results are further supported by comparing UDP-MurNAc-Ala-dGlu-Lys-dAla-dAla, -Ala-dGlu-Lys-dAla, and -Ala-dGlu-Lys. For UDP-MurNAc-tetrapeptide a 4-fold decrease in Vmax/Km was observed whereas a 77-fold decrease was found for the -tripeptide. Replacement of both R1 and R4 by glycine reduces Rmax/Km 135-fold. The translocase has a low specificity for the diamino acid in R3. Substitution of lysine with meso-diaminopimelic acid results in a 1.5-fold decrease in Rmax/Km and with ornithine in no change. The established specificity profile of the translocase is consistent with the in vivo effects of elevated concentrations of glycine on the growth of S. aureus Copenhagen (Hammes, W., Schleifer, K.H., and Kandler, O. (1973) J. Bacteriol., 116, 1029–1053). Thus, it is suggested that the translocase has a key role in selecting analogs of UDP-MurNAc-Ala-γdGlu-Lys-dAla-dAla for peptidoglycan synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1574475417,"Abstract The major DNA polymerase activity from exponentially growing Tetrahymena pyriformis was isolated and purified approximately 12,000-fold relative to the specific activity of DNA polymerase in crude extracts. The enzyme aggregates at low ionic strength. In solutions of ionic strength 0.25 m or greater, the enzyme exists as a single species with an approximate molecular weight of 80,000. DNase activity is associated with polymerase activity throughout all stages of purification. In the presence of MnCl2, the enzyme will utilize a polyribonucleotide as template in the presence of an oligodeoxynucleotide primer. The maximal velocity and Km of the enzyme are greater with dTTP than with BrdUTP as substrate when poly[d(A-T)]·poly[d(A-T)] is used as template-primer. Ethidium bromide is a potent inhibitor of enzyme activity, but inhibition is dependent on concentration of template-primer and purity of enzyme. This suggests that care must be exercised in comparing different polymerases according to the degree of inhibition of activity by ethidium bromide. Rifamycin SV does not inhibit DNA polymerase from Tetrahymena, but some semisynthetic derivatives of rifamycin SV are potent inhibitors of the enzyme, the most potent being AF/013. DNA polymerase from untreated exponentially growing Tetrahymena appears to be similar in a number of its properties to properties reported for the DNA polymerase induced after treatment of Tetrahymena with ethidium bromide. However, it is not yet known whether or not the enzymes from untreated and from induced cells are the same."

CTP reduction can be stimulated by dATP or ATP, and can be inhibited, as can ATP and GTP reduction, by dTTP. Reduction of UTP is unaffected by deoxyribonucleotides.

https://openalex.org/W1532734930,"Abstract Tyrosinase (o-diphenol:O2-oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.1) is present in the epidermis of Rana pipiens pipiens as an inactive proenzyme that can be activated by a variety of endopeptidases, chymotrypsin being the most effective. This proenzyme has been purified to homogeneity as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Inactive and active tyrosinase both have molecular weights of 200,000 ± 12,000 estimated by gel filtration over Sepharose 6B. The proenzyme contains 0.15 % copper. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicates polypeptide molecular weights of 54,100 ± 700 for the inactive and 50,000 ± 700 for the active proteins. A peptide of molecular weight approximately 5,700 ± 1,100 appears on chymotryptic activation of the proenzyme. This peptide may be located on the NH2-terminal portion of the proenzyme since slow activation of the proenzyme occurs in the presence of leucine aminopeptidase. A tetrameric structure is suggested for both active and inactive enzymes. Tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) are oxidized with approximately equal Km of 5 x 10-3 m and kcat of 800 min-1. The enzyme is inhibited competitively with respect to DOPA by a variety of substituted benzoic acids. Inhibition by copper-complexing reagents such as diethyldithiocarbamate and cyanide can be reversed by addition of copper and there is evidence that copper may be reversibly removed from the active enzyme. Isoelectric points of 9.35 and 9.25 for the inactive and active enzymes, respectively, are consistent with the amino acid composition of the former material. A proteolytically activated tyrosinase from a related subspecies of frog Rana pipiens berlandieri exhibits an isoelectric point near six suggesting that the basicity of the enzyme is not related to its function. The utility of this enzyme-proenzyme system is discussed as an example of post-translational control of active enzyme levels."

https://openalex.org/W1565707726,"Abstract By use of a Crithidia bioassay, the production of a 6-(l-erythrodihydroxypropyl)pterin (biopterin)-like substance was observed during the cultivation of Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO K1) and mouse neuroblastoma cell line (C-1300). Further studies were carried out with the CHO K1 cells using various suspected precursors. In a cell culture [2-14C]folic acid was converted to 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine (pterin), 6-hydroxymethylpterin, and 6-carboxypterin, but not to biopterin. When [2-14C]guanine was added to the culture, radioactive biopterin and pterin were obtained. However, when [2-14C]guanine was replaced by [8-14C]guanine, little or no radioactivity was incorporated into biopterin and other pterins, indicating that the purine undergoes ring opening and elimination of carbon atom 8. When the cells were cultured in a biopterin-free medium with [2-14C]guanine, the specific radioactivities of the isolated biopterin and GMP from RNA were in close agreement. A similar experiment with [U-14C]-guanosine showed that only about 10% of the label found in the GMP of RNA appeared in the ribosyl moiety. Therefore, using this approach the possible involvement of the ribosyl moiety of GMP in biopterin biosynthesis could not be unequivocally determined. In addition, the results suggested that the radioactivity found in the other nucleotides of RNA was distributed among the ribose moiety. When [6-14C]glucose was used most of the radioactivity found in biopterin was localized in the side chain and in carbon atom 5 of the ribose moiety of GMP in RNA. The results indicate that guanosine or one of its phosphorylated derivatives is the precursor of biopterin and that the side chain is of ribose origin. The addition of 6-lactyl-7,8-dihydropterin (sepiapterin) to a cell culture with [2-14C]guanine increased the amount of biopterin isolated and prevented the incorporation of radioactivity into the biopterin. This result indicates the possible intermediary role of sepiapterin. Based upon these observations, the metabolic relationship of pterins in CHO cell culture is proposed."

Attempts were made to distinguish between the various catalytic and regulatory activities of this ternary enzyme complex by a variety of techniques. Limited trypsin treatment specifically cleaved the active region of chorismate mutase and the region required for the activation of shikimate kinase activity while most of the catalytic activity of DAHP synthetase remained intact. The loss of catalytic activity of chorismate mutase paralleled the loss of feedback control of DAHP synthetase and substrate binding studies revealed only one site for prephenate binding on each polypeptide chain. Anti-serum to DAHP synthetase-chorismate mutase specifically inhibited chorimate mutase and shikimate kinase activity but did not inhibit DAHP synthetase activity. These data indicate that DAHP synthetase activity does not depend on a catalytically functional chorismate mutase activity. The data further suggest that the chorismate mutase active site is identical with the feedback inhibition site for DAHP synthetase, thus facilitating feedback control of the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. The distribution of the catalytic and regulatory activities of this enzyme on one polypeptide chain is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1510139012,"Abstract Reports in the literature have indicated that the fumarate reductase activity of succinate dehydrogenase, as measured by the fumarate-FMNH2 assay, is not influenced by the state of activation of the enzyme. This conclusion was based on the observation that the activity in the fumarate reductase assay, measured at 15°, where significant activation by succinate or malonate is not observed, was the same whether the enzyme was fully activated or essentially in the deactivated state. It is shown in the present paper that under the conditions of the fumarate-FMNH2 assay full activation of succinate dehydrogenase occurs even at 15°. The activating agent responsible is the reduced flavin, which acts as electron donor in this assay. Flavin mononucleotide, reduced by light-EDTA, causes full activation, but the energy of activation for the process is 17 Cal per mole, a value much lower than that characterizing activation by substrates, competitive inhibitors, or reduced coenzyme Q10. Light irradiation of the purified soluble enzyme in the presence of EDTA but without added flavin also causes complete activation."
