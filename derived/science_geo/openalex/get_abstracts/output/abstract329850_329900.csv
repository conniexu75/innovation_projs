On a regional basis, acidified and aluminum-rich lakes and streams in New England are confined mainly to low-order watersheds."
https://openalex.org/W2086750987,"Rechargeable, high energy density lithium batteries require an efficient lithium electrode. Earlier work with electrolytes based on propylene carbonate, methyl acetate, and tetrahydrofuran yielded poor lithium electrode cycling efficiencies because of electrolyte reduction by lithium. Solutions of lithium hexafluoroarsenate in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran are found to be remarkably stable toward lithium, resulting in cycling efficiencies that approach 98 percent. The ability of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran to resist reduction by lithium is thought to be based on the position of its lowest unfilled molecular orbital relative to that of tetrahydrofuran."
https://openalex.org/W2066315995,"Large teleseismic delays, exceeding 1 second, are found near Mount Hannah in the Clear Lake volcanic field and in the steam-production area at The Geysers. The delays are superimposed on a general delay field of about 0.5 second extending over the volcanic rocks and the steam reservoir. It is postulated that a magma chamber under the surface volcanic rocks with a core of severely molten rock beneath Mount Hannah and a highly fractured steam reservoir probably underlain by partially molten rock at The Geysers are responsible for the observed delays. Both zones extend to depths of 20 kilometers or more."
