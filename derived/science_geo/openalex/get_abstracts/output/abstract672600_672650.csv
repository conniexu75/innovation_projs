https://openalex.org/W3153493739,"The acute clinical manifestations of COVID-19 have been well characterized1,2, but the post-acute sequelae of this disease have not been comprehensively described. Here we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to systematically and comprehensively identify 6-month incident sequelae—including diagnoses, medication use and laboratory abnormalities—in patients with COVID-19 who survived for at least 30 days after diagnosis. We show that beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with COVID-19 exhibit a higher risk of death and use of health resources. Our high-dimensional approach identifies incident sequelae in the respiratory system, as well as several other sequelae that include nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain and anaemia. We show increased incident use of several therapeutic agents—including pain medications (opioids and non-opioids) as well as antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihypertensive and oral hypoglycaemic agents—as well as evidence of laboratory abnormalities in several organ systems. Our analysis of an array of prespecified outcomes reveals a risk gradient that increases according to the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection (that is, whether patients were not hospitalized, hospitalized or admitted to intensive care). Our findings show that a substantial burden of health loss that spans pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organ systems is experienced by patients who survive after the acute phase of COVID-19. These results will help to inform health system planning and the development of multidisciplinary care strategies to reduce chronic health loss among individuals with COVID-19. Healthcare data from the US Department of Veterans Affairs are used to characterize the six-month incident sequelae of individuals who survive for at least thirty days after developing COVID-19."

Engrailed-1 lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are known to function in scarring, but Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs) remain poorly characterized. Using cell transplantation and transgenic mouse models, we identified a dermal ENF subpopulation that gives rise to postnatally derived EPFs by activating Engrailed-1 expression during adult wound healing. By studying ENF responses to substrate mechanics, we found that mechanical tension drives Engrailed-1 activation via canonical mechanotransduction signaling. Finally, we showed that blocking mechanotransduction signaling with either verteporfin, an inhibitor of Yes-associated protein (YAP), or fibroblast-specific transgenic YAP knockout prevents Engrailed-1 activation and promotes wound regeneration by ENFs, with recovery of skin appendages, ultrastructure, and mechanical strength. This finding suggests that there are two possible outcomes to postnatal wound healing: a fibrotic response (EPF-mediated) and a regenerative response (ENF-mediated)."

Substantial interventions are required to meet these goals, particularly for industrialized countries. Duan et al. projected that China will need to reduce its carbon emissions by more than 90% and its energy consumption by almost 40% to do its share in reaching the 1.5°C target. Negative emission technology is an essential element of any plan. China's accumulated economic costs by 2050 may be about 3 to 6% of its gross domestic product. Science , this issue p. 378"
https://openalex.org/W3156994935,"COVID-19 presents with a wide range of severity, from asymptomatic in some individuals to fatal in others. Based on a study of 1,051,032 23andMe research participants, we report genetic and nongenetic associations with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, respiratory symptoms and hospitalization. Using trans-ancestry genome-wide association studies, we identified a strong association between blood type and COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as a gene-rich locus on chromosome 3p21.31 that is more strongly associated with outcome severity. Hospitalization risk factors include advancing age, male sex, obesity, lower socioeconomic status, non-European ancestry and preexisting cardiometabolic conditions. While non-European ancestry was a significant risk factor for hospitalization after adjusting for sociodemographics and preexisting health conditions, we did not find evidence that these two primary genetic associations explain risk differences between populations for severe COVID-19 outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3156374487,"In rodents, obesity and aging impair nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis, which contributes to metabolic dysfunction. Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) availability is a rate-limiting factor in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis. We conducted a 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the effect of NMN supplementation on metabolic function in postmenopausal women with prediabetes who were overweight or obese. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and skeletal muscle insulin signaling [phosphorylation of protein kinase AKT and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)] increased after NMN supplementation but did not change after placebo treatment. NMN supplementation up-regulated the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β and other genes related to muscle remodeling. These results demonstrate that NMN increases muscle insulin sensitivity, insulin signaling, and remodeling in women with prediabetes who are overweight or obese (clinicaltrial.gov NCT03151239)."
https://openalex.org/W3154810465,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) is a transcription factor that frequently accumulates in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), resulting in constitutive activation of genes involved in carcinogenesis. Belzutifan (MK-6482, previously known as PT2977) is a potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of HIF-2α. Maximum tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of belzutifan were evaluated in this first-in-human phase 1 study (NCT02974738). Patients had advanced solid tumors (dose-escalation cohort) or previously treated advanced ccRCC (dose-expansion cohort). Belzutifan was administered orally using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design, followed by expansion at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with ccRCC. In the dose-escalation cohort (n = 43), no dose-limiting toxicities occurred at doses up to 160 mg once daily, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached; the RP2D was 120 mg once daily. Plasma erythropoietin reductions were observed at all doses; erythropoietin concentrations correlated with plasma concentrations of belzutifan. In patients with ccRCC who received 120 mg once daily (n = 55), the confirmed objective response rate was 25% (all partial responses), and the median progression-free survival was 14.5 months. The most common grade ≥3 adverse events were anemia (27%) and hypoxia (16%). Belzutifan was well tolerated and demonstrated preliminary anti-tumor activity in heavily pre-treated patients, suggesting that HIF-2α inhibition might offer an effective treatment for ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W3152758353,"Genetic association results are often interpreted with the assumption that study participation does not affect downstream analyses. Understanding the genetic basis of participation bias is challenging since it requires the genotypes of unseen individuals. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate comparative biases by performing a genome-wide association study contrasting one subgroup versus another. For example, we showed that sex exhibits artifactual autosomal heritability in the presence of sex-differential participation bias. By performing a genome-wide association study of sex in approximately 3.3 million males and females, we identified over 158 autosomal loci spuriously associated with sex and highlighted complex traits underpinning differences in study participation between the sexes. For example, the body mass index-increasing allele at FTO was observed at higher frequency in males compared to females (odds ratio = 1.02, P = 4.4 × 10-36). Finally, we demonstrated how these biases can potentially lead to incorrect inferences in downstream analyses and propose a conceptual framework for addressing such biases. Our findings highlight a new challenge that genetic studies may face as sample sizes continue to grow."
https://openalex.org/W3154648093,"An effective vaccine is needed to end the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Here, we assess the preliminary safety, tolerability and immunogenicity data from an ongoing single-center (in Jiangsu province, China), parallel-group, double-blind phase 1 trial of the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in 144 healthy SARS-CoV-2-naive Chinese participants. These participants are randomized 1:1:1 to receive prime and boost vaccinations of 10 µg or 30 µg BNT162b1 or placebo, given 21 d apart, with equal allocation of younger (aged 18–55 years) and older adults (aged 65–85 years) to each treatment group (ChiCTR2000034825). BNT162b1 encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is one of several messenger RNA-based vaccine candidates under clinical investigation. Local reactions and systemic events were generally dose dependent, transient and mild to moderate. Fever was the only grade 3 adverse event. BNT162b1 induced robust interferon-γ T cell responses to a peptide pool including the RBD in both younger and older Chinese adults, and geometric mean neutralizing titers reached 2.1-fold (for younger participants) and 1.3-fold (for the older participants) that of a panel of COVID-19 convalescent human sera obtained at least 14 d after positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. In summary, BNT162b1 has an acceptable safety profile and produces high levels of humoral and T cell responses in an Asian population. Phase 1 trial results of the messenger RNA vaccine candidate BNT162b1, which encodes the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, show safety and elicitation of antibody and T cell responses in both younger and older Chinese adults."

To study astrocyte cell interactions in vivo, we developed rabies barcode interaction detection followed by sequencing (RABID-seq), which combines barcoded viral tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using RABID-seq, we identified axon guidance molecules as candidate mediators of microglia-astrocyte interactions that promote CNS pathology in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and, potentially, multiple sclerosis (MS). In vivo cell-specific genetic perturbation EAE studies, in vitro systems, and the analysis of MS scRNA-seq datasets and CNS tissue established that Sema4D and Ephrin-B3 expressed in microglia control astrocyte responses via PlexinB2 and EphB3, respectively. Furthermore, a CNS-penetrant EphB3 inhibitor suppressed astrocyte and microglia proinflammatory responses and ameliorated EAE. In summary, RABID-seq identified microglia-astrocyte interactions and candidate therapeutic targets."

It is essential, then, for this resource to remain secure. Jasechko and Perrone examined data from approximately 39 million wells in 40 countries worldwide to investigate their vulnerability to declining water levels (see the Perspective by Famiglietti and Ferguson).

https://openalex.org/W3154766891,"The ""magic methyl"" effect describes the change in potency, selectivity, and/or metabolic stability of a drug candidate associated with addition of a single methyl group. We report a synthetic method that enables direct methylation of C(sp3)-H bonds in diverse drug-like molecules and pharmaceutical building blocks. Visible light-initiated triplet energy transfer promotes homolysis of the O-O bond in di-tert-butyl or dicumyl peroxide under mild conditions. The resulting alkoxyl radicals undergo divergent reactivity, either hydrogen-atom transfer from a substrate C-H bond or generation of a methyl radical via β-methyl scission. The relative rates of these steps may be tuned by varying the reaction conditions or peroxide substituents to optimize the yield of methylated product arising from nickel-mediated cross-coupling of substrate and methyl radicals."
https://openalex.org/W3155818854,"The temporal order of DNA replication [replication timing (RT)] is correlated with chromatin modifications and three-dimensional genome architecture; however, causal links have not been established, largely because of an inability to manipulate the global RT program. We show that loss of RIF1 causes near-complete elimination of the RT program by increasing heterogeneity between individual cells. RT changes are coupled with widespread alterations in chromatin modifications and genome compartmentalization. Conditional depletion of RIF1 causes replication-dependent disruption of histone modifications and alterations in genome architecture. These effects were magnified with successive cycles of altered RT. These results support models in which the timing of chromatin replication and thus assembly plays a key role in maintaining the global epigenetic state."
https://openalex.org/W3156537360,"The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident increased papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) incidence in surrounding regions, particularly for radioactive iodine (131I)-exposed children. We analyzed genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic characteristics of 440 PTCs from Ukraine (from 359 individuals with estimated childhood 131I exposure and 81 unexposed children born after 1986). PTCs displayed radiation dose-dependent enrichment of fusion drivers, nearly all in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and increases in small deletions and simple/balanced structural variants that were clonal and bore hallmarks of nonhomologous end-joining repair. Radiation-related genomic alterations were more pronounced for individuals who were younger at exposure. Transcriptomic and epigenomic features were strongly associated with driver events but not radiation dose. Our results point to DNA double-strand breaks as early carcinogenic events that subsequently enable PTC growth after environmental radiation exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3152687755,"While CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can induce remission in patients with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a large subset relapse with CD19- disease. Like CD19, CD22 is broadly expressed by B-lineage cells and thus serves as an alternative immunotherapy target in ALL. Here we present the composite outcomes of two pilot clinical trials ( NCT02588456 and NCT02650414 ) of T cells bearing a 4-1BB-based, CD22-targeting CAR in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. The primary end point of these studies was to assess safety, and the secondary end point was antileukemic efficacy. We observed unexpectedly low response rates, prompting us to perform detailed interrogation of the responsible CAR biology. We found that shortening of the amino acid linker connecting the variable heavy and light chains of the CAR antigen-binding domain drove receptor homodimerization and antigen-independent signaling. In contrast to CD28-based CARs, autonomously signaling 4-1BB-based CARs demonstrated enhanced immune synapse formation, activation of pro-inflammatory genes and superior effector function. We validated this association between autonomous signaling and enhanced function in several CAR constructs and, on the basis of these observations, designed a new short-linker CD22 single-chain variable fragment for clinical evaluation. Our findings both suggest that tonic 4-1BB-based signaling is beneficial to CAR function and demonstrate the utility of bedside-to-bench-to-bedside translation in the design and implementation of CAR T cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3154773490,"Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of intranuclear inclusions of unknown origin. NIID is caused by an expansion of GGC repeats in the 5' UTR of the NOTCH2NLC (N2C) gene. We found that these repeats are embedded in a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) (uN2C), resulting in their translation into a polyglycine-containing protein, uN2CpolyG. This protein accumulates in intranuclear inclusions in cell and mouse models and in tissue samples of individuals with NIID. Furthermore, expression of uN2CpolyG in mice leads to locomotor alterations, neuronal cell loss, and premature death of the animals. These results suggest that translation of expanded GGC repeats into a novel and pathogenic polyglycine-containing protein underlies the presence of intranuclear inclusions and neurodegeneration in NIID."

Zhu et al. examined the role of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP + ) and its reduced form (NADPH) in cultured human cells. They found that cells lacking NAD kinase 2, an enzyme needed to make NADPH, had decreased abundance of mitochondrial NADPH and proliferated slowly in culture medium with limited nutrients because of a lack of proline. Proline is made in the mitochondria, and thus a key function of NADPH in the mitochondria appears to be the synthesis of proline to sustain cellular protein synthesis.

There have been a few studies examining transgenerational risks of radiation exposure but the results have been inconclusive. Morton et al. analyzed papillary thyroid tumors, normal thyroid tissue, and blood from hundreds of survivors of the Chernobyl nuclear accident and compared them against those of unexposed patients. The findings offer insight into the process of radiation-induced carcinogenesis and characteristic patterns of DNA damage associated with environmental radiation exposure. In a separate study, Yeager et al. analyzed the genomes of 130 children and parents from families in which one or both parents had experienced gonadal radiation exposure related to the Chernobyl accident and the children were conceived between 1987 and 2002.

We developed a reporter, SPOTlight, for brainwide imaging of ISR state with cellular resolution. Unexpectedly, we found a class of neurons in mouse brain, striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs), in which the ISR was activated at steady state. Genetic and pharmacological manipulations revealed that ISR signaling was necessary in CINs for normal type 2 dopamine receptor (D2R) modulation. Inhibiting the ISR inverted the sign of D2R modulation of CIN firing and evoked dopamine release and altered skill learning. Thus, a noncanonical, steady-state mode of ISR activation is found in CINs, revealing a neuromodulatory role for the ISR in learning."
https://openalex.org/W3153209697,"The hypothalamus contains an astounding heterogeneity of neurons that regulate endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral functions. However, its molecular developmental trajectory and origin of neuronal diversity remain unclear. Here, we profile the transcriptome of 43,261 cells derived from Rax+ hypothalamic neuroepithelium to map the developmental landscape of the mouse hypothalamus and trajectory of radial glial cells (RGCs), intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), nascent neurons, and peptidergic neurons. We show that RGCs adopt a conserved strategy for multipotential differentiation but generate Ascl1+ and Neurog2+ IPCs. Ascl1+ IPCs differ from their telencephalic counterpart by displaying fate bifurcation, and postmitotic nascent neurons resolve into multiple peptidergic neuronal subtypes. Clonal analysis further demonstrates that single RGCs can produce multiple neuronal subtypes. Our study reveals that multiple cell types along the lineage hierarchy contribute to fate diversification of hypothalamic neurons in a stepwise fashion, suggesting a cascade diversification model that deconstructs the origin of neuronal diversity."

https://openalex.org/W3155357773,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a devastating pathogen in the swine industry worldwide. miRNAs are reported to be involved in virus–host interaction. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing and miRNA inhibitors to screen possible miRNAs that can inhibit PRRSV infection on its target cell, porcine alveolar macrophages. We observed that miR-218 was downregulated upon virus infection, and knockdown of miR-218 significantly enhanced PRRSV replication. Overexpression of miR-218 resulted in a decrease in PRRSV replication, and this overexpression did not alter viral genomic RNA levels, but rather increased antiviral interferon signaling. Further analysis revealed that miR-218 regulated PRRSV replication by directly targeting porcine suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a JAK2 kinase inhibitor. Knockdown of the endogenous SOCS3 expression led to augmentation of type I interferon genes and resulted in decreased PRRSV replication, and vice versa. During PRRSV infection in vivo and in vitro, cellular miR-218 expression was downregulated and SOCS3 expression was upregulated, further supporting the inverse correlation between miR-218 and SOCS3 expression. The data on SOCS3 depletion in combination with miR-218 inhibition suggested that the antiviral activity of miR-218 required the SOCS3-mediated signaling pathway. Similarly, miR-218 negatively regulated PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, as well as the replication of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in Vero and ST cells respectively.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive RNA virus, belonging to the family Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales (1Cavanagh D. Nidovirales: A new order comprising Coronaviridae and arteriviridae.Arch. Virol. 1997; 142: 629-633PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meulenberg J.J. PRRSV, the virus.Vet. Res. 2000; 31: 11-21PubMed Google Scholar). PRRSV is the etiological agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which is characterized by reproductive failure in sows and severe respiratory symptoms in piglets and growing pigs. PRRS was first described in the United States in 1987 and in Europe in 1990 (3Collins J.E. Benfield D.A. Christianson W.T. Harris L. Hennings J.C. Shaw D.P. Goyal S.M. McCullough S. Morrison R.B.

To control this disease, researchers have developed different vaccines. However, due to the high antigenic heterogeneity of PRRSV, the use of current vaccines has some limitations (5Rappe J.C. García-Nicolás O. Flückiger F. Thür B. Hofmann M.A. Summerfield A. Ruggli N. Heterogeneous antigenic properties of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus nucleocapsid.Vet.

Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the immune regulatory molecules against PRRSV infection from the host’s perspective. miRNAs, a class of endogenous noncoding RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides, play important roles in the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. miRNAs are initially transcribed from the genome as primary miRNAs and processed into the final single-stranded mature miRNAs through a series of intermediates by biogenesis machinery. Mature miRNAs are then incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complex where miRNAs bind to their target mRNAs and result in mRNA destabilization and/or translational repression (7Dong H. Lei J.

Overview of microRNA biology.Semin. Liver Dis. 2015; 35: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In animals, the 5'-proximal seed region (at nucleotides 2–8) of miRNAs binds to complementary sequences within the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of the target mRNA (9Eulalio A. Huntzinger E. Izaurralde E. Getting to the root of miRNA-mediated gene silencing.Cell. 2008; 132: 9-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). It is estimated that more than half of the protein coding genes in mammals can be regulated by miRNAs (10Chekulaeva M. Filipowicz W. Mechanisms of miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in animal cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), thus miRNAs can participate in a series of cellular processes including DNA replication and reparation, cell proliferation and differentiation, and ontogenesis (11Krol J.

Recent evidence reveals that miRNAs can regulate the replication of several viruses through managing the production of IFNs and ISGs (21Forster S.C. Tate M.D. Hertzog P.J.

Likewise, a few miRNAs, such as miRNA-23, miR-26a, miR-30c, and miRNA-373, attribute to modulate PRRSV replication by targeting IFN or its signaling pathways (23Zhang Q. Huang C. Yang Q. Gao L. Liu H.C. Tang J. Feng W.H. MicroRNA-30c modulates type I IFN responses to facilitate porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection by targeting JAK1.J.

Since the details of miRNA-mediated regulation of viral replication have just begun to emerge, a comprehensive investigation of their roles in PRRSV pathogenesis will contribute to a better understanding of host–pathogen interactions. In the present study, we obtained the differently expressed miRNA profiles by deep sequencing of HP-PRRSV-infected alveolar macrophages. Based on the screening data, we have investigated miR-218 induction during PRRSV infection in vitro and in vivo. We found that miR-218 negatively regulates PRRSV replication by targeting SOCS3, thus clarifying one of the molecular mechanisms underlying PRRSV pathogenesis. To investigate the miRNAs involved in the host response against PRRSV infection, we utilized a high-throughput deep sequencing to profile miRNA in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) at 24 h postinfection (hpi) of a HP-PRRSV strain HuN4. Mock-treated PAMs were used as control. The top 100 expressed miRNAs obtained from mock-treated PAMs are shown in Figure 1A. Comparing with previously reported miRNAs related to PRRSV infection, most of them are present in this figure, such as miR-23, miR-378, miR-26a, miR-22, let-7f, miR-29a, miR-181, miR-30c, miR-505, and miR-125b (26Du T. Nan Y. Xiao S. Zhao Q. Zhou E.M. Antiviral strategies against PRRSV infection.Trends Microbiol. 2017; 25: 968-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that our deep sequencing data are reliable. After virus treatment, most miRNAs were downregulated, as shown in the volcano plot (Fig. 1B). Among them, seven miRNAs including miR-339-5p, miR-99b, miR-365-5p, miR-378, miR-345, miR-27b-3p, and miR-218 all ranked inside the top 100 and were significantly downregulated (Fig. 1C). Like our findings, Zhen et al. reported that miR-378 was downregulated upon PRRSV infection as well (27Zhen Y. Wang F. Liang W. Liu J. Gao G. Wang Y. Xu X. Su Q. Zhang Q. Liu B. Identification of differentially expressed non-coding RNA in porcine alveolar macrophages from Tongcheng and large white pigs Responded to PRRSV.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 15621Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The PRRSV replication in PAMs was confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. 1D). Next, the effect of these seven miRNAs on PRRSV infection was explored by blocking their endogenous expression using specific inhibitors. PAMs were transfected with each of seven miRNA inhibitors or negative control for 24 h, and cells were then inoculated with PRRSV at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. Relative quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that inhibition of miR-378, miR-345, miR-27b-3p, or miR-218 had significantly increased the expression levels of viral RNA (Fig. 1E), indicating that these four miRNAs negatively regulate PRRSV replication. Consistent with our data, miR-378 has been reported to be an effective suppressor against PRRSV replication (27Zhen Y. Wang F. Liang W. Liu J. Gao G. Wang Y. Xu X. Su Q. Zhang Q. Liu B. Identification of differentially expressed non-coding RNA in porcine alveolar macrophages from Tongcheng and large white pigs Responded to PRRSV.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 15621Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Since the miR-218 was significantly downregulated upon virus infection and the miR-218 inhibitor resulted in an increase in viral RNA, we further investigated the regulatory function of miR-218 inhibitor on PRRSV replication. The virus titers of collected cell supernatants were measured by TCID50 assay, and the result showed that treatment with miR-218 inhibitor resulted in a marked increase in PRRSV titers in contrast to treatment with miRNA negative control (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, the commercial miRNA mimic was used to overexpress miR-218 in PAMs. At 24 h post miR-218 mimic transfection, PAMs were infected with PRRSV for an additional 24 h. The qPCR results showed that overexpression of miR-218 significantly reduced viral RNA load compared with the negative control (Fig. 2B). The results of TCID50 assay also displayed that miR-218 overexpression led to a significant decrease in viral titers (Fig. 2C). No toxicity of miR-218 mimic at concentrations of <150 nM was evident for PAMs (Fig. S1). These findings indicate that miR-218 has the potential to inhibit PRRSV replication in PAMs. To determine whether low-virulent PRRSV has a similar effect on miR-218 expression, PAMs were treated with attenuated live PRRSV vaccine strain HuN4-F112, which is a Marc-145-adaptive strain and cannot efficiently replicate in PAMs (28Tian Z.J. An T.Q. Zhou Y.J. Peng J.M. Hu S.P. Wei T.C. Jiang Y.F. Xiao Y. Tong G.Z. An attenuated live vaccine based on highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) protects piglets against HP-PRRS.Vet. Microbiol. 2009; 138: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The result showed that the expression level of miR-218 was not reduced in HuN4-F112-treated PAMs compared with the control group (Fig. 2D). Similarly, UV-inactivated HuN4 did not result in the decrease of miR-218 expression (Fig. 2E), indicating that virus replication is required for the downregulation of miR-218. Furthermore, we identified the dynamic changes of miR-218 expression at different stages of virus infection. As shown in Figure 2F, the virus attachment did not affect miR-218 expression; as shown in Figure 2G, the downregulation of miR-218 occurred after the virus entered the cell and during its biosynthesis (after two hpi). Altogether, our findings indicate that virus replication-mediated miR-218 downregulation facilitates PRRSV replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that miRNA-mediated viral regulation can happen by directly targeting the viral genome or by targeting host genes involved in viral replication (29Bernier A. Sagan S.M. The Diverse roles of microRNAs at the Host⁻Virus Interface.Viruses. 2018; 10: 440-465Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Skalsky R.L. Cullen B.R. Viruses, microRNAs, and host interactions.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 64: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). During the replication cycle of PRRSV, the positive-sense RNA genome is transcribed into an intermediate, negative-sense RNA molecule, which functions as templates for the synthesis of positive-sense genomic RNA (31Fang Y. Snijder E.J. The PRRSV replicase: Exploring the multifunctionality of an intriguing set of nonstructural proteins.Virus Res. 2010; 154: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, to uncover the potential function of miR-218 during PRRSV replication, we compared the miR-218 seed sequence with PRRSV genomic RNA and found that there were at least two paired regions between miR-218 and negative/positive-sense viral RNA (Fig. 3A). To test whether miR-218 directly targets viral RNA and acts as a direct antiviral factor, we infected PAMs with PRRSV for 2 h and then transfected miR-218 mimic for 8 h and followed by detecting its effect on viral RNAs. As shown in Figure 3, B and C, overexpression of miR-218 did not affect the expression levels of negative-sense genomic RNA and positive-sense genomic RNA, suggesting that miR-218 regulates PRRSV replication not through directly targeting viral genomic RNA. Given that miR-218 can regulate PRRSV replication in PAMs, it is worthwhile to further investigate the molecular mechanisms. Type I IFN is the key innate immune cytokine produced in large quantities by cells to trigger antiviral function (32Mesev E.V. LeDesma R.A. Ploss A. Decoding type I and III interferon signalling during viral infection.Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4: 914-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we next determined whether miR-218 could modify innate immune response pathways of type I IFN. PAMs were treated with miR-218 mimic for 24 h, and cells were then collected for detecting the transcriptional levels of IFN-β and several ISGs. The results showed that the mRNA levels of IFN-β and several ISGs including ISG15, 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL), GBP1, IFIT1, and IFITM3 were increased in the presence of miR-218 mimic compared with the negative control (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that miR-218 regulates PRRSV replication through modulating type I IFN response. To explore the molecular mechanism by which miR-218 regulates type I IFN response, TargetScan and miRDB were used to determine the potential target gene of miR-218. One putative binding site for miR-218 was identified in the 3’UTR of porcine suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a critical regulator of infection and inflammation (33Carow B. Rottenberg M.E. SOCS3, a Major regulator of infection and inflammation.Front Immunol. 2014; 5: 58Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The pairing region between the miR-218 seed sequence and SOCS3 3'UTR seed binding site was shown in Figure 4A. To validate the direct association between SOCS3 and miR-218, a region of SOCS3 3'UTR containing the predicted target site of miR-218 was cloned into a dual-luciferase reporter vector pmirGLO, and the same 3'UTR region with mutations in the seed binding site was also constructed into the same vector to obtain the mutant plasmid (Supplementary material S1). HEK-293 T cells were cotransfected with each of an empty vector, wild-type SOCS3 3'UTR plasmid or mutant plasmid in the presence of miR-218 mimic or miRNA negative control for 48 h. The results showed that miR-218 mimic significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of wild-type SOCS3 3'UTR plasmid-transfected cells relative to miRNA control. In contrast, transfection with mutant SOCS3 3'UTR abolished the inhibition effect of miR-218 mimic on the luciferase activity (Fig. 4B), suggesting that miR-218 can directly interact with SOCS3 3’UTR. To further verify the regulatory effect of miR-218 on SOCS3, PAMs were transfected with miR-218 mimic for 24 h and 48 h, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of SOCS3 were determined. The qPCR results showed that SOCS3 mRNA level was significantly reduced following the transfection with miR-218 mimic (Fig. 4C). Western blot analysis also revealed that treatment with miR-218 mimic markedly reduced SOCS3 protein expression (Fig. 4D). These data demonstrate that miR-218 negatively regulates SOCS3 expression at the transcriptional level by targeting SOCS3 3’UTR. Next, we determined whether there is a correlation between miR-218 and SOCS3 during PRRSV infection in vitro and in vivo. After incubating PAMs with mock or PRRSV for different time points, the expression levels of miR-218 and SOCS3 were assessed by qPCR. As shown in Figure 4E, the expression levels of miR-218 decreased within 24 hpi. Whereas the expression levels of SOCS3 significantly increased at 6 hpi and reached a peak at 24 hpi. These results suggest that the expression of SOCS3 is negatively correlated with miR-218 during PRRSV infection in vitro. To confirm the in vitro data, in vivo samples were also examined. Total RNA was extracted from the lung of pigs that were inoculated with mock, vaccine strain HuN4-F112, and HP-PRRSV strain HuN4 for 21 days as previously described (28Tian Z.J. An T.Q. Zhou Y.J. Peng J.M. Hu S.P. Wei T.C. Jiang Y.F. Xiao Y. Tong G.Z. An attenuated live vaccine based on highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) protects piglets against HP-PRRS.Vet. Microbiol. 2009; 138: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The expression levels of miR-218 and SOCS3 were determined by qPCR. The levels of miR-218 were significantly lower in HuN4-inoculated pigs compared with mock controls and HuN4-F112 pigs. On the contrary, infection by HuN4 resulted in an increase in SOCS3 expression levels in comparison with the control group or HuN4-F112 group (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that virus-induced miR-218 downregulation leads to an increase of SOCS3 expression, which might impair the antiviral response to facilitate PRRSV replication. Moreover, the effect of SOCS3 on PRRSV replication was investigated using genetic modification methods. The SOCS3 mRNA level in PAMs transfected with SOCS3-specific siRNA was significantly decreased relative to control siRNA. Western blot analysis of detergent lysates collected from cells transfected with SOCS3 siRNA also revealed a clear reduction in the level of SOCS3 protein (Fig. 5A). At 24 h post siRNA transfection, PAMs were inoculated with PRRSV for an additional 24 h. We observed that the viral RNA levels were greatly decreased in the SOCS3-specific transfection group compared with the control siRNA group (Fig. 5B). Knockdown of endogenous SOCS3 with siRNA also reduced virus titer as measured by TCID50 assay (Fig. 5C). To confirm siRNA data, another SOCS3-specific siRNA was introduced to repeat the above experiments. The results showed that the SOCS3 siRNA resulted in the decrease of virus RNA level and titers (Fig. S2). To further confirm the effect of SOCS3 on PRRSV replication, we tried to overexpress SOCS3 in primary PAMs, but the expression level of SOCS3 was not detectable (data not shown), which might be due to low transfection efficiency. Therefore, the immortalized PAMs were used to overexpress SOCS3, and the cells were then infected with PRRSV. Western blot analysis confirmed that SOCS3 was overexpressed successfully in the immortalized PAMs (Fig. 5D). As shown in Figure 5E, SOCS3 overexpression increased the levels of viral RNA in contrast to the vector control. TCID50 assay results confirmed the positive effect of SOCS3 overexpression on virus titer in comparison with the vector control (Fig. 5F). These data indicate that SOCS3 negatively regulates PRRSV replication. Since miR-218 negatively regulates type I IFN response, we assessed the effect of SOCS3 on the signaling pathway of type I IFN by modifying SOCS3 expression in PAMs. Here, the mRNA levels of IFN-β and several ISGs including ISG15, OASL, and GBP1 were analyzed by qPCR. The results showed that depletion of endogenous SOCS3 expression significantly enhanced the mRNA levels of IFN-β and three ISGs, ISG15, OASL, and GBP1, in contrast to the control siRNA treatment (Figs. 5G and S3). To confirm the effect of SOCS3 on type I IFN signaling pathway, the immortalized PAMs were transfected with a eukaryotic expression plasmid containing SOCS3 and followed by IFN-β stimulation. We observed that the mRNA levels of IFN-β, ISG15, OASL, and GBP1 were significantly decreased in SOCS3 transfection group compared with the control group (Fig. 5H). Overall, these findings suggest that PRRSV induced-miR-218 downregulation upregulates SOCS3 expression, which may serve as a negative regulator of type I IFN response to promote PRRSV replication. To elucidate the role of SOCS3 in the antiviral function of miR-218, we carried out miR-218 and SOCS3 RNA interference knockdown experiments. We confirmed that inhibition of miR-218 effectively promoted PRRSV replication in PAMs, as shown by viral RNA and virus titer. Whereas depletion of SOCS3 by specific siRNA remarkably suppressed PRRSV replication (Fig. 6, A and B). When the miR-218 was inhibited by its inhibitor in SOCS3-depleted cells, the increase of both viral RNA and virus titer by miR-218 inhibitor was blocked by the depletion of SOCS3 expression (Fig. 6, A and B). These results indicate that SOCS3 is beneficial for PRRSV replication, and the virus-induced miR-218 downregulation impairs the host antiviral response through the SOCS3-mediated signaling pathway. To verify the negative regulation of PRRSV replication by miR-218, we examined the antiviral effect of miR-218 in Marc-145 cells. Marc-145 cells were transfected with miR-218 inhibitor for 24 h, and cells were then infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. Cell monolayers were fixed for IFA analysis, and we observed notably more PRRSV-positive cells with miR-218 inhibitor than the control group (Fig. 7A). The levels of viral RNA were increased in miR-218 inhibitor-treated group compared with the control group (Fig. 7B). Transfection with miR-218 inhibitor consequently augmented viral titers as measured by TCID50 (Fig. 7C). Similarly, when Marc-145 cells were transfected with miR-218 mimic, the number of PRRSV-positive cells was lower in miR-218 mimic-treated cells than in control-treated cells (Fig. 7D). The viral RNA levels were significantly decreased with miR-218 mimic treatment (Fig. 7E), and the reduced titers of virus in infected cell cultures containing miR-218 mimic were confirmed by measuring TCID50 (Fig. 7F). These data indicate that suppression of PRRSV replication by miR-218 in Marc-145 cells is consistent with that in PAMs, suggesting that the evolutionarily conserved miR-218 might have a similar function in antiviral effect in different cell lines. Next, we evaluated the antiviral effect of the evolutionarily conserved miR-218 in two other members of the order Nidovirales, PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus) and TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus). Vero E6 cells were transfected with miR-218 mimic for 24 h, and cells were then inoculated with PEDV at an MOI of 0.1 for another 24 h. Cells and supernatant were harvested for detecting viral RNA levels by qPCR and viral titers by TCID50 respectively. The results showed that overexpression of miR-218 significantly inhibited PEDV replication as indicated by RNA levels and viral titers (Fig. 7G). ST cells were also treated with miR-218 mimic as above, and cells were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. As shown in Figure 7H, miR-218 overexpression also reduced TGEV loads as measured by qPCR and TCID50. These results indicate that the evolutionarily conserved miR-218 may have a broad-spectrum antiviral property. The first line of host defense against viruses is the innate immune system, in which IFNs are glycoproteins with strong antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. The published data suggest that PRRSV is susceptible to IFNs in vivo and in vitro (34Brockmeier S.L. Loving C.L. Eberle K.C. Hau S.J. Buckley A. Van Geelen A. Montiel N.A. Nicholson T. Lager K.M.

Despite this, its effects on the long-term health of the brain in offspring are largely unknown. Here, we investigated in rats whether hypoxic pregnancy affects brain structure and function in the adult offspring and explored underlying mechanisms with maternal antioxidant intervention. Pregnant rats were randomly chosen for normoxic or hypoxic (13% oxygen) pregnancy with or without maternal supplementation with vitamin C in their drinking water. In one cohort, the placenta and fetal tissues were collected at the end of gestation. In another, dams were allowed to deliver naturally, and offspring were reared under normoxic conditions until 4 months of age (young adult). Between 3.5 and 4 months, the behavior, cognition and brains of the adult offspring were studied. We demonstrated that prenatal hypoxia reduced neuronal number, as well as vascular and synaptic density, in the hippocampus, significantly impairing memory function in the adult offspring. These adverse effects of prenatal hypoxia were independent of the hypoxic pregnancy inducing fetal growth restriction or elevations in maternal or fetal plasma glucocorticoid levels. Maternal vitamin C supplementation during hypoxic pregnancy protected against oxidative stress in the placenta and prevented the adverse effects of prenatal hypoxia on hippocampal atrophy and memory loss in the adult offspring. Therefore, these data provide a link between prenatal hypoxia, placental oxidative stress, and offspring brain health in later life, providing insight into mechanism and identifying a therapeutic strategy."

We studied 32 patients treated with radiotherapy plus capecitabine concomitant chemotherapy and 48 control subjects. We identified pre-NRCT PON1 and α-ketoglutarate as the parameters that best discriminated between RC patients and the control group. Receiver operating characteristics analysis of the combination of the two parameters showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.918. Moreover, patients who presented a pathological complete response (pCR) to treatment had lower plasma pre-NRCT valine concentrations (AUC of 0.826). Patients who had a relapse had lower concentrations of succinate (AUC of 0.833). The results of the present study illustrate the usefulness of investigating alterations in oxidative stress and metabolism in RC. Due to the small number of patients studied, our results must be considered preliminary, but they suggest that the determination of circulating levels of PON1 and α-ketoglutarate might be a valuable tool for the early diagnosis of RC, while the determination of valine and succinate might effectively predict pCR and the appearance of relapse."

In this study, we investigated whether increasing social presence during writing explanations would aid learning. University students ( N = 137) read an instructional text about immunology; their subsequent task depended on experimental condition. Students either explained the contents to a fictitious peer orally, wrote their explanations in a text editor, or wrote them in a messenger chat, which was assumed to induce higher levels of social presence. A control group retrieved the material. Surprisingly, we did not obtain any differences in learning outcomes between experimental conditions. Interestingly, explaining was more effortful, enjoyable, and interesting than retrieving. This study shows that solely inducing social presence does not improve learning from writing explanations. More importantly, the findings underscore the importance of cognitive and motivational conditions during learning activities."
https://openalex.org/W3153176235,"The quantitative relationship between the spatial variation of building’s height and the associated land surface temperature (LST) change in six Chinese megacities is investigated in this paper. The six cities involved are Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Based on both remote sensing and building footprint data, we retrieved the LST using a single-channel (SC) algorithm and evaluate the heating/cooling effect caused by building-height difference via correlation analysis. The results show that the spatial distribution of high-rise buildings is mainly concentrated in the center business districts, riverside zones, and newly built-up areas of the six megacities. In the urban area, the number and the floor-area ratio of high to super high-rise buildings (&gt;24m) account for over 5% and 4.74%, respectively. Being highly urbanized cities, most of urban areas in the six megacities are associated with high LST. Ninety-nine percent of the city areas of Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Tianjin are covered by the LST in the range of 30.2~67.8°C, 34.8~50.4°C, 25.3~48.3°C, 29.9~47.2°C, 27.4~43.4°C, and 33.0~48.0°C, respectively. Building’s height and LST have a negative logarithmic correlation with the correlation coefficients ranging from -0.701 to -0.853. In the building’s height within range of 0~66m, the LST will decrease significantly with the increase of building’s height. This indicates that the increase of building’s height will bring a significant cooling effect in this height range. When the building’s height exceeds 66m, its effect on LST will be greatly weakened. This is due to the influence of building shadows, local wind disturbances, and the layout of buildings."

Methods This retrospective study included cancer patients without HIV and with diagnosis of PJP admitted in a cancer referral centre, from January-1-2010 to March-31-2017. We compared 30-day and 1-year mortality rate, change in the respiratory item of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score(SOFA- resp worsening), use of tracheal intubation between day-1 and day-5 of anti-pneumocystis therapy and occurrence of coinfections between patients with EACST and those with no or late corticosteroid therapy, using an inverse probability weighting propensity score-based (IPW) analysis. Results 133 non-HIV oncology or haematology PJP patients were included (EACST n = 58, others n = 75). The main underlying conditions were haematological malignancies (n = 107, 80,5%), solid tumour (n = 27, 20,3%) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 17, 12,8%). Overall 30-day and 1-year mortality rate was 24,1% and 56,4%, respectively. IPW analysis found no difference on 30-day (HR = 1.45, 95% CI [0.7–3.04], p = 0.321) and 1-year (HR = 1.25, CI 95% [0.75–2.09], p = 0.39) mortality rate between groups. Conclusion No difference in SOFA- resp worsening, tracheal intubation and coinfections was found between groups. Combination of EACST with anti-pneumocystis therapy in non-HIV onco-haematology PJP-patients was not associated with clinical improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3154801377,"The Covid-19 disease has caused a world-wide pandemic with more than 60 million positive cases and more than 1.4 million deaths by the end of November 2020. As long as effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine as well as far-reaching shutdowns of economic activity and public life are the only available strategies to prevent the virus from spreading. These interventions must meet conflicting requirements where some objectives, like the minimization of disease-related deaths or the impact on health systems, demand for stronger counter-measures, while others, such as social and economic costs, call for weaker counter-measures. Therefore, finding the optimal compromise of counter-measures requires the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is based on accurate prediction of future infection spreading for all combinations of counter-measures under consideration. We present a strategy for construction and solution of such a multi-objective optimization problem with real-world applicability. The strategy is based on a micro-model allowing for accurate prediction via a realistic combination of person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and disease progression models including micro-level inclusion of governmental intervention strategies. For this micro-model, a surrogate macro-model is constructed and validated that is much less computationally expensive and can therefore be used in the core of a numerical solver for the multi-objective optimization problem. The resulting set of optimal compromises between counter-measures (Pareto front) is discussed and its meaning for policy decisions is outlined."
https://openalex.org/W3155442362,"Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plants, but also a limited resource worldwide. Strict regulations for fertilizer applications in the European Union are a consequence of the negative environmental effects in case of improper use. Maize is typically grown with the application of P starter fertilizer, which, however, might be reduced or even omitted if suitable varieties were available. This study was performed with the 20 commercially most important maize hybrids in Germany evaluated in multi-location field trials with the aim to investigate the potential to breed for high-performing maize hybrids under reduced P starter fertilizer. At the core location, three starter fertilizers with either phosphate (triple superphosphate, TSP), ammonium nitrate (calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN), or a combination of ammonium and phosphate (diammonium phosphate, DAP) were evaluated relative to a control and traits from youth development to grain yield were assessed. Significant differences were mainly observed for the DAP starter fertilizer, which was also reflected in a yield increase of on average +0.67 t/ha (+5.34%) compared to the control. Correlations among the investigated traits varied with starter fertilizer, but the general trends remained. As expected, grain yield was negatively correlated with grain P concentration, likely due to a dilution effect. Importantly, the genotype-by-starter fertilizer interaction was always non-significant in the multi-location analysis. This indicates that best performing genotypes can be identified irrespective of the starter fertilizer.

EG prepared using different gelling agents and processing conditions were used as pork back fat alternate in the CFS. From the results, physical, chemical and microstructural qualities of CFS were governed by the type of EG incorporated. Regarding the overall quality, CFS formulated with carrageenan-EG was classified as an optimal formula. CFS added with carrageenan-EG showed a superior oxidative stability, color preservation, and water holding capacity compared to the control during vacuum packaged storage at room temperature for 20 days. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and microbial quality of both formulae remained in the acceptable level (TBARS &lt; 1 mg/kg and total plate count &lt; 4 log CFU/g) throughout the storage. Therefore, the carrageenan based EG substitution for pork back fat is a promising avenue for the production of the CFS where a high saturated animal fat was substituted by vegetable oil."
https://openalex.org/W3156683144,"Accurate translation termination in bacteria requires correct recognition of the stop codons by the class-I release factors (RFs) RF1 and RF2, which release the nascent peptide from the peptidyl tRNA after undergoing a compact to open conformational transition. These RFs possess a conserved Gly-Gly-Gln (GGQ) peptide release motif, of which the Q residue is posttranslationally methylated. GGQ-methylated RFs have been shown to be faster in peptide release than the unmethylated ones, but it was unknown whether this modification had additional roles. Using a fluorescence-based real-time in vitro translation termination assay in a stopped-flow instrument, we demonstrate that methylated RF1 and RF2 are two- to four-fold more accurate in the cognate stop codon recognition than their unmethylated variants. Using pH titration, we show that the lack of GGQ methylation facilitates the compact to open transition, which results in compromised accuracy of the unmethylated RFs. Furthermore, thermal melting studies using circular dichroism and SYPRO-orange fluorescence demonstrate that GGQ methylation increases overall stability of the RF proteins. This increased stability, we suspect, is the basis for the more controlled conformational change of the methylated RFs upon codon recognition, which enhances both their speed and accuracy. This GGQ methylation-based modulation of the accuracy of RFs can be a tool for regulating translational termination in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3153278749,"Purpose To evaluate the structure and function of meibomian glands in patients with thyroid related orbitopathy (TRO) compared with age- and sex-matched controls without TRO. Methods This cross-sectional study included 106 eyes of 53 patients with TRO and 106 eyes of 53 age- and sex-matched controls without TRO. Patients with TRO were assessed for thyroid hormone status, activity and severity of TRO. All participants completed OSDI questionnaires. Their meibomian glands’ structure and function were assessed, including the area of meibomian gland dropout, lipid layer thickness (LLT), meibum expressibility and quality scores, tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining scores. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to compare between the two groups. The correlations between the area of meibomian gland dropout with symptoms and signs of TRO were evaluated using GEE and Spearman correlation. Results All patients with TRO had inactive status. The mean area of meibomian gland dropout was higher in the TRO group (34.5±11.2%) compared with that of controls (30.1±10.7%, P = 0.03). Both mean meibum quality (TRO, 1.6±0.7; Controls, 2.0 ±0.5) and expressibility (TRO, 1.5 ±0.7; Controls, 1.7 ±0.6) scores were slightly better in the TRO group compared with those of controls (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in OSDI, corneal and conjunctival staining, TBUT and LLT. The area of meibomian gland dropout in patients with TRO was correlated with euthyroid status (P&lt;0.05) and lagophthalmos (P = 0.03). Conclusions Patients with inactive TRO showed significantly higher meibomian gland dropout compared with that of age- and sex-matched controls without TRO."
https://openalex.org/W3154468880,"MtsZ is a molybdenum-containing methionine sulfoxide reductase that supports virulence in the human respiratory pathogen Haemophilus influenzae (Hi). HiMtsZ belongs to a group of structurally and spectroscopically uncharacterized S-/N-oxide reductases, all of which are found in bacterial pathogens. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of HiMtsZ, which reveals that the HiMtsZ substrate-binding site encompasses a previously unrecognized part that accommodates the methionine sulfoxide side chain via interaction with His182 and Arg166. Charge and amino acid composition of this side chain-binding region vary and, as indicated by electrochemical, kinetic, and docking studies, could explain the diverse substrate specificity seen in closely related enzymes of this type. The HiMtsZ Mo active site has an underlying structural flexibility, where dissociation of the central Ser187 ligand affected catalysis at low pH. Unexpectedly, the two main HiMtsZ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) species resembled not only a related dimethyl sulfoxide reductase but also a structurally unrelated nitrate reductase that possesses an Asp-Mo ligand. This suggests that contrary to current views, the geometry of the Mo center and its primary ligands, rather than the specific amino acid environment, is the main determinant of the EPR properties of mononuclear Mo enzymes. The flexibility in the electronic structure of the Mo centers is also apparent in two of three HiMtsZ EPR-active Mo(V) species being catalytically incompetent off-pathway forms that could not be fully oxidized."

A year ago, when I first contemplated writing this article, my intent was to provide a detailed review of the contributions of the diverse community of talented scientists in my lab to the nuclear receptor research field. In the throes of a deadly pandemic, political turmoil, and Black Lives Matter, however, I found myself compelled to tell a more personal story. While I will still cover milestones in our understanding of the intracellular trafficking of the thyroid hormone receptor, now these will be set against the backdrop of my path as a woman in STEM and on being intentionally inclusive. By sharing reflections on my journey, I hope to encourage young investigators to persist in their pursuit of a career in science. Due to COVID-19 and the cancellation of ASBMB 2020, my acceptance of the 2020 Ruth Kirschstein Diversity in Science Award was deferred to 2021. I have now had a year to reflect on this humbling honor in the midst of chaotic times, filled with grief, fear, and division. My impact on the world at first glance seems akin to tiny ripples in a small pond, but as I think about the colleagues and students whose scientific careers I’ve encouraged and cultivated, I realize that those tiny ripples have set in motion forces of great consequence. If I am a ripple, my colleague, Dr Shantá D. Hinton is a surging wave. What are the characteristics of a successful scientist? I can think of many words—intelligent, courageous, persistent, and full of initiative. Notably absent from my list are descriptors alluding to differences across socially constructed identities, such as race, ethnicity, nationality, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, or socioeconomic background. It is abundantly clear that no scientific evidence exists to suggest that scientific potential and talent differentially segregate across these social identities. But if we are not part of the majority, “getting there” can be a daily obstacle course fraught with inequity and microaggression. Systemic racism takes its toll. Negative stereotypes about Black, Indigenous, and People of Color continue to be perpetuated. Sexist and anti-LBGTQ+ attitudes are pervasive. By sharing my unique path, I hope to encourage anyone starting out in science—who wonders if they belong—to persist. The year I was born, Dr Martin Luther King, Jr wrote “True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice” (1King Jr., M.L. Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story. Harper & Brothers., New York, NY1958Google Scholar). Through their actions, my parents taught me about justice, kindness, dignity, and respect, but they also passed on a heavy dose of low self-esteem and humility to a fault. My older sister and I were raised in a very traditional household, until my parents divorced when I was 16. My father was a high school chemistry teacher and my mother a homemaker. My father’s view was that girls should be educated so that they would be good mothers in the future. Not surprisingly, rather than a chemistry set, my first memorable gift was a kitchen play set, complete with a toaster and plastic waffles (Fig. 1). My early childhood experiences shaped important parts of me. Cooking, baking, and exploring the cuisine of different cultures remain a source of pleasure and comfort, providing a point of connection with others, a way of offering thanks, appreciation, or condolences when words may not suffice. Exploration and travel also figured prominently in my childhood. I grew up in Bellingham, Washington, sandwiched between Puget Sound and the North Cascades. When I wasn’t reading, I spent much of my time outside, catching frogs in our creek, hiking, biking, canoeing, swimming, and planning family trips. Money was tight, so those early trips were limited to where we could get by station wagon. My fascination with travel and exploration of the world around me shaped my ultimate research career, focusing on travels in the cellular world and the diversity of pathways into and out of the nucleus. As a child and teenager, I felt most at home in school, although I didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up. On different days of the week I wanted to be a writer, a concert pianist, an Olympic athlete, an astrophysicist, an actress, and much later a biologist. I was the first woman in my immediate family to attend college, and as a pioneer in that way, it was only fitting to embark on my academic journey in Alaska, the last frontier. The University of Alaska-Fairbanks served as an ideal place to study biology as an undergraduate and then as a master’s student. When I started graduate school first in Alaska, and then as a PhD student at the University of Washington in the 1980s, it was a time when few women were high-ranking academic scientists. Without female role models, it was my male academic and research mentors, Drs L. Gerard Swartz and Gerald Shields, who saw a potential in me that I didn’t know I had and pointed me on the path to becoming a professor. Driving around Alaska collecting black fly larvae from streams and analyzing their polytene chromosomes during the long, dark winters solidified my passion for research. I had assumed I would continue combining molecular biology with field work, but as a PhD student I found myself drawn to the intricacies of the molecular world and began exploring the intracellular trafficking of 5S ribosomal RNA in Xenopus oocytes in the lab of Dr Aimee Hayes Bakken. This same research area—traffic control in cells—provided a launching pad for my independent career, starting in 1989 as a Lecturer and later a Senior Lecturer at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. Bypassing traditional postdoctoral training made for a wobbly foundation, in which I always felt like I was playing catch-up, but I thrived on being in charge of a lab of my own, an aspect of academic life that appealed early on and that I still relish. As a bench-scientist in a spectacular country, I satisfied my love of the outdoors by volunteering as often as possible to assist colleagues in banding Little Blue Penguins or tracking wetas at night. The next phase of my journey found me leaving New Zealand in 1997 to take a faculty position at William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, where I continued my work on travels in the cellular world using the thyroid hormone receptors as a model system, earning tenure and promotion to full professor along the way. I have been fortunate over the years to work in my lab with an incredibly talented array of developing scientists from many different backgrounds and social identities, with over 150 undergraduates, 13 Master’s students, five PhD students, two postdoctoral fellows, and five visiting scientists. I thrive on the intellectual stimulation, innovation, and inspiration that comes from their diverse perspectives. As I relate some milestones in our understanding of thyroid hormone receptor intracellular trafficking, always underpinning the science are the people who made this work possible. A member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the thyroid hormone receptors, including the major subtypes TRα1, TRβ1, and TRβ2, are both intracellular receptors and transcription factors that act as both repressors and activators of their target genes in response to thyroid hormone. As such, they are able to bypass the complex second messenger signaling pathways and phosphorylation cascades of cell surface receptors. At the time I entered the nuclear receptor field, the long-standing dogma was that thyroid hormone receptors reside solely in the nucleus tightly bound to DNA. I began with a simple quest to identify nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs in TRα1 and to determine with which importins it interacted, while traveling from its site of synthesis on cytosolic ribosomes, through the nuclear pore complexes into the nucleus. As is often the case in science, the quest turned out not to be so simple. In 2001, work begun by my last doctoral student in New Zealand and completed by my newly established team of undergraduates at William & Mary, revealed that TRα1 shuttles rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm (2Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the thyroid hormone receptor α.Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 512-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This finding launched my lab into a relatively unexplored aspect of thyroid hormone receptor function that has turned out to be a fascinating journey with many unexpected twists and turns. Soon thereafter, another team of students showed that phosphorylation of TRα1 is compartment-specific and plays a role in nuclear retention, suggesting that multiple factors contribute to thyroid hormone receptor shuttling dynamics (3Nicoll J.B. Gwinn B.L. Iwig J.S. Garcia P.P. Bunn C.F. Allison L.A. Compartment-specific phosphorylation of rat thyroid hormone receptor α1 regulates nuclear localization and retention.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003; 205: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, we discovered that dominant negative thyroid hormone receptor mutants, including v-ErbA, the highly mutated viral oncogenic homolog of TRα1, localize to both nuclear and cytosolic compartments and display altered transport activity (2Bunn C.F. Neidig J.A. Freidinger K.E. Stankiewicz T.A. Weaver B.S. McGrew J. Allison L.A. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the thyroid hormone receptor α.Mol.

Prior to our work on the oncoprotein v-ErbA, its dominant negative activity was attributed to competition with TRα1 for thyroid hormone responsive elements (TREs) and auxiliary factors involved in transcriptional regulation. Our studies defined a new mode of action of v-ErbA via subcellular mislocalization. Undergraduates and graduate students in my lab, along with students and visiting faculty from Hampton University, a local HBCU, collaborated to show that the v-ErbA oncoprotein is highly mobile and traffics between the nucleus, cytoplasm, and aggresome. These findings led us to propose that disease-causing mutations target intracellular trafficking of the thyroid hormone receptors (4Bonamy G.M. Allison L.A.

Horm. 2018; 106: 45-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Recent work spearheaded by a team of William & Mary undergraduates has shown that mutations in TRα1 that are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and thyroid cancer, lead to striking shifts toward a more cytoplasmic localization for many of the mutants and an increased tendency to form cytosolic and nuclear aggregates (https://www.kenzpub.com/journals/nurr/inpress/2020/101453/). Upon discovery that thyroid hormone receptors follow an elaborate pathway within cells, we shifted our focus from nuclear import alone to characterizing their nuclear export pathway, completing a comprehensive, systematic characterization of their multiple NLSs and nuclear export signals (NESs), and the multiple transport pathways that mediate nuclear entry and exit (Fig. 2). Mutagenesis studies on an NES in helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain pointed to the intriguing possibility that altered shuttling of TRα1 may be a contributing factor in Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) syndrome, providing further support for our model that intracellular mislocalization of thyroid hormone receptors is an important factor to consider in pathogenesis (https://www.kenzpub.com/journals/nurr/inpress/2020/101453/) (8Zhang J.

Our attention has now shifted to examining the multifaceted factors impacting nuclear retention and intranuclear mobility of the thyroid hormone receptors, including interactions with Mediator (15Femia M.R. Evans R.M. Zhang J. Sun X. Lebegue C.J. Roggero V.R. Allison L.A. Mediator subunit MED1 modulates intranuclear dynamics of the thyroid hormone receptor.J. Cell.

Acetylation modulates thyroid hormone receptor intracellular localization and intranuclear mobility.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2019; 495: 110509Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Another team of master’s students and undergraduates demonstrated that mediator subunits MED1, and to a lesser extent MED13, promote nuclear retention of TRα1 and TRβ1 by altering intranuclear dynamics, highlighting how helix 12 in the ligand-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptors modulates both gene transactivation and nuclear export (15Femia M.R. Evans R.M. Zhang J. Sun X. Lebegue C.J. Roggero V.R. Allison L.A. Mediator subunit MED1 modulates intranuclear dynamics of the thyroid hormone receptor.J. Cell. Biochem. 2020; 121: 2909-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Given the proximity of known thyroid hormone receptor acetylation sites to NLS motifs, we next investigated their role in regulating intracellular localization. Here, the driving force behind the “we” was Cyril Anyetei-Anum, first an undergraduate in my lab and then a master’s student, who found his life’s passion and is now pursuing a PhD at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Cyril’s work revealed that while TRα1 and TRβ1 nonacetylation mimics display wild-type distributions, the acetylation mimics were significantly more cytosolic. In addition, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed wild-type intranuclear dynamics of acetylation mimic thyroid hormone receptors, whereas the nonacetylation mimics had significantly reduced mobility and transcriptional activity, further suggesting that nonacetylation correlates with nuclear retention, while acetylation promotes cytosolic localization. Based on these findings, Cyril proposed a novel model in which acetylation acts as a regulatory switch for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the thyroid hormone receptors (see Fig. 2). Our ongoing studies led by a new team of undergraduates and master’s students are investigating the underpinning mechanism of this acetylation switch. Through long hours at the bench, together, we have increased our knowledge of how thyroid hormone receptors “get there” (to the nucleus), but the biological significance of their shuttling remains a puzzle to solve. These discoveries are rewarding and exhilarating, but equally rewarding is being in a position to create opportunities for young investigators to succeed in science. Early on in my career, I become aware that I was often viewed first as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed woman and second, as a scientist; and the bar was noticeably higher when my accomplishments were judged. It is easy to feel like an outsider, or an imposter, when spoken or upspoken, “not bad for a girl” suffuses the air. I did not become preoccupied with how I was viewed or let this discourage me. Rather, this awareness simply added to my motivation to flourish as a scientist and to maintain my own dynamic, externally funded lab. In this way, I can maintain a welcoming, inclusive space that enables each student or colleague to access the resources they need in order to thrive as scientists. As the Chair of the Biology Department, from 2009 to 2014, and the first woman to hold this leadership position, I dove in with energy and a vision for change. In my first year, I used my connections to orchestrate the recruitment of the first faculty member of color in the natural sciences at William & Mary. Filled with my usual optimism and positivity, I was blindsided by the personal costs involved in forcing change. When I had to acknowledge that there are colleagues who subconsciously or consciously struggle to affirm that people of darker pigmentation are intelligent and qualified scientific colleagues, a part of my spirit was crushed. Having always been comfortable in my interactions with people from diverse backgrounds, I found myself confused and disappointed. As I stood by my new colleague, a gifted scientist and rising star in her field, I shared her frustration at having grant after grant application rejected for years before she finally succeeded. There was no denying that racial bias by funding panels (16Stevens K.R. Masters K.S. Imoukhuede P.I. Haynes K.A. Setton L.A. Cosgriff-Hernandez E. Lediju Bell M.A. Rangamani P. Sakiyama-Elbert S.E.

Allen J.B. et al.Fund black scientists.Cell. 2021; 184: 561-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was part of the story. There was anguish and anger along the way, but we persisted and the payoff was tremendous. The message to young, underrepresented minority investigators: you belong in science. I have mentored students that would have succeeded in any lab, along with students that needed extra encouragement to show their true potential. It is these latter students that most benefit from my mentorship. These interactions are not one-sided. I, in turn, have had to grow as a mentor, adjusting my usual quiet, understated style to one with a stronger voice. There are conversations that no one should need to have. Like having to bluntly tell aspiring young Black investigators in my lab that to be validated as scientists, to have their voices heard, to be perceived as intellectual equals, they would have to work at least twice as hard as their white peers. Although unfair, this is the reality our nation has propagated. There is no room for mistakes in the lab or out on the street. The bottom line is that, as scientists, whatever our backgrounds or social identities, we all take joy in performing experiments and share the thrill of making novel discoveries. There is great satisfaction for me in cultivating talent and providing encouragement and opportunities for all scientists in the making, without arbitrary filters such as skin color, gender identity, or neurodiversity. Over the years, my lab has included people from backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented in science and those from backgrounds that are traditionally well represented. We have conversations together, we do better science together, we solve problems together from diverse perspectives, and we share meals together, or at least we did pre-COVID-19. Our conversations may not always be calm and graceful, but as long as we sit down together and keep talking, progress can be made. Our diversity enriches and stretches us. We are stronger and more creative. And, we have each other’s backs, as we navigate the daily obstacle course together as a community of scientists. I was a puzzle to my father until the end of his life in 2004 as he grappled with a daughter who was more like his version of a son. He was proud of me but confused by me. When I eventually married my husband 24 years ago, my father expressed concern about the impending loss to the scientific community, since he assumed that I would quit my career once married. He would be pleased that I am still employed, and would be proud of his grandson, a senior in high school who is taking AP Chemistry. Sadly, my mother died before my son was born, never seeing what she would have viewed as my greatest achievement. It is exhausting to live each day with fear, divisiveness, and incivility. So, in 2021, I will move forward with hope, finding joy in science and cultivating talent. I like to point out to my students that when it comes to identity, I am “mixed species”—a combination of Homo sapiens, Neanderthal, and Denisovan DNA. Near the end of each class I have taught, whether molecular genetics or introductory biology, I always read one of my favorite poems, Human Family by Maya Angelou, which ends with the refrain: “I note the obvious differences/between each sort and type/but we are more alike my friends,/than we are unalike.” The author declares that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article. I am grateful to Dr Shantá D. Hinton for all of our many conversations about science and life and for her insightful comments on drafts of this manuscript. I thank Vincent R. Roggero for his talent at turning my rough sketches into art.

https://openalex.org/W3154671529,"There is a continuous demand to improve monoclonal antibody production for medication supply and medical cost reduction. For over 20 years, recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells have been used as a host in monoclonal antibody production due to robustness, high productivity and ability to produce proteins with ideal glycans. Chemical compounds, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, lithium chloride, and butyric acid, have been shown to improve monoclonal antibody production in mammalian cell cultures. In this study, we aimed to discover new chemical compounds that can improve cell-specific antibody production in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells. Out of the 23,227 chemicals screened in this study, 4-(2,5-dimethyl-1 H -pyrrol-1-yl)- N -(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) benzamide was found to increase monoclonal antibody production. The compound suppressed cell growth and increased both cell-specific glucose uptake rate and the amount of intracellular adenosine triphosphate during monoclonal antibody production. In addition, the compound also suppressed the galactosylation on a monoclonal antibody, which is a critical quality attribute of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, the compound might also be used to control the level of the galactosylation for the N -linked glycans. Further, the structure-activity relationship study revealed that 2,5-dimethylpyrrole was the most effective partial structure of 4-(2,5-dimethyl-1 H -pyrrol-1-yl)- N -(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) benzamide on monoclonal antibody production. Further structural optimization of 2,5-dimethylpyrrole derivatives could lead to improved production and quality control of monoclonal antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W3155006823,"Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare cancer that develops from soft tissues in any part of the body. Despite major advances in the treatment of STS, patients are often refractory to conventional radiotherapy, leading to poor prognosis. Enhancement of sensitivity to radiotherapy would therefore improve the clinical outcome of STS patients. We previously revealed that the tumor-specific, replication-competent oncolytic adenovirus OBP-301 kills human sarcoma cells. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitizing effect of OBP-301 in human STS cells. The in vitro antitumor effect of OBP-301 and ionizing radiation in monotherapy or combination therapy was assessed using highly radiosensitive (RD-ES and SK-ES-1) and moderately radiosensitive (HT1080 and NMS-2) STS cell lines. The expression of markers for apoptosis and DNA damage were evaluated in STS cells after treatment. The therapeutic potential of combination therapy was further analyzed using SK-ES-1 and HT1080 cells in subcutaneous xenograft tumor models. The combination of OBP-301 and ionizing radiation showed a synergistic antitumor effect in all human STS cell lines tested, including those that show different radiosensitivity. OBP-301 was found to enhance irradiation-induced apoptosis and DNA damage via suppression of anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), which was expressed at higher levels in moderately radiosensitive cell lines. The combination of OBP-301 and ionizing radiation showed a more profound antitumor effect compared to monotherapy in SK-ES-1 (highly radiosensitive) and HT1080 (moderately radiosensitive) subcutaneous xenograft tumors. OBP-301 is a promising antitumor reagent to improve the therapeutic potential of radiotherapy by increasing radiation-induced apoptosis in STS."
https://openalex.org/W3155482839,"Tacrolimus (Tac) is an effective remission inducer of refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). Gene polymorphisms result in interindividual variability in Tac pharmacokinetics. In this study, we aimed to examine the relationships between gene polymorphisms and the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic effects of Tac in patients with UC. Forty-five patients with moderate-to-severe refractory UC treated with Tac were retrospectively enrolled. Genotyping for cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4*1G , CYP3A5*3 , CYP2C19*2 , CYP2C19*3 , nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 ( NR1I2 ) –25385C&gt;T , ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 2 ( ABCC2 ) –24C&gt;T , ABCC2 1249G&gt;A , and ABCC2 3972C&gt;T was performed. Concentration/dose (C/D) ratio, clinical therapeutic effects, and adverse events were evaluated. The C/D ratio of Tac in UC patients with the CYP3A4*1G allele was statistically lower than in those with the CYP3A4*1 /* 1 allele (P = 0.005) and significantly lower in patients with CYP3A5*3 /* 3 than in those with CYP3A5*1 (P &lt; 0.001). Among patients with the CYP3A4*1G allele, the C/D ratio was significantly lower in patients with CYP3A5*1 than in those with CYP3A5*3 /* 3 (P = 0.001). Patients with the NR1I2–25385C/C genotype presented significantly more overall adverse events than those with the C/T or T/T genotype (P = 0.03). Although CYP3A4*1G and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms were related to Tac pharmacokinetics, CYP3A5 presented a stronger effect than CYP3A4 . The NR1I2–25385C/C genotype was related to the overall adverse events. The evaluation of these polymorphisms could be useful in the treatment of UC with Tac."
https://openalex.org/W3153525004,"Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that activation of STAT3 is crucial for the development and progression of gastric cancer. However, the role of STAT3 in neuronal related gene methylation in gastric cancer has never been explored. In this study, by using DNA methylation microarray, we identified a potential STAT3 target, C11orf87 , showing promoter hypomethylation in gastric cancer patients with lower STAT3 activation and AGS gastric cancer cell lines depleted with STAT3 activation. Although C11orf87 methylation is independent of its expression, ectopic expression of a constitutive activated STAT3 mutant upregulated its expression in gastric cancer cell line. Further bisulfite pyrosequencing demonstrated a progressive increase in DNA methylation of this target in patient tissues from gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, to gastric cancer. Intriguingly, patients with higher C11orf87 methylation was associated with better survival. Furthermore, hypermethylation of C11orf87 was also frequently observed in other GI cancers, as compared to their adjacent normal tissues. These results suggested that C11orf87 methylation may serve as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of GI cancers, including gastric cancer. We further postulated that constitutive activation of STAT3 might be able to epigenetically silence C11orf87 as a possible negative feedback mechanism to protect the cells from the overactivation of STAT3. Targeted inhibition of STAT3 may not be appropriate in gastric cancer patients with promoter hypermethylation of C11orf87 ."

https://openalex.org/W3152973492,"There seemed to be no point in mentioning the possibility yet. I was a few years into my Ph.D., and I had just applied for a 3-month industry internship program. Starting even before I joined my supervisor's lab, I had been open with her about my interest in an industry career. She had always been supportive, including sharing her experience transitioning from biotech to academia. But I wasn't entirely sure she would be happy with the internship timing, which would mean taking a break from my Ph.D. during my final year. Anyway, I doubted that I would even get in. It didn't seem worth opening a potential can of worms for something that felt unlikely to happen.



> “Choosing your own path takes determination and resilience, but you don't have to do it alone.” 

Then, in January 2020, I was shocked and thrilled when I received word that my application was successful! But soon, things took a turn. I could have used my supervisor's help. Yet I still hesitated, feeling I needed to present her with a clean, confident proposal of my plans rather than lean on her for support.

The internship coordinators matched me to a company based on my experience and interests, and it seemed like a great fit at first. But after meeting with the CEO, I began to have second thoughts. The company wanted me to start in the spring. However, I was in the middle of critical experiments for two manuscripts and hoped to start a little later in the year to minimize the disruption to my Ph.D. Also, the company did not have a clear project for me, and I worried that I could end up doing busywork rather than getting an authentic industry research scientist experience.

I spent the next few weeks mulling over my options. Should I accept the offer, knowing I might not find any job satisfaction and that my Ph.D. could be derailed? Or should I gamble on finding an opportunity that was a better fit? The funds had to be used within 2020, so I would be racing against time to find another host company and get everything set up. Moreover, most of the companies from the selection pool were outside Oslo, where I live with my husband, and we did not want to live apart, having already been through that once before.

Ultimately, I rejected the original company's offer, cautiously optimistic that I would be able to find a new host in time that would be a better match. It was a big gamble, and it finally spurred me to face my fears and involve my supervisor. I worried that I would lose this opportunity, and my supervisor seemed to be the best person to help save it. Although I did not know how she would take the news, I mustered the courage to send her an email explaining my predicament.

I was surprised and relieved when I received her positive response. She didn't even question me about the late disclosure. She was happy for me to take a 3-month break. We had honest conversations and decided on a reasonable timetable that would make the transition back into my Ph.D. project as smooth as possible and wouldn't significantly delay my degree. Through her contacts, she also found three companies in Oslo that matched my interests, and ultimately I found a suitable host. In hindsight, I wish I had talked with her sooner.

In September 2020, I said goodbye for now to my academic colleagues and headed to industry. The internship gave me time away from the repetitive tasks of my Ph.D. and offered new challenges. It helped me appreciate that much about being a scientist is the same everywhere, and that the skills I had acquired during my Ph.D. were useful in industry. And I built valuable connections that could be helpful in the future. I'm now back in my Ph.D. lab, finishing up my thesis and scheduled to graduate just a few months later than if I had not done the internship.

The experience taught me that you have to push for what you need. Choosing your own path takes determination and resilience, but you don't have to do it alone. Be open with your mentors, and reach out for help."
https://openalex.org/W3153586187,"Introduction Hypertension is a leading risk factor for heart attack and stroke. Undiagnosed hypertension increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. The risk of hypertension is increased for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Diabetes self-management education (DSME) has been shown to be effective at improving clinical outcomes, including reducing blood pressure, but few studies have evaluated the effects of DSME for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. Methods This study examined the baseline prevalence of diagnosed hypertension and undiagnosed high blood pressure and differences in health care access between those with diagnosed hypertension versus undiagnosed high blood pressure. The sample consisted of 221 Marshallese adults with T2DM participating in a DSME randomized controlled trial in northwest Arkansas. The study also examined the effects of DSME interventions on participants’ blood pressure, comparing an Adapted-Family DSME with a Standard DSME. Results Nearly two-thirds of participants had blood pressure readings indicative of hypertension, and of those, over one-third were previously undiagnosed. The frequency of doctor visits was significantly lower for those with undiagnosed high blood pressure. There were no differences in health insurance coverage or forgone medical care between those with undiagnosed high blood pressure versus diagnosed hypertension. Across all participants, a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure occurred between baseline and post intervention, and a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure occurred between baseline and post-intervention, 6 months, and 12 months post-intervention. No differences were observed by study arm. Conclusion This study is the first to document the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension and undiagnosed high blood pressure, as well as the effects of DSME on blood pressure among a sample of Marshallese adults with T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3156615679,"José Manuel Baselga, renowned oncologist, died on 21 March at the age of 61 at his home in La Cerdanya, a beautiful Catalan county surrounded by the Spanish and French Pyrenees. Possibly the greatest drug developer of the past two decades, José was famous for, in his own words, “going to places and changing things.” Throughout his career, he transformed oncology practice and made the development of new treatments his mission. Born in Barcelona, Spain, on 3 July 1959, José was raised close to the Vall d'Hebron Hospital, an institution on which he would later leave his mark. He graduated from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona in 1982 with an MD and then fulfilled his military service duty before starting his residency at the Vall d'Hebron Hospital in 1985. With a year left in his residency, José moved to the United States to work at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. According to his sister Eulalia, he lived in a modest apartment with windows that would not close in winter, but the accommodations were good enough given that he was rarely home. José would spend his weekends and vacation time at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) running lab experiments. He then moved full time to MSK under the mentorship of oncologists John Mendelsohn and Larry Norton. Together, they worked on newly identified antibodies targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the predecessors of the anticancer therapies cetuximab, approved for the treatment of both colorectal and head and neck cancers, and trastuzumab, which drastically changed the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. His work at MSK also earned him a PhD from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona in 1992. In 1996, José returned to Vall d'Hebron Hospital with plans to implement the MSK research model, specifically the intermingling of basic science with translationally informed oncology practice. According to some at that time, he was making a mistake moving from one of the best cancer hospitals in the United States to an unknown public hospital in Spain with no tradition in oncology research. To prove his naysayers wrong, José focused on what would later become a recurring pattern in his leadership: hiring the best people. Many of those he hired and trained went on to leadership roles in the oncology community. José knew that he also needed laboratories for basic and translational research, so he convinced Joaquin Arribas, a senior postdoc from the MSK lab of Joan Massagué, to follow him and help transform an empty 70-m2 room in the middle of the oncology practice facilities into a top-notch research center. In just a few years, José put Barcelona and Vall d'Hebron Hospital on the cancer research map, building a bed-to-bench culture that we now call “precision medicine.” I met José in 2004 at Vall d'Hebron. After 40 minutes in his office, he offered me a job, but in typical fashion gave me only 72 hours to decide and begin work. I accepted in 48 hours but managed to negotiate a more leisurely start date. That decision marked the beginning of a 16-year relationship that would transform my professional and personal life. In 2010, we moved together to Boston, Massachusetts. José accepted the position of chief of oncology and codirector of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Cancer Center, and I followed him to build his laboratory. His vision was clear to everyone: a clinical investigation program worthy of the name of one of the world's best hospitals. Once again, José was not afraid of betting on young horses. Dejan Juric, a director at MGH who was then still in fellowship, became the heir-apparent to the MGH Phase I program. Astounded by José's drive, energy, and commitment, Dejan said to me at the time, “Mauri, I thought I was ready for anything, but I was not ready for José.” In January 2013, we again moved together, this time to MSK, where José made sure that in addition to managing his laboratory, I got my own independent group. What José did there in 6 years exceeded all expectations. I was in his office when, after a few days in the job, he made a phone call to someone asking the price for a biopsy (critical for translational work in clinical trials). In his way, he informed whoever was on the call that from that moment, they needed to cut the price in half. He founded and then pushed the Center for Molecular Oncology and the Early Drug Development Service to become the gems of precision medicine they are today. José expanded his vision by hiring physicians and scientists to build MSK-IMPACT, the targeted exome sequencing platform capable of genomically characterizing virtually every patient who walks into the clinic. Meanwhile, he empowered a young oncologist named David Hyman with the mandate and the resources to develop the best Phase I unit possible. In September 2018, José resigned from MSK after it was revealed that he had failed to disclose ties to drug companies. Although Jose's scientific achievements were never called into question, this incident highlighted the need for a long-overdue debate about the uniformity and clarity of conflict disclosures in medical and scientific journals. In what would become his final challenge, José brought his experience and stamina to AstraZeneca to reform oncology R&D in his singular manner. He immediately hired new talented clinicians and researchers to enhance what was already a successful team and built a perfectly oiled machine to test and approve new cancer drugs. José was direct, tough, demanding, and unforgiving, but he was also funny and caring. He would often display many or all of these characteristics in the same day. He hated mediocrity and pushed everyone around him to strive for perfection. Directly or indirectly, José helped the development and approval of a dozen drugs. In doing so, he saved and improved the lives of hundreds of thousands of cancer patients around the world."
