https://openalex.org/W1574557424,"Evidence is presented that the activity of the hexose monophosphate (HMP) pathway of red cells, assayed by 14CO2 production from glucose-1-14C, is regulated primarily by glutathione. Methemoglobin had little, if any, effect on the activity of this pathway. Increasing the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione, either by peroxidizing GSH to GSSG or by partially blocking GSH with NEM, increased the rate of HMP pathway metabolism. Complete blockage of cellular glutathione by NEM depressed the bulk of HMP pathway activity, despite little or no effect on the Embden-Meyerhof pathway. Sustained low levels of hydrogen peroxide, whether generated by aerobic oxidases or by the coupled oxidation of ascorbic acid with oxyhemoglobin, stimulated the HMP pathway of cells. This stimulation was potentiated by blocking catalase and was prevented by blocking GSH. The oxidation of NADPH by H2O2 in hemolysates was specifically dependent upon the presence of GSH. These results substantiate the existence in human red cells of the glutathione peroxidase mechanism proposed by Mills, whereby GSH protects cellular constituents such as hemoglobin from oxidative damage induced by H2O2. Oxidative denaturation of oxyhemoglobin to met- and sulf-hemoglobin by H2O2-generating mechanisms is markedly potentiated in cells lacking sufficient GSH, and commences only after GSH levels approach zero. In contrast, oxidationreduction catalysts such as methylene blue and acetylphenylhydrazine catalyze the direct oxidation of NADPH and hemoglobin, as well as GSH, by molecular oxygen. Although GSH is partially protective against these agents, they appear to damage red cells by virtue of their ability to bypass the GSH peroxidase mechanism and to cause oxidative injury despite persisting GSH."

They have been identified as rubredoxin (a red protein containing nonheme iron but no inorganic sulfide), a diphosphopyridine nucleotide-rubredoxin reductase, and the ω-hydroxylase. All three proteins are required for the conversion of laurate to ω-hydroxylaurate or of octane to n-octanol in the presence of Fe++ ions, reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide, and molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1592277260,"Abstract Human erythrocyte glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (d-glucose 6-phosphate:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) was purified by column chromatography with diethylaminoethyl cellulose, calcium phosphate gel, carboxymethyl cellulose, diethylaminoethyl Sephadex, and carboxymethyl Sephadex. A homogeneous preparation was obtained in over-all yield of about 50%. The specific activity (750) and the yield were significantly greater than those so far reported for the enzyme. The sedimentation patterns of analytical ultracentrifugation and interference pattern of sedimentation equilibrium indicated a homogeneous preparation. The sedimentation constant (s20,w) was 10.0 S at a protein concentration of 0.3%. The molecular weight was estimated as 240,000. The molecular weight was about 43,000 in 4 n guanidine-HCl, indicating that the enzyme consisted of six similar size subunits. Removal of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate from the enzyme caused dissociation into inactive (or weakly active) subunits with a molecular weight of about one-half of the native protein. The enzyme was partially inactivated by dilution without dissociating into subnuits. Optimal pH and Michaelis constants for the primary substrates were determined. Analogues of d-glucose 6-phosphate accepted as substrates were 2-deoxy-d-glucose 6-phosphate and d-galactose 6-phosphate. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide was a weak substrate. Amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined."
https://openalex.org/W1598071110,"Abstract The apoprotein of D-amino acid oxidase has been prepared by a new method involving dialysis of the holoenzyme against 1 M potassium bromide. The apoprotein prepared in this way has been found to have the same properties as that prepared by the classical acid-ammonium sulfate method. The effect of mixing apoprotein with flavin adenine dinucleotide has been followed by changes in absorbance at 493 mµ, by changes in flavin fluorescence and protein fluorescence, and by measuring catalytic activity. It is found that the reaction proceeds in two stages, a rapid binding of FAD being followed by slow secondary changes which correlate with the appearance of catalytic activity. Evidence is presented that the slow change is due to a change in protein conformation. Some speculation is made on the significance of this finding to the current theories of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1482403125,"Abstract The fatty acid-synthesizing system of Escherichia coli was fractionated by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose into three different enzyme fractions: Eii, Eiii, and Eiv. Incubation of Fraction Eii with acetyl coenzyme A, malonyl coenzyme A, reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide, and acyl carrier protein (ACP) yielded β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP, β-hydroxylauryl-ACP, and β-hydroxymyristyl-ACP in variable amounts depending on the Eii preparations. Addition of Fraction Eiii to reaction mixtures of Fraction Eii yielded mainly palmitic acid, whereas the addition of Fraction Eiv to the same Eii reaction mixture yielded mainly cis-vaccenic acid. Therefore, Fractions Eiii and Eiv must have directed the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids from β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP, respectively. Isolated β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs could be converted to their saturated homologues by incubation with Fraction Eiii and TPNH or could be elongated to palmitic acid by incubation with Fraction Eiii, TPNH, malonyl-CoA, and Fraction Eii. Incubation of Fraction Eiii or its subfractions with β-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA yielded the 2-decenoyl derivative. Incubation of Fraction Eiv or its subfractions with β-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA yielded a mixture of cis-3-decenoyl and trans-2-decenoyl derivatives. The relationship between the two dehydrases and the various products formed are discussed as well as their role in the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1606526641,"Abstract 1. The inducible p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase of Pseudomonas putida which catalyzes the hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate to protocatechuate has been obtained in crystalline form as a protein homogeneous upon ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis. The molecular weight is estimated to be 83,600. 2. The enzyme contains approximately 1 mole of flavin adenine dinucleotide per mole of protein. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, but not reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, serves as the hydrogen donor. 3. The enzyme is highly specific for p-hydroxybenzoate. Only four other aromatic compounds could be attacked at rates of less than 5% of the rate with p-hydroxybenzoate in all cases. 4. Under anaerobic conditions, the enzyme can catalyze the reduction of FAD by NADPH. This reaction requires the presence of the aromatic substrate to proceed at a significant rate. 5. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme in the visible region is slightly modified by the presence of the aromatic substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1538699852,"Glucose, labeled with 14C uniformly or in positions 1 or 6, and with tritium in positions 1, 3, 4, or 6, was incubated with rat epididymal fat tissue in the presence of insulin or epinephrine. Incorporation of the label into CO2, fatty acids, glycerol, lactate, and water was determined. From the 14C yields, the contribution of the pentose cycle to glucose metabolism was calculated. A carbon balance and a balance of formation and utilization of reduced pyridine nucleotides in the cytoplasm were established. Tritium from glucose-3-T was recovered in water and fatty acids, and a little in the α position of glycerol. Only trace amounts from this position were found in the α position of lactate and the β position of glycerol. The fatty acid yield of tritium from this sugar equaled the 14CO2 yield from glucose-1-14C via the pentose cycle. The yield of fatty acids from glucose-3-T was twice that of the yield of fatty acids via tritium-labeled reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide from glucose-1-T. In glycerol formed from glucose-1- and -6-T, all the tritium was recovered in the α position. In the presence of insulin, the T:14C ratio in glycerol from glucose-6-T ,6-14C was about 1.0; that of glycerol from glucose-1-T ,1-14C was 1.2 to 1.3. The T:14C ratios in lactate from these two sugars were less than 1, but the T:14C ratio from glucose-1-T ,1-14C was about 1.2 times that from glucose-6-T ,6-14C. In the presence of epinephrine the ratios in glycerol and lactate were the same for these two labeled sugars. Nearly 90% of tritium from glucose-4-T appeared in water in the presence of insulin, and 60% in the presence of epinephrine. The rest was recovered in lactate, fatty acids, and the α and β positions of glycerol. The T:14C ratio in the α position of glycerol from glucose-4-T labeled uniformly with 14C indicated extensive loss of the tritium from this sugar prior to the oxidation of triose phosphate. The T:14C ratios of position 2 of glycerol and of lactate indicated further loss of tritium. The contribution of TPNH and DPNH to fatty acid synthesis was calculated independently from 14C and tritium data. In the presence of insulin, it appears from 14C data that with rats on high carbohydrate diet 50% of the hydrogen equivalents are provided by TPNH, and that with rats on a regular diet 75% are provided by TPNH. From tritium data it appears that, with both diets, about 75% of the hydrogen equivalents are provided by TPNH and 25% by DPNH. With epinephrine, when fatty acid synthesis is low, DPNH may be the major source of reducing hydrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1494661700,"Abstract Treatment of spinach chloroplasts with 4% Triton X-100 yields fragments which are separable by centrifugation. In the medium used (which is 4% in Triton X-100 and 0.5 m in sucrose) for the initial incubation particles sedimented by centrifugation at 144,000 x g for 1, 3, and 8 hours are relatively inactive in the partial photoreactions representative of photosynthesis. These particles contain an increased amount of chlorophyll b when compared with chloroplasts. These particles could represent Pigment System 2 which is involved in oxygen evolution in the intact chloroplast but is inactivated by the detergent treatment. The supernatant fluid from the centrifugation described above contains particles which are sedimented by 10 hours of centrifugation at 144,000 x g after diluting with an equal volume of water. These particles exhibit a high rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate photoreduction, with rates as high as 1980 µmoles of NADP photoreduced per hr per mg of chlorophyll observed. This reaction requires the presence of spinach ferredoxin, ferredoxin-NADP reductase, and plastocyanin in addition to an electron donor system of ascorbate-2,6-dichloroindophenol (ascorbate alone is only moderately active) or ascorbate-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. This activity is heat-labile, being destroyed by heating to 40° for 5 min. Other photochemical reactions supported by this particle include methyl red reduction (supported by ascorbate-dichloroindophenol), ferrocytochrome c photooxidation (aerobic), and ferricytochrome c photoreduction (supported by reduced trimethylbenzoquinone). Methyl red photoreduction activity is also destroyed by heating, while ferricytochrome c photoreduction activity is only partially destroyed by heating to 70°. Methyl red photoreduction and ferrocytochrome c photooxidation also are stimulated by plastocyanin. The photoactive particles contain low amounts of chlorophyll b, show an unresolved cytochrome spectrum indicating the presence of cytochrome f and b6, exhibit an increased absorbance at 700 mµ, and show a greatly enhanced P700 absorption change and electron spin resonance spectrum upon illumination. The particle is only weakly fluorescent and does not emit any delayed light following illumination. All these properties indicate that this particle retains the photoactive Pigment System 1 which is responsible for NADP photoreduction in photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1628349667,"Abstract The concentrations of metabolites, including glucose, glycogen, glycolytic intermediates, adenine nucleotides, phosphates, amino acids, and citrate, in mouse brain in situ were measured from 15 to 180 sec after exposure of mice to the convulsant, Indoklon (bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether). An increase in glycolytic flux of at least 3 times the basal rate was estimated for the brain in the convulsive state. During the period of hyperactivity, new steady state levels were established for several metabolites. In the transition, the concentrations of glucose and hexose monophosphates in the brain decreased. Coincident with these decreases, the concentration of fructose 1,6-diphosphate increased rapidly but transiently. The concentration of cerebral glycogen was unchanged during the first 30 sec, decreased about 20% during the next min, and then remained constant. Lactate accumulated throughout the period of convulsion. At the initiation of convulsion, the concentration of creatine phosphate fell precipitously to half its original value. The decrease in adenosine triphosphate was relatively small. Correspondingly, the concentrations of ADP, AMP, and inorganic phosphate in the brain increased rapidly with the induction of hyperactivity. The concentrations of citrate, glutamate, and aspartate did not change significantly. The level of proline was lowered during the convulsion. With the induction of convulsions and concomitant with the increased rate of glycolysis, the enzymes phosphofructokinase and hexokinase were coordinately activated. These two enzymatic sites represent the major control points of glycolysis in cerebral tissue in vivo. The ability of the brain to adjust to a new steady state following an increase in glycolytic rate, as well as its ability to maintain adequate supplies of energy reserves and oxygen, serves to distinguish the convulsive from the ischemic condition."

https://openalex.org/W12791158,"Abstract After incubation of cholesterol-4-14C, cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol-7β-3H, and tritium-labeled 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one with the 20,000 x g supernatant fluid of rat liver homogenate, 7α,12α-dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one was identified as one of the main metabolites. In the presence of microsomal fraction fortified with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one was converted into 7α,12α-dihydroxycholest-4-en-3-one as efficiently as in the 20,000 x g supernatant fluid. It is suggested that the main substrate for the 12α-hydroxylase in cholic acid formation might be 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one."

https://openalex.org/W107891412,"The effect of divalent metal ions on the reaction catalyzed by pig heart citrate synthase has been investigated. Concentrations of divalent metal ions (Mn++, Mg++, and Ca++) in 100-fold excess of acetyl coenzyme A concentration inhibit the enzymic reaction. It is suggested that the inhibition is due to chelate formation between the divalent metal ions and the acetyl-CoA molecule, most likely at the polyphosphate chain of the molecule. The inhibition of pig heart citrate synthase by adenosine triphosphate and other nucleotides, palmitoyl-CoA, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate was studied. Divalent metal ions (Mn++, Mg++, and Ca++) at low concentrations reduce the inhibition. We suggest that the effect is due to the chelation of the metal ions with the polyphosphate moiety of the inhibitor molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1590877325,"Studies on the specificity and mechanism of action of hepatic glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase, an enzyme capable of catalyzing the reductive cleavage of the disulfide bonds of insulin in the presence of excess reduced glutathione, have been carried out. By coupling reactions catalyzed by glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase to that of glutathione reductase, it was indicated that during the course of enzyme action, transhydrogenase undergoes reduction by GSH and that the reduced enzyme is autoxidizable; it is inferred that this reduced form is an active intermediate during transhydrogenase-catalyzed reductions of disulfide-substrates. Under conditions of limited spontaneous air oxidation of protein sulfhydryls, transhydrogenase was shown to promote also the net oxidation of such thiols as the reduced forms of insulin and RNase. During the process of reoxidation of reduced forms of insulin and RNase, glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase was capable of enhancing the rates of regeneration of the native proteins from their reduced precursors as determined by their immunologic and enzymic properties, respectively. Furthermore, this transhydrogenase was able to promote the reconstitution of the native activity from a reduced form of RNase already extensively oxidized by dehydroascorbate. Contrary to previous indications, glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase was found to have no observable activity in specifically directing the preferential re-establishment of the native configuration of insulin. On the basis of evidence presented in this study, a mechanism involving a series of disulfide-interchange reactions has been proposed to explain the aforementioned reactions catalyzed by glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase. The possible relationship or identity of the transhydrogenase to other insulin-reducing and RNase-reactivating enzymes is pointed out. In substrate specificity studies on a number of chemically modified and proteolytically degraded forms of insulin, it was found that neither biological activity nor native structure is prerequisite for activity as substrate for glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase-catalyzed reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1592573515,"Abstract Experiments were conducted in order to elucidate the relationship between the structure of mammary glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and its catalytic activities with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. A model is proposed to account for the results which depicts the enzyme as existing in the form of two monomers, X and Y, in rapid, mobile equilibrium with each other, and in which X can be reversibly dissociated into inactive subunits under suitable conditions and Y can be dimerized at high protein concentration. The formation of Y from X is promoted by the addition of NADP+ or NADPH, whereas glycerol or NAD+ promote the formation of X from Y. The NADP-linked activity of Y is greater than that of X, but X possesses greater NAD-linked activity than Y. The experiments here presented in support of the proposed model deal with the interconversion of X and Y. The kinetics of NADPH inhibition of NAD-linked glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase is compared in aqueous solution and in 40% glycerol. Sigmoid kinetics is seen in aqueous solution, but normal kinetics obtains in 40% glycerol. Experiments are reported showing that, under the conditions used in the kinetic studies, NADPH does not cause the enzyme to dimerize. It is also shown that the rate and extent of reactivation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase from inactive subunits are promoted in the presence of NADPH and hindered in the presence of glycerol. Finally, the effects of various reagents upon the NADP-linked and NAD-linked activities of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase are seen to be compatible with their action on the equilibrium between X and Y. Interconversion of X and Y may be of importance in the regulation of mammary glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1601454449,"Abstract Rat epididymal fat pads were incubated at 37° in bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, with glucose (10 mm) or with glucose plus acetate (15 mm), in the presence of insulin (1000 microunits per ml). The net gas exchange, total CO2 production, O2 consumption, glucose utilization, lactate and glycerol production, and radioactive carbon incorporation into CO2 and fatty acids were measured, with the use of matched pieces of tissue, in the presence of (a) uniformly labeled glucose-14C, (b) uniformly labeled glucose-14C plus unlabeled acetate, (c) unlabeled glucose and acetate-1,2-14C, and (d) glucose-6-14C and unlabeled acetate. The results permitted the estimation of the quantitative flow of glucose and acetate carbon into the major metabolic pathways of adipose tissue. It was found that when glucose and acetate were present together the flow of glucose carbon through the pentose cycle increased 83% and total fatty acid synthesis 60% above that seen with glucose alone. Part of the increased fatty acid synthesis was due to a greater flow of glucose carbon to acetyl coenzyme A, brought about entirely by the increased production of glyceraldehyde phosphate in the pentose cycle. It was calculated that the pentose cycle provided 65% of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate needed for reduction to fatty acid of the acetyl-CoA formed from glucose, but that this cycle furnished all the extra reducing equivalents needed when acetate was also available as a precursor for fatty acid synthesis. This difference is attributed to the production of reduced coenzymes in the formation of acetyl-CoA from glucose but not from acetate. The conversion of a portion of these reduced coenzymes into NADPH for use in fatty acid synthesis, and the reaction of of the remainder with oxygen, are discussed. It is concluded that the rate of these reactions may limit conversion of glucose to fat in adipose tissue maximally stimulated by insulin. A limitation does not appear to be set by the rate at which any of the following processes can proceed: (a) glucose uptake, (b) NADPH formation by the pentose cycle, (c) conversion of acetyl-CoA to fatty acids, (d) consumption of oxygen and production of adenosine triphosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1504720427,"Difference spectra of mitochondrial and microsomal preparations from bovine adrenal cortex have been examined, and the activity of several enzyme systems in these particles has been studied. Evidence for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, flavoproteins, and cytochromes b, c1, c, and a + a3 in the adrenal respiratory chain in a molar ratio of 4.9:3.8:1.7:1.5:2.0:2.9:1.0, respectively, was found. The P-450 cytochrome was observed to be present in mitochondria in a molar ratio to cytochrome a3 of 6.9:1.0. It paralleled malate oxidase and steroid 11β-hydroxylase activities in subcellular distribution but was also present at a lower concentration in microsomal particles which contained most of the steroid 21-hydroxylase activity. The relationship of the adrenal cortical respiratory chain to the mitochondrial steroid-hydroxylating pathway is discussed, and a role for an energy-controlled pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase in electron transport to the hydroxylating system is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1516068362,"Abstract The association-dissociation equilibria of d-amino acid oxidase have been examined by light scattering under a variety of conditions. Under all conditions the value of molecular weight extrapolated to zero protein concentration appears to be in the neighborhood of 90,000. As the minimum molecular weight, based on flavin adenine dinucleotide content, is 45,500, the enzyme is thus concluded to have 2 molecules of FAD in its monomeric form. The light scattering results show that, under all conditions examined, a concentration-dependent equilibrium exists which is comprised of dimers and still higher molecular weight species. The extent of equilibrium polymer formation is decreased as the pH and temperature are lowered and as the concentration of chloride ions is increased. The extent of polymer formation is also affected by whether the enzyme is in the form of the holoenzyme, the benzoate complex, or the apoprotein. Concentration-dependent polymerization increases in the order apoprotein, benzoate complex, holoenzyme. At pH values close to the optimum for catalytic activity (pH 8.5), the effect of temperature on the apparent molecular weight indicates a transition from one equilibrium to another with a midpoint temperature of 12–15°."

The enzyme was shown to catalyze the following reversible reaction. See PDF for Structure At a neutral pH, saccharopine was formed only when aminoadipic semialdehyde, glutamate, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide were all present. NADH was much less active than NADPH as the coenzyme. In this system, when aminoadipic semialdehyde (3) or glutamate were radioactive, saccharopine, recognized by its behavior on paper electrophoresis, was radioactive. At an alkaline pH, e.g. pH 9.75, saccharopine was cleaved oxidatively either by NADP+ or NAD+ to form aminoadipic semialdehyde, as characterized by its o-aminobenzaldehyde adduct, and glutamate, detected with glutamic dehydrogenase. In this latter instance, the amount of glutamate formed corresponded to the amount of NADP+ reduced. Aminoadipic semialdehyde-glutamate reductase is a sulfhydryl enzyme having an s20,w value of 4.9 and a molecular weight of approximately 73,000 as estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The Michaelis constants for saccharopine and NADP+ are 0.92 mM and 0.022 mM, respectively. Aminoadipic semialdehyde-glutamate reductase, when coupled with saccharopine dehydrogenase which will be discussed in the accompanying paper (9), functions to synthesize lysine from aminoadipic semialdehyde via the stable intermediate, saccharopine."

https://openalex.org/W1563339254,"Abstract The synthesis of aldosterone at an appreciable rate by cell-free preparations has been achieved through the use of homogenates of the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) adrenal gland. Such homogenates synthesized aldosterone from corticosterone-1,2-3H at a rate of about 250 µg per g, wet weight, per hour. After centrifugal fractionation, aldosterone-synthesizing activity was present only in the mitochondria. Addition of the soluble fraction stimulated synthesis. Synthesis by the mitochondria required the presence of fumarate, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and Mg++. Homogenates of bovine adrenal cortex and rat adrenal glands contain an inhibitor of aldosterone synthesis. The presence of this inhibitor may explain the relatively low rate of aldosterone synthesis by such preparations. Bullfrog adrenal homogenates also synthesized a substance with the chromatographic properties of 18-hydroxycorticosterone (11β,18,21 - trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione) from corticosterone-1,2-3H at a high rate.

Pretreatment with phenobarbital had little effect on the induction of serine dehydrase and ornithine transaminase, but pretreatment with cortisone and phenobarbital together caused an enhanced response of these enzymes to casein hydrolysate feeding, with respect to both total amount of enzyme produced and activity per g of liver protein.

Sonic treatment of chloroplasts resulted in a decrease in Hill activity with NADP and ferricyanide. The decrease was accompanied by a change in the dependency of the reduction rate upon ferricyanide concentration and light intensity. With either electron acceptor, the Hill activity was highest with fragments of medium size and decreased with decreasing size of the fragments. The photoreduction of NADP and methyl red with ascorbate and 2,6-dichloroindophenol increased after sonic treatment. The larger fragments were less active than the sonically disrupted chloroplasts, whereas the small fragments showed a very high activity; that is, they were several times more active than the larger fragments or sonically treated chloroplasts. Evidence is presented to indicate that the increase in the activity induced by sonic treatment was due to an increased accessibility of the electron-donating reaction."

Final purification of wild-type and amer-5 enzyme was approximately 1000-fold, but only slightly more than 400-fold for the amer-6 and amer-8 enzymes. Purification of the latter two enzymes, however, was actually 7000-fold in comparison to crude wild-type material, owing to the increase in specific activity genetically determined by both mutations. Properties of the three mutant enzymes revealed by the various fractionation procedures were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type enzyme. A molecular weight of 20,000 has been calculated for dihydrofolate reductase by molecular sieve chromatography on calibrated gel columns. Dihydrofolate reductase from another mutant (amer-3) and a recombinant form (amer-3-5) exhibited properties which were radically dissimilar to those of the other enzymes. Both amer-3 and amer-3-5 were less soluble in ammonium sulfate; they were labile in salt solutions and unstable during storage, and appeared to exist mainly in an associated form consistently excluded during molecular sieve chromatography. A 7-fold purification of both enzymes was obtained by ammonium sulfate fractionation.

These uronic acid nucleotides, reported to occur for the first tune in living cells, are considered to be the precursors for the biosynthesis of alginic acid which constitutes about 18% of this alga. A mixture of 3 µmoles of the two uronic acid nucleotides was isolated from 14 kg of the plant. About 80% of the mixture was identified as GDP-D-mannuronic acid by the following criteria: (a) spectral properties and quantitative chemical analyses of the components, (b) examination of products formed by enzymic and mild acid hydrolysis, (c) chromatographic and electrophoretic mobilities, and (d) characterization of D-mannitol derived from the uronic acid residue by borate electrophoresis, by gas chromatography as the hexaacetate, and by oxidation with D-mannitol dehydrogenase. The minor uronic acid nucleotide component was characterized as GDP-L-guluronic acid by (a) detection of gulurone and glucitol hexaacetate, respectively, in the preparations of uronolactone and hexitol hexaacetate derived from the nucleotide mixture, and (b) detection of gluconate in the borohydride-reduced uronic acid residue of the nucleotide by the combining action of D-gluconokinase and phosphoglucono-dehydrogenase, or with gluconic dehydrogenase. Other nucleotides detected in the algal extract include: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, cytidine 5'-phosphate, NADP+, uridine 5'-phosphate, adenosine 5'-phosphate, a mixture of UDP-D-glucose and UDP-L-arabinose, ADP, GMP, GDP, a mixture of GDP sugars, and an unidentified adenine nucleotide fraction which produced glucose and arabinose upon hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1502944523,"The incorporation of tritium from tritiated water, which occurs during the chemical reduction of folate to dihydrofolate, folate to tetrahydrofolate, and dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, has been determined. Also, the transfer of tritium from enzymatically reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide during the enzymatic reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate has been investigated. By degradation of the reaction products it was established that in all of these reactions tritium was most probably incorporated only into position 7 of the pteridine ring, suggesting that the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate is preceded by intramolecular rearrangement. This was confirmed by experiments in which dihydrofolate labeled with deuterium in position 7 was reduced enzymatically or chemically to tetrahydrofolate."
https://openalex.org/W1505760304,"Abstract The isolation and purification of a soluble transhydrogenase from Chromatium is described. The enzyme promotes the oxidation of reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide by diphosphopyridine nucleotide. However, it will also use several analogues of DPN and TPN which include deamino-DPN, deamino-TPN, thionicotinamide DPN, and deamino-DPNH. Nicotinamide mononucleotide was also reduced. The enzyme does not use the 3-acetylpyridine analogues as substrates. TPN and adenosine 2'-phosphate were shown to be competitive inhibitors of the enzyme with TPNH or DPNH as the hydrogen donor. The enzyme is inhibited by mercaptide-forming reagents. The enzyme is compared with previously described transhydrogenases and a possible role in metabolism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1543795037,Abstract The stereochemistry of the α-ketoglutarate produced in the reaction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-specific isocitric dehydrogenase with threo-ds-isocitric acid-β-T has been determined. The product retained the tritium of the substrate in the β position without inversion. This is similar to the finding with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-specific enzyme. The products of the two enzymes are therefore indistinguishable. Experiments with α-ketoglutarate-β-T2 provided no evidence for the reversibility of the reaction.
https://openalex.org/W2036070630,"Rats of various ages were subjected to the stress of 30 minutes on a noisy reciprocating shaker 4 hours before their liver tyrosine transaminase and tryptophan pyrrolase activities were measured. Adrenalectomized infants and adults and hypophysectomized adults were also stressed. Intact, stressed infants exhibited an increase in tyrosine transaminase activity, while intact, stressed adults showed no change. In the stressed adrenalectomized adult, tyrosine transaminase activity markedly decreased, while adrenalectomized infants showed no change. Hypophysectomy largely, but not completely, abolished inhibition in the adults. Tryptophan pyrrolase activity, when present, was increased by stress in all age groups, but the increase was abolished by adrenalectomy and hypophysectomy. The results suggest stress-activation of a pituitary mechanism that inhibits or represses activation of tyrosine transaminase and that may not function during early postnatal life."

https://openalex.org/W61003040,Abstract Two placental enzyme systems that catalyze the transfer of hydrogen from reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide to diphosphopyridine nucleotide in the presence of 17β-estradiol have been separated by chromatography on hydroxyapatite. One effects a substrate (17β-estradiol)-mediated transhydrogenation in the presence of DPN- and TPN-linked 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase activities and is completely inhibited by 1.67 M NaCl. The other is a 17β-estradiol-dependent transhydrogenase unassociated with 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase activities; its activity is increased 2.5 times in the presence of 1.67 M NaCl.

Preparations from Caucasian subjects with different hereditary deficiency syndromes differ from each other and from normal subjects, indicating a qualitative difference in these specific ""deficient"" enzymes. Sensitivity to neutral salts may be a means of detecting an amino acid substitution."

https://openalex.org/W1567268979,"Abstract 16α-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an estrogen-induced, soluble enzyme from rat kidneys, has been concentrated, partially purified, and separated from 16β- and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities by a carboxymethyl cellulose column fractionation procedure. Spectrophotometric measurement of the reduction of 3,17β-dihydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-16-one to estriol by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has been employed to assay and characterize the purified enzyme. This preparation catalyzes the specific interconversion of 16α-hydroxy- and 16-ketosteroids. Its pH optimum for steroid reduction is 6.1 to 6.2, and it is inhibited by low concentrations of heavy metal ions, reagents which modify sulfhydryl groups, and metal chelators. At the present state of enzyme purity, a number of phenolic C18 and neutral C19 steroids can serve as substrates, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate can replace nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as cofactor. This enzyme is distinguished by its specificity from similar hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases previously characterized and has been utilized as a stereospecific reagent for substrate synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1673238349,"Abstract Infection of Escherichia coli with T-even bacteriophage or T5 leads to the production of large amounts of dihydrofolate reductase. As shown previously, this represents the synthesis of a new, virus-specific protein. Since appreciable levels of this enzyme exist in the cell before infection, an attempt was made to demonstrate a specific metabolic requirement for the viral enzyme. This included (a) a study of the structure of tetrahydrofolate produced enzymatically by both the bacterial and the viral reductase and (b) measurements of levels of reduced pyridine nucleotides in the cell before and after infection. Both the cellular and the phage-specific reductase catalyze the formation of the l, l diastereoisomer of tetrahydrofolate, as does the same enzyme isolated from chicken liver. Experiments on pyridine nucleotide concentrations reveal a 2- to 3-fold increase in the reduced forms of both di- and triphosphopyridine nucleotide occurring within about 10 min after infection, followed by a return to preinfection values. These observations are discussed with reference to the reductive biosynthetic steps in the production of deoxyribonucleic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2093423317,The interior air of a simulated underwater habitation was continuously washed or scrubbed with sea water by means of a gas exchanger of the venturi type. The sole method for supplying oxygen and removing carbon dioxide was the scrubbing process. A microburner placed inside the experimental habitation chamber continued to burn until it was intentionally extinguished. Two rats maintained in the chamber for 8 hours suffered no discernible ill effects.
