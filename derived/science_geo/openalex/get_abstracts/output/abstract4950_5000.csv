https://openalex.org/W2147463574,"A nutrient medium has been developed to enable the growth of normal epithelial cells while selectively inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. In this medium, D-valine is substituted for L-valine; and only those cells containing D-amino acid oxidase can convert the D-amino acid into its essential L-enantiomer. The ability to select for cells with this enzyme has enabled us to maintain epithelial cell populations free from fibroblast overgrowth. The presence of D-amino acid oxidase has been histochemically confirmed in the epithelial cells selected from renal cell suspensions and explants. The ability to proliferate in the selective medium is transmitted to the clonal progeny of these cells. Moreover, epithelial cell proliferation of this medium indicates the presence of D-amino acid oxidase, which we have detected in tissues where it had not previously been reported-fetal human kidney, lung, and cord. Fibroblasts will not grow in the selective medium, but will proliferate normally if the product of the D-amino acid oxidase reaction is supplied."
https://openalex.org/W1553837257,"Gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase was purified from rat kidney by a procedure involving Lubrol extraction, acetone precipitation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, treatment with bromelain, and column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100. The final preparation (enzyme III), which exhibits a specific activity about 8-fold higher than that of the purified rat kidney transpeptidase previously obtained in this laboratory (enzyme I), was apparently homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Enzyme III is a glycoprotein containing 10% hexose, 7% aminohexose, and 1.5% sialic acid; a tentative molecular weight value of about 70,000 was obtained by gel filtration. Enzyme III has a much lower molecular weight and a different amino acid and carbohydrate content than the less active rat kidney transpeptidase preparation previously obtained, but obtained, but the catalytic properties of these preparations are virtually identical. It is suggested that bromelain treatment may liberate the transpeptidase from a brush border complex that contains other proteins. An improved method is described for the isolation of the higher molecular weight form of the enzyme (enzyme I) in which affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sephrose is employed. The purified transpeptidase (enzyme III) is similar to the phosphate-independent maleate-stimulated preparation obtained from rat kidney by Katunuma and colleagues with respect to amino acid and carbohydrate content, apparent molecular weight, and relative transpeptidase and maleate-stimulated glutaminase activities. Both of these enzyme preparations are much more active in transpeptidation reactions with glutathione and related gamma-glutamyl compounds than with glutamine. In the absence of maleate, the enzyme catalyzes the utilization of glutamine (by conversion to gamma-glutamylglutamine, glutamate, and ammonia) at about 2% of the rate observed for catalysis of transpeptidation between glutathione and glycylglycine; the utilization of glutamine occurs about 8 times more rapidly in the presence of 0.1 M maleate. The transpeptidation and maleate-stimulated reactions catalyzed by both enzyme preprations are inhibited by 5 mM L-serine in the presence of 5 mM sodium borate. Studies on gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and maleate-stimulated in the kidneys of fetal rats, newborn rats, and rats after weaning showed parallel development of these activities. The evidence reported here and earlier work in this laboratory strongly support the conclusion that maleate-stimulated activity is a catalytic function of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The studies on the ontogeny of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and other data are considered in relation to the proposal that this enzyme is involved in amino acid and peptide transport. Its possible role in renal formation of ammonia is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1630678156,"A deoxyribonuclease specific for methylated DNA was isolated from Diplococcus pneumoniae. The enzyme, an endonuclease, degrades DNA for Escherichia coli to fragments of average molecular weight about half a million; it forms discrete fragments from phage lambda DNA. Methyl-deficient E. coli DNA is not attacked, neither is DNA from Micrococcus radiodurans, which contains no methylated adenine or cytosine. Nor is DNA from D. pneumoniae or phage T7 attacked. However, DNA from M. radiodurans, D. pneumoniae, and T7 is attacked after methylation with and E. coli extract. Methylated T7 DNA is degraded to discrete fragments. Although the genetic transforming activity of normal DNA from D. pneumoniae is not affected by the enzyme, transforming activity of methylated DNA is destroyed. The enzyme is designated endonuclease R Dpn I. Under certain conditions another enzyme of complementary specificity can be isolated. This enzyme, designated endonuclease R Dpn II, produces a similar pattern of fragments from the DNA of T7 without prior methylation of the DNA. It also degrades normal DNA for D. pneumoniae. It is suggested that this pair of enzymes plays a role in some unknown control process, which would involve a large fraction of the specific base sequences that are methylated in E. coli DNA and are present but not methylated in DNA from other sources."
https://openalex.org/W1565068678,"Thyroid hormones have diverse effects on growth and metabolism. Specific proteins which bind triiodothyronine and other biologically active analogs and which may be involved in thyroid hormone action have been recently found in nuclei of responsive tissues. This report presents studies of these receptors in rat liver nuclei. Confirming previous reports, a Scatchard analysis of the binding data suggests the reaction, triiodothyronine + specific receptor in equilibrium with triiodothyronine-receptor complex, with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) at 22 degrees of about 190 pM and a capacity of about 1 pmol of triiodothyronine-binding sites per mg of DNA. The kinetics of the binding were also examined. Triiodothyronine-receptor complex formation is second order and dissociation is first order. The apparent association (k+1) and dissociation (k minus 1) rate constants at 22 degrees are, respectively, 4.7 times 10-7 m-minus 1 min-minus 1 and 7.6 times 10-minus 3 min-minus 1. The apparent Kd, estimated from the ratio of the rate constants (k minus 1:k+1), was about 150 pM, similar to that determined from the equilibrium data. These data support the expression written above for the interaction of thyroid hormone with its receptor. Additional kinetic experiments indicate that some of the triiodothyronine binding by cell-free nuclei is to sites previously occupied by hormone in the intact animal, providing further evidence that the intact cell and cell-free reactions are the same. It was previously found that nuclear-bound triiodothyronine is localized in chromatin. We found that isolated chromatin retains specific binding activity similar to that of isolated nuclei. Thus, binding may not require cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic, or nuclear membrane factors. These findings may imply that chromatin localization of the receptor does not depend on the hormone. This idea is supported by an earlier finding that binding activity is present in nuclei from thyroidectomized animals. However, many stimuli such as steroid hormones, bacterial inducers, and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate in bacteria influence regulatory proteins at the gene level by promoting the protein's addition to or removal from chromatin. Thus, we studied the effect of thyroid hormone on the nuclear content of receptors under assay conditions of receptor stability and reversible binding. Receptor levels in hypothyroid animals are identical with those in euthyroid animals. These data suggest that the hormone does not influence the nuclear localization of receptors. Thus, the basis for thyroid hormone action may be to regulate the activity of receptors resident in chromatin rather than to promote receptor addition to or removal from chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W2122620532,"The influence of thyroid hormones on lipid biosynthesis was studied after administration of L-thyroxine to rats for 5 days. Their weights remained the same as those of control animals, despite an approximately 3-fold increment in plasma L-thyroxine and L-triiodothyronine concentrations. The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase as well as incorporation of tritium into fatty acids were depressed significantly in epididymal adipose tissue and enhanced significantly in livers of thyroxine-treated rats. Using antibodies specific against rat liver fatty acid synthetase, it was determined that the changes in activity of this multienzymic complex were due to alterations in amount of enzyme protein. In the presence of optimal concentrations of fatty acids, radioactive sn-glycero-3-phosphate, and co-substrates, total glycerolipid synthesis (defined in this study as the sum of newly formed radioactive mono- and diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, diglyceride, and triglyceride) was decreased significantly in adipose tissue and increased in liver and heart. Thus, administration of thyroid hormone results in tissue-specific alterations in lipid biosynthesis which, at least in the case of fatty acid synthetase, are due to changes in enzyme protein content."
https://openalex.org/W1967418149,"Distribution of amino acids in 68 representative proteins is compared with their distribution among 61 codons of the genetic code. Average amounts of lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and alanine are above the levels anticipated from the genetic code, and arginine, serine, leucine, cysteine, proline, and histidine are below such levels. Arginine plus lysine account for 11.0 percent of codons and aspartic acid plus glutamic acid account for 11.3 percent; thus the average charge is roughly neutral."
https://openalex.org/W1507633654,"A high level of cholesterol esterase activity, comparable to that of hormone-sensitive triglyceridase, has been demonstrated in rad adipose tissue. Essentially all of the activity was in the isolated adipocytes, primarily in the 100,000 times g supernatant fraction of the adipocytes. Cholesterol esterase activity in the 100,000 times g supernatant fraction was increased 40 plus or minus 16% by incubation with ATP (0.5 mM), Mg-2+ (1.25 mM), and cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) (10 muM), conditions which also activated hormone-sensitive triglyceridase. Protein kinase inhibitor (rabbit skeletal muscle) blocked activation, and activation was restored by the addition of excess protein kinase (bovine skeletal muscle). In extracts prepared from adipocytes first incubated for 5 min with 10 muM epinephrine and 1 mM theophylline, there was no cyclic AMP-dependent cholesterol esterase activation, implying that the enzyme had been activated by a similar mechanism in the intact cell. The physiological role of this high level of cholesterol esterase activity in adipose tissue is unclear. Its relationship to hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase, with which it extensively co-fractionates, and its possible involvement in fat mobilization remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1972074793,"Reexamination of the effects of actinomycin D (AMD) on the intracellular level and rate of synthesis of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) in hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells reveals that much apparent controversy can be resolved with acknowledgment of the multi-faceted nature of this inhibitor's action. AMD can slow overall protein synthesis and inhibit the degradation of both TAT and its mRNA as well as block the synthesis of RNA. The extent of these secondary actions of the inhibitor depend somewhat upon the growth condition of the cells. The effects of cordycepin (3′-deoxyadenosine) on the metabolism of TAT and its mRNA are also complex, but differ in several respects from those of AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1558516521,"A poly(A) polymerase with a molecular weight of approximately 80,000 containing 51,000 and 35,000 molecular weight subunits, was purified by affinity chromatography from vaccinia virus cores. The enzyme had a pH optimum of about 8.6, was dependent on divalent cations, and had considerably more activity with Mn-2+ than Mg-2+. At equimolar concentrations, other ribonucleoside triphosphates inhibited poly(A) polymerase activity by less than 10%; NaCl was extremely inhibitory at concentrations above 0.1 M. Under standard assay conditions, poly(A) polymerase activity was stimulated more than 10-fold by poly(C), but to small extent or not at all by other homopolyribonucleotides or natural RNA species unless they were first subjected to partial hydrolysis and alkaline phosphatase treatment. The ineffectiveness of most long polyribonucleotides was attributed to enzyme binding to internal regions. Short poly- or oligoribonucleotides prepared from natural or synthetic RNAs, except poly(G), exhibited similar priming abilities, and isotope transfer experiments indicated the covalent attachment of poly(A) to cytidylate, uridylate, and inosinate residues. Experiments with a series of uridylate oligomers indicated that the minimum effective primer length was four to six nucleotides. Partially digested DNA and short poly- and oligodeoxyribonucleotides of dT, dC, and dI, but not of dA and dG, also acted as effective primers for the poly(A) polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1577031595,"A large fraction of the Ca-2plus- and Mg-2plus-dependent ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes solubilized with Triton X-100 was phosphorylated with Pi. The phosphorylation required Mg-2plus but was strongly inhibited by low concentrations of Ca-2plus. A Ca-2plus ion concentration of 30 muM caused half-maximum inhibition in the presence of 50 mM MgCl2. The phosphorylated enzyme showed a rapid turnover and was in dynamic equilibrium with Pi in the medium. At equilibrium the amount of the phosphorylated enzyme increased markedly with increased in the reaction temperature. The apparent standard free energy change, the apparent standard enthalpy change, and the apparent standard entropy change in the formation of the phosphorylated enzyme from the enzyme-phosphate complex in the presence of excess Mg-2plus at 37 degrees and pH 7.0 were, respectively, 0.35 Cal per mol, 15.9 Cal per mol, and 50.2 e.u. per mol. The susceptibility of the acid-denatured phosphorylated enzyme to hydroxylamine showed that the phosphorylated enzyme is of an acyl phosphate type. The present results are consistent with the probability that the phosphorylation results from reversal of late steps in the Ca-2plus transport process. The results clearly show that the phosphorylated enzyme is stabilized by a great increase in entropy upon its formation from the enzyme-phosphate complex."
https://openalex.org/W1553584692,"The rate of reaction between alpha-amino groups and cyanic acid was followed at 26 degrees and ionic strength 0.2 M as a function of pH of human hemoglobin Ao solutions to determine the pK and the pH-independent second order rate constant, kappa, for these groups in the alpha and beta chains. At a given point in time, the extent of the reaction was determined by employing the Beckmann Sequencer as a quantitative tool in which the yields of leucine and histidine in the second Edman degradation cycle were used to define the rates of reaction of the alpha and beta chains, respectively. From these results, the individual were evaluated (Garner, M.H., Garner, W.H., and Gurd, F. R.N. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 5451-5455). Values for pK for the alpha and beta chains were, respectively, 6.74 and 6.93 for cyanoferrihemoglobin, 6.95 and 7.05 for carboxyhemoglobin, and 7.79 and 6.84 for deoxyhemoglobin. Values for kappa, M- minus 1 S-minus 1, for the alpha and beta chains were, respectively, 12.5 and 17 for cyanoferrihemoglobin, 12 and 18 for carboxyhemoglobin, and 91 and 24 for deoxyhemoglobin. Limits of significance were estimated for both variables in each case. The pK results for valine 1alpha agree well with the value obtained by Hill and Davis (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 2005-2012) for carboxyhemoglobin and with that of Kilmartin and Rossi-Bernardi ((1971) Biochem. J. 124, 31-45) for deoxyhemoglobin. Values obtained for sperm whale myoglobin were 7.77 for pK and 7.4 for kappa. The results are useful for the interpretation of the allosteric interactions of hemoglobin with hydrogen ions, with CO2, and with phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1557897326,"Two aminotransferases from Escherichia coli were purified to homogeneity by the criterion of gel electrophoresis. The first (enzyme A) is active on L-aspartic acid, L-tyrosine, L-phenylalanine, and L-tryptophan; the second (enzyme B) is active on the aromatic amiono acids. Enzyme A is identical in substrate specificity with transaminase A and is mainly an aspartate aminotransferase; enzyme B has never been described before and is an aromatic amino acid aminotransferase. The two enzymes are different in the Vmax and Km values with their common substrates and pyridoxal phosphate, in heat stability (enzyme A being heat-stable and enzyme B being heat-labile at 55 degrees) and in pH optima with the amino acid substrates. They are similar in their amino acid composition, each enzyme appears to consist of two subunits, and enzyme B may be converted to enzyme A by controlled proteolysis with subtilsin. The conversion was detected by the generation of new aspartate aminotransferase activity from enzyme B and was further verified by identification by acrylamide gel electrophoresis of the newly formed enzyme A. The two enzymes appear to be products of two genes different in a small, probably terminal, nucleotide sequence."

Interferon with a specific activity of 2.5 times 10-8 reference units/mg of protein is composed of 10 to 11 polypeptides. They differ in their molecular size as determined by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The molecular weight range is estimated to be from the smallest at 20, 000 to the largest at 32, 000. At least six of the polypeptides are glycoproteins and each of the polypeptides can be obtained as an apparent homogeneous entity and each has interferon activity."
https://openalex.org/W1484164332,"The subcellular localization of guanylate cyclase was examined in rat liver. About 80% of the enzyme activity of homogenates was found in the soluble fraction. Particulate guanylate cyclase was localized in plasma membranes and microsomes. Crude nuclear and microsomal fractions were applied to discontinuous sucrose gradients, and the resulting fractions were examined for guanylate cyclase, various enzyme markers of cell components, and electron microscopy. Purified plasma membrane fractions obtained from either preparation had the highest specific activity of guanylate cyclase, 30 to 80 pmol/min/mg of protein, and the recovery and relative specific activity of guanylate cyclase paralleled that of 5'-nucleotidase and adenylate cyclase in these fractions. Significant amounts of guanylate cyclase, adenylate cyclase, 5'-nucleotidase, and glucose-6-phosphatase were recovered in purified preparation of microsomes. We cannot exclude the presence of guanylate cyclase in other cell components such as Golgi. The electron microscopic studies of fractions supported the biochemical studies with enzyme markers. Soluble guanylate cyclase had typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to GTP and had an apparent Km for GTP of 35 muM. Ca-2+ stimulated the soluble activity in the presence of low concentrations of Mn-2+. The properties of guanylate cyclase in plasma membranes and microsomes were similar except that Ca-2+ inhibited the activity associated with plasma membranes and had no effect on that of microsomes. Both particulate enzymes were allosteric in nature; double reciprocal plots of velocity versus GTP were not linear, and Hill coefficients for preparations of plasma membranes and microsomes were calculated to be 1.60 and 1.58, respectively. The soluble and particulate enzymes were inhibited by ATP, and inhibition of the soluble enzyme was slightly greater. While Mg-2+ was less effective than Mn-2+ as a sole cation, all enzyme fractions were markedly stimulated with Mg-2+ in the presence of a low concentration of Mn-2+. Triton X-100 increased the activity of particulate fractions about 3- to 10-fold and increased the soluble activity 50 to 100%."
https://openalex.org/W1588801326,"Guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP)-dependent protein kinase was assayed with calf thymus histone as substrate and partially purified from the soluble fraction of bovine cerebellum. The enzyme was selectively activated by cyclic GMP at lower concentrations; the Ka value for cyclic GMP was 1.7 times 10- minus 8 M whereas that for adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) was 1.0 times 10- minus 6 M. The Km value for ATP was 1.0 times 10- minus 5 M. A high concentration of Mg-2+ (100 mM) was needed for maximum stimulation by cyclic GMP and maximum reaction rate. The pH optimum was 7.5 to 8.0. The isoelectric point was pH 5.7. The molecular weight was about 140,000 as estimated by gel filtration. The enzyme was unable to activate muscle glycogen phosphorylase kinase, and was clearly distinguishable from cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in kinetic and catalytic properties. Comparative data on cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases in this tissue are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1605959992,"A poly(A) polymerase has been purified from the soluble protein fraction of calf thymus gland. The activity is cytoplasmic and nonparticulate. Mn-2+ATP is the preferred substrate. On the basis of disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels, gel filtration, and sedimentation velocity in sucrose gradients, the enzyme has a molecular weight of 62,000 and appears to consist of one polypeptide chain. The enzyme preparation is shown to be nearly homogeneous by disc gel electrophoresis and isoelectric-focusing. The activity has a pI of about 7.4. The specific activity of the enzyme is about 1700 mumol per hour per mg of protein, giving a turnover number of about 1800 mol of substrate per mol of enzyme min- minus 1. The activity is highly specific for ATP and is inhibited by other ribonucleoside triphosphates. It is sensitive to high levels of RNA-polymerase inhibitors. Km for oligoadenylate is 50 muM in the presence of Mn-2+ and 200 muM in Mg-2+ and equivalent Vmax is achieved with either metal ion. The initiator function may be filled by a variety of oligoribonucleotides having a free 3'-OH."
https://openalex.org/W1497680908,"Two forms of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthetase (designated I and II) have been identified in extracts of Escherichia coli. Synthetase I corresponds to the condensing enzyme that was studied earlier (GREENSPAN, M.D., ALBERTS, A.W., and VAGELOS, P.R. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 6477-6485); synthetase II represents a new form of the enzyme. Synthetase II was isolated as a homogeneous protein. It differs from synthetase I in having a higher molecular weight (76,999 versus 66,000), a lower pH optimum (5.5 to 6.1 versus 7.2), and a greater resistance to denaturation by heat. Synthetase II is similar to synthetase I in that both are inactivated by iodoacetamide, and prior incubation of the enzymes with fatty acyl thioesters prevents the inhibitory effect of iodoacetamide. Both also react with a fatty acyl thioester to form an acyl-enzyme intermediate, and the latter reacts with malonyl-ACP to form a beta-ketoacyl thioester. Specificity studies indicated that synthetase II, like synthetase I, has similar affinities with saturated and cis unsaturated fatty acyl thioesters of ACP that are intermediates in the synthesis of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, respectively. The two synthetases differ only with respect to reactivity with palmitoleyl thioesters: synthetase II has a lower Km and higher Vmax than synthetase I with palmitoleyl-ACP. This finding suggests that synthetase II functions specifically in the elongation of palmitoleyl-ACP to form cis-vaccenyl-ACP. An investigation of synthetases I and II in two classes of unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs revealed that synthetase I is absent in one class, fabB. Addition of wild type synthetase I to fabB fatty acid synthetase, which synthesizes only saturated fatty acids, permitted this fatty acid synthetase to synthesize unsaturated fatty acids. These experiments indicate that synthetase I plays a critical role in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1497081127,"Toluene treatment of Escherichia coli B makes it possible to measure adenylate cyclase activity directly using [alpha-32-P]-ATP as substrate. In contrast to French press extracts, the activity of adenylate cyclase in toluene-treated cells shows many of the characteristics of the enzyme seen in the intact cell. In both toluene-treated and intact cells the activity of adenylate cyclase is inhibited at least 85% by glucose, while in French press extracts the enzyme activity is much lower and is not sensitive to inhibition by glucose. In toluene-treated cells, glucose inhibits at 10 muM, and the effect is rapid in onset and readily reversible. The activity is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate suggesting that glucose is responsible for the inhibition. The measurement of the activity and sensitivity to glucose of adenylate cyclase in toluene-treated cells requires the presence of potassium phosphate in the assay medium. Since it does not increase the activity or sensitivity of the enzyme in the French press extract, it is suggested that potassium phosphate is required for the maintenance of cellular integrity necessary for the activity and sensitivity of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1535871014,"A microsomal fraction from seedlings of Sorghum bicolor (Linn) Moench has been shown to catalyze the conversion of L-tyrosine to p-hydroxymandelonitrile via p-hydroxyphenylacetaldoxime. This transformation is consistent with the general pathway for cyanogenic glycoside biosynthesis proposed on the basis of in vivo experiments. When the microsomal fraction was combined with a protein fraction from the soluble portion of the cell and uridine diphosphate glucose, it was possible to demonstrate the synthesis of the cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin from L-tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W2116200052,"The kinetic characteristics of substrate utilization by hepatic adenylate cyclase were investigated under a variety of incubation conditions, including veriations in pH, [substrate], [Mg2+], and in the absence or presence of glucagon. Activities were compared with ATP and 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (App(NH)p) as substrates. The Km for both substrates was about 50 muM; Vmax given with App(NH)p was about 40% lower than obtained with ATP as substrate. In the presence of a saturating concentration of substrate (1 mM), basal activity was increased 4-fold by increasing [Mg2+] from 5 to 50 mM. The stimulatory effect of Mg2+ was not due to an allosteric action since basal activity was only marginally enhanced (40%) when the substrate concentration was reduced to 10 muM. As suggested by deHaen ((1974 J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2756), it is likely that Mg2+ increases enzyme activity by decreasing the concentration of an inhibitory, unchelated form of substrate that competes with the productive magnesium-substrate complex at the active site. Activity-pH profiles differed with ATP and App(NH)p as substrates; a shift in pH optimum was observed which correlated with the different pKa of the terminal phosphate groups of ATP and App(nh)p, and which reflect the concentration of protonated substrate (ATPH-3 minus) present in the incubation medium. Accordingly, protonated substrate is the predominant inhibitory species of unchelated substrate and probably has a considerably higher affinity for the active site than does the magnesium-substrate complex. Glucagon-stimulated activity was less susceptible to inhibition by protonated substrate than is the basal state as evidenced by lower stimulatory effect when the [Mg2+] was increased from 5 to 20 mM. However, increasing the [Mg2+] from 20 to 50 mM resulted in marked inhibition of glucagon-stimulated activity, particularly in the presence of 10 muM substrate. Conversely, at a fixed [Mg2+], concentrations of substrate at least 20-fold higher than the Km were required to achieve maximal hormone-stimulated activity. These findings suggest that the unchelated, fully ionized form of substrate serves as an activating ligand, as has been observed with guanine nucleotides at considerably lower concentrations. Thus, Mg2+ affects adenylate cyclase activity by forming the productive substrate complex and by titrating the inhibitory protonated and activating free forms of substrate. As a result of these effects of unchelated substrate, it proved difficult to evaluate the kinetic parameters involved in substrate binding and utilization and the effects of hormone thereon when substrate was added as the only source of activating ligand. However, linear Michaelis kinetic data were obtained by adding the activating ligand 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate with glucagon and by making appropriate adjustments of pH and [Mg2+]. Vmax was increased 4-fold without changes in Km by the actions of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate and glucagon."

The enzyme appears to be composed of 3 subunits of identical molecular weight (27,000 per subunit).

https://openalex.org/W178024736,"Yeast tRNA-Phe has been cross-linked photochemically to three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, and E. coli valyl-tRNA synthetase. The two non-cognate enzymes are known to interact with tRNA-Phe. In each complex, three regions on the tRNA are found to cross-link. Two of these are common to all of the complexes, while the third is unique to each. Thus, the cognate and non-cognate complexes bear considerable similarity to each other in the way in which the respective enzyme orients on tRNA-Phe, a result which was also established for the complexes of E. coli tRNA-Ile (BUDZIK, G.P., LAM, S.M., SCHOEMAKER, H.J.P., and SCHIMMEL, P.R. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4433-4439). The common regions include a piece extending from the 5'-side of the acceptor stem to the beginning of the dihydrouridine helix, and a segment running from the 3' side of the extra loop into the TpsiC helix. These two regions overlap with and include some of the homologous bases found in eight tRNAs aminoacylated by yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (ROE, B., SIROVER, M., and DUDOCK, B. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 4146-4153). Although well separated in the primary and secondary structure, these two segments are in close proximity in the crystallographic tertiary structure. In two of the complexes, the third cross-linked fragment is near to the two common ones. The picture which emerges is that the enzymes all interact with the general area in which the two helical branches of the L-shaped tertiary structure fuse together, with additional interactions on other parts of the tRNAas well."
https://openalex.org/W1646513942,"Insulin was enzymatically moniodinated with 127-I or 125-I, and an improved method of purification by anion exchange chromatography was employed. (127-I)Monoiodoinsulin was identified by spectrophotometric analysis and its molar extinction coefficient determined to be 6.31 times 10-3 M-1 cm minus 1. The observed specific activity of carrier-free (125-I)monoidoinsulin was close to the theoretical value (378mCi/mg). The monoiodotyrosyl residue of monoidoinsulin was shown to be solvent-exposed. The ionic properties of the substituted hormone were altered at pH values close to the pK of monoiodotyrosine (8.85), but the pI was unchanged (5.65). (127-I)Monoiodoinsulin formed rhombohedral crystals and co-crystallized with native insulin. Monoidoinsulin was indistinguishable from insulin with respect to binding to two out of three guinea pig anti-insulin sera, to binding to IM9 cultured human lymphocytes, and to binding to isolated rat hepatocyte plasma membranes. The potency of monoidoinsulin was not statistically different from that of insulin in the rat fat cell bioassay and in the mouse convulsion assay. An insulin-degrading enzyme extracted from rat liver degraded monoiodoinsulin less readily than native insulin; monoiodoinsulin was a competitive inhibitor of insulin degradation, and the Km values were 30 nM AND 78 NM for monoidoinsulin and native insulin, respectively. It is concluded that monoidination does not markedly alter the three-dimensional structure of the molecule and that only a few sensitive biological systems are able to distinguish the monoidinated from the native hormone."

The activity of the enzyme UDP-Gal:Gm2 galactosyltransferase was reduced to between 2.7 and 14.3% of normal in the transformed clones. Other ganglioside glycosyltransferase activities were unaffected. This enzymatic change was consistent with the observed alteration in ganglioside pattern in the transformed cells. The residual galactosyltransferase activity in the transformed cells was kinetically similar to the normal enzyme, suggesting that transformation alters ganglioside biosynthesis by blocking enzyme synthesis at the translational or transcriptional levels."

This procedure yields a crystalline pure enzyme with a 45% recovery of the activity in crude cell-free extracts. The yield is significantly higher than that reported for this enzyme. The purified enzyme appears to be homogeneous in ultracentrifugation (s-o20, w equals 10.2 S) and isoelectric focusing (pI equals 6.13). The purified enzyme showed two bands on disc gel electrophoresis, both carrying out the deimination of L-arginine. Electrophoresis in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol plus Na dodecyl-SO4 gave a single band (Mr, 54,000). Specific activity of this enzyme was 58.8 mumol of L-citrulline formed per min per mg of protein at 37 degrees. The optimum pH of the purified enzyme was 6.0 and maximal activity was obtained at 50 degrees. The molecular weight of the native protein was 130,000 by gel filtration and 120,000 by sedimentation-equilibrium measurements. The spectrum of the pure enzyme showed absorption maximum at 280 nm and the value of E-1%-1 CM AT 280 NM WAS 10.48 IN 0.05 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The crystalline enzyme hydrolyzed several L-arginine analogues. L-Homoarginine, L-alpha-amino-gamma-guanidinobutyric acid, and L-alpha-amino-beta-guanidinopropionic acid competitively inhibited the hydrolysis of L-arginine with Ki values of 25.7, 7.5, and 4.0 times 10- minus 3 M, respectively. p-Chloromercuribenzoate, Ag-+, and Hg-2+, and several metal ions inhibited the enzyme."

Slight additional purification of malic enzyme was achieved with preparative disc electrophoresis. The specific activities of the purified rat liver malic enzyme from the least two steps were between 28.0 and 30.5 units per mg of protein. Homogeneity of the purified enzyme was determined by disc and starch gel electrophoresis as well as sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies. The molecular weight and S20, w values of rat liver malic enzyme are 268,000 and 10.2, respectively.

A comparison of deuteron and proton relaxation rates revealed an order of magnitude primary isotope effect and a small inverse secondary isotope effect on the escape rate of protons from the heme iron into bulk water establishing the exchange of protons and not the exchange of the entire water molecule to be the chemical mechanism of the entire water molecule to be the chemical mechanism of the exchange process. With fluoromethemoglobin, the relaxation rate is in the fast exchange region. The results can be understood in terms of a water molecule interacting with the heme iron at an iron to proton distance less than 3.4 A in aquomethemoglobin and a single proton at a distance of 4.11 A assignable to the NH proton of the distal histidine imidazole group in fluoromethemoglobin. The relaxation rates are pH-dependent and normal titrations with Hill coefficients n = 1 are observed. The pKa is less than or equal to 6. 7 with aquomethemoglobin and 8.5 with fluoromethemoglobin at 30 degrees C. The binding of inositol hexaphosphate in stoichiometric amounts has no significant effect on the magnetic susceptibility of solutions of aquomethemoglobin and fluoromethemoglobin, but in the former case it increases koff to 3.8 times 10-4 per s by lowering the H+ barrier to 6.8 Cal per mol. In fluoromethemoglobin, inositol hexaphosphate decreases the iron to distal histidine NH distance by 0.17 A and the electron relaxation time taus by 10% as determined by the frequency dependence of 1/T1. In the aquomethemoglobin system, inositol hexaphosphate induces a Bohr effect, raising the pKa of the ionization responsible for the 1/T1 titration to 7.2, and induces cooperativity in the pH titration with a Hill coeffocoemt n = 2.8 plus or minus 0.1. With fluoromethemoglobin, the normal pH titration curve is unaffected by inositol hexaphosphate (n approximately equal to 1). Further, relaxivity titrations with varying amounts of azide and fluoride near neutral pH show normal behavior (n = 1) with and without inositol hexaphosphate. These results indicated that inositol hexaphosphate alters the quaternary structure of methemoglobin to the deoxy conformation without causing a change in the spin state of the heme iron..."

https://openalex.org/W1530333855,"The observed equilibrium constant (Kobs) for the reaction of choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) has been determined under physiological conditions. Using sigma and square brackets to indicate total concentrations of all ionic species present: (see article). The value of Kobs has been determined to be 12.3 plus or minus 0.6 at 38 degrees, pH 7.0 and ionic strength 0.25 M. The value at 25 degrees is not significantly different, and the constant has been found to be insensitive to variations in ionic strength (0.03 to 0.375 M), pH (6.5 TO 7.5) OR FREE [Mg-2+] (0 to 5 mM). The Kobs of this reaction reflects the difference between the observed standard free energy change (delta G-oobs) for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine and the delta G-oobs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA. Since the delta G-oobs for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA has been previously determined to be minus 8.54 kcal/mol (minus 35.75 kJ/mol under the same physiological conditions, the delta G-oobs for the reaction of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7): (SEE ARTICLE).

https://openalex.org/W1539099005,"Temperature jump and stopped flow methods were used to study at pH 7.0 the temperature dependence of elementary steps of the reactions of lysozyme with the beta(1 yields 4)-linked trimer, tetramer, and hexamer of N-acetylglucosamine. The steady state rate of cleavage of the hexasaccharide was determined as a function of temperature (5 degrees-40 degrees) and pH(2 to 8) in H-2O solution and as a function of pD(2.5 to 9.5) at 40 degrees in D-2O solution. The apparent enthalpies of the two ionizations of apparent pK 3.8 and 6.7 observed in measurements of k are 0 to 2 kcal/mol. The energy of activation determined for the pH optimum is 21.5 kcal/mol. The solvent deuterium isotope effect measured for k at the pH (pD) optimum is 1.5 And reflects isotope effects on pre-equilibrium steps and on the rate-determining step. Transfer from H-2O to D-2O solution produces 0.2 to 0.4 kcal/mol more negative free energies of saccharide binding and no changes in the enthalpies of binding. Pre-steady state, steady state, and equilibrium measurements indicate a pathway for the reaction of lysozyme with hexasaccharide. The results define for this mechanism the complete free energy profile and an essentially complete enthalpy profile. Three of the five observable ES complexes are present at nearly equal concentrations. The free energies of the transition states are within a range of 3 kcal. The enthalpies of productive enzyme-substrate complexes are about 5 kcal/mol greater than the enthalpies of nonproductive complexes. Changes in tryptophan fluorescence were observed for each elementary step, and changes in pK of Glu-35 for the isomerizations of nonproductive and productive complexes. The signal changes during formation of nonproductive complexes are the same for the oligosaccharides (ClcNAc)3 to (GlcNAc)6. The changes for productive complexes are similar but not identical with saccharides (GlcNAc)4 to (GlcNAc)6. Correlations of the present data with previous crystallographic and solution measurements indicate the structures of productive and nonproductive ES complexes and suggest that full interaction of the substrate with the enzyme active site is established in the rate-determining step."
https://openalex.org/W1577208467,"Similarities in properties of ribulose diphosphate carboxylase and oxygenase activities further substantiate the hypothesis that the same protein catalyzes both reactions. The Km (ribulose diphosphate) is 0.33 mM for the ribulose diphosphate oxygenase, when assayed in air with an oxygen electrode. Maximum activity is obtained with 10 to 35 mM MgCl2. Higher MgCl2 concentrations are inhibitory, but they shift the pH optimum from 9.3 or 9.4 to 8.7 or 9.0. MnCl2 is an effective cofactor of the oxygenase and some activity is obtained with CoCl2. Both the ribulose diphosphate carboxylase and oxygenase activity of the purified protein from spinach leaves are slowly inactivated by storage at 0 degrees and reactivated in 10 min at 50 degrees, provided both 25 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM dithiothreitol are present. The sulfhydryl groups of the enzyme which react rapidly with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) are approximately 4 at pH 7.8 and 11 at pH 9.4. At both pH values ribulose diphosphate prevents two of these sulfhydryl groups from reacting with this reagent. About 50% inhibition of the oxygenase activity at pH 9.0 occurs with 50 mM bicarbonate in the presence of 3 mM ribulose diphosphate, and from variations in these parameters the inhibition is attributed to the CO2 species. The purified enzyme of acrylamide gels prevented the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium in the presence of the superoxide radical, but the enzyme in solution did not react as a superoxide dismutase."

This separation requires a careful control of temperature, ionic strength, pH, and column flow rate for success. The yield of subunit II is further improved by transacetylation (with acetyl-CoA) of the dissociated fatty acid synthetase prior to affinity chromatography. The separated subunit I (reductase) contains the 4'-phosphopantetheine (A2) acyl binding site, two NADPH binding sites, and beta-ketoacyl and crotonyl thioester reductases. Subunit II (transacylase) contains the B1 (hydroxyl or loading) and B2 (cysteine) acyl binding sites, and acetyl- and malonyl-CoA: pantetheine transacylases. When subunit I is mixed in equimolar quantities with subunit II, an additional NADPH binding site is found even though subunit II alone shows no NADPH binding. Both subunits contain activities for the partial reactions, beta-hydroxybutyryl thioester dehydrase (crotonase) and palmityl-CoA deacylase. Subunit I has 8 sulfhydryl groups per mol whereas subunit II has 60. Reconstitution of fatty acid synthetase activity to 75% of the control level is achieved on reassociation of subunits I and II."

The molecular weight of the enzyme, estimated by gel filtration, was approximately 32,500. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis in 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate showed the presence of two apparently identical subunits of 17,000 molecular weight. The amino acid composition indicated a large excess of glutamic acid and aspartic acid over other amino acid residues and a very low content of tyrosine and tryptophan. Th SH groups analysis performed with 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) on thenative protein as well as in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate showed the existence of one sulfhydryl group per mole of enzyme. Uridine nucleosidase is active on uridine and 5-methyluridine (ribosylthymine) resulting inactive toward all other pyrimidine and purine nucleosides tested. The Km values for uridine and 5-methyluridine were 0.86 x 10(-3) M and 1.66x10--3M, respectively. The optimal pH is around 7.0. The isoelectric point is 5.1.

Hexanoyl-enzyme contains 2 mol of hexanoate/mol of enzyme (molecular weight 66,000); it is liable at alkaline pH, and it reacts with neutral hydroxylamine to form hexanoyl hydroxamic acid. Hexanoate was cleaved from the enzyme when hexanoyl-enzyme was subjected to performic acid oxidation. These properties indicate that hexanoyl-enzyme is a thioester. Studies of the circular dichroism spectra of fully acylated and nonacylated forms of the enzyme indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme is relatively unperturbed by the presence of the hexanoyl groups. An alpha helical content of 65% was estimated for the enzyme from the circular dichroism spectrum. Hexanoyl-enzyme is active in both partial reactions that comprise the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase reaction; it reacts with ACP to form hexanoyl-ACP and with malonyl-ACP to form beta-ketooctanoyl-ACP. Although the hexanoate of hexanoyl-enzyme is transferred very rapidly to ACP, the physiological acceptor in this reaction, it is also transferred very slowly to CoA, dithiothreitol, and 2-mercaptoethanol, indicating that the enzyme can react nonspecifically with a number of unrelated mercaptans."

The initial modification is accompanied by a shift of the pH for maximal enzymatic activity from pH 7.2 to pH 5.5 Upon further treatment with N-bromosuccinimide, the activity is gradually reduced from 60 to 0% as tryptophan residues become oxidized. An NBS to enzyme mole ratio of approximately 20 results in 90% inactivation of the enzyme. When the enzyme is titrated with NBS in 6 M guanidine HCl, 5 mol of tryptophan react per mol of enzyme, a result in agreement with the total tryptophan content as determined by magnetic circular dichroism. The 40% NBS-inactivated sample posses full binding capacity for methotrexate and reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide, and the Km values for dihydrofolate and TPNH are the same as for the native enzyme. After 90% inactivation, only half of the enzyme molecules bind methotrexate, and the dissociation constant for methotrexate is 40 nM as compared to 4 nM for native enzyme in solutions of 0.1 M ionic strength, pH 7.2 Also, TPNH is not bound as tightly to the modified enzyme-methotrexate complex as to the unmodified enzyme-methotrexate complex. Circular dichroism studies indicate the 90% NBS-inactivated enzyme has the same alpha helix content as the native enzyme but less beta structure, while the 40% inactivated enzyme is essentially the same as the native enzyme. Protection experiments were complicated by the fact that NBS reacts with the substrates and cofactors of the enzyme. Although protection of specific residues was not determined, it was clear that TPNH was partially protected from NBS reaction when bound to the enzyme, and the enzyme, and the enzyme was not inactivated by NBS until the TPNH had reacted."

https://openalex.org/W1532105712,"The very low level of postillumination ATP synthesis in chromatophores was markedly stimulated when permeant anions (thiocyanate or perchlorate) or permeant cations (potassium in the presence of valinomycin) were added to the light stage. Although these compounds stimulated also light-induced proton uptake in chromatophores the pH dependence of both photoreactions was different. Proton uptake peaked at pH 6.5 while the amount of postillumination ATP was maximal when the light stage was carried out around pH 7.7. The increased yield of ATP at the more alkaline pH could not be explained by a slower decay of the high energy state at this pH, since the decay rate was faster at pH 7.7 than at pH 6.5. The proton concentration gradient which is maintained across the chromatophore membrane in the light was also found to increase when the external pH was raised from 6.0 to 8.0. Only a minimal amount of postillumination ATP was formed when this gradient was below 2.1 pH units, but above this value the ATP yield rose steeply as a function of the increasing pH gradient. In light of these results it is suggested that in order to obtain a high yield of postillumination ATP synthesis in chromatophores two conditions are required: the particles have to be loaded with a sufficient number of protons and a light-induced pH gradient above a certain threshold value has to be maintained across their membrane. The low yield of postillumination ATP in chromatophores and the increase obtained by adding permeating ions, is thus explained by similar variations in the extent of the pH gradient, which exceeded the threshold value only in the presence of the permeating ions."

These series include: (a) formylheptapeptides of the basic structure, HCO-GLY3-L-Gln-Gly3. A single L-leucine residue was systematically substituted for glycine at a different position in each peptide; (b) formyltripeptides of the basic structure, HCO-Gly-L-Gln-Gly. L-Leucine was substituted for glycine in each position and in both positions; (c) various N-acyl derivatives of the dipeptide, L-Gln-Gly. Comparison of the values of the kinetic constants for methylamine incorporation and for hydroxylamine incorporation with the peptide derivatives shows that the length of the peptide chain has a pronounced influence on catalysis, as does the position of the leucine residue in the longer chain peptide derivatives. The kcat/Km(app) values for each substrate calculated from data for methylamine incorporation and from those for hydroxylamine incorporation were found to be in good agreement. However, both the observed maximum velocity and the apparent Michaelis constant for each peptide derivative were significantly larger for hydroxylamine incorporation than for methylamine incorporation. Interpretation of these findings as evidence for a normal catalytic mechanism for each amine incorporation reaction and for the limiting nature of deacylation to methylamine is discussed. Two observations caution against such an interpretation. These are the significantly higher inhibitor constants found fo formylhexaglycine and for several other competitive inhibitors in the hydroxylamine incorporation reaction, and earlier findings of higher turnover values with hyroxylamine in cases were acylation appears to be limiting for methylamine incorporation.

This mutant has properties that follow the predictions of the autogregulatory model previously proposed for the control of synthesis of the isoleucine-valine biosynthetic enzymes. The autoregulatory model specifies that L-threonine deaminase participates in the control of the expression of the ilv ADE gene cluster as well as the ilv B gene and ilv C gene, which constitute three separate units of regulation. The single mutation in strain CU18 results in altered regulation of ilv gene expression and in the production of an altered L-threonine deaminase. The immature form of the enzyme purified from mutant CU18 exhibits an altered response to L-valine, a maturation-inducing ligand. The native form of the mutant is altered in its apparent Km for L-threonine and in its response to the effects of L-valine and L-isoleucine upon catalytic activity. The mutant and wild type L-threonine deaminases differ in the apoenzyme formed as a consequence of alkaline dialysis. Dialysis of the mutant enzyme yields an apoenzyme mixture, apparently of dimers and monomers, while the wild type enzyme yields only dimers. The CU18 L-threonine deaminase, is however, indistinguishable from the wild type enzyme in molecular weight and subunit composition."
