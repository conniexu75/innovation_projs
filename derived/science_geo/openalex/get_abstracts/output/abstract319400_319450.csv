https://openalex.org/W2052571748,"Most plant genes that control complex traits of tissues, organs, and whole plants are uncharacterized. Plant height, structure of reproductive organs, seed development and germination, for example, are traits of great agronomic importance. However, in the absence of knowledge of the gene products, current molecular approaches to isolate these important genes are limited. Infection of germinating seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana with Agrobacterium results in transformed lines in which the integrated T-DNA from Agrobacterium and its associated kanamycin-resistance trait cosegregate with stable, phenotypic alterations. A survey of 136 transformed lines produced plants segregating in a manner consistent with Mendelian predictions for phenotypes altered in height, flower structure, trichomes, gametogenesis, embryogenesis, and seedling development. This report is the characterization of a dwarf mutant in which the phenotype is inherited as a single recessive nuclear mutation that cosegregates with both the kanamycin-resistance trait and the T-DNA insert."

This concept has been tested in the portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 34 degrees and 45 degrees (Azores hot spot). Peridotite and basalt data indicate that the upper mantle in the hot spot has undergone a high degree of melting relative to the mantle elsewhere in the North Atlantic. However, application of various geothermometers suggests that the temperature of equilibration of peridotites in the mantle was lower, or at least not higher, in the hot spot than elsewhere. The presence of H(2)O-rich metasomatized mantle domains, inferred from peridotite and basalt data, would lower the melting temperature of the hot spot mantle and thereby reconcile its high degree ofmelting with the lack of a mantle temperature anomaly. Thus, some so-called hot spots might be melting anomalies unrelated to abnormally high mantle temperature or thermal plumes."

Multiples of the haploid nuclear genome complement (1C) corresponding to 2C, 4C, 8C, 16C, 32C, and 64C were observed. The distribution of nuclei among the different ploidy levels is tissue-specific and in leaves is characteristic of the stage of development. This type of genome organization has been identified in eight other succulent CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism) plant species with small genomes. Multiploidy may be a common property of this type of plant."

The Boran people of Kenya claim that they can deduce the direction and the distance to the nest as well as their own arrival at the nest from the bird's flight pattern, perching height, and calls. Analyses of the behavior of guiding birds confirmed these claims."
https://openalex.org/W2088891125,"Changes in the copper K-edge x-ray absorption spectrum of YBa2Cu3O7 across the critical temperature indicate that, accompanying the superconducting transition, the mean square relative displacement of some fraction of the Cu2-O4 bonds becomes smaller or more harmonic (or both), that there may be a slight increase in the associated Cu1-O4 distance, and that electronic states involving these atom pairs become more atomic-like. If there is an association between the superconductivity and this lattice instability, then the bridging axial oxygen is of central importance in determining the high transition temperature of YBa2Cu3O7. Because this structural perturbation will affect the dynamic polarizability of the copper oxygen sublattice, it is consistent with an excitonic pairing mechanism in these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2077769725,"Absorption of pulsed laser radiation by a single particle generates a photoacoustic wave whose time profile can be measured with a wideband pressure transducer. Solution of the wave equation for pressure in one, two, and three dimensions shows that the photoacoustic wave is determined by the geometry and dimensions of the particle, and by its sound speed and density relative to the fluid that surrounds it. Photoacoustic waves, referred to here as signatures, are reported in experiments in which fluid droplets, cylinders, and layers are irradiated with 10-nanosecond laser pulses."
https://openalex.org/W2028537533,"The Archean Kolar Schist Belt, south India, is a suture zone where two gneiss terranes and at least two amphibolite terranes with distinct histories were accrted. Amphibolites from the eastern and western sides of the schist belt have distinct incompatible element and isotopic characteristics sugesting that their volcanic protoliths were derived from dint mantle sources. The amphibolite and gneiss terranes were juxtaposed by horizontal compression and shearing between 2530 and 2420 million years ago (Ma) along a zone marked by the Kolar Schist Belt. This history of accretion of discrete crustal terranes resembles those of Phanerozoic convergent margins and thus suggests that plate tectonics operated on Earth by 2500 Ma."
https://openalex.org/W2063597804,"A stock market is said to be efficient if it accurately reflects all relevant information in determining security prices. Critics have asserted that share prices are far too volatile to be explained by changes in objective economic events-the October 1987 crash being a case in point. Although the evidence is not unambiguous, reports of the death of the efficient market hypothesis appear premature."

https://openalex.org/W1982842759,"Exceptionally small spheres (nanospheres) of hematite (diameters between 120 and 200 nanometers) occur in the Marra Mamba Iron Formation of the Hamersley Basin, Australia. The nanospheres are clustered into small aggregates and may have formed by structural ordering and dehydration of colloidal iron hydroxide particles. Individual spheres consist of numerous thin, curved hematite platelets surrounding a central void that is approximately half the diamter of the sphere; this texture suggests that they formed by a volume reduction of the original colloidal particles by approximately 12.5%. The occurrence of hematite nanospheres supports the hypothesis that some ofthe iron was deposited colloidally during the development ofbanded iron formations, approximately 2.5 billion years ago."

Special attention is given to velocity distributions in the beam and scattering gas. Conversion of data to the center- of-mass system, apparatus, scope of thermal molecular-beam-scattering studies, and recent advances in elastic scattering at thermal energies are discussed. 75 references are included.

https://openalex.org/W2047752855,"The field of atmospheric chemistry is data-limited, primarily because of the challenge of measuring the key chemical constituents in the global environment. Several recent advances, however, in rugged, portable, remotesensing, ground-based instrumentation and accurate, fast-response airborne instrumentation have provided powerful tools for the understanding of stratospheric ozone, particularly in polar regions. Current discoveries of the role of heterogeneous chemical processes point to the need for better techniques for characterization of stratospheric aerosols. In the troposphere, advances in in situ, sensitive methods for detecting reactive nitrogen compounds have demonstrated the role that these compounds have in controlling global oxidation processes, but better measurements of the reservoir species by which the long-ranged transport of pollutant-reactive nitrogen compounds is thought to occur are urgently needed. The role of hydrocarbons, particularly those of natural origin, in ozone formation in rural areas has focused attention on the requirement for better speciation of these ubiquitous compounds. Lastly, rigorous instrument intercomparison experiments have provided unbiased estimates of measurement capabilities."

https://openalex.org/W1999521692,"Developed for the oil industry, well logging instrumentation based on electrical, acoustic, and nuclear measurements has been providing information about the localization and evaluation of hydrocarbon-bearing strata for petroleum geologists and engineers since 1927. This method of exploring properties of the earth's crust without taking physical samples is attracting a growing audience of geologists and geophysicists because of recent developments that permit nondestructive measurements of subsurface geochemistry. A combination of nuclear measurement techniques, which use gamma ray and neutron sources, can provide detailed information on rock composition of interest to both industry and academia."
