https://openalex.org/W2803328587,"Kaempferol (kae) and its glycosides are widely distributed in nature and show multiple bioactivities, yet few reports have compared them. In this paper, we report the antitumor, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity differences of kae, kae-7-O-glucoside (kae-7-O-glu), kae-3-O-rhamnoside (kae-3-O-rha) and kae-3-O-rutinoside (kae-3-O-rut). Kae showed the highest antiproliferation effect on the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, mouse colon cancer cell line CT26 and mouse melanoma cell line B16F1. Kae also significantly inhibited AKT phosphorylation and cleaved caspase-9, caspase-7, caspase-3 and PARP in HepG2 cells. A kae-induced increase in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity, inhibition of concanavalin A (Con A)-induced activation of T cell proliferation and NO or ROS production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were also seen. Kae glycosides were used to produce kae via environment-friendly enzymatic hydrolysis. Kae-7-O-glu and kae-3-O-rut were hydrolyzed to kae by β-glucosidase and/or α-L-rhamnosidase. This paper demonstrates the application of enzymatic catalysis to obtain highly biologically active kae. This work provides a novel and efficient preparation of high-value flavone-related products."
https://openalex.org/W2804763780,"Macrophages play crucial roles in innate immune response and in the priming of adaptive immunity, and are characterized by their phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. Reprogramming intracellular metabolism in response to microenvironmental signals is required for M1/M2 macrophage polarization and function. Here we assessed the influence of iron on the polarization of the immune response in vivo and in vitro. Iron-enriched diet increased M2 marker Arg1 and Ym1 expression in liver and peritoneal macrophages, while iron deficiency decreased Arg1 expression. Under LPS-induced inflammatory conditions, low iron diet exacerbated the proinflammatory response, while the IL-12/IL-10 balance decreased with iron-rich diet, thus polarizing toward type 2 response. Indeed, in vitro macrophage iron loading reduced the basal percentage of cells expressing M1 co-stimulatory CD86 and MHC-II molecules. Further, iron loading of macrophages prevented the pro-inflammatory response induced by LPS through reduction of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation with decreased iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12 and TNFα expression. The increase of intracellular iron also reduced LPS-induced hepcidin gene expression and abolished ferroportin down-regulation in macrophages, in line with macrophage polarization. Thus, iron modulates the inflammatory response outcome, as elevated iron levels increased M2 phenotype and negatively regulated M1 proinflammatory LPS-induced response."
https://openalex.org/W2804384251,"Although counts of tweets citing academic papers are used as an informal indicator of interest, little is known about who tweets academic papers and who uses Twitter to find scholarly information. Without knowing this, it is difficult to draw useful conclusions from a publication being frequently tweeted. This study surveyed 1,912 users that have tweeted journal articles to ask about their scholarly-related Twitter uses. Almost half of the respondents (45%) did not work in academia, despite the sample probably being biased towards academics. Twitter was used most by people with a social science or humanities background. People tend to leverage social ties on Twitter to find information rather than searching for relevant tweets. Twitter is used in academia to acquire and share real-time information and to develop connections with others. Motivations for using Twitter vary by discipline, occupation, and employment sector, but not much by gender. These factors also influence the sharing of different types of academic information. This study provides evidence that Twitter plays a significant role in the discovery of scholarly information and cross-disciplinary knowledge spreading. Most importantly, the large numbers of non-academic users support the claims of those using tweet counts as evidence for the non-academic impacts of scholarly research."
https://openalex.org/W2805020365,"To examine the distribution of intraocular pressure (IOP) in a normal population and the associations of IOP with other ocular and systemic parameters.Out of 3468 participants of the population-based cross-sectional Beijing Eye Study 2011 we selected those individuals without glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The study particpants underwent a detailed ophthalmologic and systemic examination. IOP was measured by air puff non-contact tonometry.The study included 3135 eyes of 3135 participants with a mean age of 64.1 ± 9.6 years (mean ± standard deviation). The mean IOP was 14.7 ± 2.8 mmHg. The 95% percentile and 97.5% percentile of the IOP distribution decreased from 20 mmHg / 21 mmHg in individuals aged 40 to 54 years to 18 mmHg / 19 mmHg in individuals aged ≥80 years. In multivariable analysis, higher IOP was associated with the systemic parameters of younger age (P<0.001), higher blood concentration of glucose (P = 0.03) and triglycerides (P<0.001), higher diastolic blood pressure (P<0.001), higher pulse rate (P = 0.003) and higher quantity of alcohol consumption (P = 0.004), and with the ocular parameters of larger central corneal thickness (P<0.001), more myopic refractive error (P = 0.01) and steeper anterior corneal curvature radius (P = 0.006). IOP decreased significantly by 0.50 mmHg and 0.76 mmHg for each increase in age by 10 years and each increase in corneal curvature radius by 1.0 mm, respectively. The range of the mean ± 2 standard deviations of the IOP adjusted for the parameters of the multivariable model was 9.0 to 18.1 mmHg versus 9.2-20.2 mmHg for the unadjusted IOP. In the age group of 50 to 55 years, the age-adjusted IOP range (mean ± 2 standard deviations) was 9 to 18 mmHg, and in the age group of ≥75 years, it was 8 to 18 mmHg.IOP physiologically depends on a multitude of systemic and ocular factors including age and blood pressure. These physiological associations of the IOP may be taken into account in the definition of the normal range of the IOP."
https://openalex.org/W2803634998,"The marine environment in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia) is severely impacted by phosphate industries. Nowadays, three localities, Sfax, Skhira and Gabes produce phosphoric acid along the coasts of this Gulf and generate a large amount of phosphogypsum as a waste product. The Gabes phosphate industry is the major cause of pollution in the Gulf because most of the waste is directly discharged into the sea without preliminary treatment. This study investigates the marine environment in the proximity of the phosphate industries of Gabes and the coastal marine environment on the eastern coast of Djerba, without phosphate industry. This site can be considered as ""pristine"" and enables a direct comparison between polluted and ""clean"" adjacent areas. Phosphorous, by sequential extractions (SEDEX), Rock-Eval, C, H, N elemental analysis, and stable carbon isotope composition of sedimentary organic matter, X-ray diffraction (qualitative and quantitative analysis) were measured on sediments. Temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen were measured on the water close to the sea floor of each station to estimate environmental conditions. These analyses are coupled with video surveys of the sea floor. This study reveals clear differentiations in pollution and eutrophication in the investigated areas."
https://openalex.org/W2804060176,"Bacterial DNA has been reported in the placenta and amniotic fluid by several independent groups of investigators. However, it's taxonomic overlap with fetal and maternal bacterial DNA in different sites has been poorly characterized. Here, we determined the presence of bacterial DNA in the intestines and placentas of fetal mice at gestational day 17 (n = 13). These were compared to newborn intestines (n = 15), maternal sites (mouth, n = 6; vagina, n = 6; colon, n = 7; feces, n = 8), and negative controls to rule out contamination. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene indicated a pattern of bacterial DNA in fetal intestine similar to placenta but with higher phylogenetic diversity than placenta or newborn intestine. Firmicutes were the most frequently assignable phylum. SourceTracker analysis suggested the placenta as the most commonly identifiable origin for fetal bacterial DNA, but also over 75% of fetal gut genera overlapped with maternal oral and vaginal taxa but not with maternal or newborn feces. These data provide evidence for the presence of bacterial DNA in the mouse fetus."
https://openalex.org/W2803339298,"Nucleic acid material of adequate quality is crucial for successful high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analysis. DNA and RNA isolated from archival FFPE material are frequently degraded and not readily amplifiable due to chemical damage introduced during fixation. To identify optimal nucleic acid extraction kits, DNA and RNA quantity, quality and performance in HTS applications were evaluated. DNA and RNA were isolated from five sarcoma archival FFPE blocks, using eight extraction protocols from seven kits from three different commercial vendors. For DNA extraction, the truXTRAC FFPE DNA kit from Covaris gave higher yields and better amplifiable DNA, but all protocols gave comparable HTS library yields using Agilent SureSelect XT and performed well in downstream variant calling. For RNA extraction, all protocols gave comparable yields and amplifiable RNA. However, for fusion gene detection using the Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma Assay, the truXTRAC FFPE RNA kit from Covaris and Agencourt FormaPure kit from Beckman Coulter showed the highest percentage of unique read-pairs, providing higher complexity of HTS data and more frequent detection of recurrent fusion genes. truXTRAC simultaneous DNA and RNA extraction gave similar outputs as individual protocols. These findings show that although successful HTS libraries could be generated in most cases, the different protocols gave variable quantity and quality for FFPE nucleic acid extraction. Selecting the optimal procedure is highly valuable and may generate results in borderline quality specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2803245561,"Peri-implant infections are the most common cause of implant failure in modern dental implantology. These are caused by the formation of biofilms on the implant surface and consist of oral commensal and pathogenic bacteria, which harm adjacent soft and hard tissues and may ultimately lead to implant loss. In order to improve the clinical situation, there has to be a better understanding of biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces. Therefore, we successfully developed a system to cultivate an oral multispecies biofilm model in a flow chamber system, optimized for the evaluation of biofilm formation on solid materials by direct microscopic investigation. The model contains four relevant oral bacterial species: Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar and Porphyromonas gingivalis in ratios similar to the native situation. The reliability of the developed “Hanoverian Oral Multispecies Biofilm Implant Flow Chamber” (HOBIC) model was verified. Biofilm volume and live/dead distribution within biofilms were determined by fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microcopy (CLSM). The individual species distribution was analyzed using quantitative real time PCR with propidium monoazide pretreatment (PMA-qRT-PCR) and by urea-NaCl fluorescence in situ hybridization (urea-NaCl-FISH). This in vitro model may be used to analyze biofilm formation on dental implants in more detail and to develop future implant systems with improved material properties."
https://openalex.org/W2804366875,"Microvascular invasion (MVI) is regarded as one of the independent risk factors for recurrence and poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The presence of MVI in HCCs was evaluated on the basis of pathological reports of surgical specimens and was defined as tumor within a vascular space lined by endothelium that was visible only on microscopy. The aim of the study was to investigate the usefulness of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion weighted (DW) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in predicting MVI of HCC. Preoperative IVIM DW imaging and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of 51 patients were analyzed. Standard apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), D (the true diffusion coefficient), D* (the pseudodiffusion coefficient) and f (the perfusion fraction), relative enhancement (RE) and radiological features were evaluated and analyzed. Univariate analysis revealed that HCCs with MVI had a higher portion of an irregular tumor shape than HCCs without MVI (p = 0.009), the Standard ADC, D value were significantly lower in HCCs with MVI (p = 0.022, p = 0.007, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that an irregular shape (p = 0.012) and D value ≤ 1.16×10-3mm2/sec (p = 0.048) were independent predictors for MVI. Combining the two factors of an irregular shape and D value, a sensitivity of 94.4% and specificity of 63.6% for predicting MVI was obtained. In conclusion, we found that an irregular shape and D value ≤ 1.16×10-3mm2/sec may suggest the presence of MVI in HCCs."
https://openalex.org/W2804225483,"Sodium bicarbonate (SB) has been proposed as an ergogenic aid, as it improves high-intensity and resistance exercise performance. However, no studies have yet investigated SB application in CrossFit. This study examined the effects of chronic, progressive-dose SB ingestion on CrossFit-like performance and aerobic capacity.In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial, 21 CrossFit-trained participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups and underwent 2 trials separated by a 14-day washout period. Participants ingested either up to 150 mg∙kg-1 of SB in a progressive-dose regimen or placebo for 10 days. Before and after each trial, Fight Gone Bad (FGB) and incremental cycling (ICT) tests were performed. In order to examine biochemical responses, blood samples were obtained prior to and 3 min after completing each exercise test.No gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were reported during the entire protocol. The overall FGB performance improved under SB by ~6.1% (p<0.001) and it was ~3.1% higher compared to post placebo (PLApost) (p = 0.040). The number of repetitions completed in each round also improved under SB (mean from baseline: +5.8% to +6.4%). Moreover, in ICT, the time to ventilatory threshold (VT) (~8:25 min SBpost vs. ~8:00 min PLApost, p = 0.020), workload at VT (~218 W SBpost vs. ~208 W PLApost, p = 0.037) and heart rate at VT (~165 bpm SBpost vs. ~161 bpm PLApost, p = 0.030) showed higher SBpost than PLApost. Furthermore, the maximum carbon dioxide production increased under SB by ~4.8% (from ~3604 mL∙min-1 to ~3776 mL∙min-1, p = 0.049). Pyruvate concentration and creatine kinase activity before ICT showed higher SBpost than PLApost (~0.32 mmol∙L-1 vs. ~0.26 mmol∙L-1, p = 0.001; ~275 U∙L-1 vs. ~250 U∙L-1, p = 0.010, respectively). However, the small sample size limits the wide-application of our results.Progressive-dose SB ingestion regimen eliminated GI side effects and improved CrossFit-like performance, as well as delayed ventilatory threshold occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2964028041,"Results from a recent neuroimaging study on spoken sentence comprehension have been interpreted as evidence for cortical entrainment to hierarchical syntactic structure. We present a simple computational model that predicts the power spectra from this study, even though the model's linguistic knowledge is restricted to the lexical level, and word-level representations are not combined into higher-level units (phrases or sentences). Hence, the cortical entrainment results can also be explained from the lexical properties of the stimuli, without recourse to hierarchical syntax."
https://openalex.org/W2803122065,"Among 230,360 women with diagnosed HIV in the United States (U.S.), ~ 8,500 give birth annually, and unplanned pregnancies (as with HIV-negative women) are prevalent. However, unplanned pregnancies and contraceptive use among HIV-positive women have been understudied. To examine unplanned pregnancies and contraceptive use among HIV-positive women, we used 2013-2014 data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP), an HIV surveillance system that produces national estimates for HIV-positive adults in care in the U.S. (Pregnancy outcome dates were from years 1986-2015 for this cohort of women who were interviewed during 2013-2014; median year of reported pregnancy outcome was year 2003). Women in HIV care and diagnosed with HIV before age 45 (reproductive age) were included. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of unplanned pregnancies with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For women who were aged 18-44 years at time of interview, we computed weighted prevalences of contraceptive use (previous 12 months) by method, including permanent (i.e., sterilization), short-acting (i.e., pills, depo-progesterone acetate (DMPA)), long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) (i.e., implants), and barriers (i.e., condoms). Six hundred seventy-one women met criteria for the unplanned pregnancy analysis; median age at HIV diagnosis = 24.6 years, and 78.1% (CI:74.5-81.7) reported ≥ 1 unplanned pregnancy. Women reporting unplanned pregnancies were more likely to be non-Hispanic white (aPR = 1.20; CI 1.05-1.38) or non-Hispanic black (aPR = 1.14; CI 1.01-1.28) than Hispanic, to be above the poverty level (aPR = 1.09; CI 1.01-1.18), and to have not received care from an OB/GYN in the year before interview (aPR = 1.13; CI 1.04-1.22). Among 1,142 total pregnancies, 795 (69.6%) were live births; 70 (7.8%) were born HIV-positive; 42 (60%) of those born HIV-positive were unplanned pregnancies. For the contraceptives analysis (n = 957 women who were aged 18-44 at time of interview), 90.5% reported using at least one contraceptive, including 59.7% reporting barrier methods, 29.9% reporting permanent sterilization, and 22.8% reporting short-term methods in the previous year. LARC was used by only 5.3% of women. Women who reported use of LARC or DMPA were more likely to be aged 18-29 years (aPR = 3.08; CI 1.61-5.89) or 30-39 years (aPR = 2.86; CI 1.76-4.63) compared with women aged 40-44 years. Unplanned pregnancies were prevalent and LARC use was low; prevention efforts should strengthen pregnancy planning and contraceptive awareness for HIV-positive women during clinical visits."
https://openalex.org/W2804836515,"It has long been thought that biomedical doctoral students pursue careers primarily as tenure-track/tenured faculty at research institutions. Recent reports showed, however, that the majority of biomedical doctoral alumni engage in a variety of careers. Wayne State University (WSU) undertook a project to understand the career trajectories of its biomedical doctoral alumni to create programs to better prepare its students for careers in multiple pathways. Data were collected on career outcomes of WSU's biomedical doctoral alumni who graduated in a 15-year period from 1999-2014. Careers were classified into three tiers by Employment Sector, Career Types and Job Functions and career paths were examined by alumni gender, race, U.S. citizenship status, and association with certain academic characteristics. Several statistically significant differences in career paths among all demographics were found. For example, women were more likely to be in teaching and providing healthcare, men in faculty and research; Black alumni pursued careers in Government at higher rates and Whites in For-Profit careers; Asians and non-U.S. citizens spent more time in training positions than others. There was no association of academic characteristics such as GRE, GPA, and Time-to-Degree completion with careers in the two largest sectors of Academia or For-profit. Since our trainees are engaged in this rich variety of careers essential to advancing biomedical science and research nationally, it is imperative for the graduate training community to embrace all careers as successful, and transform the model for biomedical doctoral training to foster student success across this broad career spectrum."

However, there is little evidence about the associations between parental involvement, health behaviours and mental health among Ghanaian youth. This study sought to examine the role of parental involvement in the association between physical activity, dietary habits and mental health among Ghanaian youth.Data were obtained from the 2012 Ghana Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS). The study population consisted of 1,984 school going youth in high schools with a median age of 15 years old, (53.7%) males. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression statistical models using complex samples method were performed.The prevalence of mental distress was 18.1%, 16.6% and 23% for loneliness, feeling worried and suicidal ideation respectively. Younger students were more likely to feel lonely, worried and have suicidal ideation than older students. Students from low socio-economic backgrounds were significantly more likely to report loneliness, worry and suicidal ideation. After adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, some physical activity and eating habits were associated with experiencing loneliness, worry and suicidal ideation but after introducing parental involvement, there was a decrease in the likelihood of some health behaviour factors in both physical activity and dietary habits to be associated with loneliness, worry and suicidal ideation.Physical inactivity and poor dietary habits could have a negative effect on mental distress, however, parental involvement could mitigate the impact of these lifestyle habits on mental distress and should therefore be taken into consideration in efforts aimed at encouraging positive lifestyle habits for good mental health among Ghanaian youth."
https://openalex.org/W2803669502,"Antisense-mediated exon skipping has made significant progress as a therapeutic platform in recent years, especially in the case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Despite FDA approval of eteplirsen-the first-ever antisense drug clinically marketed for DMD-exon skipping therapy still faces the significant hurdles of limited applicability and unknown truncated protein function. In-frame exon skipping of dystrophin exons 45-55 represents a significant approach to treating DMD, as a large proportion of patients harbor mutations within this ""hotspot"" region. Additionally, patients harboring dystrophin exons 45-55 deletion mutations are reported to have exceptionally mild to asymptomatic phenotypes. Here, we demonstrate that a cocktail of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers can effectively skip dystrophin exons 45-55 in vitro in myotubes transdifferentiated from DMD patient fibroblast cells. This is the first report of substantive exons 45-55 skipping in DMD patient cells. These findings help validate the use of transdifferentiated patient fibroblast cells as a suitable cell model for dystrophin exon skipping assays and further emphasize the feasibility of dystrophin exons 45-55 skipping in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2733708868,"Considerable interest has been devoted for developing a deeper understanding of the dynamics of healthy biological systems and how these dynamics are affected due to aging and disease. Entropy based complexity measures have widely been used for quantifying the dynamics of physical and biological systems. These techniques have provided valuable information leading to a fuller understanding of the dynamics of these systems and underlying stimuli that are responsible for anomalous behavior. The single scale based traditional entropy measures yielded contradictory results about the dynamics of real world time series data of healthy and pathological subjects. Recently the multiscale entropy (MSE) algorithm was introduced for precise description of the complexity of biological signals, which was used in numerous fields since its inception. The original MSE quantified the complexity of coarse-grained time series using sample entropy. The original MSE may be unreliable for short signals because the length of the coarse-grained time series decreases with increasing scaling factor τ, however, MSE works well for long signals. To overcome the drawback of original MSE, various variants of this method have been proposed for evaluating complexity efficiently. In this study, we have proposed multiscale normalized corrected Shannon entropy (MNCSE), in which instead of using sample entropy, symbolic entropy measure NCSE has been used as an entropy estimate. The results of the study are compared with traditional MSE. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using noise signals as well as interbeat interval signals from healthy and pathological subjects. The preliminary results of the study indicate that MNCSE values are more stable and reliable than original MSE values. The results show that MNCSE based features lead to higher classification accuracies in comparison with the MSE based features."
https://openalex.org/W2803275897,"Background 
Radiologic severity may predict adverse outcomes after lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). However, few studies have quantified radiologic severity of LRIs. We sought to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative scoring tool, the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI), predicted mortality after parainfluenza virus (PIV)-associated LRI.


Methods 
We conducted a retrospective review of consecutively-enrolled adult patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and with PIV detected in nasal wash who subsequently developed radiologically-confirmed LRI. We measured RSI (range 0–72) in each chest radiograph during the first 30 days after LRI diagnosis. We used extended Cox proportional hazards models to identify factors associated with mortality after onset of LRI with all-cause mortality as our failure event.


Results 
After adjustment for patient characteristics, each 1-point increase in RSI was associated with an increased hazard of death (HR 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.21, p = 0.0008). Baseline RSI was not predictive of death, but both peak RSI and the change from baseline to peak RSI (delta-RSI) predicted mortality (odds ratio for mortality, peak: 1.11 [95%CI 1.04–1.18], delta-RSI: 1.14 [95%CI 1.06–1.22]). A delta-RSI of ≥19.5 was 89% sensitive and 91% specific in predicting 30-day mortality.


Conclusions 
We conclude that the RSI offers precise, informative and reliable assessments of LRI severity. Progression of RSI predicts 30-day mortality after LRI, but baseline RSI does not. Our results were derived from a cohort of patients with PIV-associated LRI, but can be applied in validated in other populations of patients with LRI."
https://openalex.org/W2804527775,"Peripersonal space is a multisensory representation of the environment around the body in relation to the motor system, underlying the interactions with the physical and social world. Although changing body properties and social context have been shown to alter the functional processing of space, little is known about how changing the value of objects influences the representation of peripersonal space. In two experiments, we tested the effect of modifying the spatial distribution of reward-yielding targets on manual reaching actions and peripersonal space representation. Before and after performing a target-selection task consisting of manually selecting a set of targets on a touch-screen table, participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice reachability-judgment task. In the target-selection task, half of the targets were associated with a reward (change of colour from grey to green, providing 1 point), the other half being associated with no reward (change of colour from grey to red, providing no point). In Experiment 1, the target-selection task was performed individually with the aim of maximizing the point count, and the distribution of the reward-yielding targets was either 50%, 25% or 75% in the proximal and distal spaces. In Experiment 2, the target-selection task was performed in a social context involving cooperation between two participants to maximize the point count, and the distribution of the reward-yielding targets was 50% in the proximal and distal spaces. Results showed that changing the distribution of the reward-yielding targets or introducing the social context modified concurrently the amplitude of self-generated manual reaching actions and the representation of peripersonal space. Moreover, a decrease of the amplitude of manual reaching actions caused a reduction of peripersonal space when resulting from the distribution of reward-yielding targets, while this effect was not observed in a social interaction context. In that case, the decreased amplitude of manual reaching actions was accompanied by an increase of peripersonal space representation, which was not due to the mere presence of a confederate (control experiment). We conclude that reward-dependent modulation of objects values in the environment modifies the representation of peripersonal space, when resulting from either self-generated motor actions or observation of motor actions performed by a confederate."
https://openalex.org/W2803846766,"Among various genome editing tools available for functional genomic studies, reagents based on clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats (CRISPR) have gained popularity due to ease and versatility. CRISPR reagents consist of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes formed by combining guide RNA (gRNA) that target specific genomics regions and a CRISPR associated nuclease (Cas). The gRNA targeting specific gene sequences may be delivered as a plasmid construct that needs to be transcribed or as a synthetic RNA. The Cas nuclease can be introduced as a plasmid construct, mRNA, or purified protein. The efficiency of target editing is dependent on intrinsic factors specific to each species, the target gene sequence, and the delivery methods of CRISPR gRNA and the Cas nuclease. Although intrinsic factors affecting genome editing may not be altered in most experiments, the delivery method for CRISPR/Cas reagents can be optimized to produce the best results. In this study, the efficiency of genome editing by CRISPR/Cas system in the bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), was evaluated using ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes assembled by binding synthetic gRNA with purified Cas9 nuclease engineered with nuclear localization signals to target the vermillion (eye color) gene. Mutation rates of adults emerging from embryos microinjected with 1, 2, or 4 μM RNP complexes were compared using replicated experiments. Embryos injected with 2 or 4 μM RNP complexes displayed significantly higher mutation rates (>88%) in surviving adults compared to those injected with 1 μM. The hatch rate in embryos injected with RNP complexes and with injection buffer only (mock injections) was reduced by 19.8(±5.2)% compared to noninjected control embryos, but did not differ significantly between injected embryos. Evaluation of potential off-target sites in H. zea genome did not identify any mutations. This study demonstrates that in vitro assembled synthetic RNP complexes can be used to obtain high genome editing rates in a reproducible manner in functional genomics or genetic manipulation studies."
https://openalex.org/W2803310278,"Background Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), Cystatin C and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been discussed as biomarkers for prediction of cardiac diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of single and repeated measurements of GDF-15 compared to Cystatin C and CRP for incidence of heart failure (HF) and death due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in the general population. Methods and results Levels of GDF-15, CRP and Cystatin C were determined in three repeated measurements collected 5 years apart in the DAN-MONICA (Danish-Multinational MONitoring of trends and determinants in Cardiovascular disease) cohort (participants at baseline n = 3785). Cox regression models adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors revealed significantly increased hazard ratios (HR) for GDF-15 for incident HF 1.36 (HR per interquartile range (IQR) increase, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16; 1.59) and for death from CHD 1.51 (HR per IQR increase, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.75) (both with p<0.001). Joint modeling of time-to-event and longitudinal GDF-15 over a median 27-year follow-up period showed that the marker evolution was positively associated with death of CHD (HR per IQR increase 3.02 95% CI: (2.26, 4.04), p < 0.001) and HF (HR per IQR increase 2.12 95% CI: (1.54, 2.92), p<0.001). However using Cox models with follow-up time starting at the time of the third examination, serial measurement of GDF-15, modeled as changes between the measurements, did not improve prediction over that of the most recent measurement. Conclusions GDF-15 is a promising biomarker for prediction of HF and death due to CHD in the general population, which may provide prognostic information to already established clinical biomarkers. Repeated measurements of GDF-15 displayed only a slight improvement in the prediction of these endpoints compared to a single measurement."

Although endemic in Chile, information on the molecular characteristics of CE in livestock remains scarce. Therefore we aimed to describe the status of infection with E. granulosus s.l. in cattle from central Chile and also to contribute to the study of the molecular epidemiology of this parasite. According to our results, the prevalence of CE is 18.84% in cattle, similar to previous reports from Chile, suggesting that the prevalence in Santiago Metropolitan area has not changed in the last 30 years. Most of the cysts were found only in lungs (51%), followed by concurrent infection in liver and lungs (30%), and only liver (19%). Molecular characterization of the genetic diversity and population structure of E. granulosus s.l. from cattle in central Chile was performed using a section of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) mitochondrial gene. E. granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) (G1-G3 genotypes) was confirmed by RFLP-PCR to be the dominant species affecting cattle (284 samples/290 samples); we also report for the first time in Chile the presence of E. ortleppi (G5 genotype) (2 samples/61 samples). The Chilean E. granulosus s.s. parsimony network displayed 1 main haplotype. Additional studies using isolates from many locations across Chile and different intermediate hosts will provide more data on the molecular structure of E. granulosus s.s. within this region. Likewise, investigations of the importance of E. ortleppi in human infection in Chile deserve future attention."
https://openalex.org/W2803430423,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a diverse group of molecules which play an important role in the innate immune response. Bovine NK-lysins, a type of AMP, have been predominantly found in the granules of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and NK-cells. Bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides demonstrate antimicrobial activity against various bacterial pathogens, including several involved in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) in cattle; however, such studies are yet to be performed with one important contributor to the BRDC, Mycoplasma bovis. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity of bovine NK-lysin-derived peptides on M. bovis. Thirty-mer synthetic peptides corresponding to the functional region helices 2 and 3 of bovine NK-lysins NK1, NK2A, NK2B, and NK2C were evaluated for killing activity on M. bovis isolates. Among four peptides, NK2A and NK2C showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the M. bovis isolates tested. All four NK-lysin peptides induced rapid plasma membrane depolarization in M. bovis at two concentrations tested. However, based on propidium iodide uptake, only NK2A and NK2C appeared capable of causing structural damage to M. bovis plasma membrane. Confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy further suggested NK-lysin-induced damage to the plasma membrane. Taken together, the findings in this study suggest that plasma membrane depolarization alone was insufficient to induce lethality, but disruption/permeabilization of the M. bovis plasma membrane was the cause of lethality."
https://openalex.org/W2804818985,"Objective To investigate variables associated at baseline (cross-sectional design) and at one year (longitudinal design) with the quality of sleep in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH). Methods One hundred and eighty (n = 180) and 135 individuals with CTTH participated in the cross-sectional and longitudinal design respectively. Clinical features were collected with a 4-weeks headache diary at baseline and one-year follow-up. Sleep quality was assessed at baseline and 1-year follow-up with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-HADS), burden of headache (Headache Disability Inventory-HDI), quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), and pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) at trigeminal, extra-trigeminal and widespread area were assessed at baseline. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine the associations between variables at baseline and 1-year follow-up with sleep quality. Results At baseline positive correlations between sleep quality and headache intensity, headache frequency, headache duration, emotional and physical burden of headache and depression were observed. The regression analyses found that depression and emotional burden of headache explained 27.5% of the variance in sleep quality at baseline (r2 = .262; F = 23.72 P < .001). At one-year, sleep quality was significantly associated with baseline burden of headache, depression, widespread PPTs, vitality and mental health domains. Regression analyses revealed that vitality, PPT over the second metacarpal and PPT over the neck explained 30.0% of the variance of sleep quality at one-year (r2 = .269, F = 9.71, P < .001). Conclusions It seems that sleep quality exhibits a complex interaction in individuals with CTTH since depression and the emotional burden were associated with sleep quality at baseline, but vitality and PPTs over extra-trigeminal areas were associated with the quality of sleep at one-year."

However, since mosquito bites are not fully prevented, the effect of these products on the level of viral infection remains unknown.To evaluate in vitro the essentials oils from Reunion Island against one archetypal arbovirus, the Ross River virus (RRV), and investigate the viral cycle step that was impaired by these oils.The essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of GC-FID and GC×GC-TOF MS techniques. In vitro studies were performed on HEK293T cells to determine their cytotoxicity, their cytoprotective and virucidal capacities on RRV-T48 strain, and the level of their inhibitory effect on the viral replication and residual infectivity prior, during or following viral adsorption using the reporter virus RRV-renLuc.Each essential oil was characterized by an accurate quantification of their terpenoid content. PG yielded the least-toxic extract (CC50 > 1000 μg.mL-1). For the RRV-T48 strain, the monoterpene-rich CC and PG essential oils reduced the cytopathic effect but did not display virucidal activity. The time-of-addition assay using the gene reporter RRV-renLuc showed that the CC and PG essential oils significantly reduced viral replication and infectivity when applied prior, during and early after viral adsorption. Overall, no significant effect was observed for the low monoterpene-containing VZ essential oil.The inhibitory profiles of the three essential oils suggest the high value of the monoterpene-rich essential oils from CC and PG against RRV infection. Combined with their repellent activity, the antiviral activity of the essential oils of CC and PG may provide a new option to control arboviral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2463946586,"Cooperative breeding is an excellent example of cooperation in social groups. Domestic dogs have evolved from cooperatively hunting and breeding ancestors but have adapted to a facultatively social scavenging lifestyle on streets, and solitary living in human homes. Pets typically breed and reproduce under human supervision, but free-ranging dogs can provide insights into the natural breeding ecology of dogs. We conducted a five year-long field based behavioural study on parental care of free-ranging dogs in India. 23 mother-litter units, belonging to 15 groups were observed, which revealed the presence of widespread allo-parenting by both adult males and females. While all the females were known to be related to the pups receiving care, the relatedness with the males could not be determined. Hence, we coined the term “putative father” for caregiving males. Allomothers provided significantly less care than the mothers, but the putative fathers showed comparable levels of care with the mothers. Mothers invested more effort in nursing and allogrooming, while the putative fathers played and protected more. Our observations provide support for both the “benefit-of-philopatry” and “assured fitness returns” hypotheses. Free-ranging dogs are not cooperative breeders like wolves but are rather communal breeders; their breeding biology bearing interesting similarities with the human joint family system. This breeding strategy is likely to have played an important role in increasing pup survival in a stochastic environment and helping to adapt to living among humans during the domestication of dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2803560285,"Production of the iron regulatory peptide hepcidin is tightly controlled by a network of proteins in hepatocytes that sense levels of iron in the circulation (as diferric-transferrin) and in tissues (in ferritin). Human studies show high variability in the normal range of serum hepcidin levels. We have postulated that this may, in part, be related to inter-individual variability in the expression of genes in the iron sensing pathway, potentially governed by epigenetic factors. Here, we have investigated whether genes encoding hepatic iron sensing proteins and hepcidin are regulated by DNA methylation. Experiments were performed on two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells. Basal expression of TFR2 and HAMP was significantly lower in Huh7 cells compared with HepG2 cells. Analysis of bisulphite-converted DNA from Huh7 cells revealed partial methylation of TFR2 (alpha transcript), which could result in gene silencing. Demethylation using 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine (AZA) increased TFR2 mRNA expression in Huh7. PCR analysis of bisulphite-converted HAMP promoter DNA, using methylation-specific primers, revealed no differences between cell lines. However, HAMP mRNA expression in Huh7 was increased by AZA treatment, suggesting that methylation of one or more iron sensing genes may indirectly influence HAMP expression. Our study provides evidence that DNA methylation might control expression of HAMP and other hepatic iron sensing genes, and indicates that epigenetic influences on iron homeostasis warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2803959572,"The mammalian secretoglobin (SCGB) superfamily contains functionally diverse members, among which the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) display similar subunits. We searched for molecular similarities between Fel d 1 and ABP to examine the possibility that they play similar roles. We aimed to i) cluster the evolutionary relationships of the SCGB superfamily; ii) identify divergence patterns, structural overlap, and protein-protein docking between Fel d 1 and ABP dimers; and iii) explore the residual interaction between ABP dimers and steroid binding in chemical communication using computational approaches. We also report that the evolutionary tree of the SCGB superfamily comprises seven unique palm-like clusters, showing the evolutionary pattern and divergence time tree of Fel d 1 with 28 ABP paralogs. Three ABP subunits (A27, BG27, and BG26) share phylogenetic relationships with Fel d 1 chains. The Fel d 1 and ABP subunits show similarities in terms of sequence conservation, identical motifs and binding site clefts. Topologically equivalent positions were visualized through superimposition of ABP A27:BG27 (AB) and ABP A27:BG26 (AG) dimers on a heterodimeric Fel d 1 model. In docking, Fel d 1-ABP dimers exhibit the maximum surface binding ability of AG compared with that of AB dimers and the several polar interactions between ABP dimers with steroids. Hence, cat Fel d 1 is an ABP-like molecule in which monomeric chains 1 and 2 are the equivalent of the ABPA and ABPBG monomers, respectively. These findings suggest that the biological and molecular function of Fel d 1 is similar to that of ABP in chemical communication, possibly via pheromone and/or steroid binding."
https://openalex.org/W2803523730,"The elaborate anatomy of hands and feet is shaped by coordinated formation of digits and regression of the interdigital mesenchyme (IM). A failure of this process causes persistence of interdigital webbing and consequently cutaneous syndactyly. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are key inductive factors for interdigital cell death (ICD) in vivo. NOGGIN (NOG) is a major BMP antagonist that can interfere with BMP-induced ICD when applied exogenously, but its in vivo role in this process is unknown. We investigated the physiological role of NOG in ICD and found that Noggin null mice display cutaneous syndactyly and impaired interdigital mesenchyme specification. Failure of webbing regression was caused by lack of cell cycle exit and interdigital apoptosis. Unexpectedly, Noggin null mutants also exhibit increased Indian hedgehog (Ihh) expression within cartilage condensations that leads to aberrant extension of IHH downstream signaling into the interdigital mesenchyme. A converse phenotype with increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation was found in the interdigital mesenchyme of Ihh mutant embryos. Our data point towards a novel role for NOG in balancing Ihh expression in the digits impinging on digit-interdigit cross talk. This suggests a so far unrecognized physiological role for IHH in interdigital webbing biology."
https://openalex.org/W2804325655,"There is considerable interest in the ex vivo propagation of primary human basal epithelial stem/progenitor cells with a view to their use in drug development, toxicity testing and regenerative medicine. These cells can be expanded in co-culture with mitotically inactivated 3T3-J2 murine embryonic feeder cells but, similar to other epithelial cell culture systems employing 3T3-J2 cells, the aspects of cross-talk between 3T3-J2 cells and human airway basal cells that are critical for their expansion remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated secreted growth factors that are produced by 3T3-J2 cells and act upon primary human airway basal cells. We found robust production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from fibroblast feeder cells following mitotic inactivation. Consistent with the limited cross-species reactivity of murine HGF on the human HGF receptor (MET; HGFR), MET inhibition did not affect proliferative responses in human airway basal cells and HGF could not replace feeder cells in this culture system. However, we found that murine HGF is not completely inactive on human airway epithelial cells or cancer cell lines but stimulates the phosphorylation of GRB2-associated-binding protein 2 (GAB2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6). Although HGF induces phosphorylation of STAT6 tyrosine 641 (Y641), there is no subsequent STAT6 nuclear translocation or STAT6-driven transcriptional response. Overall, these findings highlight the relevance of cross-species protein interactions between murine feeder cells and human epithelial cells in 3T3-J2 co-culture and demonstrate that STAT6 phosphorylation occurs in response to MET activation in epithelial cells. However, STAT6 nuclear translocation does not occur in response to HGF, precluding the transcriptional activity of STAT6."
https://openalex.org/W2804458254,"Electromagnetic field (EMF) technology has the potential to improve scientific data capture and welfare assessment by allowing automated data collection from individual cages. However, it is important to determine any impact that a new technology itself may have on animal welfare, and previous studies have found contrasting results of EMF on laboratory rodent anxiety-like behaviour and cognition. We therefore investigated whether there was an effect of low frequency EMF experienced continuously over a six-week period, as an integral part of the animal housing system, on measures of mouse anxiety-related behaviour, cognition and welfare. We housed mice (N = 80) of two strains (BALB/cAnNCrl and C57BL/6NCrl) separately in Individually Ventilated Cages (IVCs) in groups of four, either with the EMF plate turned ‘on’ or ‘off’ (n = 5). Some measures, e.g. food and water utilisation, were collected at regular intervals, whereas measures of anxiety-like behaviour (e.g. open field test) and cognitive performance (novel-object recognition test) were collected only at the end of the study. We found expected strong strain differences in most measures, e.g. latency to leave the starting square in an open field test, with C57BL/6NCrl mice moving away sooner, and interactions between strain and time for those measures recorded at more than one time point, e.g. significant weight gain over time for both strains, but with BALB/cAnNCrl mice weighing more. However, we found no significant effects of treatment (EMF ‘on’/‘off’) for any of the measures collected. These results indicate that, for the measures recorded here, there was no measurable impact on the behaviour and welfare of low frequency EMF exposure experienced continuously over a six-week period. Housing systems that include EMF monitoring technology may therefore be suitable for use without influencing either animal welfare or scientific outcomes."

It reveals the molecular biodiversity and divergence time estimation of basidiomycetes from Gujarat, India. A total of 267 mushrooms were collected from 10 locations across the state. 225 ITS sequences were generated belonging to 105 species, 59 genera and 29 families. Phylogenetic analysis of Agaricaceae reveals monophyletic clade of Podaxis differentiating it from Coprinus. Further, the ancient nature of Podaxis supports the hypothesis that gasteroid forms evolved from secotioid forms. Members of Polyporaceae appeared polyphyletic. Further, our results of a close phylogenetic relationship between Trametes and Lenziteslead us to propose that the genera Trametes may by enlarged to include Lenzites. The tricholomatoid clade shows a clear demarcation for Entolomataceae. However, Lyophyllaceae and Tricholomataceae could not be distinguished clearly. Distribution studies of the mushrooms showed omnipresence of Ganoderma and Schizophyllum. Further, divergence time estimation shows that Dacrymycetes evolved in the Neoproterozoic Era and Hymenochaetales diverged from Agaricomycetes during the Silurian period."
https://openalex.org/W2803408029,"The hydrography and dynamics of NW Iberian margin were explored for July 2009, based on a set of in situ and remote sensing observations. Zonal sections of standard CTD casts, towed CTD (SeaSoar), Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and Lagrangian surveys were made to characterize cycles of upwelling and relaxation in this region. Two periods of northerly winds, bounded by relaxation periods, were responsible for the formation of an upwelling front extending to the shelf edge. An equatorward flow was quickly set up on the shelf responding to the northerly wind pulses. South of Cape Silleiro, the development and subsequent relaxation of an upwelling event was intensively surveyed in the shelf, following a Lagrangian drifter transported by the upwelling jet. This region is part of an upwelling center extending from Cape Silleiro to Porto, where the surface temperature was colder than the neighboring regions, under upwelling favorable winds. As these winds relaxed, persistent poleward flow developed, originating south of the upwelling center and consisting in an inner-shelf tongue of warm waters. During an event of strong southerly wind, the poleward flow was observed to extend to the whole continental shelf. Although the cruise was executed during summertime, the presence of river-plumes was observed over the shelf. The interaction of the plumes with the circulation on the shelf was also described in terms of coastal convergence and offshore advection. The sampling of the offshore and slope regions showed the presence of the Iberian poleward current offshore and a persistent equatorward flow over the upper slope."
https://openalex.org/W2803590513,"Hybridization events are frequently demonstrated in natural butterfly populations. One interesting butterfly complex species is the Enantia jethys complex that has been studied for over a century; many debates exist regarding the species composition of this complex. Currently, three species that live sympatrically in the Gulf slope of Mexico (Enantia jethys, E. mazai, and E. albania) are recognized in this complex (based on morphological and molecular studies). Where these species live in sympatry, some cases of interspecific mating have been observed, suggesting hybridization events. Considering this, we employed a multilocus approach (analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear sequences: COI, RpS5, and Wg; and nuclear dominant markers: inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSRs) to study hybridization in sympatric populations from Veracruz, Mexico. Genetic diversity parameters were determined for all molecular markers, and species identification was assessed by different methods such as analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), clustering, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), gene flow, and PhiPT parameters. ISSR molecular markers were used for a more profound study of hybridization process. Although species of the Enantia jethys complex have a low dispersal capacity, we observed high genetic diversity, probably reflecting a high density of individuals locally. ISSR markers provided evidence of a contemporary hybridization process, detecting a high number of hybrids (from 17% to 53%) with significant differences in genetic diversity. Furthermore, a directional pattern of hybridization was observed from E. albania to other species. Phylogenetic study through DNA sequencing confirmed the existence of three clades corresponding to the three species previously recognized by morphological and molecular studies. This study underlines the importance of assessing hybridization in evolutionary studies, by tracing the lineage separation process that leads to the origin of new species. Our research demonstrates that hybridization processes have a high occurrence in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2803655843,"Endothelial cells (EC) frequently undergo primary or secondary injury during kidney disease such as thrombotic microangiopathy or glomerulonephritis. Renin Lineage Cells (RLCs) serve as a progenitor cell niche after glomerular damage in the adult kidney. However, it is not clear whether RLCs also contribute to endothelial replenishment in the glomerulus following endothelial injury. Therefore, we investigated the role of RLCs as a potential progenitor niche for glomerular endothelial regeneration. We used an inducible tet-on triple-transgenic reporter strain mRen-rtTAm2/LC1/LacZ to pulse-label the renin-producing RLCs in adult mice. Unilateral kidney EC damage (EC model) was induced by renal artery perfusion with concanavalin/anti-concanavalin. In this model glomerular EC injury and depletion developed within 1 day while regeneration occurred after 7 days. LacZ-labelled RLCs were restricted to the juxtaglomerular compartment of the afferent arterioles at baseline conditions. In contrast, during the regenerative phase of the EC model (day 7) a subset of LacZ-tagged RLCs migrated to the glomerular tuft. Intraglomerular RLCs did not express renin anymore and did not stain for glomerular endothelial or podocyte cell markers, but for the mesangial cell markers α8-integrin and PDGFRβ. Accordingly, we found pronounced mesangial cell damage parallel to the endothelial injury induced by the EC model. These results demonstrated that in our EC model RLCs are not involved in endothelial regeneration. Rather, recruitment of RLCs seems to be specific for the repair of the concomitantly damaged mesangium."

Naiman Banner located in northern China was chosen as research site, a total of 332 soil samples were taken in a depth of 100 cm from the low hilly land in the southern part, sandy land in the middle part and an alluvial plain in the northern part of the county. The results showed that SOC and TN density initially decreased and then increased from the north to the south, The highest densities, were generally in the south, with the lowest generally in the middle part. The SOC and TN densities in cropland were significantly greater than those in woodland and grassland in the alluvial plains and for Naiman as a whole. The woodland SOC and TN density were higher than those of grassland in the low hilly land, and higher densities of SOC and TN in grassland than woodland in the sandy land and low hilly land. There were significant differences in SOC and TN densities among the five soil types of Cambisols, Arenosols, Gleysols, Argosols, and Kastanozems. In addition, SOC and TN contents generally decreased with increasing soil depth, but increased below a depth of 40 cm in the Cambisols and became roughly constant at this depth in the Kastanozems. There is considerable potential to sequester carbon and nitrogen in the soil via the conversion of degraded sandy land into woodland and grassland in alluvial plain, and more grassland should be established in sandy land and low hilly land."
https://openalex.org/W2803670523,"Annexin A6 (AnxA6) is expressed in articular chondrocytes at levels higher than in other mesenchymal cell types. However, the role of AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes is not known. Here we show that complete lack of AnxA6 functions resulted in increased ß-catenin activation in Wnt3a-treated murine articular chondrocytes, whereas AnxA6 expressing articular chondrocytes showed decreased ß-catenin activation. High expression of AnxA6 in human articular chondrocytes showed the highest inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Inhibition of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activity by AnxA6 together with cytosolic Ca2+ was achieved by interfering with the plasma membrane association of the Wnt signaling complex. AnxA6 also affected the cross-talk between Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and NF-κB signaling by decreasing ß-catenin activity and increasing NF-κB activity in Wnt3a-, interleukin-1beta (IL-1ß)-, and combined Wnt3a/IL-1ß-treated cells. Wnt3a treatment increased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers (cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase) to a much lesser degree than IL-1ß treatment in human articular chondrocytes, and decreased the mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and articular cartilage markers (aggrecan, type II collagen). Furthermore, Wnt3a decreased the mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in IL-1ß-treated human articular chondrocytes. High expression of AnxA6 resulted in decreased mRNA levels of catabolic markers, and increased MMP-13 and articular cartilage marker mRNA levels in Wnt3a-treated human articular chondrocytes, whereas leading to increased mRNA levels of catabolic markers and MMP-13 in human articular chondrocytes treated with IL-1ß, or combined Wnt3a and IL-1ß. Our findings define a novel role for AnxA6 in articular chondrocytes via its modulation of Wnt/ß-catenin and NF-κB signaling activities and the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways."

The identified correlates should inform components of future DV primary prevention interventions that target men as potential perpetrators or the couple as a unit."
https://openalex.org/W2803715376,"Whether γδ T cells inhibit or enhance the Foxp3 T cell response depends upon their activation status. The critical enhancing effector in the supernatant is adenosine. Activated γδ T cells express adenosine receptors at high levels, which enables them to deprive Foxp3+ T cells of adenosine, and to inhibit their expansion. Meanwhile, cell-free supernatants of γδ T cell cultures enhance Foxp3 T cell expansion. Thus, inhibition and enhancement by γδ T cells of Foxp3 T cell response are a reflection of the balance between adenosine production and absorption by γδ T cells. Non-activated γδ T cells produce adenosine but bind little, and thus enhance the Foxp3 T cell response. Activated γδ T cells express high density of adenosine receptors and have a greatly increased ability to bind adenosine. Extracellular adenosine metabolism and expression of adenosine receptor A2ARs by γδ T cells played a major role in the outcome of γδ and Foxp3 T cell interactions. A better understanding of the functional conversion of γδ T cells could lead to γδ T cell-targeted immunotherapies for related diseases."

Insecticide residues in treated vegetables, however, pose a potential risk to consumers. Photocatalytic degradation is a new alternative to managing pesticide residues. In this study, the degradation of dimethoate in Bok choy was investigated under the field conditions using cerium-doped nano titanium dioxide (TiO2/Ce) hydrosol as a photocatalyst. The results show that TiO2/Ce hydrosol can accelerate the degradation of dimethoate in Bok choy. Specifically, the application of TiO2/Ce hydrosol significantly increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents in the treated Bok choy, which speeds up the degradation of dimethoate. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis detected three major degradation products, including omethoate, O,O,S-trimethyl thiophosphorothioate, and 1,2-Bis (acetyl-N-methyl-) methane disulfide. Two potential photodegradation pathways have been proposed based on the intermediate products. To understand the relationship between photodegradation and the molecular structure of target insecticides, we investigated the bond length, Mulliken atomic charge and frontier electron density of dimethoate using ab initio quantum analysis. These results suggest the P = S, P-S and S-C of dimethoate are the initiation sites for the photocatalytic reaction in Bok choy, which is consistent with our empirical data."

https://openalex.org/W2804573640,"Introduction Thailand recommends influenza vaccination for children aged 6 months to <36 months, but investment in vaccine purchase is limited. To inform policy decision with respect to influenza disease burden and associated cost in young children and to support the continued inclusion of children as the recommended group for influenza vaccination, we conducted a prospective cohort study of children in Bangkok hospital to estimate and compare influenza incidence and cost between healthy and high-risk children. Methods Caregivers of healthy children and children with medical conditions (‘high-risk’) aged <36 months were called weekly for two years to identify acute respiratory illness (ARI) episodes and collect illness-associated costs. Children with ARI were tested for influenza viruses by polymerase chain reaction. Illnesses were categorized as mild or severe depending on whether children were hospitalized. Population-averaged Poisson models were used to compare influenza incidence by risk group. Quantile regression was used to examine differences in the median illness expenses. Results During August 2011-September 2015, 659 healthy and 490 high-risk children were enrolled; median age was 10 months. Incidence of mild influenza-associated ARI was higher among healthy than high-risk children (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13–2.48). Incidence of severe influenza-associated ARI did not differ (IRR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.11–1.38). The median cost per mild influenza-associated ARI episode was $22 among healthy and $25 among high-risk children (3–4% of monthly household income; difference in medians: -$1; 95% CI for difference in medians: -$9 to $6). The median cost per severe influenza-associated ARI episode was $232 among healthy and $318 among high-risk children (26–40% and 36–54% of monthly household income, respectively; difference in medians: 110; 95% CI for difference in medians: -$352 to $571). Conclusions Compared to high-risk children, healthy children had higher incidence of mild influenza-associated ARI but not severe influenza-associated ARI. Costs of severe influenza-associated ARI were substantial. These findings support the benefit of annual influenza vaccination in reducing the burden of influenza and associated cost in young children."

Making the overlap between the pairs of variables consistent with their squared bivariate correlations often results in the overlap of two of these variables with the third variable that is not the same as the variance of the third variable accounted for by the other two variables. I introduce a modified Venn diagram approach that examines the relationships in multiple regression by using only two circles at a time, provides a new and consistent reason why the circles need to be of the same size, and designates a ""target variable"" whose overlap with the other circle corresponds to the variance accounted for by the other variable or variables. This approach allows the visualization of the components involved in multiple regression coefficients, their standard errors, and the F-test and t-test associated with these coefficients as well as other statistics commonly reported in the output of multiple regression programs."
https://openalex.org/W2804321346,"Recent studies in coastal wetlands have indicated that consumers may play an important role in regulating large-scale ecosystem processes. Predator removal experiments have shown significant differences in above-ground biomass production in the presence of higher level consumers, or predators. These results indicate that predators play an important role in regulating biomass production, but the extent to which this regulation impacts additional ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling and organic matter accumulation, is unclear. This study evaluated the impact that consumers have on large-scale ecosystem processes within southern New England tidal wetlands and contributes to the general understanding of trophic control in these systems. I established enclosure cages within three coastal wetlands and manipulated the presence of green crab predators to assess how trophic interactions affect ecosystem functions. Findings suggest that although these consumers may exert some top-down effects, other environmental factors, such as other consumers not studied here or bottom-up interactions, may variably play a larger role in the maintenance of ecosystem processes within the region. These results indicate that the loss of top-down control as an important mechanism influencing ecosystem functions may not hold for all wetlands along the full extent of the New England coastline."
https://openalex.org/W2803624873,"Approximately 90% of the structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) were obtained by X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. Whereas the overall quality of structure is considered high, thanks to a wide range of tools for structure validation, uncertainties may arise from density maps of small molecules, such as organic ligands, ions or water, which are non-covalently bound to the biomolecules. Even with some experience and chemical intuition, the assignment of such disconnected electron densities is often far from obvious. In this study, we suggest the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations, which are well-established computational methods, to aid in the assignment of ambiguous disconnected electron densities. Specifically, estimates of (i) relative binding affinities, for instance between an ion and water, (ii) absolute binding free energies, i.e., free energies for transferring a solute from bulk solvent to a binding site, and (iii) stability assessments during equilibrium simulations may reveal the most plausible assignments. We illustrate this strategy using the crystal structure of the fluoride specific channel (Fluc), which contains five disconnected electron densities previously interpreted as four fluoride and one sodium ion. The simulations support the assignment of the sodium ion. In contrast, calculations of relative and absolute binding free energies as well as stability assessments during free MD simulations suggest that four of the densities represent water molecules instead of fluoride. The assignment of water is compatible with the loss of these densities in the non-conductive F82I/F85I mutant of Fluc. We critically discuss the role of the ion force fields for the calculations presented here. Overall, these findings indicate that MD simulations and free energy calculations are helpful tools for modeling water and ions into crystallographic density maps."
https://openalex.org/W2804072724,"A bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for G. mustelinum Miers ex G. Watt (AD4) was constructed. Intact nuclei from G. mustelinum (AD4) were used to isolate high molecular weight DNA, which was partially cleaved with Hind III and cloned into pSMART BAC (Hind III) vectors. The BAC library consisted of 208,182 clones arrayed in 542 384-microtiter plates, with an average insert size of 121.72 kb ranging from 100 to 150 kb. About 2% of the clones did not contain inserts. Based on an estimated genome size of 2372 Mb for G. mustelinum, the BAC library was estimated to have a total coverage of 10.50 × genome equivalents. The high capacity library of G. mustelinum will serve as a giant gene resource for map-based cloning of quantitative trait loci or genes associated with important agronomic traits or resistance to Verticillium wilt, physical mapping and comparative genome analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2804387526,"The aim of the project was to find new catalysts capable of chlorolactone biotransformation. Three bicyclic chlorolactones with structures possessing one or two methyl groups in their cyclohexane ring were subjected to screening biotransformation using seven bacterial strains and one fungal strain from a salt mine. Three strains of bacteria (Micrococcus luteus Pb10, Micrococcus luteus WSP45, Gordonia alkanivorans Pd25) and one fungal strain (Aspergillus sydowii KGJ10) were able to catalyse hydrolytic dehalogenation of one substrate. The classification of the strains that were effective biocatalysts was confirmed by 16S rDNA analysis. The best result (76%) was obtained using Aspergillus sydowii KGJ10. All strains catalysed hydrolytic dehalogenation without changing the conformation. The equatorial position of the chlorine atom in the substrate turned out to be warrant of the positive result of the biotransformation process."
https://openalex.org/W2804839740,"Background Blood is a critical aspect of treatment in life saving situations, increasing demand. Blood requisition practices greatly effect sufficient supply in blood banks. This study aimed to determine the risk factors for inappropriate blood requisition in Tanzania. Methods This was a cross sectional study using secondary data of 14,460 patients’ blood requests from 42 transfusion hospitals. Primary data were obtained by using cluster-sampling design. Data were analysed using a two-level mixed-effects Poisson regression to determine fixed-effects of individual-level factors and hospital level factors associated with inappropriate blood requests. P-value <0.05 (2-tails) was considered statistically significant. Results Inappropriate requisition was 28.8%. Factors significantly associated with inappropriate requisition were; reporting pulse rate and capillary refill decrease the risk (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.64, 0.84) and (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.63, 0.85) respectively and the following increased the risk; having surgery during hospital stay (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.06, 1.4); being in general surgical ward (RR 3.3; 95% CI 2.7, 4.2), paediatric ward (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.2, 2.7), obstetric ward (RR 2.5; 95% CI 2.0, 3.1), gynaecological ward (RR 2.1; 95% CI 1.5, 2.9), orthopaedics ward (RR 3.8; 95% CI 2.2, 6.7). Age of the patient, pallor and confirmation of pre-transfusion haemoglobin level were also significantly associated with inappropriate requisition. Majority of appropriate requisitions within the wards were marked in internal medicine (91.7%) and gynaecological wards (77.8%). Conclusions The proportion of inappropriate blood requests was high. Blood requisition was determined by clinical and laboratory findings and the ward patients were admitted to. Adherence to transfusion guidelines is recommended to assure the best use of limited blood supply."
https://openalex.org/W2803516375,"Transplacental viral and parasitic infections have been shown to initiate an innate response in the mammalian embryo by increasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma (Ifng). However, the developmental consequences of an activated innate immunity and, in particular, the effects of induction of Ifng expression independent of infection have been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate in vivo that the conditional overexpression of Ifng in metanephric mesenchymal (MM) progenitors results in renal agenesis or hypoplasia. Cell death was observed in and around the MM region of E10.5–11.5 mutants where Ifng was constitutively expressed during early kidney development and resulted in a retardation of branching morphogenesis. Furthermore, isolated mutant or normal Ifng-treated metanephroi replicated this phenotype in culture, demonstrating the inherent nature of the aberrant morphogenesis. The expression of renal progenitor marker Sall1 was significantly decreased in the MM of mutant kidneys, suggesting that a reduction in Sall1 may be the cause of cell death in the MM during early kidney development and that, in turn, retards UB branching in the mutants. Therefore, the aberrant induction of Ifng expression, as part of an innate immune response, may contribute to renal agenesis or hypoplasia during early metanephric development by regulating the MM progenitor population."
