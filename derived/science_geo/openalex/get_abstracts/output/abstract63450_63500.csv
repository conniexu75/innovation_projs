https://openalex.org/W1558133704,"Abstract Tyrosinase (o-diphenol:O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.1) has been purified from a commercial lyophilized powder prepared from edible mushrooms. Specific activities toward dl-dihydroxyphenylalanine and catechol, homogeneity, molecular weight, absorption spectrum, amino acid composition, and copper content of the preparation are comparable to other purified samples of tyrosinase prepared from fresh mushrooms. Circular dichroism of the enzyme reveals an unusually shaped envelope of negative ellipticity bands in the deep ultraviolet (196 to 250 mµ), which is difficult to explain by a combination of the usual peptide conformational forms. Small positive ellipticity bands ([θ] per 32,000 mol wt ≅ 30,000) are associated with the near ultraviolet absorption of the aromatic amino acid side chains. Kinetic constants for the oxidation of a homologous series of catechol substrates substituted in position 4 by groups —H, —SCN, —COCH3, —CHO, —CN, and —NO2 have been determined. As the electron-withdrawing ability of the substituent increases, Km and kcat decrease in the order H g SCN g COCH3 g CHO g CN g NO2. Except for the kcat values for the two most slowly oxidized substrates, both Km and kcat conform to Hammett relationships when the substituent parameter σ- is used. The ρ values are -1.01 ± 0.09 for Km and -2.49 ± 0.11 for kcat. The oxidation of pyrocatechol, 4-COCH3, and 4-CHO-catechol give a satisfactory isokinetic relationship between ΔH‡ and ΔS‡. These findings suggest that these substrates are oxidized by the same basic mechanism. Studies of the dependence of catechol oxidation on the concentration of oxygen show that Km for oxygen varies with the nature of the catechol substrate. With the exception of the pyrocatechol complex, the enzyme-substrate complexes for this series of catechols are saturated in air (20.95% O2). The oxygen kinetics suggest a sequential mechanism for the binding of catechol and oxygen. Detailed studies of the pH dependence of Km and kcat show the presence of a group in the enzyme whose pKa changes upon the binding of a catechol molecule. Inhibition of tyrosinase by benzoic acid and cyanide show that the former is competitive with catechol and noncompetitive with oxygen, while the latter is competitive with oxygen and noncompetitive with catechol. These results are taken to indicate two distinct substrate binding sites on the enzyme, one with a high affinity for aromatic compounds including phenolic substrates, the other for metal-binding agents and oxygen. The latter site presumably involves enzyme copper. Binding studies with 14C-benzoic acid suggest that there are two binding sites for benzoic acid per mole of tetramer (mol wt = 128,000). The equilibrium constant for this binding is the same as the Ki measured for competitive inhibition of catechol oxidation by benzoic acid. Catechols are activators of the phenolase reaction of tyrosinase, and tyrosine is shown to be an inhibitor of this activation of its own oxidation in a manner suggesting that there is a third binding site on the enzyme for an activator catechol or phenol."

https://openalex.org/W2065522032,"A sample of hashish was extracted consecutively with petroleum ether, benzene, and methanol. When tested intravenously in monkeys only the petroleum-ether fraction was active. This material was further fractionated. The only active compound isolated was Delta(1)-tetrahydrocannabinol. Cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabichromene, cannabigerol, and cannabicyclol when administered together with Delta(1)-tetrahydrocannabinol do not cause a change in the activity of the latter, under the experimental conditions used. These results provide evidence that, except for Delta(1)-tetrahydrocannabinol, no other major, psychotomimetically active compounds are present in hashish."

https://openalex.org/W2091230678,Newly synthesized regions of Bacillus subtilis flagella were labeled with fluorophenylalanine or [(3)H]leucine. The flagella were then examined for altered gross morphology or by radioautography. Results of both experiments indicate that flagella elongate in vivo by polymerization of flagellin subunits onto the distal end of the filament.
https://openalex.org/W1533421793,"Abstract Studies were conducted to examine the chemical and physical properties of human plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin (PA), and the factors affecting their interaction with each other and with the ligands retinol and thyroxine, respectively. The effects of changes in temperature, pH, and urea concentration and the effects of reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds and of iodination were assessed. Analytical ultracentrifuge studies established the formation of a 1:1 molar complex between the two proteins. The estimated molecular weight of the complex (approximately 70,000) was almost exactly the sum of the molecular weights of the individual proteins (PA, approximately 49,000 and RBP, 21,000). The complex was stable in the temperature range 4–42.5° and in the pH range 5.8 to 7.5. Considerable dissociation of the complex occurred as the pH was raised from 8.6 to 10.3. Addition of 6 m urea completely disrupted the RBP-PA complex, markedly reduced the affinity of PA for thyroxine, but did not interfere with the association of retinol with RBP. Only one of the two disulfide bonds of PA was readily accessible to reduction and alkylation. Reduction of this one disulfide bond did not affect the binding of either RBP or thyroxine to PA. In contrast, both disulfide bonds of RBP were highly resistant to reduction. When the disulfide bonds of RBP were reduced and alkylated, however, the retinol-RBP complex was disrupted, and retinol was completely lost from the protein. Iodination of RBP up to the level of 4.3 atoms of iodine per molecule selectively interfered with the interaction of RBP with PA, without disrupting the retinol-RBP complex. These studies demonstrate that it is possible to affect selectively the different interactions involved in the RBP-PA system responsible for retinol transport in plasma."

https://openalex.org/W2020490222,"MAN is uniquely susceptible to gonorrhoea, but antibodies present in normal human sera are bactericidal for cultured gonococci1–3. The ineffectiveness of these antibodies in the natural infection may be explained if gonococci growing in the host possess a factor, perhaps a surface antigen, which protects the organism from the bactericidal action of serum. There is some evidence that Neisseria gonorrhoeae loses virulence factors during growth in vitro because enormous doses of cultured gonococci were required to infect volunteers4,5 while organisms recovered from the resulting urethral discharges exhibited enhanced virulence6. Another, less likely, suggestion is that gonococci only infect individuals lacking bactericidal antibodies to the strain concerned. To distinguish between these possibilities we have tested the ability of serum from men with gonorrhoea of less than 3 days duration to kill the gonococci present in the urethral exudate and the same organism after subculture."
https://openalex.org/W1597272777,"Abstract The single tryptophan residue of staphylococcal nuclease was selectively modified with the use of a new bromine-positive releasing compound obtained by reaction of 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methylindole with N-bromosuccinimide. The oxidizing properties of the reagent for amino acid side chains of proteins are much more selective than those of N-bromosuccinimide. Cleavage of the tryptophanyl peptide bond also can be obtained (yields up to 59% on model compounds) with use of relatively high amounts of reagent and longer reaction times. The nuclease derivative, with an oxindole side chain at Residue 140, showed complete lack of tryptophan fluorescence, and the molar absorptivity at 280 nm was decreased in proportion to the loss of tryptophan. Ultraviolet circular dichroism was consistent with loss of helical structure. However, the modified enzyme retained 18% DNase and 12% RNase activity and cross-reacted with native nuclease in agar immunodiffusion against antinuclease antiserum. When the protein was incubated with a large excess of reagent for 28 hours at room temperature, selective cleavage of the tryptophanyl peptide bond was observed, and the COOH-terminal nonapeptide of nuclease was isolated in 15% yield."
https://openalex.org/W1557318138,"Abstract A method for preparing highly purified glutaminase (EC 3.5.1.2, l-glutamine amidohydrolase) from pig renal cortex is described. The main steps consist of sodium sulfate fractionation followed by alternative solubilization by dialysis against Tris-HCl buffer and precipitation with phosphate-borate. The final enzyme preparation contains no impurities which could be detected by sucrose gradient centrifugations, sedimentation velocity experiments, immune diffusion, or disc electrophoresis. Glutaminase has been found to exist in different interconvertible molecular forms. A Tris-soluble enzyme form (Tris-HC1 enzyme), obtained by dialysis against Tris-HCl, has an average sedimentation coefficient of 7.3 and an apparent molecular weight of 140,000 to 160,000, as determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation and Sephadex gel filtration. Another enzyme form (phosphate enzyme), obtained by dialysis of the Tris-HCl enzyme against phosphate, has an average sedimentation coefficient of 10.8 and an apparent molecular weight of 250,000 to 290,000. A phosphate-borate-precipitated form (phosphate-borate enzyme), with an average sedimentation coefficient of 50 and an apparent molecular weight of about 2,000,000, is obtained by addition of borate to the phosphate enzyme. Sulfate has an effect on the sedimentation coefficient similar to that of phosphate, and glutamate, citrate, and malonate have an effect similar to that of Tris-HCl. The sedimentation coefficients of both the Tris-HCl enzyme and the phosphate enzyme are increased by borate and the dye bromthymol blue. The sedimentation coefficient of the phosphate enzyme is lowered by chloride and urea. The Tris-HCl enzyme has a pH optimum of about pH 9, whereas no distinct optimum in the pH range 8 to 9 has been shown for the phosphate-borate enzyme. These forms of glutaminase are activated not only by anions, but also by ammonium ions and bromthymol blue, which suggests allosteric properties."
https://openalex.org/W1500846462,"Abstract Parsley carbonic anhydrase (EC 4.2.1.1) is a powerful catalyst for the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, with a maximum catalytic constant of approximately 105 per sec at 25°. It comprises approximately 1% of the total protein in extracts of parsley leaves. The enzyme is purified by a procedure involving fractionation with ammonium sulfate, chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, concentration by ultrafiltration, and chromatography on agarose. Its sedimentation coefficient, s20,w0, is 8.8 S. Sedimentation equilibrium and gel filtration studies in aqueous buffer indicate a molecular weight near 180,000. In 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, or on electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel in the presence of dodecyl sulfate, the molecular weight is approximately 29,000. This suggests that 6, possibly identical, subunits are present. Zinc analysis indicates the presence of 1 zinc atom per 29,000 molecular weight subunit. Attempts to remove the zinc without denaturing the protein were unsuccessful. The amino acid composition is somewhat similar to that of the mammalian carbonic anhydrases, although the parsley enzyme contains much more cysteine, more phenylalanine and methionine, and less tryptophan and histidine, than the mammalian enzymes. Optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism data suggest that the parsley enzyme may contain about 30% helix. The catalytic constant of the parsley carbonic anhydrase for carbon dioxide hydration, like that of the mammalian carbonic anhydrases, increases with increasing pH in the range from pH 6.5 to 7.5. The parsley enzyme differs from the mammalian enzymes, however, in that the Michaelis constant increases with increasing pH. It also differs from them in failing to catalyze the hydrolysis of p-and o-nitrophenyl acetates and in being reversibly inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. Imidazole buffers also act as inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1577907863,"Abstract Cycloheximide, actinomycin D, and puromycin inhibit the synthesis de novo of tyrosinase in cultures of Neurospora crassa which have been derepressed by fasting. Under other conditions, or in a mutant which is not derepressed by fasting, these antibiotics derepress the synthesis at low concentrations. Derepressed cultures, after a lag period, produce tyrosinase at an initially exponential rate. These results, taken together with earlier findings, suggest that synthesis of the enzyme is controlled by an unstable repressor protein. A model which accounts for most of the observations that have been made on this system is presented."

No differences in the native and forms generated in vitro of the B isozymes are noted. All of the zinc in human hemolysates can be accounted for by the carbonic anhydrases and cytocuprein. Quantitative immunochemical assays of the hemolysates of normal humans show little variation in the levels of the B and of the C type enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W1528995211,"Abstract Threonine deaminase (l-threonine hydro-lyase (deaminating), EC 4.2.1.16) from Bacillus subtilis catalyzes the deamination of threonine at a constant rate upon addition of substrate. In the presence of isoleucine, the reaction begins slowly and increases to a steady state, inhibited rate. Essentially the same steady state rate is observed when the same amount of isoleucine is added to enzyme already catalyzing the reaction but the inhibited rate is achieved slowly. In the absence of inhibitor, the substrate saturation curve is described by a hyperbola. In the presence of isoleucine, the curves are sigmoid and can be fitted by the method of Cleland to an equation containing S2 terms. Isoleucine was shown to be a competitive-type inhibitor. The steady state kinetic data can also be fitted to kinetic versions of equations which describe the allosteric model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux for regulatory proteins. Valine antagonized the inhibition by isoleucine in a competitive fashion. It did not activate the enzyme in the absence of isoleucine, rather, it exerted a weak (15%) inhibition which was noncompetitive."

https://openalex.org/W1531771784,"Abstract Male Sprague-Dawley rats were raised on a copper-deficient diet for 4 weeks. At that time their plasma contained little or no ceruloplasmin oxidase activity but did form a precipitate with a rabbit antibody to rat ceruloplasmin. Immunoelectrophoresis of plasma from copper-deficient rats revealed that the substance precipitating with the anticeruloplasmin antibody had the same properties as apoceruloplasmin. In addition, partial purification of the substance indicated that it contained less than 10% of the copper content of holoceruloplasmin. Quantitative precipitin assays of rat plasma showed that the apoceruloplasmin-like substance was present in a concentration equivalent to 25% of the ceruloplasmin concentration in control rats raised on a regular diet. The intraperitoneal injection of copper to the copper-deficient rats resulted in restoration of normal plasma concentrations of ceruloplasmin within 24 to 48 hours."

The purified enzyme shows only one band upon electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels, is antigenically pure by immunodiffusion, and is homogeneous with respect to size as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 100,000 and its sedimentation coefficient s20, is 6.2 S. The enzyme has optimal activity at a temperature of 37° and at pH values between 7.2 and 8.5. The Km values for the formation of histidyl-tRNA were determined as 2.5 x 10-5 m for histidine, 1.4 x 10-4 m for ATP, and 1.1 x 10-7 m for histidine acceptor transfer RNA. Some of the properties of the synthetase in relation to the mechanism of repression of the histidine operon are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1600953383,"A highly purified follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) preparation has been obtained from sheep pituitary glands by extraction with ethanol followed by fractionation with metaphosphoric acid and ammonium sulfate, gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, ion exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl Sephadex, hydroxylapatite chromatography, preparative acrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The purified FSH contained 133 units of the National Institutes of Health ovine follicle-stimulating hormone standard (NIH-FSH-S1) per mg of dry weight as judged by augmentation bioassays. This preparation also contained 0.04 unit of the National Institutes of Health ovine luteinizing hormone standard (NIH-LH-S1) per mg of dry weight as determined by ovarian ascorbate depletion bioassays and more than 1 unit of NIH-LH-S1 per mg as determined by the hypophysectomized male rat ventral prostate bioassay. Radioimmunoassay indicated that the purified FSH contained only 3% as much immunoreactive luteinizing hormone as found in the National Institutes of Health ovine FSH standard (NIH-FSH-S4). Administration of low doses of the purified FSH to hypophysectomized female and male rats not only resulted in increased weights of the ovaries and testes but also of the uteri, ventral prostates, and seminal vesicles. Analytical acrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of the purified FSH at pH 8.9 displayed a single broad zone; however, immunodiffusion in agar showed a diffuse precipitin line plus two fine precipitin lines. The molecular weight of sheep FSH was approximately 33,000 as determined by ultracentrifugation. Electrofocusing in carrier ampholytes indicated an isoelectric point of pH 4.6. Amino acid analysis showed that the purified FSH contained a higher content of threonine and half-cystine and a lower content of phenylalanine than sheep FSH preparations previously described."

A molecular model is postulated in which two immunoglobulin A monomers are superimposed on each other in a close-packed state with the secretory piece inserted in the constant region of the alpha-chains.

Sigmoid substrate saturation curves were obtained in the presence of isoleucine. In crude extracts, the enzyme was stabilized in phosphate buffer at room temperature by pyridoxal phosphate. Under these conditions, however, the enzyme was cold labile. After treatment with brushite during the purification procedure the enzyme was cold stable. The enzyme had a molecular weight of about 200,000 and could be dissociated into half-molecules by urea, guanidine, and sodium lauryl sulfate. Electron microscopy suggested a dimeric structure."

https://openalex.org/W1586430801,"Two representatives of the low (human Enzyme B and horse Enzyme B) and two representatives of the high (bovine Enzyme B and human Enzyme C) catalytic activity forms of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase were reacted with bromoacetate and bromoacetazolamide with the aim of elucidating structural differences at their active sites. The dissociation constants of the reversible inhibition of bromoacetate and bromoacetazolamide have been determined. It was found that the constants for bromoacetate showed 25- to 30-fold differences between the low and high activity forms of the enzyme, but only 1.1- to 6-fold differences within one activity type. The dissociation constants of the enzyme-bromoacetazolamide complex were almost the same for the two groups. Several lines of evidence suggest that bromoacetazolamide inactivates both types of enzymes with simultaneous alkylation of a histidine (or histidines) at or near the active site at the 3-nitrogen position. The rate of alkylation is, however, markedly different for the two types. Stoichiometric amounts of this inhibitor partially alkylate a histidine of the high catalytic activity forms, but do not react with the low catalytic activity forms. At higher inhibitor concentrations both types react, but the high activity forms react significantly faster. By contrast, bromoacetate at low concentrations inactivates exclusively the low catalytic activity forms with the carboxymethylation of a histidine at the 3-nitrogen position. Evidence is presented that this reaction for the horse enzyme occurs at or near the active site. At higher inhibitor concentrations the high catalytic activity forms also became inactivated, but this reaction is nonspecific. The half-times of the inactivation by bromoacetate were also determined. These values for the high catalytic activity enzymes were found to be 36 times greater than could be explained on a basis of enzyme-inhibitor complex concentration. It is suggested that a difference in the conformation of the active site, or a steric hindrance brought about by an amino acid side chain sufficiently close to the reactive histidine, would account for the observed differences in the rates of alkylation and inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1968578062,"Plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, as measured by radioimmunoassay, begin to rise within 5 minutes after initiation of electrical stimulation of the medial-basal hypothalamus, become significantly elevated at 10 minutes, and reach a peak at 10 to 25 minutes. Intravenous administration of synthetic thyrotropin-releasing factor induces a marked rise in plasma thyroidstimulating hormone which is maximal within 5 minutes after administration. These data are interpreted to indicate that there are neuronal structures within the medial-basal hypothalamus which release preformed thyrotropin-releasing factor. The claim (based on bioassay data) that pyroglutamyl-histidyl-proline amide is a potent thyrotropin-releasing factor has also been confirmed by using a highly specific immunoassay system."
https://openalex.org/W1555708202,"Abstract Penicillinase from Bacillus cereus 569 was purified and examined for homogeneity by sedimentation analysis, amino-terminal analysis, and vertical acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The enzyme preparation was shown to contain three distinct species of extracellular penicillinase which could be separated easily by gel electrophoresis. Kinetic studies failed to reveal any significant differences in the three species of enzyme. The evidence provided suggests that all three species are composed of a single polypeptide chain of approximately 31,000 molecular weight. The amino acid composition of a mixture of the three species was determined. These data, plus additional experiments, confirmed a lack of cysteine in penicillinase isolated from B. cereus 569. Optical rotatory dispersion data obtained with penicillinase indicate that possibly 30% of the amino acid residues exist in the α helical configuration. Similarly, data obtained with penicillinase reveal that the majority of this α helix is destroyed in the presence of 7.5 m urea or 5.8 m guanidine hydrochloride. These experiments, in conjunction with measurements which show at least a 500-fold reduction in enzyme activity in the presence of the denaturants, indicate that penicillinase from B. cereus 569 is denatured when treated with high molar concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride. Removal of the denaturants results in full restoration of activity and rotatory dispersion very similar to those obtained for the native enzyme. These data, colleclectively, prove that penicillinase from B. cereus 569 can readily undergo reversible denaturation."

https://openalex.org/W1589356678,"Abstract Bacillus subtilis α-amylase is inactivated by treatment with N-acetylimidazole. Full catalytic activity is restored when the acetylated protein is treated with hydroxylamine. Spectral changes associated with the loss and recovery of activity indicate that exposed residues of tyrosine react. If the enzyme is acetylated in the presence of substrate (soluble starch) the modified protein retains 90% of its catalytic activity and one less tyrosyl residue per 24,000 g of protein reacts, compared with the control which has only 20% activity remaining. Free amino groups are acetylated by N-acetylimidazole but hydroxylamine did not remove these acetyl groups, under the conditions used for regeneration of activity. Maleic anhydride reacts with amino groups on the enzyme but there is only limited loss of catalytic activity with extensive maleylation of the protein. Tetranitromethane inactivates B. subtilis α-amylase. The absorption spectrum and amino acid analysis of a sample which had lost 70% of its activity show that 1 to 1.2 residues of tyrosine per 24,000 g of protein are nitrated while no other residues are affected. The apparent pK of the 3-nitrotyrosine in the modified enzyme is 7.7 which is higher than that of the free amino acid derivative (pKapp = 6.8). Peptide maps of a tryptic digest of the modified protein show a single yellow spot. This tryptic peptide contains 1 eq of 3-nitrotyrosine and corresponds with a tyrosine-containing peptide in the map of the native enzyme. These data are interpreted to indicate that in B. subtilis α-amylase tyrosyl residues are required for enzymic activity. Attempts to relate the tyrosyl residue protected by substrate during acetylation with that residue nitrated by tetranitromethane were made, but are not conclusive. The data support the evidence from peptide mapping that in B. subtilis α-amylase the active, physical entity of about 48,000 molecular weight is composed of two equivalent subunits."

The soluble enzyme was incapable of incorporating the d-glucosyl moiety from guanosine diphosphate d-glucose into β-(1 → 4)-d-glucan, however, addition of Mg2+ to the solution rendered the enzyme active. The addition to the solution of compounds such as d-glucose, cellobiose, maltose, or soluble cellodextrins did not enhance the activity of the soluble enzyme. The particulate enzyme preparation completely lost its activity after 12 hours at 4°. However, addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol caused the particles to remain active after 3 days at 4°. When the soluble enzyme was treated with the same reagent, it retained full activity for 2 weeks at -20°. It was not inactivated by freezing and thawing during this period. Addition to the incubation mixture of 0.5 µmole of ethylenediaminetetraacetate per µmole of MgCl2 caused the reaction to proceed linearly with time up to 25 min.

The enzyme catalyzes a reaction in which 1 mole of thiamine and 2 moles of oxygen are consumed to form 1 mole of thiamine acetic acid. The evidence reported here suggests that thiamine is oxidized to thiamine acetic acid by a single enzyme without the intermediate aldehyde being released from the enzyme. The enzyme is active against thiamine, oxythiamine, and pyrithiamine but not thiochrome. At an equimolar concentration, thiamine acetic acid decreases the rate of oxidation of thiamine by 40%.

Upon removal of the denaturing agent by dialysis, full binding activity is restored. In addition, the electrophoretic and antigenic properties of the urea-treated and dialyzed protein are indistinguishable from those of the native protein. The binding of the amino acid does not result in detectable changes in the conformation of the protein, as judged by studies involving the Stokes radius, sedimentation rate, fluorescence, binding of fluorescent probes, and optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism."

https://openalex.org/W1520567521,"Abstract An in vitro system from Bacillus subtilis cells has been developed for the initiation and synthesis of large polypeptide chains with molecular weights equal to approximately 40,000. The presence of N-formylmethionine on the NH2 termini of newly made peptides has been shown. The analysis of the free NH2-terminal residues of polypeptides made in vitro and coded by endogenous messenger RNA revealed the presence of methionine, alanine, serine, threonine, and valine which are ordinarily present on the NH2 terminus of B. subtilis proteins made in vivo. These results all suggest the high fidelity of this protein-synthesizing system in vitro to that found in vivo."

Red blood cells, infected with malaria and trypanosomes, can be separated from uninfected cells in sucrose gradients after low speed centrifugation1. This simple technique can also be applied to various parasitic Protozoa and Metazoa."
