https://openalex.org/W1550330933,"Purified troponin (Tn), the complex of the Ca-2+ binding subunit (TnC), the inhibitory subunit (TnI), and the tropomyosin binding subunit (TnT) binds 4 mol of Ca-2+ per mol. Two sites bind Ca-2+ with a binding constant of 5 times 10-8 M- minus 1, and two with a binding constant of 5 times 10-6 M- minus 1. In the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 the binding to four sites can be characterized with a single affinity constant of 5 times 10-6 M- minus 1. Purified TnC also binds 4 mol of Ca-2+ per mol; two sites have a binding constant of 2 times 10-7 M- minus 1 and two have one of 2 times 10-5 M- minus 1. In the presence of 2 mM MgCl2 the binding constant of the sites of higher affinity is reduced to 2 times 10-6 M- minus 1, while Ca-2+ binding to the sites of lower affinity is unaffected. Assuming competition between Mg-2+ and Ca-2+ for the high affinity sites on TnC and Tn, the changes in Ca-2+ binding can be accounted for with KMg values of 5 times 10-3 M- minus 1 and 5 times 10-4 M- minus 1, respectively. Tn and TnC bind 4 mol of Mg-2+ per mol in the absence of Cs-2+. The fact that at [Ca-2+] similar to 10- minus 5 M four Ca-2+ and only two Mg-2+ are bound per mol of TnC in the presence of 2 mM Mg-2+ further supports the view that there is direct competition between Mg-2+ and Ca-2+ for the high affinity Ca-2+ binding sites on TnC and Tn. These results then suggest that Tn and TnC contain six divalent cation binding sites: two high affinity Ca-2+ binding sites that also bind Mg-2+ competitively (Ca-2+-Mg-2+ sites); two sites with lower affinity for Ca-2+ that do not bind Mg-2+ (Ca-2+-specific sites); and two sites that bind Mg-2+ but not Ca-2+ (Mg-2+-specific sites). The complex of TnC and TnI (1:1 molar ratio) has the same binding properties as Tn, suggesting a conformational change in TnC upon interaction with TnI. Studies on myofibrillar ATPase activity as a function of free Ca-2+ concentration at two different free Mg-2+ concentrations suggest that full activation by Ca-2+ occurs only upon binding of Ca-2+ to the two Ca-2+-specific binding sites in Tn but does not require binding of Ca-2+ to the Ca-2+-Mg-2+ sites."

https://openalex.org/W1546910338,"The mechanism of transport of basic amino acids into vacuoles of cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated in vitro. Right-side-out vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared from purified vacuoles. Arginine was taken up effectively by the vesicles only in the presence of ATP, not in the presence of ADP or AMP-adenosyl-5‘-yl imidodiphosphate. It was exchangeable and was released completely by a protonophore, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzilidenemalononitrile (SF6847). The transport required Mg2+ ion but was inhibited by Cu2+, Ca2+, or Zn2+ ions. The transport activity was sensitive to the ATPase inhibitor N,N‘-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), but not to oligomycin or sodium vanadate. SF6847 or nigericin blocked arginine uptake completely, but valinomycin had no effect. ATP-dependent formation of a delta pH across the membrane vesicles was shown by quenching of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence. These results indicate that DCCD-sensitive, Mg2+-ATPase of vacuolar membranes is essential as an energy-donating system for the active transport, and that an electrochemical potential difference of protons is a driving force of this basic amino acid transport. Arginine transport showed saturation kinetics with a Km value of 0.6 mM and the mechanism was well explained by an H+/arginine antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1480084192,"The regulation of vertebrate skeletal muscle contraction by the troponin . tropomyosin complex is generally thought to be the result of tropomyosin physically blocking the myosin binding site of actin in the absence of Ca2+. This mechanism was tested during steady state ATP hydrolysis by comparing the degree of association of myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) with the actin . troponin . tropomyosin complex in the absence and presence of Ca2+. Binding in the presence of ATP was determined by stopped flow absorbance measurements at 25 degrees C. Although the steady state ATPase rate was reduced 96% in the absence of Ca2+, the association constant of S-1 with regulated actin was virtually the same in the absence of Ca2+ (1.3 X 10(4) M-1) as in the presence of Ca2+ (2.3 X 10(4) M-1). The association constant of S-1 to regulated actin in the presence of Ca2+ was similar to the association constant of S-1 to unregulated actin. These results suggest that the troponin . tropomyosin complex does not inhibit the actin-activated ATPase activity by preventing the binding of S-1 . ATP or S-1 . ADP . Pi to actin; rather, it may act by blocking the release of Pi from the acto-S-1 . ADP . Pi complex."
https://openalex.org/W1605206902,"The binding of human erythrocyte ankyrin (band 2.1) to the erythrocyte membrane has been characterized by reassociating purified ankyrin with ankyrin-depleted inside-out vesicles. Ankyrin reassociates at high affinity with a limited number of protease-sensitive sites located only on the cytoplasmic side of the erythrocyte membrane. Depleting the vesicles of band 4.2 does not affect their binding capacity. A 45,000-dalton polypeptide derived from the cytoplasmic portion of band 3 competitively inhibits the binding of ankyrin to inside-out vesicles. Although the bulk of band 3 molecules appear to have the potential for binding ankyrin, nly a fraction of the band 3 molecules in native membranes or in reconstituted liposomes actually provides accessible high affinity ankyrin binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1992811266,"Over 350 clones homologous to poly(A)+ RNAs that are significantly more prevalent in conidiating cultures of Aspergillus nidulans than in somatic cells have been selected from a recombinant DNA library formed between nuclear DNA and λ Charon 4A. The procedure used for this selection involved in situ hybridization to a cDNA probe which had been selectively depleted of sequences represented in somatic cells by complement hybridization. Five of these clones have been characterized further. All but one encoded poly(A)+ RNAs that were at least ten times more prevalent in conidiating cultures than in somatic cells. One clone hybridized to a single, developmentally regulated RNA. The three others were complementary to several RNAs having different molecular weights, each of which was more prevalent in conidiating cultures than in vegetative cells. These results and quantitative aspects of the selection procedure suggest that developmentally controlled poly(A)+ RNA coding regions may not be distributed randomly in the Aspergillus genome."
https://openalex.org/W1511936218,"Twelve peptide analogs of the actomyosin ATPase inhibitory region of rabbit skeletal troponin I (Tn-I) have been synthesized by the solid phase method and tested for biological activity in both actomyosin and acto-S1(A1) systems. Acto-S1(A1) is a cleaner and more facile system and we found no important discrepancies in the results for the two systems. These studies indicate that the sequence 105 to 114 is necessary for inhibition and that the inhibition is on the order of that reported for the 21-residue cyanogen bromide fragment of Tn-I (residues 96 to 116). We have shown the importance of lysine 105 and that of a bulky side chain at position 114 to this inhibition. Both the high activity of peptides containing the sequence 105 to 114 compared to Tn-I (45% on a molar basis) and the previously demonstrated tropomyosin specificity of this activity indicate that the relative inhibitory activity of these peptides is applicable to the discussion of the inhibitory activity of Tn-I. We have proven that actin concentration is a significant factor determining the extent of inhibition of both Tn-I and the peptides. We have also established that the charges on alpha-amino and alpha-carboxyl groups of a peptide, which do not appear in the parent protein, can modify the activity of the peptides. This must be taken into account when extrapolating from the activity of a peptide to the activity of the protein."

Hypertrophy caused by triiodothyronine was not prevented by DFMO. There appear to be both ODC-dependent and ODC-independent processes contributing to the subcellular mechanisms associated with growth, which must be considered in the potential laboratory and clinical use of DFMO."
https://openalex.org/W1513838989,"The TF1-ATPase from the thermophilic bacterium, PS3, is inactivated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). This inactivation is stimulated by ADP and other specific nucleotides and is inhibited by Mg2+. When the inactivation is carried out with [14C]DCCD, about 2 g atoms of 14C are bound/mol of TF1 when the enzyme is nearly completely inactivated. The isolated subunits from TF1 inactivated with [14C]DCCD contain the following amounts of 14C/mol: alpha, 0.12 g atom; beta, 0.47 g atom; gamma, approximately 0.04 g atom; delta, none; and epsilon, 0.05 g atom. Fractionation of tryptic digests have shown that the 14C bound to the alpha subunit is nonspecifically associated with several peptides, and that the 14C bound to the beta subunit is associated with a single tryptic peptide with the amino acid sequence Ala-Gly-Val-Gly-Glu-Arg, where Glu represents the N-gamma-glutamyl derivative of dicyclohexyl[14C]urea."

When aden 5'-(3-thiotriphosphate), stereospecifically labeled with 18O in the gamma position, was hydrolyzed in [17O]water in the presence of the ATPase, the product inorganic [16O, 17O, 18O]thiophosphate was chiral. The configuration of the product showed that the hydrolysis had proceeded with inversion at the gamma-phosphorus atom. This result suggests that there is a direct, in-line transfer of the phosphoric residue between ADP and water and that there is no phosphoenzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1531769687,"Platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa were isolated and purified from human platelet membranes using lentil lectin affinity chromatography and electrophoretic elution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis of a mixture of the purified proteins against monospecific antisera showed antigenic uniqueness of the separate polypeptides. Computerized analysis of autoradiographs of two-dimensional tryptic 125I peptide maps revealed that the two glycoproteins had completely different structures. Monospecific anti-glycoproteins IIb and IIIa Fab'2 fragments, either singly or in combination, induced platelet agglutination but did not inhibit or alter the platelet aggregation response to physiologic stimuli. The results demonstrate that human platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa are separate molecular entities. In the native state, the membrane macromolecular IIb.IIIa complex may play an important role in mediating platelet-platelet interactions."

Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two major bands with molecular weights of 58,000 and 46,000. Examination of the acceptor substrate specificity with pure oligomannosides revealed that the best acceptor had the following structure, (Formula: see text) and gave a single product in which N-acetylglucosamine was present in the sequence GlcNAc beta 1 goes to 2Man alpha 1 goes to 3Man beta 1 goes to 4 GlcNAc. Other terminal mannose residues in the best acceptor as well as that linked alpha 1 goes to 6 in the following oligosaccharide, (Formula: see text) were not acceptors. This specificity is in accord with the role of the transferase in the processing of mannose-containing oligosaccharides during glycoprotein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1616144591,"Illumination of chloroplast thylakoid membranes results in the activation of the light-triggered ATPase (coupling factor 1) and in exchange of tightly bound adenine nucleotides. The dark decay of the light-triggered ATPase activity is accelerated significantly by the addition of ADP. Both the decay of the ATPase activity and the rebinding of ADP appear to be rate limited by the same unimolecular step which is estimated to have a rate constant of 0.058 +/- 0.005 s-1. ADP is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the ATPase, if sufficient time for binding is allowed. The Kis for ADP inhibition of the ATPase is equivalent to the K0.5 for ADP binding to the nucleotide tight binding site (K0.5 = 2 +/- 1 microM). A kinetic model is proposed which suggests that the binding of one ADP to chloroplast coupling factor 1 inhibits three ATPase active sites."
https://openalex.org/W1495009307,"Abstract The preceding paper (Williams, D., and Schachter, H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 0000-0000) described a novel N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase in canine submaxillary gland microsomes which catalyzed the incorporation of GlcNAc into mucin acceptors. We show in the present report that the enzyme catalyzes th following reaction: UDP-GlcNAc + Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-X leads to Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc beta 1-6) GalNAc-X + UDP, where X can be porcine submaxillary mucin polypeptide (Km = 5.2 mM), antifreeze glycoprotein polypeptide (Km = 23 mM), alpha-O-p-nitrophenyl (Km = 0.52 mM), beta-O-p-nitrophenyl (Km = 0.92 mM), alpha-O-o-nitrophenyl (Km = 0.86 mM), alpha-O-benzyl (Km = 0.77 mM), alpha-O-methyl (Km = 4.2 mM), or -H (Km = 1.2 mM). Ineffective acceptors (< 5% of the activity with Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-alpha-p-nitrophenyl) are asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin, asialo-alpha 1 acid glycoprotein, Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc-beta-p-nitrophenyl, Gal beta 1-3GlcNAc-alpha-methyl, Gal beta1-3GlcNAc, Gal beta 1-3-N-acetylgalactosaminitol, and D-fucose beta 1-3GalNAc-alpha-benzyl, indicating that both the Gal and GalNAc residues are essential for acceptor activity. The beta 1 leads to 6-linkage of GlcNAc to GalNAc in the acceptor Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-alpha-O-benzyl was established by methylation analysis and high resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of a large scale preparation of product. Preliminary evidence has been obtained indicating that sialic acid linked alpha 2-6 to GalNAc or L-fucose linked alpha 1-2 to Gal inhibit the action of the beta 6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase on Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-porcine submaxillary mucin polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1023516097,"The tryptophan fluorescence emission of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase was studied both in purified ATPase vesicles and in ATPase solubilized with the nonionic detergent dodecyloctaethyleneglycolmonoether (C12E8). Fluorescence intensity changes in purified ATPase were titrated as a function of free Ca2+ in the medium. It exhibited a cooperative pattern, with a Hill number of 2.21 +/- 0.02 and K0.5 = 0.51 microM Ca2+. Upon solubilization of the ATPase, the cooperative pattern of fluorescence change was lost; the Hill number was 0.96 and K0.5 = 1.4 microM Ca2+. When solubilization was carried out in the presence of 0.5 or 1.0 mM CaCl2, followed by the titrations of fluorescence change in the micromolar Ca2+ range, the cooperative pattern was preserved under the same concentrations of C12E8 which would otherwise promote the loss in cooperativity. For the ATPase solubilized in millimolar Ca2+, the Hill number was 1.98 with a K0.5 = 1.5 microM Ca2+. The maximal amount of Ca2+ bound to the high affinity sites corresponded to approximately 1 mol of calcium/mol of polypeptide chains, both in purified ATPase vesicles and in the soluble ATPase. A model is suggested, which involves a minimum of 4 interacting Ca2+ sites (tetramers). Cooperativity is accounted for in the model by the predominance in the absence of Ca2+ of low affinity state (E') of the Ca2+ site (K'D = 5.7 x 10(-4) M), which would be congruent to 90 times more concentrated than (E), the high affinity state (KD = 1.9 x 10(-7) M). Simulations derived from this model fit the experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W1542374797,"Canine submaxillary gland microsomes have been shown to catalyze the following reaction: UDP-GlcNAc + Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-X leads to Gal beta 1-3(GlcNAc)GalNAc-X + UDP where X is porcine or ovine submaxillary mucin polypeptide or a low molecular weight substituent. This activity was shown by mixed substrate experiments to be different from two other previously described glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases acting on N-glycosyl oligosaccharides and is the first N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase shown to act on mucin substrates. The transferase-catalyzed reaction proceeds at 70 to 80% of the optimum rate in the absence of added divalent cation or in the presence of 10 mM EDTA. The enzyme appeared to be unstable at 37 degrees C, but the reaction rate remained constant for at least 2 h at 25 degrees C. The enzyme showed a pH optimum of 7.0 and was stimulated 4-fold by 0.125% Triton X-100. Methylation analysis of product formed either with mucin acceptor or Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-alpha-O-benzyl indicated GlcNAc transfer to either carbon 4 or carbon 6 of the GalNAc residue of the acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1504974457,"Acid hydrolases from mammalian sources contain phosphorylated oligosaccharides which function as recognition markers for their receptor-mediated endocytosis by human fibroblasts. The discovery that glycopeptides derived from the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, contain mannose 6-phosphate led to the suggestion that acid hydrolases from this source might also bear the marker. To test this hypothesis, the binding and endocytosis of purified beta-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52), and alpha-D-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) by human fibroblasts were investigated. These enzymes underwent endocytosis with efficiencies of 8.6 to 60%/mg/h, and 1 mM mannose 6-phosphate markedly inhibited their uptake (80 to 100%). The specificity of inhibition by sugar phosphates, the saturation kinetics of endocytosis, and the binding properties of D. discoideum acid hydrolases were similar to those reported for enzyme preparations derived from mammalian sources. In addition, 95 to 100% of the beta-D-glucosidase or alpha-D-mannosidase molecules from D. discoideum preparations were competent for in vitro clearance. Furthermore, the three purified acid hydrolases contain 5 to 7 mol of mannose 6-phosphate/mol of enzyme. This indicates that, unlike many mammalian enzyme preparations, most if not all of these enzyme molecules from D. discoideum contain the phosphomannosyl recognition marker."
https://openalex.org/W1507548413,"The intrinsic fluorescence of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was measured under conditions allowing ATPase phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate. Significant fluorescence enhancement of up to 4% resulted from gradient-independent enzyme phosphorylation at pH 6, in the absence of KCl. The equilibrium fluorescence data obtained at various magnesium and phosphate concentrations agree with a reaction scheme in which Mg2+, as direct activator, and free phosphate, as the true substrate, bind to the enzyme in random order to give a noncovalent ternary complex (Mg.*E.Pi), in equilibrium with the covalent phosphoenzyme (Mg.*E-P). The transient kinetics of the fluorescence rise was also studied, and the resulting data were generally consistent with the above scheme, assuming that binding reactions are fast compared to covalent phosphoenzyme formation. This, however, might be valid only as a first approximation. At 20 degrees C and pH 6, the phosphate concentration for half-maximum phosphorylation rate constant, at 20 mM magnesium, was higher than 20 mM. Similarly, the magnesium concentration for half-maximum phosphorylation rate constant, at 20 mM phosphate, was also higher than 20 mM. The maximum phosphorylation rate was faster than 25 s-1, and the phosphoenzyme hydrolysis rate constant was 1.5-2 s-1 under these conditions, so that the equilibrium constant between Mg.*E.Pi and Mg.*E-P largely favors the phosphoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1605178447,"Light chain exchange in 4.7 M NH4Cl was used to hybridize the essential light chain of cardiac myosin with the heavy chain of fast muscle myosin subfragment 1, S-1. The actin-activated ATPase properties of this hybrid were compared to those of the two fast S-1 isoenzymes, S-1(A1), fast muscle subfragment 1 which contains only the alkali-1 light chain, and S-1(A2), fast muscle myosin subfragment 1 which contains only the alkali-2 light chain. This hybrid S-1 behaved like S-1(A1)., At low ionic strength in the presence of actin, this hybrid had a maximal rate of ATP hydrolysis about the same as that of S-1(A1) and about one-half that of S-1(A2), while at higher ionic strengths the actin-activated ATPases of these three S-2 species were all similar. Light chain exchange in NH4Cl was also used to hybridize the essential light chains of fast muscle myosin with the heavy chains of cardiac myosin and to hybridize the essential light chains of cardiac myosin with the heavy chains of fast muscle myosin. In 60 and 100 mM KCl, the actin-activated ATPases of these two hybrid myosins were very different from those of the control myosins with the same essential light chains but were very similar to those of the control myosins with the same heavy chains, differing at most by one-third."

https://openalex.org/W1538734925,"Abstract The physiochemical properties of the isolated alpha subunit of the Escherichia coli coupling factor ATPase, and changes resulting from the interaction of alpha with ATP, were studied. Amino acid analysis of alpha revealed 42% polar residues, 4 cysteine residues, and a single tryptophan residue. The partial specific volume, v, of alpha was 0.74 cm3 g-1. Molecular weight value of alpha, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, of 55,000 to 59,000 were observed in guanidine hydrochloride, or in nondenaturing buffer in either the presence of absence of ATP, which alpha binds with high affinity. Sedimentation velocity experiments gave a value of s20,w0-3.52 S for alpha. In the presence of ATP, this value increased to 4.00 S, indicating a large conformational change of alpha when ATP is bound. A slow dissociation rate of alpha x ATP was suggested by the finding that a substantial portion of [2-3H]ATP mixed with alpha remained to the protein during native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, causing alpha to migrate with a higher relative mobility. A dissociation rate constant, koff, of 0.21 min-1 at 22 degrees C was measured by following the rate at which unlabeled ATP displaced [2-3H]ATP from the protein. The properties of the interaction of alpha with ATP suggest that this subunit may be the site of the tightly bound nucleotides of the coupling factor ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1666831655,"Abstract The nitrogen regulatory circuit of Neurospora crassa contains an entire set of unlinked structural genes which specify nitrogen catabolic enzymes. These genes are controlled as a group by a major regulatory gene, designated nit-2, which turns on their expression in a positive fashion. Moreover, expression of these same structural genes is repressed when the cells contain sufficient nitrogen; the active repressor metabolite has been identified as glutamine. It has been suggested that the nit-2 gene product is a protein which binds at a recognition sequence near each nitrogen-related structural gene to activate their expression. We have directly examined the nuclear proteins of Neurospora in order to attempt to detect th postulated nit-2 regulatory protein. Nonhistone nuclear proteins were isolated, labeled in vitro, and applied to DNA-cellulose and subsequently specifically eluted with glutamine. A single protein, whose molecular weight is approximately 22,000, was eluted from DNA-cellulose by glutamine but not by asparagine. This same protein was greatly reduced in quantity in the nonhistone proteins isolated from two nit-2 mutants; a third nit-2 mutant has a normal amount of this nuclear protein but it displays a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility than found in wild type. Finally, a revertant of a nit-2 mutant possesses approximatley 20 times as much of this protein as does the parental nit-2 mutant, an amount essentially equivalent to that found in wild type. The results suggest that the nit-2 control gene encodes this DNA-binding protein, which is postulated to play a major role in regulating expression of the structural genes of the nitrogen control circuit of Neurospora."
https://openalex.org/W1584153502,"A microsomal preparation from larval stages of the brine shrimp Artemia salina was found to catalyze the transfer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to an endogenous acceptor. The product was identified as chitin by its resistance to extraction with alkali and high concentrations of urea and the liberation of chito-oligosaccharides by treatment with purified chitinases. The enzyme requires Mg2+ for activity and is inhibited by UDP and diflubenzuron, but not by Polyoxin D. The pH optimum is 7.0. The enzyme is not significantly activated by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine nor by trypsin treatment. Incorporation of radioactivity into endogenous acceptor is inhibited by chitodextrins which appear to serve as alternate acceptors. The crustacean enzyme can also utilize exogenous, macromolecular chitin as acceptor. The enzyme, which was partially purified by sucrose step-gradient ultracentrifugation, appears maximally active after 72 h of larval growth."
https://openalex.org/W1572182935,"Detailed kinetic analyses of ATP-splitting activities were obtained with purified Ca2+ ATPase from human erythrocyte membranes. At constant low total ATP levels increasing Mg2+ inhibited the activity of the enzyme, while increasing Ca2+ did not. Detailed analysis of this phenomenon with appropriate controls showed that this occurred because Ca2+ . ATP4- (CaATP) was the substrate for the enzyme: the inhibition by Mg2+ was due to the lowering of the CaATP concentration as Mg2+ replaced Ca2+ as the metal bound to ATP. Free ATP could not be the substrate, since its concentration could be lowered by increasing total Ca2+, and no inhibition of the reaction occurred. In addition to this site for CaATP, the enzyme may contain yet another metal-ATP site of much lower affinity and less specificity with respect to the metal. The data also indicate the presence of a Mg2+ site and a Ca2+ site in addition to the CaATP site. Since the enzyme also interacts with calmodulin, it effectively interacts with Ca2+ at three sites: the Ca2+ site, the CaATP site, and the Can-calmodulin site. The enzyme displays the same characteristics in the presence of calmodulin. However, the stimulation by calmodulin is always about three times higher in the presence of Mg2+ than in its absence. A model for the mechanism of this enzyme is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1518390395,"Bacteriophage lambda transcripts were synthesized in vitro using lambda b2 DNA and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. RNA molecules initiating with ATP were labeled exclusively at the 5'-end by transcribing in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP. They were analyzed by electrophoresis in 3.5% polyacrylamide, 7.5 M urea gels followed by autoradiography. The previously known 6 S rho-independent transcript and rho-dependent 9 S and 8 S transcripts were observed. A new rho-dependent 5 S transcript was also detected. The 5 S RNA was not the result of cleavage of larger RNAs by ribonuclease III. Analysis of partial ribonuclease T1 digestion products of isolated 5'-end-labeled transcripts showed that the 5 S RNA is synthesized from promoter pR, the promoter for the 9 S and 8 S RNA species. A similar analysis of transcripts labeled with 32P exclusively at the 3'-terminus by the post-transcriptional addition of a [32P]pCp moiety with T4 RNA ligase revealed the positions of guanosine nucleotides proximal to the 3'-hydroxyl end. This information, and inspection of the known DNA nucleotide sequence downstream from pr, allowed us to conclude that the 5 S RNA is a mixture of molecules 112 and 113 nucleotides long terminating in the middle of gene cro. The nucleotide sequence at the 3'-end of the 5 S RNA is similar to that of other rho-dependent transcripts and lacks the oligo(U) found at the terminus of rho-independent transcripts."

With the exception of this partial methylation and of a single tyrosyl residue, it shared all the characteristic properties of mammalian calmodulin in terms of molecular weight, amino acid composition, electrophoretic behavior in the presence or absence of Ca2+ ions, and activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. In fact, Octopus calmodulin proved to be slightly more effective than ram testis calmodulin in activating both skeletal and smooth muscle myosin light chain kinases in the presence of Ca2+. This provides conclusive evidence that (a) stoichiometric trimethylation of lysine 115 is not required for enzyme activation, and (b) the inability of troponin C to activate myosin light chain kinase (Walsh, M.

Of the methods tested, a dialysis method using cholate plus deoxycholate gave the best results for reconstitution. Using this method, H+ conductivity of the membrane moiety of H+-ATPase from a thermophilic bacterium PS3 (TF0) was analyzed. Dependence of H+ conductivity of TF0 on H+ concentration fitted a Michaelis-Menten equation showing a Vmax of 31.3 microgram ion/min . mg of TF0 and a Km of 0.095 microgram ion/liter. Upon modification of a tyrosyl residue of TF0 with iodine, the Km value shifted to 0.71 microgram ion/liter, while the Vmax remained constant. These results were interpreted as indicating that a single tyrosyl residue in N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding proteolipid of TF0 plays an important role as an H+ donor in the the rate-limiting step of H+ permeation through TF0. TF1, the catalytic moiety of H+-ATPase from the thermophilic bacterium PS3, blocked H+ conduction through TF0. A 1:1 stoichiometry of TF1 and TF0 was found in ATP-dependent membrane potential generation as well as H+ conduction."

https://openalex.org/W1533676970,"Citreoviridin, a nonfluorescent inhibitor of bovine and bacterial ATPases, also inhibits the yeast F1 (K1 = 2 microM). The beta subunit-specific fluorescent ligand, aurovertin, has been used to report the interaction of citreoviridin with the yeast F1-ATPase and the isolated beta subunit. Citreoviridin caused a marked decrease in the fluorescence increment associated with the binding of aurovertin to either intact F1 or the isolated beta subunit. Three lines of evidence indicate that citreoviridin and aurovertin bind to nonidentical sites on the beta subunit: 1) the binding of citreoviridin to the F1 or isolated beta subunit is noncompetitive with respect to aurovertin; 2) the number of aurovertin binding sites (Kd = 0.2 to 0.6 microM) per F1-ATPase molecule remains the same (1.89 +/- 0.6 mol of aurovertin bound per mol of F1) in the presence or absence of citreoviridin; 3) the F1-ATPase obtained from the aurovertin-resistant mutant aur-1 is partly inhibited by citreoviridin."
https://openalex.org/W2033352933,"Interactions between regulatory T lymphocytes and other cells are assumed to occur at the level of the cell surface. T cells which suppress the generation of specifically effector cells have been described as having antigenic, idiotypic, allotypic and I-region specificity. Other T suppressor cells generated by in vitro cultivation with or without mitogenic stimulation have suppressive activity for T and B cells but no specificity can be assigned to them. These T suppressor cells (Ts) inhibit various lymphoid functions-this either reflects their polyclonal origin or indicates that the structures recognized by the Ts receptors must be common for many cell types. Carbohydrates on cell membrane-inserted glycoproteins or glycolipids might function as specific ligands for recognition by cellular receptors or soluble factors. Almost all cell-surface proteins of mammalian cells are glycosylated. There is evidence for lectin-like carbohydrate binding proteins not only in plants but also in toxins, viruses, prokaryotic cells and even mammalian cells, including T cells. A functional role for these lectin-like proteins has been described for slime moulds and suggested for the selective association of embryonic cells. We report here that addition of a monosaccharide can counteract the effect of T suppressor cells during the generation of alloreactive cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1639846401,"The effect of regions adjacent to the lambda PL promoter was studied using a sequence deleted in an A/T-rich segment immediately upstream from the promoter. High resolution thermal denaturation analysis showed that the undeleted sequence, as isolated on a 360-bp restriction fragment (360-PL) melted in two distinct steps. Since the deleted sequence (230-PL) melts at a higher temperature than any portion of 360-PL, the deleted promoter is more stable to denaturation. This increased stability was also suggested by a transcription assay in which the strong binding of RNA polymerase is inhibited at low temperature. The deleted promoter fragment required a higher temperature to become functional than did the 360-PL fragment. Furthermore, RNA polymerase bound to the 230-PL fragment is displaced by heparin at a faster rate than from 360-PL, and the deleted fragment initiates transcription at a reduced rate. Thus, by several criteria the deleted promoter is less active than the parent sequence. Evidence is presented arguing that the deletion does not alter the sequence directly recognized by RNA polymerase. Therefore, the altered sequence is reducing promoter activity by changing some other level of overall promoter structure. These results suggest that regions outside of the sequence directly recognized by a regulatory protein can affect genetic expression from the site."
https://openalex.org/W2051246954,Monoamine oxidase activity was higher in the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia of patients dying from Huntington's disease than in controls. Enzyme kinetics and multiple substrate studies indicated that the increased activity was due to elevated concentrations of monoamine oxidase type B. Concentrations of homovanillic acid were increased in the cerebral cortex but not in the basal ganglia of brains of patients with Huntington's disease. These changes may represent a primary aminergic lesion that could underlie some of the mental symptoms of this disease.

https://openalex.org/W1557807420,"The H+-translocating ATPase from rat liver mitochondria can be disaggregated selectively to yield two distinct, stable complexes of the rutamycin-insensitive ATPase. The two ATPase complexes can be purified to homogeneity by zone sedimentation in a glycerol gradient. Based on their electrophoretic mobility in 5% polyacrylamide gels, the aggregates have been designated as type I (Rf = 0.49) ATPase and type II (Rf = 0.56) ATPase. These two complexes of the ATPase differ in ATP hydrolytic activity, in stability, in mobility on 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, in subunit composition, and in ability to reassociate with submitochondrial particles which are highly depleted in ATPase activity. The type II ATPase is similar to the F1-ATPase, but the type I ATPase contains a 26.5-kilodalton subunit not present in the type II enzyme. This 26.5-kilodalton subunit is equimolar with the gamma subunit of the ATPase (based on Coomassie blue dye binding); its presence seems to be correlated to the altered properties of the type I ATPase. Type I ATPase reconstitutes rutamycin-sensitive ATPase activity in submitochondrial particles treated with trypsin, urea, ammonia, and 1.5% silicotungstic acid. The type II ATPase does not reconstitute rutamycin-sensitive ATPase activity in these ATPase-depleted submitochondrial particles unless it is supplemented with the 26.5-kilodalton subunit isolated from the type I ATPase. The 26.5-kilodalton protein has thus been functionally identified as important for the binding of the ATPase to the membrane by providing a direct link to the membrane or by binding to the ATPase putting it in an appropriate conformation for binding."
https://openalex.org/W1589663482,"Phosphofructokinase was determined at low substrate concentration using a new isotopic assay in extracts of perfused rat heart. Epinephrine treatment of the perfused heart resulted in an activation of the enzyme. Half-maximal activation of phosphofructokinase occurred at 5 X 10(-7) M epinephrine, which was approximately that required to produce half-maximal activation of phosphorylase. Time course studies indicated that epinephrine-mediated changes in beating rate, cyclic AMP concentration, and phosphorylase a activity were maximal at 1 to 2 min and preceded maximal activation of phosphofructokinase by approximately 3 min. the activated form of the enzyme as expressed in heart extracts was sensitized to the activators, cyclic AMP, AMP, glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Passage of control extract that was untreated, activated by AMP, or inhibited by citrate through Sephadex G-25 columns gave eluate activities approaching control extract values. The epinephrine-activated form of the enzyme remained activated following similar treatment. The data suggest that epinephrine mediates a modification of phosphofructokinase that is independent of changes in intracellular effector concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1661496677,"Peptide fragments generated by limited plasmin digestion and reduction of human growth hormone (hGH) and human placental lactogen (hPL) were recombined to produce biologically active molecules consisting of the NH2-terminal two-thirds of one hormone molecule linked to the COOH-terminal one-third of the other. Plasmin-cleaved hPL and hGH each consist of an NH2-terminal fragment (1-134) connected to a COOH-terminal fragment (141-191) through a Cys53-Cys165 disulfide bond. The plasmin-cleaved hormones were reduced, the fragments isolated, and then recombined in equimolar quantities to prepared recombinant hormones. On sodium dodecyl sulfate disc gel electrophoresis the recombinants migrated as a single band in the position of native hormone when they were not reduced and as two bands in the positions of the fragments when they were reduced. This indicated that the recombinants had re-formed a disulfide bond. The derivatives were tested for immunologic activity in hPL and hGH radioimmunoassays, for lactogenic and growth-promoting activity by the radioreceptor assays using membranes from mammary gland and liver of lactating rabbits, and for secondary and tertiary structure by circular dichroism measurements in the near and far UV regions. The recombinant with NH2-terminal hGH had hGH immunologic activity, hGH structure and lactogenic and growth-promoting activity, while the hybrid with NH2-terminal hPL had hPL immunologic activity, hPL structure, and lactogenic activity alone. Therefore the immunologic activity, biologic activity, and structure of each of the covalently linked derivatives was characteristic of the hormone's NH2-terminal 1-134 fragment. The COOH-terminal 141-191 sequence maintains overall conformation but appears to have little, if any, role in determining biologic specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1822965789,"A simple purification procedure has been developed for the extracellular alkaline protease from Neurospora crassa. Key steps in the purification were: 1) the choice of gelatin as the protein inducer, which induces optimally at a much lower concentration than other commonly employed protein inducers; 2) heat treatment, during which the inducer is digested by the protease; and 3) a concentration step that eliminates the usual precipitation procedures and removes much of the digested protein inducer. These procedures were followed by routine ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The preparation was homogeneous, as determined by gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugal analyses. A molecular weight of approximately 30,500 was determined by amino acid analysis, gel electrophoresis, and sedimentation equilibrium. The protease has 100% activity from pH 6.0 to 10.0, is heat labile above 45 degrees C, and susceptible to autodigestion. Hydrolysis of the beta chain from insulin indicates a preferential cleavage on the carboxyl group side of neutral and aromatic amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W119245353,"Evidence is presented that under physiological conditions of ionic strength and temperature, where myosin Subfragment 1 is hydrolyzing MgATP, the interaction between its subunits is extremely labile. Incubation of [3H]N-ethylmaleimide-SF1(A1) with N-ethylmaleimide-SF1(A2) in the presence of 10 mM MgATP at 37 degrees C resulted in the exchange of subunits between these isozymes. This is readily discernible from the subunit composition and distribution of the 3H label after separation of the isozymes by ion exchange chromatography. Moreover, incubation of unmodified SF1(A1) or SF1(A2) with the free Alkali light chains A2 and A1, respectively, under the same conditions led to the formation of significant amounts of the hybrid species. These findings suggest that in vivo the Alkali light chain-heavy chain interaction of Subfragment 1 is in a state of dynamic equilibrium between associated and dissociated states."
https://openalex.org/W1496348908,"Oxalase-supported, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by cardiac and skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) exhibits a pH profile with the maximal rate of Ca2+ uptake at pH 6.6-6.8 and marked inhibition (90-95%) at pH 7.4-7.6, a point at which Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity is optimal. These observations are noted when the SR is first preincubated in media containing no added Ca2+. This alkaline pH inhibition is not caused by an irreversible perturbation since the Ca2+ uptake rate is fully restored by changing the alkaline pH preincubation medium to pH 6.8. When SR is preincubated with added Ca2+, Ca2+ uptake at alkaline pH (7.4-7.6) is only inhibited by 10-30%. Ca2+ uptake at pH 6.8 is the same regardless of preincubation conditions. A depressed oxalate permeability is not a factor in the observed alkaline pH inhibition of Ca2+ uptake. At alkaline pH, the relationship between the preincubation Ca2+ concentration and the rate of Ca2+ uptake is hyperbolic; the half-maximal free Ca2+ concentration for stabilization of Ca2+ uptake is 8-15 microM with a Vmax equal to the velocity at the optimal pH. The Hill coefficient is 1.0, implying a single class of Ca2+-requiring sites for stabilization at alkaline pH. In contrast to its effect on Ca2+ uptake, the presence of Ca2+ during preincubation does not alter the pH sensitivity of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. Thus, the presence of Ca2+ during preincubation may stabilize a state of the CaATPase, conducive to the coupling of net Ca2+ translocation to Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, which is ordinarily opposed by alkaline pH. The data suggest a single class of Ca2+-requiring sites which favors this coupled state."

https://openalex.org/W2166488402,"The interaction of myosin Subfragment 1 with ATP in 0.1 M KCl containing 0.01 M MgCl2 and 0.02 M Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) was studied by microcalorimetry at temperatures of 4, 12, and 23 degrees C so that values of the heat capacity change (delta Cp) could be obtained for intermediate steps of the ATPase cycle. The delta Cp values are large compared to the value for the overall cycle, indicating that large changes in the hydrophobic effect are involved in transitions between different intermediate states. However, the heat capacity changes themselves show peculiar temperature dependences. Thus bindings of ATP and ADP to Subfragment 1, both of which are strongly exothermic processes, take place with large negative delta Cp of about -3 kJK-1 mol-1 between 4 and 12 degrees C but with very small delta Cp of 0.3-0.4 kJ K-1 mol-1 between 12 and 23 degrees C. On the contrary, the delta Cp for the endothermic hydrolysis of ATP bound to Subfragment 1 is positive (congruent to kJK-1 mol-1) in the lower temperature range but strongly negative (congruent to -4 kJK-1 mol-1) in the higher temperature range. The magnitude of delta Cp for the slow Pi dissociation process is similar but its sign is just opposite to that for the hydrolysis. These anomalous changes in the heat capacity may be due to the temperature-induced changes in a balance between large opposing effects which result from distinct, local conformation changes within the Subfragment 1 molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1480458296,"We have found that when the ATP hydrolysis activity of beef heart mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase (F1) is eliminated by either cold treatment or chemical modification, the enzyme attains the ability to catalyze the Pi in equilibrium ATP exchange reaction. The ATP hydrolysis activity of isolated F1 was lost upon chemical modification by phenyglyoxal, butanedione, or 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzene-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. The F1 thus chemically modified was able to catalyze an ADP-dependent Pi in equilibrium ATP exchange reaction. In addition F1 that had been cold-treated to eliminate ATP hydrolysis activity, also catalyzed the Pi in equilibrium ATP exchange reaction. The Pi in equilibrium ATP exchange catalyzed by modified F1 was shown to be totally inhibited by the F1-specific antibiotic efrapeptin. We have previously shown that isolated beef heart mitochondrial ATPase will catalyze the formation of a transition state analog of the ATP synthesis reaction (Bossard, M. J., Vik, T. A., and Schuster, S. M. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 5342-5346). While the F1-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis activity was lost rapidly upon chemical modification or cold treatment, the ability of the enzyme to produce Pi . adenosine 5'-diphosphate (chromium(III) salt) from phosphate and monodentate adenosine 5'-diphosphate (chromium(III) salt) was unimpaired. The implications of these data with regard to the mechanism of ATP synthesis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1582080785,"Abstract Activities of single ions in concentrated suspensions of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles have been measured using ion-specific electrodes. With activation of the Ca2+-stimulated ATPase by addition of ATP in the presence of equimolar Mg2+ and activating concentrations of Ca2+, activities of Na+ and H3O+ increased to maxima, then declined to reach new steady levels; the activity of K+ decreased to a minimum then rose to a new steady state level. In the absence of Mg2+ and the presence of the ionophore A23187, vesicles failed to accumulate Ca2+ at all; extrema in activities of Na+, K+, and H3O+, however, were still observed, and the final levels of activities of Na+ and K+ were the same as their initial levels. The final pH was always lower than the initial pH because protons were produced by the hydrolysis of ATP. In fresh vesicles which accumulated and retained Ca2+, activities of Na+ and H3O+ were held at higher levels and the activity of K+ at a lower level than those reached in the absence of Ca2+ accumulation. When vesicles were solubilized by addition of Triton X-100, the minimum in pH was still observed. These findings are discussed in terms of a molecular model of active transport in which the driving force for transport is developed by a change in the structure of a small volume of water enclosed within a narrow cleft of the pump unit."
