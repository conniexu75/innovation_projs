Here, we report that nitric oxide (NO) activates p21ras in human T cells as evidenced by an increase in GTP-bound p21ras. In vitro studies using pure recombinant p21ras demonstrate that the activation is direct and reversible. Circular dichroism analysis reveals that NO induces a profound conformational change in p21ras in association with GDP/GTP exchange. The mechanism of activation is due to S-nitrosylation of a critical cysteine residue which stimulates guanine nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p21ras is essential for NO-induced downstream signaling, such as NF-κB activation, and that endogenous NO can activate p21ras in the same cell. These studies identify p21ras as a target of NO in T cells and suggest that NO activates p21ras by an action which mimics that of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.

https://openalex.org/W1532265037,"Aberrant phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is one of the pathological features of neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. The phosphorylation of Ser-262 within the microtubule binding region of tau is of particular interest because so far it is observed only in Alzheimer's disease (Hasegawa, M., Morishima-Kawashima, M., Takio, K., Suzuki, M., Titani, K., and Ihara, Y.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 26, 17047-17054) and because phosphorylation of this site alone dramatically reduces the affinity for microtubules in vitro (Biernat, J., Gustke, N., Drewes, G., Mandelkow, E.-M., and Mandelkow, E.(1993) Neuron 11, 153-163). Here we describe the purification and characterization of a protein-serine kinase from brain tissue with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa on SDS gels. This kinase specifically phosphorylates tau on its KIGS or KCGS motifs in the repeat domain, whereas no significant phosphorylation outside this region was detected. Phosphorylation occurs mainly on Ser-262 located in the first repeat. This largely abolishes tau's binding to microtubules and makes them dynamically unstable, in contrast to other protein kinases that phosphorylate tau at or near the repeat domain. The data suggest a role for this novel kinase in cellular events involving rearrangement of the microtubule-associated proteins/microtubule arrays and their pathological degeneration in Alzheimer's disease."

A novel transcriptionally regulated phosphatase, MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), is induced by angiotensin II in VSMC and selectively dephosphorylates MAP kinase in vitro. Using actinomycin D and antisense oligonucleotides targeted to MKP-1, we demonstrate that MKP-1 regulates MAP kinase in VSMC. Both actinomycin D and MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotides inhibited MKP-1 mRNA expression and caused prolonged activation of the p42 and p44 MAP kinases as measured by in-gel-kinase assays and Western blot. For example, MAP kinase activity 120 min after angiotensin II treatment was 30% (range 25-35%), 79%, and 74% of maximum in control, actinomycin D-treated (3 μg/ml, 30 min), and antisense oligonucleotide-treated (300 nM, 6 h) cells, respectively. A sense oligonucleotide was without effect (34%). MKP-1 antisense oligonucleotides did not affect the activity of MEK indicating that sustained activation of MAP kinase was due to inhibition of MKP-1 expression. These findings demonstrate that inactivation of MAP kinase by angiotensin II is mediated predominantly by MKP-1, suggesting an important role for MKP-1 and other related phosphatases in the regulation of MAP kinases in VSMC.

Its function is, therefore, critical to the survival of all vascular plants. Its chemical structure and biosynthesis are poorly defined, although it is known to consist of both aromatic and aliphatic domains. While the composition of the aliphatic component has been fairly well characterized, that of the phenolic component has not. Using a combination of specific carbon-13 labeling techniques, and in situ solid state 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis, we now provide the first direct evidence for the nature of the phenolic domain of suberin and report here that it is almost exclusively comprised of a covalently linked, hydroxycinnamic acid-derived polymeric matrix.

Suberin is a complex, intractable, biopolymer found in specialized plant cell walls, where it is laid down between the primary wall and plasmalemma(1Kolattukudy P.E. Can. J. Bot. 1984; 62: 2918-2933Crossref Google Scholar, 2Esau K. Anatomy of Seed Plants. Wiley and Sons, New York1977: 183-198Google Scholar). It is comprised of both aromatic and aliphatic components, a feature which may contribute to the alternating light and dark lamellae observed in transmission electron microscope sections of suberized tissue. It plays a pivotal physiological function in providing a water-impermeable diffusion barrier in dermal tissues of most underground plant organs (e.g. mature roots, tubers, stolons, rhizomes), the periderm (bark) of aerial tissues that undergo secondary thickening, and the Casparian band of the endodermis(2Esau K. Anatomy of Seed Plants. Wiley and Sons, New York1977: 183-198Google Scholar). Consequently, it is essential for water retention by plants and functions in the overall control of water movement through the apoplastic stream(2Esau K. Anatomy of Seed Plants. Wiley and Sons, New York1977: 183-198Google Scholar). In this context, the evolutionary development of its biological pathway must have been a critical juncture in the transition of plants from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, since it provided vascular plants with the ability to cope with a desiccating environment(3Lewis N.G Davin L.B. ACS Symp. Ser. 1994; 562: 202-246Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to its developmentally regulated biosynthesis, suberin is synthesized and deposited in the walls of cells adjacent to wound sites during wound healing, where it is hypothesized to serve both as a diffusion barrier to water loss and as a physical barrier to opportunistic pathogens(1Kolattukudy P.E. Can. J. Bot. 1984; 62: 2918-2933Crossref Google Scholar). In fact, most of our current knowledge about suberin and the suberization process is derived from wound-induced healing processes. It should be recognized, however, that the molecular mechanism(s) of the induction of suberin biosynthesis (and regulation thereof) remains largely unknown. A tentative model depicting suberin as an aliphatic polyester network containing a lignin core (i.e. a polymeric matrix of monolignols 1a-1c) interspersed with esterified waxes and hydroxycinnamic acids was first proposed in the early 1980s by Kolattukudy(1Kolattukudy P.E. Can. J. Bot. 1984; 62: 2918-2933Crossref Google Scholar). It emerged out of the most logical reconstruction of compounds identified in the chemical degradation products of suberin-enriched cell wall preparations from wound-healed (i.e. suberized) potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber disks. For example, saponification, LiAlH4 reduction, and BF3/methanol transesterification of suberin-enriched preparations released mainly L-alkanoic acids, L-alkanols, ω-hydroxyalkanoic acids, α,ω-alkane-dioic acids, as well as smaller amounts of unsaturated, hydroxylated, and epoxidized aliphatics(4Kolattukudy P.E. Dean B.B. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 116-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Matzke K. Riederer M. Planta. 1991; 185: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and ferulic acid(6Cottle W. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Physiol. 1984; 69: 393-396Crossref Google Scholar, 7Borg-Olivier O. Monties B. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. III. 1989; 308: 141-147Google Scholar, 8Borg-Olivier O. Monties B. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 601-606Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). (These components were presumed to be largely ester-linked since they were readily released from suberin preparations by treatment with alkali.) The lignin core was predicted largely on the basis of alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation (a common method used for lignin detection and characterization), which yielded substituted benzaldehydes considered to be derived from, and characteristic of, lignin(9Riley R.G. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Physiol. 1975; 56: 650-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent attempts at providing more direct evidence for a lignin core in suberized tissues have generated conflicting results. Specifically, various research groups have applied techniques developed for detailed lignin analysis to the study of suberized tissues (see below). Thioacidolysis, for example, is a recently developed lignin degradation procedure that releases characteristic trithioethane derivatives of the monolignol 1a-1c building blocks of lignin and, thus, is considered to be more specific and diagnostic than the dated nitrobenzene oxidation technique(10Lapierre C. Monties B. Rolando C. Holzforschung. 1986; 40: 47-50Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, results obtained from the thioacidolytic analysis of suberin-enriched tissues revealed that only minor amounts of “lignin” were present in such preparations (i.e. about one-sixth of that predicted by alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation)(7Borg-Olivier O. Monties B. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. III. 1989; 308: 141-147Google Scholar, 8Borg-Olivier O. Monties B. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 601-606Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Lapierre C. Monties B. Rolando C. Holzforschung. 1986; 40: 47-50Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Some attempts to define the aromatic components of suberin through the analysis of organic solvent-soluble metabolites and alkaline hydrolysates obtained from suberized tissues have revealed a rather complicated picture; i.e. they afforded mixtures of feruloyl esters(11Adamovics J.A. Johnson G. Stermitz F.R. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 1089-1090Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Bernards M.A. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 3409-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), tyrosine, tyramine, and substituted benzaldehydes/benzoates(8Borg-Olivier O. Monties B. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 601-606Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), caffeic acid (at least in green cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. fibers)(13Schmutz A. Jenny T. Amrhein N. Ryser U. Planta. 1993; 189: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), hydroxycinnamoyl amides (14Negrel J. Javelle F. Paynot M. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 142: 518-524Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and glycerates(13Schmutz A. Jenny T. Amrhein N. Ryser U. Planta. 1993; 189: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The soluble ferulate esters associated with suberized tissue have been suggested to function as suberin precursors (11Adamovics J.A. Johnson G. Stermitz F.R. Phytochemistry. 1977; 16: 1089-1090Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Bernards M.A. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 3409-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), although they could also act as low molecular weight plasticizers in the polymer. The enzyme-catalyzed biosynthesis of certain alkyl ferulates in wound-healing potato tubers has recently been detailed(15Lofty S. Negrel J. Javelle F. Phytochemistry. 1994; 35: 1419-1424Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The presence of phenolic amides in suberized tissue remains intriguing and raises questions about their role in the suberization process (e.g. are they suberin precursors or produced simply as wound-induced antimicrobial compounds?). Whatever case holds, they appear to be synthesized de novo in concert with the initiation of wound-induced suberization(14Negrel J. Javelle F. Paynot M. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 142: 518-524Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Methods developed to isolate soluble lignin-derived fragments (i.e. through solvation of extractive-free milled-wood preparations), suitable for characterization by solution state NMR spectroscopy, have also been adapted to suberized tissue (i.e. suberin, like lignin, is an intractable polymer, and there are no methods available to wholly isolate or solubilize it in pure, unaltered form). But when applied to “suberin” preparations from the periderm of Quercus suber, Rubus idaeus, and S. tuberosum, the solution state 1H and 13C NMR spectra failed to show any resonances characteristic of lignins (16Zimmermann W. Nimz H. Seemuller E. Holzforschung. 1985; 39: 45-49Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) thereby leaving the question of its constitution again in doubt. Indeed, even natural abundance solid state 13C NMR spectral analysis of S. tuberosum suberin preparations (17Garbow J.R. Ferrantello L.M. Stark R.E. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Stark R.E. Zlotnik-Mazori T. Ferrantello L.M. Garbow J.R. ACS Symp. Ser. 1989; 399: 214-229Crossref Google Scholar) failed to provide any clarification of its aromatic component; these analyses were further hampered by the fact that the preparations contained at least 50% carbohydrate (17Garbow J.R. Ferrantello L.M. Stark R.E. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Stark R.E. Zlotnik-Mazori T. Ferrantello L.M. Garbow J.R. ACS Symp. Ser. 1989; 399: 214-229Crossref Google Scholar, 19Stark R.E. Sohn W. Pacchiano R.A. Al-Bashir M. Garbow J.R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To overcome these difficulties, we have specifically labeled the suberin polymer with carbon-13 at sites designed to clarify the constitution of the polymer through solid state 13C NMR spectroscopic analysis in situ, as conducted previously for lignin structural determinations(20Lewis N.G. Newman J. Just G. Ripmeister J. Macromolecules. 1987; 20: 1752-1756Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Lewis N.G. Yamamoto E. Wooten J.B. Just G. Ohashi H. Towers G.H.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1344-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, following uptake and metabolism of [1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, or [3-13C]phenylalanine, the specifically labeled S. tuberosum wound periderm was examined in situ using solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy. These analyses have revealed that the phenolic domain of suberin is primarily composed of an hydroxycinnamic acid-derived phenolic polymer. Additionally, the chemical shift data for enhanced resonances strongly suggested that a significant amount of covalent cross-linking (other than ester bonds) exists between the phenolic monomers in suberin. All chemicals used were of reagent grade unless otherwise stated. Water was purified through a Barnstead NANOpure II system. L-[U-14C]Phenylalanine (15 GBq mmol−1) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. L-[1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, and [3-13C]phenylalanine (99 atom %13C) were purchased from MSD Isotopes (St. Louis, MO). Carbon-13 cross-polarization-magic angle spinning (CPMAS) 1The abbreviation used is: CPMAScross-polarization-magic angle spinning. NMR spectra were recorded at 100.6 MHz on a Chemagnetics CMX-400 spectrometer. Both 1H and 13C(1H) solution state NMR spectra were recorded in acetone-d6 on a Varian VXR-5005 spectrometer at 500 and 125.7 MHz, respectively. cross-polarization-magic angle spinning. Slices of potato tuber, prepared from surface-sterilized tubers(12Bernards M.A. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 3409-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were administered 200 μl of a fresh, filter-sterilized solution (up to 100 mM) of either L-[14C]-, natural abundance, [1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, or [3-13C]phenylalanine immediately after slicing (wounding) and allowed to metabolize in the dark at 25°C for up to 7 days as described previously(12Bernards M.A. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 3409-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments using L-[14C]phenylalanine were carried out to establish optimal uptake and incorporation conditions. Subsequently, two independent experiments (each comprising separate administrations of L-natural abundance, [1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, and [3-13C]phenylalanine, respectively, at 100 mM in 200-μl aliquots) were carried out, resulting in essentially identical incorporation and enhancement patterns. Representative data are shown. Wound periderm was mechanically removed from 7-day wound-healed tuber slices, frozen in liquid N2, and ground to a powder. Ground, frozen periderm tissue was extracted for 30 min on ice with buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8) containing 10 mM each of dithiothreitol, sodium ascorbate, and NaN3, followed by successive extraction with 95% ethanol (24 h) and CHCl3/ethanol (2:1, 24 h) in a Soxhlet apparatus. The resulting extractive free residue was stirred with 90% dimethyl sulfoxide (250 ml g−1 of tissue) for 48 h at room temperature (to remove starch), filtered under gentle suction (Miracloth), washed twice with water (collecting the residue on Miracloth after each wash), boiled in an oxalic acid (45 mM)/NH3 oxalate (130 mM) solution (250 ml g−1 of tissue) for 1 h (to partially degrade cellulose), collected and washed as above, and finally freeze-dried. The dimethyl sulfoxide/oxalate-treated residue was next incubated with cellulase (5 mg•ml−1) and pectolyase (1 mg•ml−1) for 16 h in sodium acetate buffer (50 mM, pH 4.0, 40 ml g−1 of freeze-dried residue) at room temperature, and the residue was collected on Miracloth as above and washed with buffer (1×) and water (2×). The resulting residue was further digested with Pronase E (0.5 mg•ml−1) for 16 h in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5, 40 ml g−1 of freeze-dried residue) at 37°C, with the residues again collected on Miracloth, washed with buffer (1×) and water (2×), and freeze-dried. Finally, enzyme-treated residues were saponified as described(8Borg-Olivier O. Monties B. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 601-606Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the residues were collected on Miracloth as above. Solid state 13C CPMAS NMR spectra were recorded using from 25 to 100 mg of freeze-dried residues obtained after oxalic acid treatment, Pronase E digestion, and saponification. Sample weights were carefully matched to ensure that reliable difference spectra could be obtained. Buffer and ethanol solubles were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described (12Bernards M.A. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 3409-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified by the dye binding method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208752) Google Scholar). Thioacidolysis was performed as described(10Lapierre C. Monties B. Rolando C. Holzforschung. 1986; 40: 47-50Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Compound 4 was synthesized according to a procedure adapted from (23Katayama T. Kawai S. Sogo M. Tech. Bull. Fac. Agric. Kagawa Univ. 1987; 39: 47-53Google Scholar). Solid state 13C CPMAS NMR experiments were performed at ambient temperature (22°C) using a 13C-1H cross-polarization field strength of 48 kHz and a 2-ms contact time. A proton-decoupling of 56 kHz was used during the 68.2-ms acquisition time. Usually, 8,000 to 12,000 scans were collected for each spectrum with 2.5 s recycle time. Samples (25-100 mg) were packed into 5-mm Chemagnetics Pencil® zirconia rotors and spun at 8 kHz. Chemical shifts were referenced to those of glycine (24Hayashi S. Hayawizu K. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1991; 64: 685-687Crossref Google Scholar) obtained from an independently recorded spectrum under identical spectrometer settings. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the natural abundance resonances recorded for a suberin sample prepared from tuber slices previously administered 100 mM natural abundance L-phenylalanine. Wound-healing potato (S. tuberosum) tubers have been demonstrated by others to be an excellent model system to study suberization in plants (e.g.(1Kolattukudy P.E. Can. J. Bot. 1984; 62: 2918-2933Crossref Google Scholar)). They suberize quickly and uniformly upon wounding and are amenable to the incorporation of exogenously supplied substrates. Since the deposition of suberin is highly localized and occurs only within the first few cell layers beneath the wound surface, suberin-enriched preparations are, in principle, easily obtained. Specifically labeled L-[13C]phenylalanines were administered as precursors in these experiments, since this amino acid represents the primary source of phenylpropanoids in potatoes (25Young M.R. Towers G.H.N. Can. J. Bot. 1966; 44: 341-349Crossref Google Scholar) and is known to be efficiently incorporated into the periderm of wound healing potato tubers (and hence suberin; (9Riley R.G. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Physiol. 1975; 56: 650-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Importantly, this precursor provides an effective means to distinguish between the potential metabolic products of L-phenylalanine, since protein-bound L-phenylalanine 2, hydroxycinnamic acids (and their derivatives) 3a-3c, the monolignols 1a-1c (and their derivatives) have characteristic and distinct 13C NMR spectroscopic signals (Fig. S1)(26Eberhardt T.L. Bernards M.A. He L. Davin L.B. Wooten J.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21088-21096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wuthrich K. NMR in Biological Research: Peptides and Proteins. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1976: 178Google Scholar). In other words, lignin formation from L-phenylalanine 2 requires its metabolism into various substituted hydroxycinnamic acids 3a-3c, followed by their successive reduction to the monolignols 1a-1c, and subsequent polymerization (reviewed in (28Lewis N.G. Yamamoto E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 41: 455-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar)). Thus, reduction of the carbonyl carbon of L-phenylalanine 2 into an hydroxymethyl functionality is essential to, and indeed an easily identifiable marker for, the formation of lignin (precursors). Thus, by judicious choice of precursor (e.g.L-[1-13C]phenylalanine), the presence or absence of lignin (i.e. polymerized monolignols) in suberized tissues should readily be determined in situ, without having to first degrade the tissue through harsh chemical means. Preliminary experiments using L-[14C]phenylalanine were conducted to optimize conditions of precursor uptake and incorporation. These studies established that the administration of 100 mML-[14C]phenylalanine (18.3 kBq, 200 μl) per slice, to wound-healing potato tubers, followed by 7 days metabolism, yielded an incorporation of >2% L-[14C]phenylalanine equivalents into the insoluble (suberized) residue. To ensure that this level of exogenously supplied phenylalanine did not adversely affect tuber metabolism and suberization, endogenous levels of soluble phenolics and proteins were measured in unlabeled (control) tissue, and the values compared to those obtained following administration of 100 mML-phenylalanine. It was found that neither the amount of soluble phenolics (including ferulate esters) (12Bernards M.A. Lewis N.G. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 3409-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) nor extractable protein (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208752) Google Scholar) was affected by the addition of exogenously supplied L-phenylalanine (data not shown). Similarly, thioacidolytic analysis (10Lapierre C. Monties B. Rolando C. Holzforschung. 1986; 40: 47-50Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) of both control and 100 mML-phenylalanine-labeled wound periderms liberated essentially identical amounts of guaiacyl and syringyl products (e.g. 13-16 μmol g−1 extractive free residue) and confirmed that only a minute amount of lignin (if any) was present in the tissue. Lastly, solid state 13C NMR spectra obtained from either the controls or tissue-administered 100 mML-phenylalanine were identical, again indicating that the administration of 100 mM phenylalanine did not adversely affect metabolism and ultimately suberization. Having established satisfactory conditions for the uptake and metabolism of L-phenylalanine, attention was next directed toward the metabolic fate of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine in wound-healing (i.e. suberizing) potato tuber disks. Following uptake and metabolism (i.e. 100 mML-[1-13C]phenylalanine; 7 days), the suberized wound periderm was excised and subjected to procedures largely aimed at the removal of soluble metabolites and cell wall carbohydrates (see “Materials and Methods”). Solid state 13C NMR spectra were recorded at each stage of purification, i.e. following solvent extraction, enzyme digestion, and saponification. Suberin preparations obtained from potato tubers administered 100 mM natural abundance L-phenylalanine were used to subtract natural abundance resonances from the 13C-enriched preparations. As can be seen in Fig. 1a, a single large, dominant, enhanced resonance (171.0 ppm) was apparent in the difference spectrum of extractive-free suberin preparations, indicative of carbonyl functionalities (e.g. acids, esters, amides). This result showed that at best only a limited amount of synthesis into hydroxycinnamoyl alcohols (δ∼ 63.1 ppm) and, thus lignin, had occurred. That the enhanced signal at 171.0 ppm was not due to L-phenylalanine metabolism into proteinaceous material was revealed by the absence of a characteristic protein-bound phenylalanine resonance at approximately 38 ppm(27Wuthrich K. NMR in Biological Research: Peptides and Proteins. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1976: 178Google Scholar), following metabolism of L-[3-13C]phenylalanine (see below). Thus, this spectroscopic data provided the first evidence that the phenolic domain of suberin was not built up from monolignols, as previously speculated, but contained hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. A small resonance at 63.1 ppm, corresponding to an hydroxymethyl functionality (e.g. of lignin) was observed, however, in the 1-13C-labeled sample following enzymatic digestion of the 1-13C-labeled periderm (Fig. 1b), indicative of traces of lignin in the sample (and thus providing an explanation for the thioacidolytic data described above). Interestingly, this signal persisted when the preparation was saponified (Fig. 1c), even though the 171.0 ppm resonance was substantially reduced (i.e. much of the phenolic polyester nature of suberin was degraded by this treatment, presumably through cleavage of labile ester linkages). Importantly, the persistence of the 171.0 ppm signal after saponification indicated that the phenolic component of suberin was more highly cross-linked than would be predicted for a simple polyester. This could be due to the presence of both stable C-C or C-O cross-links between the monomeric moieties of the phenolic domain, as well as perhaps via stable amide linkages. Next L-[2-13C]- and [3-13C]phenylalanine were individually administered to wound healing tubers, and the suberized periderm isolated as before. The labeling pattern observed in the corresponding difference spectra of the 2-13C- and 3-13Clabeled suberins (Fig. 2, a and b) both confirmed and extended the initial observation that the phenolic domain of suberin contained essentially only hydroxycinnamic acid-derived moieties. For example, the enhanced resonances at 120.5 (C-2) and 142.1 (C-3) ppm are characteristic of olefinic carbons of hydroxycinnamic acids or conjugates thereof. Enhanced resonances were also observed at 84.5 and 55.2 ppm (C-2-enriched suberin; Fig. 2a) and 86.2 and 75.4 ppm (C-3-enriched suberin; Fig. 2b) thereby revealing the presence of covalent linkages other than ester bonds in the polymer (discussed below). As with the 1-13C-labeled suberin, saponification did not significantly alter the pattern of signal enhancement (data not shown). However, only tiny resonances corresponding to the olefinic carbons of monolignols 1a-1c (e.g. at 127.9 and 130.7 ppm) (26Eberhardt T.L. Bernards M.A. He L. Davin L.B. Wooten J.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21088-21096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were observed, again indicating that minute amounts of lignin, at best, were present in the preparations. Lastly, the absence of an enhanced resonance at approximately 38 ppm in the 3-13C-labeled suberin clearly indicated that the suberin preparations were essentially devoid of phenylalanine-containing proteins(27Wuthrich K. NMR in Biological Research: Peptides and Proteins. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1976: 178Google Scholar). The data presented thus far indicates that the phenolic domain of suberin was comprised of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Since there is a growing body of evidence(29Espelie K.E. Francheschi V.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Physiol. 1986; 81: 487-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Roberts E. Kutchan T. Kolattukudy P.E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) indicating that the formation of suberin may be an H202/peroxidase-mediated polymerization, the coupling products (substructures) within the polymer are likely to be fairly predictable (e.g.4-7, Fig. S1). Consequently, dimers of likely oxidative coupling products of ferulic acid (including some of its esters) were synthesized as needed, and their NMR spectroscopic data were recorded and interpreted using, where possible, appropriate literature assignments(31Ralph J. Helm R.F. Quideau S.J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1992; 1: 2971-2980Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data were compared to that of the specifically labeled 1-13C-, 2-13C-, and 3-13C-suberins. For synthetic coupling products 4 and 5 (Fig. S1), the observed side chain carbon resonances were essentially identical with those of the wound-induced potato suberins: i.e. enhanced resonances at 84.5 (C-2) and 75.4 (C-3) ppm (Fig. 2) were consistent with an 8-O-4′-linked compound (e.g.4 in Fig. S1), while those at 55.2 (C-2) and 86.2 (C-3) supported a phenylcoumarin 5 (i.e. 8-5′) type of interunit linkage (Fig. S1). Similarly, the resonances at 171.0 (C-1), 120.5 (C-2), and 142.1 (C-3) ppm (Figure 1, Figure 2) all indicated that suberin contains hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives with intact side chains as in 3a-3c (Fig. S1). These units are presumably linked to the remainder of the matrix either through ester or amide linkages, their aromatic ring carbons, or phenolic hydroxyl moieties. It can therefore be concluded that the aromatic domain of suberin is largely derived from the polymerization of hydroxycinnamic acids and/or their derivatives. More detailed information about likely linkages between aromatic ring carbons (e.g. 5-5′ linkages such as in diferulic acid 6) as well as others (e.g. amides) will be the subject of a future report. Specific labeling of potato wound periderm with L-[1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, and [3-13C]phenylalanine, combined with in situ solid state carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy, has provided the most direct means to date to characterize the phenolic domain of suberin. The resulting data, presented in this paper, establishes that the phenolic domain of suberin is largely comprised of a covalently linked, hydroxycinnamate-derived polymer matrix, with only minute amounts of lignin co-occurring. This finding means that we must now re-evaluate not only the chemical constitution of suberin, but also the sequential stages involved in its assembly.

https://openalex.org/W1514300288,"CD22 is a cell-surface receptor of resting mature B cells that recognizes sialic acid (Sia) in the natural structure Sia alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc (Powell, L. D., Jain, R. K., Matta, K. L., Sabesan, S., and Varki, A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 7523-7532). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HEC) treated with inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) display increases in cell-surface CD22 ligands, caused by increased expression of the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase (Hanasaki, K., Varki, A., Stamenkovic, I., and Bevilacqua, M. P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10637-10643; Hanasaki, K., Varki, A., and Powell, L. D. (1995) J. Biol Chem. 270, 7533-7542). Thus, CD22 could direct potential interactions between mature B cells and endothelial cells during inflammatory states. However, this would have to occur in the presence of blood plasma, which contains many sialoglycoproteins known to carry alpha 2-6-linked sialic acids. We show here that human plasma can indeed inhibit Sia-dependent binding of a recombinant soluble chimeric form of human CD22 (CD22Rg) to TNF-alpha activated HEC. Affinity adsorption of individual human plasma samples with immobilized CD22Rg showed that, of the numerous alpha 2-6-sialic acid containing glycoproteins in plasma, only three polypeptides with apparent molecular mass (under reducing conditions) of 74, 44, and 25 kDa bound, and were specifically eluted with alpha 2-6-sialyllactose. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of these high affinity CD22 ligands revealed that they are subunits of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and haptoglobin. Purified human IgM from pooled human plasma can be quantitatively bound by CD22Rg, and binding is blocked by alpha 2-6-sialyllactose, but not by alpha 2-3-sialyllactose. Pretreatment by sialidase or by mild periodate oxidation of sialic acid side chains abolishes these interactions. IgM at physiological concentrations also inhibits CD22Rg binding to TNF-alpha-activated HEC in a manner dependent not only upon its sialylation but also requiring its intact multimeric structure. These data show that CD22 is capable of highly selective recognition of certain multimeric plasma sialoglycoproteins that carry alpha 2-6-linked sialic acids. Notably, the two proteins that are selectively recognized are known to be involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Haptoglobin synthesis by the liver is markedly increased during the ""acute phase response"" to systemic inflammation, while IgM is the major product resulting from activation of resting CD22-positive B cells."

Involvement of these elements in SAA gene induction, following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of the liver, has been studied by investigating LPS-activated transcription factors and their interaction with the promoter elements of the SAA gene. Appearance of complexes in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay has indicated that DNA-binding proteins that interact with the NF-κB element of the SAA promoter are induced in the LPS-treated rabbit liver. Presence of RelA (p65 subunit of NF-κB) in these complexes was demonstrated by the ability of RelA-specific antisera to supershift the DNA-protein complexes. LPS also induced several members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, which interacted with the C/EBP motifs of the SAA promoter. Activated C/EBP and RelA form a RelA•C/EBP heteromeric complex that associates with varying affinity to NF-κB and C/EBP elements of the SAA gene. Transfection assays using both transcription factor genes have demonstrated that the heteromeric complex of NF-κB and C/EBP is a much more potent transactivator of SAA expression than each transcription factor alone.

The NMDAR2 gene family is comprised of four members designated 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D, which only exhibit channel activity when co-expressed with the NMDAR1 gene(5Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R.

In situ hybridization studies revealed that the NMDAR1 gene is expressed widely in the central nervous system with more prevalent expression in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and olfactory bulb(6Moriyoshi K.

Meguro H. Masaki H. Kumanishi T. Arakawa M. Mishina M. Nature. 1992; 358: 36-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NMDAR2 genes have a more restricted and differential distribution(5Monyer H. Sprengel R. Schoepfer R. Herb A. Higuchi M. Lomeli H. Burnashev N. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H.

These expression patterns have been substantiated by immunohistochemical methods with specific antibodies to the various subunits(12Brose N. Gasic G.P. Vetter D.E. Sullivan J.M. Heinemann S.F. J.

The expression of the NMDAR1 gene is neuron-specific and highly regulated under both physiological and pathological conditions(2Collingridge G.L. Singer W. Trends Pharmacol.

Sci. 1990; 11: 379-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). In the developing mammalian central nervous system, there is a progressive increase in NMDAR1 expression until the cessation of cortical neuronal migration(14Franklin S.O. Elliott K. Zhu Y.S.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 529-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2772) Google Scholar). Evidence based upon receptor ligand binding studies suggests that NMDA receptors may be diminished during aging and in various neurological diseases(3Meldrum B. Garthwaite J. Trends Pharmacol.

Furthermore, NMDA receptors are down-regulated in hippocampus and cerebral cortex by long-term administration of competitive antagonists(19Lesch K.P. Aulakh C.S. Wolozin B.L. Hill J.L. Murphy D.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 109-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), in dentate gyrus granule cells by full kindling-induced epileptogenesis(20Pratt G.D. Kokaia M. Bengzon J. Kokaia Z.

Sommer C. Becker C.M. Kiessling M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Estrogen replacement in ovariectomized rats significantly up-regulates NMDAR1 mRNA in cerebral cortex(22Brann D.W. Zamorano P.L. Chorich L.P. Mahesh V.B. Neuroendocrinology. 1993; 58: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that NMDAR1 mRNA levels change in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the rat(23Ishida N. Matsui M. Mitsui Y. Mishina M. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 166: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that NMDA receptor expression may be highly regulated at the level of gene transcription in both a temporal and cell-specific manner. As a first step to explore this regulation, we previously isolated and characterized a 3-kb genomic fragment encompassing the 5′-flanking sequence of the NMDAR1 gene and mapped the transcriptional start sites (24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that the NMDAR1 gene promoter has the characteristics of a housekeeping gene in that there are multiple start sites and it contains a proximal GC-rich region with no TATA or CAAT box motifs. In the present study we studied the ability of rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) to correctly transcribe NMDAR1 mRNA and evaluated the ability of the 3-kb promoter fragment to direct the expression of a reporter gene construct in transient transfection assays. We also investigated DNA-protein interactions by gel mobility shift assays and DNA footprinting assays with promoter fragments thought to be important in the expression of the NMDAR1 gene. Our results suggest that the NMDAR1 gene proximal promoter region is sufficient for gene expression and that this promoter may be regulated by immediate early genes. The following kits were utilized: mini and maxi DNA purification from Qiagen, Sequenase II from U. S. Biochemicals, Riboprobe and Gel Shift Assay from Promega, and DNA footprinting from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Luciferase and β-galactosidase were purchased from Promega Corp. and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively; Lipofectin reagent was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All radiolabeled nucleotides were from Amersham Corp., and Sp1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Total RNA from rat brain and cultured cells was extracted using guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi(25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62713) Google Scholar). Plasmid pG918K/S was constructed by subcloning into pGEM-3Zf(+) a KpnI-SacI product (918 bp) from the 3.8-kb EcoRI fragment reported previously(24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Riboprobes 1 and 2 were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from plasmid pG918 K/S linearized by PstI and XbaI, respectively, using a Promega Riboprobe kit in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. Sizes of the probes were indicated previously(24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Transcribed probes were purified on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Riboprobe 2 was hybridized to 10 μg of RNA at 45°C overnight and digested with 7 units of RNase ONE (Promega) for 30 min at 30°C(24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The digestion was stopped by adding 0.1% SDS and extracted once with phenol/chloroform. After precipitation, the protected RNA probe was fractionated on an 8% sequencing gel. A DNA sequence ladder was generated from the single strand of M13 phagemid by a M13 sequencing primer with U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase II kit in the presence of [α-35S]dATP. Riboprobe 1 with a size of 253 nucleotides was used for correcting the difference in the migration of RNA and DNA ladders. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. The 5′-flanking sequence of NMDAR1 gene reported by us previously (24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has 3029 bp whose last 3′ base pair is numbered −1 relative to the first nucleotide in codon 1. This fragment ends with a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′ SacI site and was subcloned into pGEM-3Zf(+) to form pG3029. To create 5′ non-overlapping deletions presented schematically in Fig. 1, the following strategies were applied to retrieve fragments from pG3029 and ligate them into a polylinker in front of a firefly luciferase gene harbored in pGL-2Basic (Promega). Individual constructs are named pNRL followed by a number indicating the 5′ end of the genomic fragment inserted into the vector. The 3′ end of each insert is at nucleotide −1(24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Partial digestion with SacI and ligation to pGL2-Basic vector linearized by SacI were used to form pNRL2837, −1880, and −1113; AccI digestion of pG3029, blunt ending of the AccI ends with Klenow enzyme, partial SacI digestion, isolation of 2.3-kb fragment, and ligation to SmaI/SacI-digested vector were performed, in order, for pNRL2326. In another aliquot of the above ligation mixture, a 340-bp AccI fragment (−2666/−2327) purified from the same blunted mixture was added for formation of pNRL2666. Removal of KpnI-KpnI and KpnI-PstI fragment from pNRL1113 was used for pNRL919 and −239 constructs, respectively. Insertion of an EcoRI-KpnI fragment into KpnI-digested pNRL919 followed by blunting KpnI/EcoRI and religation was employed for pNRL3029. The ligation-blunt-ligation strategy was also applied to an XbaI-SacI fragment for pNRL731; partial BsmI plus SacI for pNRL579 and −356; partial SmaI plus SacI for pNRL473 and −100. A PstI-SacI fragment (−243/−2) from pNRL356 was removed to form pNRL356Δ242. The boundaries of the inserted DNAs in all constructs were sequenced by extending primers GL1 and GL2 (Promega) which are complementary to the sequences flanking the multiple cloning sites in pGL2-Basic. All plasmid DNAs were isolated using Qiagen columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were cultured as described previously(27Bai G. Weiss B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). C6 glioma cells were obtained from Paragon Biotech and maintained in Ham's F14 nutrient medium containing 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum. Human cervical carcinoma, HeLa cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. One day before transfection, cells (5 × 105 for PC12, 5 × 105 for C6, or 3 × 105 for HeLa) were plated on 60-mm plates. PC12 cells were grown on collagen-coated plates. A lacZ gene driven by the enhancer/promoter of the major immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus, pCMVβ (Clontech), was co-transfected with luciferase constructs to correct for transfection efficiency. We introduced 0.45 pmol of luciferase constructs and 0.4 pmol of pCMVβ with a cationic liposome reagent, Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 10 μg/ml for PC12 and HeLa cells, as described by Muller et al.(28Muller S.R. Sullivan P.D. Clegg D.O. Feinstein S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). C6 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with the same amount of DNA as above(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cells were returned to serum-containing media 6 h after transfection, and C6 cells underwent glycerol shock before addition of serum-containing medium. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested with 0.04% EDTA containing PBS and washed twice. Pelleted cells were resuspended in buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris phosphate, pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, bovine serum albumin at 1 mg/ml, and 10% glycerol and sonicated at 4.0 watts for 3 × 5 s to lyse the cells. Sonication was found to be the best technique to lyse cells and preserve the activity of reporter enzymes(29Bai G. Stuebing E.W. Parker H.R. Harlow P. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the luciferase gene assay, 10 μl of lysate was mixed with ATP-containing buffer B and injected with luciferin-containing buffer A in a Monolight 2101 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, San Diego). Firefly luciferase (Boehringer Mannheim) was serially diluted and used to establish a standard curve to convert luminescence units into the amount of luciferase activity. To measure β-galactosidase, 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside was used as substrate. One to five μl of lysate together with dH2O to 60 μl was incubated with 60 μl of 2 × substrate buffer containing 120 mM Na2HPO4, 80 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 1.33 mg/ml 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 2 M Na2CO3, and the optical density at 420 nm was recorded. The activity of enzyme was calibrated by a standard curve established with purified β-galactosidase (Promega). To prepare probe for gel shift experiments, a 112-bp BsmI/PstI blunt-ended fragment (position −356 to −245) was inserted into the HincII site of pGEM-3Zf(+) to form pG112. Radiolabeled probes were prepared by filling in the ends of restriction enzyme-digested pG112 (XbaI/PstI for antisense strand and HindIII/SmaI for sense strand) with an appropriate [α-32P]dNTP and Klenow enzyme. Labeled DNA was then purified through a native polyacrylamide gel. Cell nuclear extracts were made by a modified Dignam method(30Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 12.1.1.-12.1.19Google Scholar), and washed nuclei were extracted with buffer containing 0.45 M KCl. Contaminating nuclease activity in extracts was examined by incubating 1 μg of HindIII-digested λ-DNA with 9.5 μg of protein overnight at 37°C and comparing its integrity with untreated DNA. A Promega kit was used for gel mobility shift experiments with the following modifications. In a 10-μl final volume, nonspecific binding was blocked with 3 μg of poly(dI:dC) at room temperature for 10 min and, in competition experiments, oligonucleotides containing specific consensus sequences supplied by the kits were also added for 10 min of blocking. Labeled probe was incubated at room temperature with extracts for another 20 min and, for supershift experiments, antibody was added 10 min after addition of the probe. The mixtures were electrophoresed on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer at 4°C for 2 h. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film. For some experiments, the PC12 nuclear extract was heated at 100°C for 10 min and cooled on ice prior to incubation. In other experiments, the extract was pretreated by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal Sp1 antibody as follows: in 11 μl volume, 95 μg of PC12 nuclear extract was incubated with 1 μg of Sp1 antibody at 4°C for 4 h and then 2 μl of activated protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was added for an additional 2 h. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, the supernatants were removed and used. A Pharmacia kit was utilized for DNA footprinting. After titrating the DNase I concentration to create the best ladder, enough extract was applied under the conditions in gel mobility shift assay to saturate the probe. For the control ladder, the same amount of bovine serum albumin was added. At the end of the incubation, the probe was nicked by DNase I digestion for 1 min at room temperature. The digestion was stopped by adding 120 μl of stop buffer and extracted once with phenol/chloroform. Precipitated DNA was denatured at 95°C for 5 min in loading buffer from the Sequenase II kit and fractionated on a 10% sequencing gel. DNA ladders of chemically cleaved G and G + A were also prepared and run on the gel(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In some experiments, the density of specific bands in autoradiographs was analyzed with an LKB Ultroscan XL Enhanced Laser Densitometer. We previously reported on the isolation and characterization of a 3-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the rat NMDAR1 gene. In rat brain, this gene was transcribed from two major and several minor start sites (24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We examined the transcriptional start sites of the NMDAR1 gene in PC12 cells and compared them with those of rat brain, a glioma cell line (C6), and HeLa cells (Fig. 2). Riboprobe 2 (24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) generated from the genomic sequence and encompassing all transcription start sites was used in this experiment. PC12 cells (lane 3) utilized the same sites as the brain (lane 2) to transcribe the NMDAR1 gene, but C6 and HeLa cells did not contain any detectable NMDAR1 message (lanes 4 and 5). It is interesting to note that PC12 cells use primarily the distal major transcription start site. In contrast, the proximal start site is predominately used in rat brain, which was observed previously(24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A series of luciferase constructs were prepared, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, with progressive 5′, non-overlapping deletions of the 3-kb 5′-flanking sequence and were transiently transfected into PC12, C6, and HeLa cells. The construct pNRL356 gave a high level of activity in PC12 cells (Fig. 3A). pNRL239, which lacks the 5′ 117 bp (−356/−240) in pNRL356, gave activity which was 1/35 of pNRL356, suggesting that the 356-bp fragment contains major cis-acting elements required for NMDAR1 promoter activity. This region encompasses all 5′ transcription start sites and the GC-rich sequence including putative GSG and Sp1 motifs(24Bai G. Kusiak J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1152: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The SV40 early promoter (pSVL) containing a cluster of six Sp1 motifs (31Dynan W.S. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 35: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) exhibited an activity similar to that of pNRL356 in PC12 cells (Fig. 3A). Relative to pNRL356, constructs containing additional sequences 5′ of pNRL356 changed the activity less than 2-fold. These data strongly suggest that pNRL356 contains the core promoter of NMDAR1 gene. pNRL356Δ242, a construct in which nucleotides −243/−2 were deleted from pNRL356, i.e. linking directly the 5′ 113-bp DNA (−356/−244) to the reporter gene had 20.64% of the activity of pNRL356 (Fig. 3D). To determine whether the NMDAR1 core promoter only contains nonspecific basal transcription activity, additional transfection studies were carried out in non-neuronal C6 glioma and HeLa cells. Results in Fig. 3, B and C, showed that this NMDAR1 promoter construct in these two cell lines had low activity compared to the SV40 construct. The changes in activity among the other NMDAR1 constructs are small and vary less than 2-fold in HeLa and 7-fold in C6 cells. In HeLa cells, since the cytomegalovirus promoter has high β-galactosidase activity and luciferase activity overall was low, the relative luciferase activity is lower than that in either PC12 or C6 cells. In view of these results, this proximal sequence may have a role in basal, cell type-specific NMDAR1 gene expression. We labeled a 112-bp fragment (position −356 to −245) located at the 5′ end of pNRL356 and investigated its ability to interact with nuclear factors. Six complexes, migrating as three doublet bands, were formed using PC12 cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 4A). The bands in each doublet showed even density. Increasing poly(dI:dC) up to 10 μg per sample did not significantly change the density of each complex (data not shown). Preincubation of the crude nuclear extract with unlabeled DNA completely abolished complex C2 and C3 doublet formation, but failed to remove the smallest doublet, C1A + B (data not shown). Hence, we believe that the C1A + B complexes represent nonspecific binding. In comparison with PC12, C6 cell nuclear extracts exhibited weak complex formation with multiple bands. HeLa cell nuclear extracts formed complexes with this fragment similar to PC12 cell extracts except that C3A (see Fig. 4C) is almost 4 times stronger than the others. As the first step to identify the nuclear factors, competition experiments with a series of double-stranded oligonucleotides, which contain specific motifs including many GC-rich consensus sequences, were performed. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, C2 and C3 doublets were completely competed by preincubation with a 100-fold excess of Sp1 oligonucleotide. Other oligonucleotides did not compete with the binding. We then tested the effect of an Sp1 specific antibody on the reaction mixture (Fig. 4C). In PC12 extracts, only one band, C3A, was further retarded by the polyclonal Sp1 antibody which is capable of specifically binding Sp1 proteins in human, rat, and mouse tissues. This antibody showed high titer since 25 ng of antibody was able to shift almost all C3A complex from 4.5 μg of extracts to a new, slower migrating band. Increasing the amount of antibody to 50 ng did not significantly change the other three bands. This suggests that the C3A complex may contain Sp1-like proteins. Then we attempted to verify this by adding purified Sp1 protein to the labeled 112-bp DNA. However, even though we put 2 footprinting units in a single reaction, we did not see any binding (Fig. 4D, left lane). Sp1 protein belongs to a family of zinc finger proteins and requires zinc ions as cofactor. Although the storage buffer of Sp1 protein contains 5 μM ZnSO4, we did not supplement any buffers with zinc during nuclear extraction. Metal ions, such as ZnCl2, ZnSO4, CaCl2, or MgCl2 up to 1 mM, were added in the assay, but no binding was seen (data not shown). These same results were observed with three different lots of Sp1 proteins. Only when we added nuclear extract, even as small an amount as 2.5 μg, did a band appear from 0.0625 unit of Sp1 protein migrating at the same position as C3A. This suggests that an Sp1-like protein probably contributes to the C3A binding complex. Since Sp1 bound the 112-bp DNA fragment only in the presence of nuclear extract and did not bind in the presence of added zinc, we tested the heat sensitivity of the extract for Sp1 potentiation. Boiling the PC12 extracts dramatically decreased the formation of all complexes on the probe, since, compared to half as much native ex"
https://openalex.org/W2010052831,"Human peripheral blood monocytes responded to stimulation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) with up-regulation of the transcript for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. This function of PAF was observed at nanomolar concentrations of the ligand, starting at 30 min after stimulation. The PAF-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA was accompanied by an increase in κB binding activity. These functions of PAF appeared to be mediated through the cell surface PAF receptors, as two PAF receptor antagonists, WEB 2086 and L-659,989, blocked both the up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and κB binding activity induced by PAF. The antagonists, however, had no effect on phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA and κB binding activity. Pretreatment of monocytes with pertussis toxin inhibited these functions of PAF, whereas cholera toxin had no inhibitory effect. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor for NF-κB activation, markedly reduced PAF-stimulated κB binding activity as well as up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA. These results suggest a potential role of PAF in HB-EGF expression and provide evidence that this stimulation may occur through increased κB binding activity. Human peripheral blood monocytes responded to stimulation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) with up-regulation of the transcript for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a potent mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. This function of PAF was observed at nanomolar concentrations of the ligand, starting at 30 min after stimulation. The PAF-induced up-regulation of HB-EGF mRNA was accompanied by an increase in κB binding activity.

Here, we examine the formation of TGF-β receptor homooligomers and their possible contribution to signaling. TβR-I can contact ligand bound to TβR-II, but not ligand free in the medium, and thus cannot form ligandinduced homo-oligomers. TβR-II, which binds ligand on its own, formed oligomeric complexes when overexpressed in transfected COS cells. However, these complexes were largely ligand-independent and involved immature receptor protein. Since ligand-induced homo-oligomers could not be obtained with the wild-type TGF-β receptors, we studied receptor cytoplasmic domain homo-oligomerization by using receptor chimeras. The extracellular domain of TβR-II was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TβR-I, yielding TβR-II/I, and the extracellular domain of TβR-I was fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TβR-II, yielding TβR-I/II. When cotransfected with wild-type receptors and exposed to ligand, TβR-II/I formed a complex with TβR-I, and TβR-I/II formed a complex with TβR-II, thus yielding complexes with homologous cytoplasmic domains. TβR-II/I transfected alone or with TβR-I did not restore TGF-β responsiveness in TβR-II-defective cell mutants. Furthermore, TβR-II/I acted in a dominant negative fashion, inhibiting restoration of TGF-β responsiveness by a cotransfected TβR-II in TβR-II-defective cells and by a cotransfected TβR-I in TβR-I-defective cells. Similarly, TβR-I/II transfected alone or with TβR-II did not restore TGF-β responsiveness and acted in a dominant negative fashion against TβR-I. Together with previous genetic and biochemical evidence, these results suggest that TGF-β mediates transcriptional and antiproliferative responses through the heteromeric TβR-I•TβR-II complex and not through homo-oligomeric TβR-I or TβR-II complexes.

Both receptors are transmembrane serine/threonine kinases and consist of a short extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, a kinase domain, and, in the type II receptors, a serine/threonine-rich tail. Despite their similar domain structure, TGF-β receptors I and II show only ∼40% amino acid sequence identity in the kinase domain and even lower similarity outside this domain. The same holds true for receptors that bind other TGF-β-related factors such as activin and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). The type I receptors for these various factors are more similar to each other than they are to their corresponding type II receptors, generating two distinct subfamilies of transmembrane serine/threonine kinases(1Massagué J.

Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between TβR-I and TβR-II suggests two alternative models for TGF-β signal transduction. In one model, TβR-I and TβR-II might signal separately, initiating distinct pathways whose cooperation produces TGF-β responses(15Ebner R. Chen R.-H. Shum L. Lawler S. Zioncheck T.F. Lee A. López A.R. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 260: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). After contacting the ligand, TβR-I and TβR-II could each signal as monomers or, by analogy with the tyrosine kinase receptors(24Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar), as ligand-induced homodimers. Alternatively, the signaling entity could be the heteromeric TβR-I•TβR-II complex. Formation of this complex might be necessary to allow each receptor access to its substrates or to allow one receptor kinase to stimulate the other, which then propagates the signal to downstream substrates. Support for the latter model comes from the recent demonstration that TβR-II is a constitutively active kinase that, upon ligand binding, recruits and phosphorylates TβR-I as a necessary step for signal propagation via the TβR-I kinase(25Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). However, the evidence to date does not exclude the possibility that ligand-induced homologous receptor interactions might participate in TGF-β signaling. To investigate this possibility, we have sought evidence for ligand-induced homo-oligomeric TβR-I or TβR-II complexes. In addition, we forced homo-oligomerization of receptor cytoplasmic domains by using chimeras that contain the extracellular domain of one receptor and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the other. The results of studies using these constructs argue that homologous receptor kinase interactions do not mediate TGF-β signals. Chimeric forms of human TβR-II and TβR-I were generated by polymerase chain reaction using as templates the human TβR-I cDNA (6Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). cDNA fragments encoding the extracellular domain of TβR-II (amino acid residues 1-158), the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TβR-II/His (amino acids 159-567), the extracellular domain of TβR-I (amino acid residues 1-124), and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TβR-I (amino acids 125-485) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 15 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C for 25 cycles. Gel-purified reaction products were then combined pairwise (TβR-I ectodomains with TβR-II transmembrane-cytoplasmic domains and vice versa) and reamplified with the corresponding primers to create cDNAs encoding the chimeras TβR-I/II and TβR-II/I. Products of these reactions were cloned into pBluescript using convenient internal restriction sites, verified by DNA sequencing, and subcloned into pCMV5 for transient transfection. R-1B and DR-26 cells were derived in earlier studies by chemical mutagenesis of the mink lung epithelial cell line Mv1Lu (CCL-64; American Type Culture Collection) and selection for resistance to TGF-β(9Boyd F.T.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) using 250 pM125I-TGF-β1 unless otherwise indicated. Labeled cell monolayers were solubilized with buffer containing Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors(28Massagué J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 146: 174-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and soluble extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 1 mM dithiothreitol. For metabolic labeling, transiently transfected cells were incubated in methionine-free minimal essential medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, ICN) for 2.5 h at 37°C followed by 1 h at 4°C in the presence or absence of TGF-β (1 nM). Cell monolayers were then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture). Labeled cells were solubilized in 0.05 ml/cm2 lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) in the presence of protease inhibitors at 4°C for 30 min. Insoluble debris was removed by microcentrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min. HA-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4°C with 5 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (BABCO), followed by adsorption to protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Histidine-tagged receptors were collected by binding to Ni-NTA-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.) for 1 h at 4°C. Two-step precipitation was done by eluting material bound to Ni-NTA-agarose beads with 0.25 M imidazole at room temperature for 10 min, followed by immunoprecipitating the eluate with anti-HA antibody. Agarose-bound receptors were eluted by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Exponentially growing cells plated and grown for 48 h to ∼75% confluence were transfected with receptor constructs of interest and/or vector alone (up to 3 μg of total plasmid DNA) plus 3 μg of the reporter plasmid p3TP-Lux(8Cárcamo J.

Cells were harvested 20 h later and assayed for luciferase activity using a commercial system as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Total light emission during the initial 20 s of the reaction was measured with a luminometer (Berthold Lumat LB 9501). Cells were plated 24 h after transfection into 24-well plates containing medium with 10% FBS. After 3 h, the medium was replaced with medium containing 0.2% FBS. After 4 h, TGF-β1 was added for 17 h. Cells were labeled with 0.5 μCi/ml [125I]iododeoxyuridine (DuPont NEN) for the last 4 h of incubation. Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 95% methanol for 1 h at 4°C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted with 1 N NaOH for 30 min at 4°C. The extracts were collected and counted in a γ-counter. To determine whether TβR-II can form homo-oligomers, COS cells were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding human TβR-II forms tagged with two different retrieval sequences. TβR-II was tagged at the C terminus with either the influenza virus HA epitope (TβR-II/HA) or a hexahistidine sequence (TβR-II/His) that can bind to Ni2+ chelated onto agarose (Ni-NTA-agarose)(4Wrana J.L.

Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Massagué J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3810-3821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like wild-type TβR-II, these tagged TβR-II forms bind ligand on the cell surface as determined by cross-linking to 125I-TGF-β1 (the isoform used throughout this study)(4Wrana J.L. Attisano L.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), are able to form heteromeric complexes with TβR-I as determined by coprecipitation from cell lysates(4Wrana J.L.

Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), and have normal signaling capacity as determined by their ability to restore TGF-β responsiveness in TβR-II-deficient cell lines(4Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). To determine the relative levels of functional TβR-II/HA and TβR-II/His expressed on the surface of cotransfected COS cells, receptors were affinity-labeled by cross-linking to bound 125I-TGF-β1 and precipitated from cell lysates with anti-HA antibody or Ni-NTA-agarose beads, respectively (Fig. 1A). The yield of labeled TβR-II/HA was ∼3-fold less than the yield of labeled TβR-II/His; however, this difference is attributable to different recoveries in the two isolation procedures. Previous work indicated that precipitation with anti-HA antibody recovers only ∼30% of the total affinity-labeled TβR-II/HA, whereas precipitation with Ni-NTA-agarose recovers TβR-II/His almost quantitatively(16Attisano L. Cárcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 25Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). Taking this difference into account, the results indicated that functional TβR-II/HA and TβR-II/His are expressed at equivalent levels on the surface of COS cells. More important, when these cell lysates were bound to Ni-NTA-agarose and eluted with imidazole, and the eluates were precipitated with anti-HA antibody, little or no ligand-labeled TβR-II was recovered (Fig. 1A). This two-step precipitation method can readily recover ligand-induced complexes of TβR-II/His and TβR-I/HA from COS cells (see Fig. 3)(25Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). The present results suggested that TβR-II did not form stable ligand-induced homo-oligomers in COS cells. Since COS cells have been used in many TGF-β receptor studies, we examined the interaction of transfected TβR-II in more detail by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled receptor. Pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine revealed that TβR-II was synthesized as a 70-kDa product that was converted with time into a heterogeneous product of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 1B). Based on previous studies(30Cheifetz S. Andres J.L. Massagué J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16984-16991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these products are identified as the newly synthesized TβR-II core before N-linked glycan chain maturation and the mature TβR-II glycoprotein, respectively. Metabolically labeled receptor began to disappear 2 h after the start of the chase (Fig. 1B), at which time only about half of the receptor population had reached maturity. Surface labeling of TβR-II-transfected COS cells indicated that immature TβR-II did not reach the cell surface (data not shown; see (25Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar)). Continued labeling with [35S]methionine confirmed that only about half of the steady-state receptor population was the mature form (Fig. 1C). COS cells support episomal replication of vectors that contain an SV40 origin of replication(29Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar), resulting in vast overexpression of products encoded by these vectors. In contrast to COS cells, Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells and L6E9 rat skeletal myoblasts, which expressed stably transfected TβR-II at modest levels, completely processed this receptor within 60 min after synthesis (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these results argue that transiently transfected COS cells express more TβR-II protein than they can fully process. To search for homo-oligomeric TβR-II interactions, COS cells transfected with TβR-II/HA, TβR-II/His, or the two receptors were metabolically labeled and subjected to the two-step precipitation protocol described above to recover complexes containing both tagged receptor forms. As expected, lysates from singly transfected cells yielded no labeled products with this protocol (Fig. 1C). Two-step precipitation of lysates from doubly transfected cells yielded a large amount of immature TβR-II core and very little mature receptor form (Fig. 1C). The amount of immature TβR-II form recovered in this process was approximately half of the total amount, as determined from the autoradiographic signals (Fig. 1C, compare the second and fifth lanes). The receptor yield was only marginally increased by incubation of cells with a high concentration (1 nM) of TGF-β1 (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that in COS cells overexpressing TβR-II, a large proportion of excess immature TβR-II and a small proportion of mature TβR-II form ligand-independent complexes and that the addition of ligand has little effect on the yield of these complexes. Similar experiments performed with Mv1Lu cells did not yield ligand-independent or -dependent TβR-II complexes (data not shown). Since neither wild-type TβR-I nor TβR-II appeared to form ligand-induced homo-oligomers, to investigate the activity of homologous TGF-β receptor kinase interactions we forced their formation using chimeric receptor constructs. The chimera TβR-I/II was created by fusing the entire extracellular domain of human TβR-I (up to Val124(6Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Yamashita H. Schulz P. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K.

Weinberg R. Lodish H. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2). The reciprocal chimera, TβR-II/I, was generated by fusing the extracellular domain of TβR-II with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of TβR-I (Fig"

Although the mechanism of action as well as the structure-function relationship of the coenzyme has been extensively studied with diol dehydrase(7Abeles R.H. Zagalak B. Friedrich W. Vitamin B. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1979: 373-388Google Scholar, 8Toraya T. Fukui S. Dolphin D. B, Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 233-262Google Scholar), only a little information is available about the structure and function of the apoenzyme in the catalysis.In the previous papers(10Toraya T.

McGee and Richards (13McGee D.E. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4293-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) claimed that the enzyme isolated from detergent-extract of membrane (Mr, 250,000) is composed of Mr 60,000, 51,000, 29,000, and 15,000 polypeptides(13McGee D.E.

In contrast, a paper appeared that reported that component F is an essential constituent of the enzyme from detergent-extract of membrane as well(15Tanizawa K. Nakajima N. Toraya T. Tanaka H. Soda K. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We attempted to solve this apparent discrepancy by cloning the genes encoding this enzyme.In this paper, we report cloning and sequence analysis of the pdd genes encoding diol dehydrase. Overexpression systems for the diol dehydrase genes in Escherichia coli are also described here, which promise us to get the enzyme in a large quantity for structural analysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 5,000 Ci/mmol) and [α-35S]dATPαS (specific activity, 1,500 Ci/mmol) were purchased from DuPont NEN. Crystalline AdoCbl was a gift from Eizai, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. Restriction endonucleases and the enzymes used for the construction of DNA library and expression plasmids and DNA sequencing were obtained from Toyobo Co., Osaka, Japan.DNA ManipulationsStandard recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al.(16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from K. oxytoca was isolated by the procedure of Marmur (17Marmur J. J. Mol.

Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). The transformation of E. coli HB101 and screening procedures were carried out as described previously (19Tobimatsu T. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16082-16086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A synthetic 50-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5′-TCTTTCACGAAGCCGTCCTGGTTCACCGGGCGTTTCGCCAGCGCTTCGAA-3′), which is complementary to the DNA sequence deduced from the reported N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Mr 60,000 subunit (FEALAKRPVNQDGFVKE) of diol dehydrase (13McGee D.E.

This probe labeled with 32P at the 5′-end was used for hybridization at 60°C. Positive clones were isolated and characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping.Enzyme and Protein AssaysHybridization-positive E. coli clones as well as E. coli carrying plasmid pUC119 were cultivated aerobically at 37°C in a modified glycerol/1,2-propanediol medium (20Toraya T. Ishida A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7677-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) supplemented with 40 μg/ml ampicillin and harvested in the late logarithmic phase. Cell homogenates prepared by sonication were assayed for diol dehydrase activity by the 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone method(21Toraya T. Ushio K. Fukui S. Hogenkamp H.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of diol dehydrase is defined as the amount of enzyme activity that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of propionaldehyde/min. Protein was assayed by the method of Lowry et al.(22Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with crystalline bovine serum albumin as a standard. Specific activity is expressed as units/mg of protein.Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Activity Staining of Diol DehydrasePolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell-free extracts was performed under nondenaturing conditions as described by Davis (23Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15919) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.1 M 1,2-propanediol or under denaturing conditions as described by Laemmli(24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). Protein staining was carried out with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Activity staining for diol dehydrase was performed as follows. The gel was immersed in a solution consisting of 0.035 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 0.1 M 1,2-propanediol, 0.05 M KCl, and 15 μM AdoCbl and incubated at 37°C for 10-15 min in the dark. The gel was immediately transferred to a solution of 0.4% (w/v) 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 2 N HCl and allowed to stand for 15 min. Excess 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine was removed by immersing in 2 N HCl solution with several changes. The band of diol dehydrase can be located by the precipitate of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone of propionaldehyde.Nucleotide SequencingThe plasmid recovered from the E. coli strain that showed the highest activity of diol dehydrase was designated pUCDD11 and used for analysis of the nucleotide sequence. pUCDD11 was digested with SacI, treated by T4 DNA polymerase with dNTPs, ligated to HindIII linker CCAAGCTTGG, and cleaved with HindIII. The resulting 7.0-kb fragment was subcloned into pUC119(18Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). pUCDD11 was digested with KpnI, treated by T4 DNA polymerase with dNTPs, and digested with EcoRI. The resulting 9.3-kb fragment was ligated with the 31-base pair HincII-EcoRI fragment of pUC119 to produce plasmid pUCDD11-1. The 6.2-kb XbaI fragment from pUCDD11-1 was inserted into XbaI site of pUC119 and selected for the plasmid having an insert DNA in the opposite direction (pUCDD11-2). Other restriction fragments obtained from pUCDD11 were also subcloned into pUC119. Deletion mutants were produced by exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease(25Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar, 26Barnes W.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 538-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method of Sanger et al.(27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52357) Google Scholar), as modified by Johnston-Dow et al.(28Johnston-Dow L. Mardis E. Heiner C. Roe B.A. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 754-765Google Scholar), using Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I or Sequenase from U. S. Biochemical Corp.Construction of Expression Plasmid for Diol Dehydrase GenespUSI2(29Shibui T. Uchida M. Teranishi Y. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 983-988Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), an expression vector containing the tac promotor, was digested partially with EcoRI, treated by T4 DNA polymerase with a mixture of four dNTPs, and ligated. The remaining EcoRI site of the resulting DNA was eliminated by repeating the same treatments, and the plasmid possessing no EcoRI sites was selected. The plasmid was then digested with SmaI and ligated with EcoRI linker GGAATTCC. Digestion with EcoRI followed by self-ligation yielded expression vector pUSI2E. The 9.4-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment from pUCDD11 and a 0.3-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment from a deletion mutant (pUCDD11d505) containing nucleotide residues 2708-2960 (taking the first nucleotide of the translational initiation codon of ORF2 as 1) were ligated to produce plasmid pUCDD11Δ5. A DNA segment encoding the N-terminal region of the Mr 28,000 polypeptide was amplified by PCR using a 5′ oligonucleotide primer TCGGATCCTAGGAGGTTTAAACATATGAGCAGCAATGAGCTGGTGG (the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the initiation codon of this ORF are underlined), and a 3′ oligonucleotide primer GGGCGCCGAGAATGCCGATGGAGCG (complimentary to the nucleotide sequence 18-42 bases downstream of the unique HindIII site). The PCR product digested with BamHI and HindIII was cloned into HindIII-BamHI-digested pUC119 (pUC28N). The 0.2-kb BamHIHindIII fragment from pUC28N and the 3.6-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment from pUCDD11Δ5 were ligated to pUSI2E previously linearized with BamHI and EcoRI to construct expression plasmid pUSI2E(1DD).The DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal region of the Mr 60,000 polypeptide was amplified by PCR using a 5′ oligonucleotide primer GACATATGAGATCGAAAAGATTTGA (the initiation codon is underlined) and a 3′ oligonucleotide primer GCATTTTCTGCATCGCCATC (complimentary to the nucleotides 378-397 of ORF2 encoding the 60,000 polypeptide). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and inserted into the NdeI site of pUC28N. A plasmid containing Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the insert DNA in the same direction was selected. The plasmid obtained was digested partially with NdeI and completely with BamHI. The resulting 0.4-kb BamHI-NdeI fragment and the 2.6-kb NdeI-EcoRI fragment from pUCDD11Δ5 were ligated to the 5.0-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment from pUSI2E to construct pUSI2E(DD), another expression plasmid for diol dehydrase. It was confirmed by sequencing that no undesired mutations occurred during PCR reactions. Expression plasmids constructed were transformed to E. coli JM109 by the electroporation method as described by Dower et al.(30Dower W.J. Miller J.F. Ragsdale C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli strains harboring expression plasmids were aerobically grown in LB medium (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 1,2-propanediol (0.1%) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml). When the culture reached an A600 of approximately 0.7, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was added for induction to a concentration of 1 mM. Cells were harvested in the late logarithmic phase.The T7 expression system constructed by Studier et al.(31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) was also examined for overproduction of diol dehydrase. pUSI2E(DD) was digested partially with NdeI and completely with EcoRI. The resulting 3.0-kb fragment was ligated to the 2.4-kb NdeI-EcoRI fragment from pRK172 to construct pRK172(DD). This expression plasmid was transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS by the electroporation method, and the transformant was cultured as described above, except that chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) was also added together with ampicillin.Western Blot AnalysisCell-free extracts of transformed E. coli cells were subjected to 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane BA 85 (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. The diol dehydrase-derived proteins were probed with rabbit antiserum raised against K. oxytoca diol dehydrase (32Toraya T. Fukui S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) followed by treatment with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and located by reaction with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium.RESULTSCloning of the Diol Dehydrase GenesGenomic DNA from K. oxytoca ATCC 8724 was digested partially with restriction enzyme Sau3AI, and resulting 6-20-kb fragments were inserted into the BamHI site of plasmid pUC119(18Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). E. coli HB101 was transformed with the plasmids. Ampicillin-resistant transformants were screened using the synthetic 50-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe, which was complementary to the deduced DNA sequence from the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Mr 60,000 subunit of diol dehydrase(13McGee D.E. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4293-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14McGee D.E. Carroll S.S. Bond M.W. Richards J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Twelve hybridization-positive clones were isolated from 4 × 103 transformants.Twelve hybridization-positive E. coli clones cultivated aerobically in a glycerol/1,2-propanediol medium were examined for diol dehydrase activity. As shown in Table 1, specific activity of homogenates of the clones carrying plasmid pUCDD11 or pUCDD3 was rather higher than that of K. oxytoca ATCC 8724 grown in the same medium under aerobic conditions (0.55 unit/mg of protein). Clones carrying pUCDD4, pUCDD7, or pUCDD12 exhibited low but definite activity. Enzyme activity of the other seven clones as well as E. coli HB101 transformed with parent vector pUC119 was less than 0.001 unit/mg of protein. Plasmid pUCDD11, expressing the highest diol dehydrase activity in E. coli, was used for further analysis.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Identification of the Gene Products Expressed in E. coli Strain Carrying Plasmid pUCDD11Cell-free extract of the recombinant E. coli strain carrying plasmid pUCDD11 was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions according to the method of Davis (23Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15919) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1,2-propanediol(12Poznanskaja A.A. Tanizawa K. Soda K. Toraya T. Fukui S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The extract of E. coli carrying plasmid pUCDD11 contained a new protein band (marked with arrowhead in Fig. 1A, lane 3). When the gel was subjected to activity staining by visualizing propionaldehyde through reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, this band was the only one that converted 1,2-propanediol to propionaldehyde in the presence of AdoCbl (Fig. 1C, lane 3). The propionaldehyde formation was not observed in the absence of AdoCbl (Fig. 1B, lane 3). The cell-free extract of K. oxytoca showed the band of diol dehydrase in the same position (Fig. 1, A and C, lane 1), whereas the extract of E. coli HB101 transformed with pUC119 did not (Fig. 1, A and C, lane 2). The recombinant diol dehydrase formed in E. coli co-migrated with diol dehydrase of K. oxytoca (Fig. 1, A and C, lane 4). Furthermore, diol dehydrase activity in the extract of the recombinant E. coli strain was immunoprecipitated by rabbit antiserum against diol dehydrase of K. oxytoca(32Toraya T. Fukui S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, it was suggested that the diol dehydrase formed in E. coli carrying plasmid pUCDD11 is identical to the wild-type enzyme of K. oxytoca.Figure 1Expression of diol dehydrase in E. coli HB101 carrying plasmid pUCDD11. Cell-free extracts of K. oxytoca (lane 1), E. coli HB101 carrying vector pUC119 (lane 2), or plasmid pUCDD11 (lane 3), and a mixture of extracts of K. oxytoca and E. coli HB101 carrying pUCDD11 (lane 4) were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions.

Among them, the 0.4-, 1.6-, 0.3-, and 0.9-kb PstI fragments were found in common in the inserts of all the five clones expressing diol dehydrase activity in E. coli, whereas the 1.8-, 2.0-, and 0.5-kb fragments were not found in pUCDD3 and pUCDD7, and the 1.3-kb PstI fragment not found in pUCDD12 (data not shown). Therefore, it was suggested that diol dehydrase is encoded within the region containing the 1.3-, 0.4-, 1.6-, 0.3-, 0.9-, and 1.8-kb PstI fragments. The E. coli strain carrying pUCDD11 expressed diol dehydrase activity when grown in the glycerol/1,2-propanediol medium, but not in a glucose medium. The addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to the medium did not increase but rather decreased the level of enzyme activity. These results suggest that the diol dehydrase genes in pUCDD11 are under control not of the lac promoter of pUC119 but of their own promoter.Figure 2Restriction map of the insert DNA of pUCDD11 and sequencing strategy.

As summarized in Figure 2, Figure 3, there existed four successive open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) encoding polypeptides of 270, 554, 224, and 173 amino acid residues with predicted molecular weights of 28,071, 60,348, 24,113, and 19,173, respectively. The fourth ORF was followed by another ORF (ORF5), whose putative initiation codon (GTG) was found 41-bases downstream of the termination codon of ORF4. However, the termination codon of ORF5 did not appear within the 1.8-kb PstI fragment. ORF2-ORF4 were separated from their upstream ORFs by 18, 10, and 14 bases, respectively. Shine-Dalgarno sequences were found 8-12 bases upstream of the putative initiation codon (ATG) for each polypeptide. The deduced N-terminal amino acid sequences of 60,000, 24,000, and 19,000 polypeptides shown in Fig. 3 coincided with the N-terminal 36 residues of the Mr 60,000 subunit, 39 residues of the Mr 29,000 subunit, and 40 residues of the Mr 15,000 subunit of diol dehydrase reported by McGee et al.(14McGee D.E. Carroll S.S. Bond M.W. Richards J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), respectively. The deduced sequence of the 60,000 polypeptide contained the same sequences as two proteolytic peptides. 2K. Tanizawa and H. Kimimoto, personal communication. Amino acid compositions of those polypeptides are in reasonable agreement with those reported by McGee et al.(14McGee D.E. Carroll S.S. Bond M.W. Richards J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The mutant plasmid, pUCDD11Δ5, which carried ORF1-ORF4 and lacked ORF5 except for the first 34 nucleotides was transformed into E. coli HB101. The homogenate of the transformant exhibited diol dehydrase activity of 0.74 unit/mg of protein, which was comparable with that of E. coli HB101 carrying pUCDD11 (1.2 units/mg of protein). It is therefore evident that the polypeptide encoded by ORF5 is not a functional subunit of diol dehydrase. In order to confirm this conclusion and to determine whether the Mr 28,000 polypeptide is essential for diol dehydrase activity, we constructed two expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 4, pUSI2E(1DD) contained the first four ORFs encoding the Mr 28,000, 60,000, 24,000, and 19,000 polypeptides downstream of the tac promoter. pUSI2E(DD) containing ORF2-ORF4 encoding the Mr 60,000, 24,000, and 19,000 polypeptides in the same position was also constructed. For overexpression of the diol dehydrase genes, T7 expression system of Studier et al.(31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5987) Google Scholar) was also examined. pRK172(DD) containing the same ORFs as pUSI2E(DD) downstream of T7 promoter was constructed. All of the three expression plasmids retained the first 34 nucleotides of ORF5.Figure 4The plasmids constructed for high level expression of the diol dehydrase genes.

As shown in Table 2, when cultivated at 30°C, specific activity of homogenates of both E. coli stains carrying pUSI2E(1DD) and pUSI2E(DD) were 38 and 53 times higher, respectively, than that of K. oxytoca ATCC 8724 cultivated aerobically in the glycerol/1,2-propanediol medium. E. coli carrying pUSI2E(DD) grown at 37°C showed almost the same specific activity as that grown at 30°C.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab The E. coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells transformed with pRK172(DD) were cultivated in a similar manner at 30 or 37°C, and diol dehydrase activity of homogenates was determined. As shown in Table 2, specific activity of the cells grown at 30°C was higher than that of the cells grown at 37°C. The former was 35 times higher than that of K. oxytoca ATCC 8724 but a little lower than that of the cells transformed with pUSI2E(1DD) or pUSI2E(DD). In the following experiments, characterization of recombinant diol dehydrase was performed using E. coli JM109 carrying pUSI2E(DD) or pUSI2E(1DD).Diol dehydrase in cell-free extracts was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions and located by protein staining and activity staining. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, electrophoretic mobility of recombinant diol dehydrase in cell-free extracts of E. coli carrying pUSI2E(1DD) (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 3) or pUSI2E(DD) (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 4) was in good agreement with that of diol dehydrase in the extract of K. oxytoca (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 1) (marked with arrowhead in the left) upon both protein staining and activity staining. These results suggest that inclusion of the three ORFs (ORF2-ORF4) encoding Mr 60,000, 24,000, and 19,000 polypeptides in an expression plasmid was sufficient to form high levels of functional diol dehydrase. It is therefore strongly suggested that ORF2, ORF3, and ORF4 are the genes encoding the subunits of diol dehydrase. These were designated pddA, pddB, and pddC genes, respectively.Figure 5Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell-free extracts of E. coli carrying expression plasmids. Cell-free extracts of K. oxytoca (lane 1) and E. coli JM109 carrying pUSI2E (lane 2), pUSI2E(1DD) (lane 3), or pUSI2E(DD) (lane 4) were electrophoresed on 7% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions.

When polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed under denaturing conditions, the extract of E. coli carrying pUSI2E(DD) contained the three thick protein bands with Mr of 60,000, 30,000, and 19,000 (marked with arrowhead in Fig. 6A, lane 3), which reacted with anti-diol dehydrase antiserum (Fig. 6B, lane 3). These three bands were the same in size as the three subunits detected in the cell-free extract of K. oxytoca with the antiserum (Fig. 6B, lane 1). No bands reactive with the antiserum were observed in the cell-free extract of E. coli carrying pUSI2E (control) (Fig. 6B, lane 2). The Mr 60,000, 30,000, and 19,000 subunits were designated α, β, and γ subunits, respectively.Figure 6Western blot analysis of homogenates of E. coli carrying expression plasmids.

Functional diol dehydrase migrated as a single band under nondenaturing conditions in the presence of substrate (marked with arrowhead on the top of Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7A, the band of diol dehydrase then dissociated into the three polypeptides upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Their Mr of 60,000, 30,000, and 19,000 coincided with those of the subunits recognized with anti-diol dehydrase antiserum in the Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). When the extract of E. coli carrying pUSI2E(1DD) was analyzed in a similar manner, essentially the same results were obtained (data not shown). None of these bands were detected in the gel with the extract of E. coli carrying pUSI2E (control). From all of these results, it can be concluded that diol dehydrase apoenzyme is composed of the Mr 60,000 (α), 30,000 (β), and 19,000 (γ) subunits that are encoded by the pddA, pddB, and pddC genes, respectively. It is also evident that the gene product of ORF1 is not a functional subunit of the enzyme.Figure 7Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cell-free extract of E. coli carrying expression plasmids. Cell-free extracts of E. coli JM109 carrying pUSI2E(DD) (A) or pUSI2E (B) were electrophoresed on 7% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions (first dimension, from left to right) and then on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions (second dimension, from top to bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we revealed by gene cloning and expression that functional diol dehydrase consists of the Mr 60,000 (α), 30,000 (β), and 19,000 (γ) subunits. No additional subunits were required for activity, since specific activity of the recombinant diol dehydrase purified from E. coli carrying pUSI2E(DD) (86 units/mg of protein) was essentially the same as that of the enzyme purified from cell-free extracts of K. oxytoca (88 units/mg of protein). Apparent Mr of the β subunit obtained from the calibration curve (30,000) was a little larger than calculated (24,000) from the deduced amino acid sequence from the pddB gene, although Mr of the α and γ subunits (60,000 and 19,000) were just as calculated from the pddA and pddC genes, respectively.We have previously reported that diol dehydrase is separated into components F and S upon chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (11Toraya T. Uesaka M. Fukui S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3895-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or DEAE-Sephadex A-50 in the absence of substrate(12Poznanskaja A.A. Tanizawa K. Soda K. Toraya T. Fukui S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Tanizawa K. Nakajima N. Toraya T. Tanaka H. Soda K. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Neither component alone is inactive, but enzymic activity is restored when both are combined(11Toraya T. Uesaka M. Fukui S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3895-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mr of F and S determined by gel filtration are 26,000 and 200,000, respectively(12Poznanskaja A.A. Tanizawa K. Soda K. Toraya T. Fukui S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We confirmed that recombinant diol dehydrase was also separated into F and S and that F and S included the Mr 30,000 subunit and the Mr 60,000 + 19,000 subunits, respectively (data not shown).McGee and co-workers (13McGee D.E. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4293-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14McGee D.E. Carroll S.S. Bond M.W. Richards J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) reported that the Mr 51,000 polypeptide is also a subunit of diol dehydrase. However, the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the N-terminal 40 amino acid residues described by them was not found in the insert DNA of pUCDD11. Functional diol dehydrase was formed by expression of the pddA, pddB, and pddC genes encoding the α, β, and γ subunits, respectively, indicating that the Mr 51,000 polypeptide is not a functional subunit of diol dehydrase. The Mr 51,000 polypeptide was not present in the enzyme purified from cell-free extracts(12Poznanskaja A.A. Tanizawa K. Soda K. Toraya T. Fukui S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At present, the relation of the Mr 51,000 polypeptide to diol dehydrase remains obscure.Four ORFs lie adjacent to each other on the genomic DNA and seem to constitute an operon. Expression of ORF1 using plasmid pUSI2E(1DD) resulted in overproduction of another 30,000 polypeptide (data not shown). High-level expression of ORF5 in E. coli has not yet been attempted. Functions of the products of these two genes have not yet been characterized. They may play certain roles in the fermentation of 1,2-propanediol(33Toraya T. Honda S. Fukui S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 39-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The deduced amino acid sequences of the diol dehydrase subunits did not show significant homology to those of proteins listed in the PIR and SWISSPROT data bases when analyzed using FASTA program(34Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9345) Google Scholar). No significant similarity was found between the subunits of diol dehydrase and other cobalamin-dependent enzymes or cobalamin-binding proteins. Motifs of a binding site for a large molecule, such as AdoCbl, may not be apparent.

Although the mechanism of action as well as the structure-function relationship of the coenzyme has been extensively studied with diol dehydrase(7Abeles R.H. Zagalak B. Friedrich W. Vitamin B.

McGee and Richards (13McGee D.E. Richards J.H. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4293-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) claimed that the enzyme isolated from detergent-extract of membrane (Mr, 250,000) is composed of Mr 60,000, 51,000, 29,000, and 15,000 polypeptides(13McGee D.E.

In contrast, a paper appeared that reported that component F is an essential constituent of the enzyme from detergent-extract of membrane as well(15Tanizawa K. Nakajima N. Toraya T. Tanaka H. Soda K. Z. Naturforsch. 1987; 42: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We attempted to solve this apparent discrepancy by cloning the genes encoding this enzyme.In this paper, we report cloning and sequence analysis of the pdd genes encoding diol dehydrase. Overexpression systems for the diol dehydrase genes in Escherichia coli are also described here, which promise us to get the enzyme in a large quantity for structural analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1973522628,"During axotomy studies, we discovered that the βA4-amyloid precursor protein (APP) participates in immune responses of the central nervous system. Since microglia constitute the main immune effector cell population of this response, we used the murine microglial cell line BV-2 to analyze immune response-related APP expression. We show that interaction of microglia with the extracellular environment, particularly components of the extracellular matrix, affects APP secretion as well as intracellular APP biogenesis and catabolism. Fibronectin enhanced APP secretion and decreased the level of cellular mature transmembrane APP, whereas laminin and collagen caused a decrease in secretion and an accumulation of cellular mature APP and APP fragments.Our results demonstrate that APP plays a fundamental role in the regulation of microglial mobility, i.e. migration, initial target recognition, and binding. The decrease in APP secretion and the concomitant increase in cellular mature APP were accompanied by an accumulation of C-terminal APP fragments. Enrichment of APP and APP fragments is assumedly based on inhibition of catabolic processes that is caused by a disorganization of the actin microfilament network. These observations provide evidence that microglia, which are closely associated with certain amyloid deposits in the brain of Alzheimer patients, can play a key role in initial events of amyloidogenesis by initiating accumulation of APP and also of amyloidogenic APP fragments in response to physiological changes upon brain injury. During axotomy studies, we discovered that the βA4-amyloid precursor protein (APP) participates in immune responses of the central nervous system. Since microglia constitute the main immune effector cell population of this response, we used the murine microglial cell line BV-2 to analyze immune response-related APP expression. We show that interaction of microglia with the extracellular environment, particularly components of the extracellular matrix, affects APP secretion as well as intracellular APP biogenesis and catabolism. Fibronectin enhanced APP secretion and decreased the level of cellular mature transmembrane APP, whereas laminin and collagen caused a decrease in secretion and an accumulation of cellular mature APP and APP fragments. Our results demonstrate that APP plays a fundamental role in the regulation of microglial mobility, i.e. migration, initial target recognition, and binding. The decrease in APP secretion and the concomitant increase in cellular mature APP were accompanied by an accumulation of C-terminal APP fragments.

Foster D. Wilson J.D. Foster D.W. Williams‘ Textbook of Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1992: 1255-1333Google Scholar). Upon glucagon binding, the receptor interacts with the membrane-associated G-protein subunit Gs to ultimately stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP. Elevation of this second messenger ultimately leads to an increase in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis(3Smith R.J. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1989: 1333-1345Google Scholar).The glucoincretin hormone known as glucagon-like peptide-I (GLP-I) is secreted in the gut and potentiates the glucose-induced secretion of insulin by the islets of Langerhans(4Dupre J.

Like glucagon, GLP-I exerts its effects by binding to its cognate receptor generating a rise in intracellular cAMP concentration(6Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.P. Morel P. Widmannj C. Diabetes. 1992; 42: 1678-1682Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Both hormones are of considerable importance in the control of blood glucose homeostasis.The cDNAs encoding both the human glucagon receptor (hGR) and the human islet GLP-I receptor (hGLP-IR) have been recently cloned(6Thorens B. Porret A. Buhler L. Deng S.P. Morel P. Widmannj C. Diabetes. 1992; 42: 1678-1682Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 7Lok S. Kuijper J.L. Jelinek L.J. Kramer J.M. Whitmore T.E. Sprecher C.A.

Both polypeptides show sequence similarity to a well established family of receptors with seven-transmembrane domains that are known to couple to intracellular effectors through heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins)(8Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). All members of this family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) share the same basic structure and membrane topology. Within the large family of GPCRs are grouped subfamilies based on primary sequence homology(9Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The glucagon and GLP-I peptide receptors are grouped into a subfamily that includes the receptors for secretin, calcitonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, parathyroid hormone, and growth hormone-releasing factor(9Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The hGR and hGLP-IR share 47% amino acid identity and 66% similarity, with the transmembrane segments having the highest degree of similarity (see Fig. 1). Despite this homology, glucagon binds to the hGR with a Kd approximately 1000-fold lower than to the hGLP-IR.Despite a large body of information regarding the ligand binding and signaling characteristics of GPCRs in general, there has been very little structure-function analysis reported about the glucagon-secretin subfamily. In order to understand the nature of the interaction of glucagon with its receptor, we constructed a number of hGR•hGLP-IR chimeras in which the various domains of the hGR were sequentially replaced by homologous domains from hGLP-IR. Since both receptors are highly conserved throughout their entire length, it was possible to swap domains without introducing any gaps or deletions in the primary amino acid sequence. We report here the identification of several, non-continuous domains that are required for high affinity glucagon binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe cDNA that encodes the hGR was identified using the previously described rat GR cDNA (10Jelinek L.J. Lok S. Rosenberg G.B. Smith R.A. Grant F.J. Biggs S. Bensch P.A. Kuijper J.L. Sheppard P.O. Sprecher C.A. O'Hara P.J. Foster D. Walker K.M. Chen L.H.J. McKernan P.A. Kindsvogel W. Science. 1993; 259: 1614-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) to probe a human liver cDNA library (Clontech). A clone of approximately 1.7 kilobases, consisting of 70 bases of the 5′-untranslated region, the full coding sequence, and 230 bases of 3′-untranslated segment was obtained. Nucleotide sequence of the clone was identical to the corresponding portion of the published hGR (GenBank accession number L20316(7Lok S. Kuijper J.L. Jelinek L.J. Kramer J.M. Whitmore T.E. Sprecher C.A. Mathewes S. Grant F.J. Biggs S.H. Rosenberg G.B. Sheppard P.O. O'Hara P.J. Foster D.C. Kindsvogel W.K. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). Isolation of the hGLP-IR cDNA was described previously(11Dillon J.S. Tanizawa Y. Wheeler M.B. Leng X.H. Ligon B.B. Rabin C.U. Yoo-Warren H. Permutt M.A. Boyd A.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1907-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Restriction endonucleases were from Boehringer Mannheim. Polymerase chain reaction reagents were from Invitrogen Corp. and New England Biolabs (Vent polymerase). 125I-Labeled glucagon was obtained from DuPont, and unlabeled glucagon was purchased from Sigma. COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC.Construction and Expression of ChimerasThe cDNAs encoding the wild type hGR and hGLP-IR were subcloned into an expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Chimeras were constructed using a polymerase chain reaction strand overlap extension (12Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528PubMed Google Scholar) technique using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The chimeras were engineered precisely through the use of specific oligonucleotide primers (Midland certified reagent company). The region surrounding the chimera splice junctions was subcloned as a cassette into either the hGR or hGLP-IR backbone in vector pcDNA3. The constructions were verified by restriction endonuclease mapping and sequence analysis.The wild type, mutant, and chimeric receptors were expressed transiently by DEAE-mediated transfection of COS-7 cells(13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatus T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Glucagon Binding AnalysisBinding assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate on at least two separate occasions on whole cells grown in a 24-well chamber dish. Approximately 105 cells were incubated in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.0% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml bacitracin (Aldrich) in a 200-μl volume. Binding was carried out for 90 min at 4°C in the presence of 150,000 cpm of 125I-labeled glucagon and various amounts of unlabeled ligand. Nonspecific binding was determined as total counts bound to COS-7 cells transfected with vector pcDNA3. Bound tracer ligand was determined using an automatic γ counter (Wallac model 1470 Wizard).Immunofluorescence AssaysCells were grown on a 4-well glass chamber slide (Nunc). Cells were blocked with a solution of RPMI 1640 medium (JRH Biosciences), 1.0% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) for 1 h at 25°C. The cells were then incubated in fresh blocking medium containing 10 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-human GR antibody for 1 h at 4°C. This antibody was raised by immunizing mice with Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with hGR. The antibody has been shown to specifically block glucagon binding to hGR (data not shown; characterization of this monoclonal antibody will be reported separately). Cells were washed with blocking solution, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) was added in blocking buffer at 4°C for 1 h. Cells were washed, coverslipped, and viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Leitz Diaplan system).RESULTSLigand Binding Properties of Chimeric ReceptorsTen chimeric hGR•hGLP-IR genes were constructed (Fig. 2). The recombinant chimeras were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed for ligand binding. The affinity for 125I-labeled glucagon was ascertained using an equilibrium whole cell binding assay (Fig. 3 and Table 1). With few exceptions, all of the chimeras reported here segregate neatly into two categories: 1) they bind glucagon with wild-type affinity, or 2) they bind glucagon with an affinity similar to that of glucagon binding to GLP-IR.Figure 2Schematic representation of the hGR•hGLP-IR chimeras.

However, replacement of the entire amino-terminal extension and the first intracellular loop, including transmembrane domains (TMDs) I and II (chimera CH-2) abolishes high affinity binding (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, chimera CH-3, in which the first intracellular loop plus TMDs I and II are replaced, yields a construct with a high binding affinity. Taken together, binding data from CH-1, CH-2, and CH-3 suggest that the membrane-proximal region of the amino-terminal extension is in fact important for glucagon binding or recognition, whereas the membrane-distal half of the amino-terminal extension, the first intracellular loop, and TMD I and II are not involved in a major way.Substitution of the first extracellular loop plus TMDs III and IV (chimera CH-4) yields a construct that has no high affinity glucagon binding activity (Fig. 3A). However, chimera CH-5, in which the majority of the second intracellular loop was replaced, binds glucagon with high affinity. Data from CH-4 and CH-5 together suggest that the first extracellular loop and TMDs III and IV are involved in glucagon-specific binding, but the second intracellular loop is not.In order to determine whether the domains surrounding the second extracellular loop are important, CH-6 and CH-7 were constructed. CH-6, in which TMD V plus the third intracellular loop have been replaced, binds glucagon with high affinity, as does CH-7 in which the second extracellular loop has also been switched (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the second extracellular loop, TMD V, and the third intracellular loop are not involved in high affinity glucagon binding.CH-8, CH-9, and CH-10 were designed to address the role of the carboxyl-terminal region of the receptor in ligand binding. Chimera CH-8 is able to bind glucagon with high affinity, which indicates that TMD VII plus the entire intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail is not involved in ligand selection (Fig. 3C). CH-10, in which the third extracellular loop has effectively been converted into GLP-IR, binds glucagon but with somewhat reduced affinity relative to the wild-type receptor, even though this chimera differs in only two adjacent amino acids: Ser-379 to Phe and Ala-380 to Ile. CH-9, however, binds glucagon with an affinity comparable with that of the GLP-IR. These data indicate that TMD VI is important for glucagon binding.In summary, the regions which are not involved in the selective binding of glucagon include the membrane-distal half of the amino-terminal extension, all three intracellular loops, the second extracellular loop, TMDs I, II, V, and VII, and the entire carboxyl-terminal tail. The first and third extracellular loops appear to be involved, as do TMDs III, IV, and VI, as well as the membrane-proximal half of the amino-terminal extension. These results are summarized under “Discussion” and in Fig. 5.Figure 5Regions of the hGR implicated in high affinity glucagon-specific binding.

Fig. 4 shows the immunofluorescence staining patterns of COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type hGR, CH-2, CH-4, CH-9, and CH-10. The antibody detected the three chimeras and the wild-type receptor in approximately 40% of the total cell population, which is consistent with the known transfection frequency. Cells had a typical pattern of membrane staining.Figure 4Cellular distribution of the hGR chimeras in transfected COS-7 cells.

The strategy in such experiments is to exchange homologous domains between two similar, yet functionally distinct receptors and correlate gain or loss of function with the exchanged domain. This approach eliminates any gross structural alterations such as altered folding or membrane insertion that can occur with other methods such as substitution or deletion mutagenesis. However, while the design of chimeras is a useful method for identifying amino acid residues involved in ligand-specific selectivity, this approach does not necessarily identify domains that may be important for ligand binding but are common to both receptors. A composite diagram indicating the regions of the hGR that are involved in the selective binding of glucagon is shown in Fig. 5. The residues in Fig. 5 shown as “not involved” in high affinity glucagon-specific binding are determined by two criteria: 1) chimera data and 2) sequence identity between the hGR and GLP-IR.The general picture that has emerged of the peptide ligand binding site on GPCRs implicates the extracellular domains, and less often, a few select transmembrane segments. This is true even of very short peptide ligands such as the tripeptide fMet-Leu-Phe, which binds to the N-formyl peptide receptor via multiple, discontinuous regions, especially in the extracellular domains and near the top of the transmembrane regions(14Quehenberger O. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18167-18175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our structure-function analysis of the hGR indicates that it conforms well to this paradigm. Most GPCRs that bind large peptides utilize residues within the amino-terminal extension(9Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 15Fong T.M. Yu H. Huang R.C. Strader C.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11806-11811Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our findings are consistent with this idea. Specifically, we find that residues between Ser-80 and Gln-142 are necessary for glucagon binding specificity. In addition, a recent study by Carruthers et al.(16Carruthers C.J.L. Unson C.G. Kim H.N. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that a highly conserved aspartic acid residue located within the amino-terminal extension of the rat GR (corresponding to Asp-63 in Fig. 1) is crucial for ligand binding. This conserved aspartic acid residue is probably of general structural importance for the binding of a number of peptide ligands within the family of GPCRs and is not involved in ligand selectivity.Huang et al.(17Huang R.C. Yu H. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3007-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that residues lying within TMD II and VII of the neurokinin-1 receptor are important for the specificity of binding of its peptide ligand, substance P; in contrast, we find that residues within TMD II and TMD VII do not appear to be involved in glucagon-specific binding. A two-amino acid change within extracellular loop 3 of the hGR (CH-11) leads to a slight but significant decrease in glucagon-specific binding, similar to the interleukin-8 receptor, which utilizes two residues within its third extracellular loop in the specific binding of interleukin-8(18Hebert C.A. Chuntharapai A. Smith M. Colby T. Kim J. Horuk R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18549-18553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Early biochemical measurements of the site(s) of glucagon interaction with its hepatic receptor demonstrated that both the glucagon binding function of the receptor as well as the region functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase are contained within a 21-kDa peptide fragment(19Iyengar R. Herberg J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5222-5229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments involved the proteolytic treatment of the receptor following covalent cross-linking with monoiodoglucagon. A subsection of the receptor (approximately the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the receptor, including all of the hydrophobic membrane binding regions) was identified as the fragment that binds glucagon. This conclusion is consistent with the data presented here.More recently, effort has been directed toward a structural analysis of glucagon, specifically the residues involved in receptor binding (20Hjorth S.A.

They determined that the epitope involved in the selective recognition of the GR is located near the amino terminus of glucagon, and the GLP-I selective recognition epitope is located in the far carboxyl-terminal end of GLP-I. While such analyses do not predict the receptor domains involved in binding, they provide some information on receptor-ligand interaction. A deeper understanding requires the complementary analysis of the receptor itself. Our future effort will be directed toward a detailed structural characterization of the residues of the receptor involved in glucagon recognition and specific contact.

Both polypeptides show sequence similarity to a well established family of receptors with seven-transmembrane domains that are known to couple to intracellular effectors through heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins)(8Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). All members of this family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) share the same basic structure and membrane topology. Within the large family of GPCRs are grouped subfamilies based on primary sequence homology(9Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The glucagon and GLP-I peptide receptors are grouped into a subfamily that includes the receptors for secretin, calcitonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, parathyroid hormone, and growth hormone-releasing factor(9Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The hGR and hGLP-IR share 47% amino acid identity and 66% similarity, with the transmembrane segments having the highest degree of similarity (see Fig. 1). Despite this homology, glucagon binds to the hGR with a Kd approximately 1000-fold lower than to the hGLP-IR.Despite a large body of information regarding the ligand binding and signaling characteristics of GPCRs in general, there has been very little structure-function analysis reported about the glucagon-secretin subfamily. In order to understand the nature of the interaction of glucagon with its receptor, we constructed a number of hGR•hGLP-IR chimeras in which the various domains of the hGR were sequentially replaced by homologous domains from hGLP-IR. Since both receptors are highly conserved throughout their entire length, it was possible to swap domains without introducing any gaps or deletions in the primary amino acid sequence. We report here the identification of several, non-continuous domains that are required for high affinity glucagon binding."

The biological significance of the isolated structures is discussed in relation to the biological functions and the biosynthetic mechanisms of dermatan sulfate. Dermatan sulfate is an extracellular matrix component of fibrous connective tissues and is also present on cell surfaces as a proteoglycan. Several biological functions of proteodermatan sulfate are known such as extracellular matrix formation through interaction with several types of collagen(1Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D.

Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These functions are attributable to the core protein. Dermatan sulfate chains also mediate activities such as anticoagulant activity, self-association activity, and antiproliferative activity. The anticoagulant activity is expressed by binding to heparin cofactor II(6Tollefsen D.M. Pestka C.A. Monafo W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6713-6716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Self-association via protein-protein interactions is known, but it also occurs through carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions(7Frannson L.-Å. Nieduszynski I.A. Phelps C.F. Sheehan J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 586: 179-188Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Dermatan sulfate chains rich in iduronic acid have been demonstrated to be antiproliferative and also interact with spermine(8Belting M. Franson L.-Å. Glycoconjugate J. 1993; 10: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the structure-function relationship of dermatan sulfate chains is not fully understood mainly because of their complicated structure. Structurally, dermatan sulfate is similar to chondroitin sulfate and was previously called chondroitin sulfate B(9Meyer K. Davidson E. Linker A. Hoffman P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1956; 21: 506-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate as well as heparin and heparan sulfate are covalently bound to serine of a protein core through the common tetrasaccharide structure GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1- in the carbohydrate-protein linkage region(10Lindahl U. Rod é n L. Gottschalk A. Glycoproteins. Elsevier, New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar, 11Rod é n L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Attached to the linkage region is a long carbohydrate sequence, a so-called repeating disaccharide region, which is composed of alternately arranged uronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine residues. The uronic acid in the repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate is glucuronic acid, whereas that in dermatan sulfate is either iduronic or glucuronic acid. Thus, dermatan sulfate contains two types of disaccharide units, −4GlcAβ1-3GalNAcβ1- and −4IdoAα1-3GalNAcβ1-. 1The abbreviations used are: IdoAiduronic acidHexAhexuronic acidΔHexA or Δ4,5HexA4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acidΔDi-0SΔ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAcΔDi-6SΔ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAc(6-sulfate)ΔDi-4SΔ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAc(4-sulfate)ΔDi-diSDΔ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-3)GalNAc(6-sulfate)ΔDi-diSBΔ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-3)GalNAc(4-sulfate)ΔDi-diSEΔ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAc(4,6-disulfate)ΔDi-triSΔ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-3)GalNAc(4,6-disulfate)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyESIelectrospray ionizationMSmass spectrometryCOSYcorrelation spectroscopyHOHAHAhomonuclear Hartmann-Hahn. The disaccharide repeats are modified by sulfation. The former can be sulfated at C4 or C6 of the GalNAc unit, whereas the latter contains almost exclusively 4-sulfated GalNAc units and a minor proportion of IdoA unit which may be sulfated at C2. Combining sequential arrangements of iduronic acid residues and sulfate groups results in a wide variety of domain structures, some of which could have biological activities. iduronic acid hexuronic acid 4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid Δ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAc Δ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAc(6-sulfate) Δ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAc(4-sulfate) Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-3)GalNAc(6-sulfate) Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-3)GalNAc(4-sulfate) Δ4,5HexAα(1-3)GalNAc(4,6-disulfate) Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-3)GalNAc(4,6-disulfate) high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry correlation spectroscopy homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn. It is known that iduronic acid-rich glycosaminoglycans, like dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, inhibit fibroblast proliferation and that the antiproliferative activity appears to be related to iduronic acid content(12Westergren-Thorsson G. Önnervik P.O. Fransson L.-Å. Malmström A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 147: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although the role of IdoA units is important, their distribution along a given dermatan sulfate chain or the relationship between the structure and biological functions is not well understood. A recent structural study of the binding domain to heparin cofactor II is the best known example showing the relationship between the structure and biological functions of dermatan sulfate(13Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of this previous study revealed a unique hexasaccharide structure containing a cluster of three IdoA(2-sulfate)-GalNAc(4-sulfate) repeats, which comprises only 5% of the disaccharides present in intact dermatan sulfate. The biosynthetic mechanisms of such a domain structure of dermatan sulfate remain obscure. Dermatan sulfate is synthesized basically by a mechanism similar to that established for chondroitin sulfate. Chain initiation occurs by xylosylation of the serine residue of a core protein, followed by the addition of 2 galactose residues yielding the Gal-Gal-Xyl trisaccharide sequence which links each polysaccharide chain via a terminal glucuronic acid residue to the core protein. Chain elongation then occurs by alternate addition of GalNAc and GlcA units. Modification reactions take place at the polymer level. Iduronic acid in dermatan sulfate is formed from glucuronic acid by epimerization, most likely after C4 sulfation of the adjacent N-acetylgalactosamine(14Malmström A. Fransson L.-Å. Höök M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3419-3425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Epimerization and C4 sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine are tightly coupled, whereas C2 sulfation of iduronic acid occurs after the epimerization and does not seem to play any role in the formation of iduronic acid. We have been analyzing the structure of the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of various sulfated glycosaminoglycans to investigate the structure-function relationship and the biosynthetic mechanisms of these glycosaminoglycans(15Sugahara K.

Since the linkage region is first constructed in biosynthesis, possible differences in the structure of the linkage region may influence that of the repeating disaccharide region to be synthesized thereafter. Recently, we found novel 4-sulfated and 6-sulfated galactose units in the linkage region of chondroitin sulfate chains(15Sugahara K. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J.

In this study, we isolated and characterized the linkage region oligosaccharides from bovine aorta dermatan sulfate to examine possible structural variability and differences in this region from other glycosaminoglycans, especially chondroitin sulfate. Dermatan sulfate peptidoglycans were prepared from bovine cardiac aorta as reported previously(21Sugahara K. Takemura Y. Sugiura M. Kohno Y. Yoshida K. Takeda K. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The following authentic tetra- and hexasaccharide alditols were obtained from whale cartilage chondroitin 4-sulfate as reported(16Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P.

Other materials were obtained from the following sources: chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), chondroitinase ACII (EC 3.1.6.9), chondroitinase B (EC 4.2.2), chondro-4-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.9) from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo; NaBH4 from Nacalai tesque., Kyoto; NaB[3H]4 (15 Ci/mmol) from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis. The dermatan sulfate peptidoglycan fraction (100 mg containing 1.1 μmol of serine) from bovine aorta was treated with 2 ml of 1 M NaBH4, 0.05 M NaOH at room temperature for 24 h. For preparation of the 3H-labeled sample, the peptidoglycan fraction (1 mg) was treated with 100 μl of 0.24 mM NaB[3H]4 (15 Ci/mmol), 0.5 M NaOH at room temperature overnight; 50 μl of 1.2 mM NaBH4, 0.5 M NaOH was then added, and the mixture was left for 2 h to complete the reaction. Both labeled and nonlabeled samples were acidified with glacial acetic acid and then neutralized with 1 M NaOH. Following repeated evaporation with methanol, the residues were reconstituted in water. The 3H-labeled sample was subjected to gel filtration on a column (0.8 × 55.5 cm) of Sephadex G-50 with 0.25 M NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. The flow-through fractions containing 3H-labeled glycans were pooled, concentrated to dryness by evaporation, and reconstituted in water. A total radioactivity of 1.3 × 107 cpm was recovered into this preparation. A portion (6.1 × 106 cpm) of the sample was added to the nonlabeled preparation as a tracer, and the mixture was subjected to gel filtration on a column (0.8 × 55.5 cm) of Sephadex G-50 with 0.25 M NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. The fractions containing 3H radioactivity were pooled and concentrated. Chondroitinase ABC digestion was carried out as follows. The reduced polysaccharide containing 100 mg of the nonlabeled and 6.1 × 106 cpm of the 3H-labeled polysaccharides was incubated with 1 IU of the enzyme in a total volume of 2.6 ml of 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.05 M sodium acetate and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin as an enzyme stabilizer for 21 h at 37°C; 0.1 IU of the enzyme was added after 18 h. Then, the mixture was treated in boiling water for 1 min. The digest was subjected to gel filtration on a column (1 × 115 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2 with 0.25 M NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. Chondroitinase ACII digestion of the isolated linkage oligosaccharides (0.5 nmol) was conducted using 3 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl of 0.03 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 6, at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by heating at 100°C for 1 min. Chondroitinase B treatment of the isolated linkage oligosaccharide in fraction 14 (0.5 nmol) was performed using 4 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl of 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 11 h at 30°C. Chondro-4-sulfatase treatment of the isolated linkage oligosaccharides (0.5 nmol) was carried out using 20 mIU of the enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl of 0.04 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.04 M sodium acetate and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 or 14 h at 37°C. Fractionation of the linkage oligosaccharide alditols and analysis of the enzyme digests of the isolated oligosaccharides were carried out by HPLC essentially as reported previously for the separation of the chondrodisaccharides(22Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Chromatography was performed on an amine-bound silica PA 03 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 from 16 to 530 mM over a 60-min period at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. Eluates were monitored by absorbance at 232 nm. Xylitol analysis was carried out according to Yamada et al. 2S. Yamada, M. Oyama, and K. Sugahara, unpublished results. using 0.5 nmol of each fraction corresponding to 1,500-2,000 cpm. Briefly, the 3H-labeled oligosaccharide fraction was mixed with 50 μg each of nonlabeled xylitol, galactitol, and galactosaminitol and then hydrolyzed with 1 N HCl at 100°C for 2 h. The sample was subjected to HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. Elution was performed under isocratic conditions using 80% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluates were monitored by absorption at 195 nm. Three UV-absorbing peaks corresponding to the carrier sugar alditols were collected for radioactivity measurement by liquid scintillation counting. Linkage oligosaccharides were repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O with intermediate lyophilization. The 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Varian VXR-500 at a probe temperature of 26°C as described previously(23Yamada S. Yoshida K. Sugiura M. Sugahara K. J. Biochem. 1992; 112: 404-447Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The spectra of fractions 10 and 14 were also recorded at 15°C to prevent disturbance by the HOD response. Chemical shifts are given relative to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured indirectly relative to acetone (δ 2.225) in 2H2O(24Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The mass spectrometer used was a Hitachi liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer, M-1200H, equipped with a quadrupole mass filter with a nominal m/z limit of 2,000. Mass spectra were obtained using a pneumatically assisted electrospray ionization (ESI) method in aqueous 50% methanol solution in negative ion mode. The voltage applied on the ESI capillary was −2,700 volts, and the voltage between the first and the second apertures was −30 volts. The flow rate of the analyte solution was 0.05 ml/min. To investigate the structure of the carbohydrate-protein linkage region of dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, a peptidoglycan fraction was prepared from bovine aorta as reported previously(21Sugahara K. Takemura Y. Sugiura M. Kohno Y. Yoshida K. Takeda K. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The preparation was depolymerized completely by chondroitinase B as examined by gel permeation chromatography (data not shown), indicating the absence of chondroitin sulfate. Disaccharide analysis of the chondroitinase ABC digest of the peptidoglycan fraction by HPLC showed the ΔDi-4S component to be prevailing as expected for dermatan sulfate (Table 1). A significant amount of ΔDi-diSB, which may be associated with an anticoagulant activity, was also identified. The peptidoglycan fraction (100 mg, 1.1 μmol as serine) was reduced with alkaline NaBH4, and a small portion (1 mg) was treated separately with alkaline NaB[3H]4 to prepare tracers by radiolabeling the reducing ends of the polysaccharides. The nonlabeled (100 mg) and 3H-labeled reduced fractions (1 mg, 6.1 × 106 cpm) were isolated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50, mixed, digested exhaustively by chondroitinase ABC, and the digest was fractionated by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-2 column. In addition to the major UV-absorbing disaccharide fraction, the preceding radioactive fractions, presumed to contain linkage oligosaccharides, were observed and separated into three subfractions (Fig. 1). Fractions B-1, −2 and −3, which contained 31, 53, and 16% of the total radioactivity, respectively, were separately pooled and concentrated. In this study the major radioactive fraction, B-2, was used for isolation of the linkage oligosaccharides as described below. Most (∼70%) of the 3H label in fraction B-1 was associated with presumable internal oligosaccharides, which were generated probably as a result of an incomplete depolymerization by chondroitinase ABC, and were not investigated further. Most (∼90%) of the 3H label in fraction B-3 was recovered in a trisaccharide by HPLC, which was characterized as ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate)β1-4[3H]HexA-ol by enzymatic analyses in conjunction with HPLC, ESI mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. 3A. Ikegami, Y. Shibata, K. Yoshida, and K. Sugahara, unpublished results. It might have been produced by alkali-peeling degradation of the linkage region. Alternatively or in addition it could have been derived from the reducing termini of free glycosaminoglycan chains in the starting peptidoglycan preparation, which had been possibly generated by tissue endoglycosidase as discussed previously for similar sulfated trisaccharides isolated from various chondroitin/dermatan sulfate preparations including the one used in this study(21Sugahara K. Takemura Y. Sugiura M. Kohno Y. Yoshida K. Takeda K. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fraction B-2, which contained 1.26 μmol of oligosaccharides (as ΔHexA), was fractionated by HPLC (Fig. 2). Of the separated fractions, fractions 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17 were labeled with 3H, indicating that they probably contained oligosaccharide alditols derived from the linkage region (Table 2). In this study, the five major fractions 3, 8, 9, 10, and 14 were further purified by rechromatography, yielding 69, 57, 317, 47, and 131 nmol (as ΔHexA), respectively, per 100 mg of peptidoglycans. They represented 6.3, 5.2, 28.8, 4.3, and 11.9% of the total serine of the starting peptidoglycan preparation, respectively. Aliquots of the isolated fractions 3, 8, 9, 10 and 14 were acid hydrolyzed and subjected to xylitol analysis by HPLC, where xylitol was well separated from galactitol and galactosaminitol. The results showed that the main component in each fraction was xylitol, suggesting that fractions 3, 8, 9, 10, and 14 contained oligosaccharide alditols derived from the linkage region (Table 3). These fractions were next subjected to chondroitinase ACII digestion followed by HPLC analysis. Fractions 3, 8, and 9 were each degraded into equimolar amounts of an unsaturated disaccharide and the presumed common nonsulfated unsaturated tetrasaccharide alditol, ΔHexAα1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol (Fig. 3). The disaccharide components derived from fractions 3, 8, and 9 were ΔDi-0S (Fig. 3B), ΔDi-6S (Fig. 3C), and ΔDi-4S (Fig. 3D), respectively. These results indicate that fractions 3, 8, and 9 shared the common core hexasaccharide alditol ΔHexAα1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol containing an internal GlcA unit and that the GalNAc unit was nonsulfated in the compound in fraction 3 and sulfated at C6 and C4 in the compounds in fractions 8 and 9, respectively. These structures were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see below). Fraction 14 was partially (10%) degraded by chondroitinase ACII into ΔDi-4S and the presumed unsaturated tetrasaccharide ΔHexAα1-3Gal(4-sulfate)β1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol (data not shown), indicating that the structure of this minor component was most likely ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate)β1-4GlcAβ1-3Gal(4-sulfate)β1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol reported previously for chondroitin 4-sulfate from whale cartilage (16Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the major compound accounting for 90% of this fraction remained undigested, and fraction 10 was also resistant to chondroitinase ACII (data not shown), indicating that the structures of the compound in fraction 10 and of the major component in fraction 14 were clearly different from the hexasaccharide alditols isolated previously from the linkage region of chondroitin sulfate in terms of their sensitivity toward chondroitinase ACII. The results suggested that the internal uronic acid in fractions 10 and 14 was not glucuronic acid, but more likely iduronic acid. ESI/MS of underivatized fractions 10 and 14 were analyzed. Fraction 14 gave doubly charged ions [M-2H]2−, [M+Na-3H]2−, and [M+2Na-4H]2− at m/z 585, 596, and 607 as well as triply charged ions, [M-3H]3−, [M+Na-4H]3−, and [M+2Na-5H]3− at m/z 390, 397, and 404 (Fig. 4B). The singly charged ion [M-H]− was also observed at m/z 1,172. All these molecular ions corresponded to the approximate molecular weight of 1,173 of the compound in this fraction. Only a doubly charged ion [M-2H]2− was observed at m/z 546 for fraction 10 (Fig. 4A), which corresponded to the estimated molecular weight of 1,094 of the compound in this fraction. To determine the positions of the sulfate groups, aliquots of fractions 10 and 14 were subjected to chondro-4-sulfatase digestion followed by HPLC analysis. After a 1-h incubation, fraction 10 eluted at position a was partially degraded, giving rise to a degradation product at position b which accounted for 30% of fraction 10 used (Fig. 5A). After a 14-h incubation, it was completely converted to the compound at position b (Fig. 5B), corresponding to the authentic nonsulfated hexasaccharide alditol ΔHexAα1-3GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol. Thus, the compound in fraction 10 contained one sulfate group on C4 of either GalNAc or one of the 2 galactose residues. It is known that chondro-4-sulfatase acts on C4 of both GalNAc and the galactose substituted by GlcA in the linkage region(16Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Chondro-4-sulfatase treatment of fraction 14, which eluted at position c before digestion, resulted in two peaks after a 1-h incubation, one of which (43%) eluted at position d1 and the other (33%) at position d2 (Fig. 5C). When exhaustively treated, fraction 14 was completely converted to the compound at position d2, which seemed to correspond to position b (Fig. 5D). Position d1 was close to the elution position of fraction 10, indicating that the compound at position d1 was also a monosulfated hexasaccharide alditol. Thus, fraction 14 seemed to contain two sulfate groups on C4 of GalNAc and/or 2 galactose residues. It was noted that only one partially desulfated product was observed, suggesting that chondro-4-sulfatase acted sequentially by first removing one then the other sulfate group. It would appear that this enzyme acted preferentially on one of the two sulfate groups. Which sulfate group, however, remains to be determined. The results indicate that fractions 10 and 14 had the common hexasaccharide core structure ΔHexAα1-3 GalNAcβ1-4HexA1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol, with one or two sulfate groups on either C4 of GalNAc or galactose residue(s) underlined. To identify the internal hexuronic acid residue, the sensitivity of fractions 10 and 14 toward chondroitinase B was investigated. Fraction 14 was degraded into two products in equimolar amounts as detected by absorbance at 232 nm (Fig. 6A), while 3H radioactivity was found only in the faster eluting UV-absorbing peak (Fig. 6B), which corresponded to the position of authentic ΔHexAα1-3Gal(4-sulfate)β1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol. The nonradiolabeled peak coincided with authentic ΔDi-4S. Thus, the compound in fraction 14 most likely had the disulfated hexasaccharide alditol structure with iduronic acid at the internal position, ΔHexAα1-3GalNAc(4-sulfate)β1-4IdoAα1-3Gal(4-sulfate)β1-3Galβ1-4Xyl-ol. In contrast, fraction 10 was resistant to chondroitinase B digestion (data not shown). Fractions 3, 8, 9, 10, and 14 were analyzed by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Proton chemical shifts were assigned using two-dimensional HOHAHA and COSY analysis. The NMR data are summarized in Table 4. As presumed from the enzymatic analysis described above, the spectral data of fractions 3, 8, and 9 were in good agreement with those reported for Fr. A, B, and C, respectively, which were isolated previously from the linkage region of chondroitin 4-sulfate from whale cartilage(16Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, the structures of the compounds in fractions 3, 8, and 9 were confirmed to be identical to those from whale cartilage chondroitin 4-sulfate as follows. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of fraction 14 measured at 26°C is shown in Fig. 7. The inset is the spectrum recorded at 15°C to suppress the disturbance by HOD line. The resonances at δ 5.962 and 2.115 ppm are characteristic of the H-4 proton of ΔHexA (15Sugahara K. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol.

Accumulating evidence indicates that it may be an endogenous regulator of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release process mediated by ryanodine receptors(6Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B.

This has led to the recent proposal that cADPR may be involved in the signaling pathway mediated by nitric oxide(13Lee H.C. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 9: 134-138Google Scholar). Cyclic ADP-ribose high pressure liquid chromatography guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)-triphosphate. The cyclic structure of cADPR is formed by linking the adenine ring of NAD+ to the terminal ribose, displacing the nicotinamide group(2Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography showed that the linkage site is at N-1 of the adenine ring and the cycling glycosidic bond is in the β-conformation(3Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The structure of cADPR has been also confirmed by chemical synthesis(14Gu Q.-M. Sih C.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 7481-7486Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Detailed knowledge of the structure of the molecule provides rational approaches for synthesizing useful analogs. Indeed, a series of analogs with substitution at the 8-position of the adenine ring has been synthesized and shown to be antagonists of cADPR (15Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Among these, 8-amino-cADPR is the most potent and, at nanomolar concentrations, specifically inhibits the Ca2+ mobilizing effect of cADPR in vitro as well as in intact cells(16Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this study, we couple a photoactivatable group to one of the phosphates of cADPR. The product, caged cADPR, is biologically inactive until UV activation by photolysis of the caging group. The use of caged cADPR in vitro and in vivo are described. cADPR was synthesized by incubation of NAD+ with the Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase and purified by HPLC using an AG MP-1 column as described previously(9Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The purified cADPR (48 mg, 0.092 mmol) was dissolved in 3 ml of ice-cold E-pure water, and the resulting pH of the solution was 2.3. To this stirring solution was added 2-nitrophenethyldiazoethane (0.28 mmol, prepared as described in (17Walker J.W. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar)) in 3 ml of diethyl ether. The resulting biphasic mixture was vigorously stirred at 0−5°C in darkness for 3 h, during which the color of the diazoethane solution changed from amber to pale yellow. The ether layer was drawn off, and the diazoethane/ether treatment was repeated 3 more times. The aqueous portion was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (2 × 20 cm), and eluted with water; 2-ml fractions were collected. The caged product (silica gel RF 0.55, MeOH/CHCl3/H2O/HAc, 12.5:10:3.5:0.2) was isolated as a fluffy white powder after lyophilization of the combined product fractions (30 mg, 49%). Unreacted cADPR was also recovered (RF 0.13, 15 mg, 31%). The caged product could be efficiently photolyzed into free cADPR, even by a hand-held UV lamp as analyzed by thin layer chromatography. As described under “Results,” the caged product represented a mixture of two mono-caged isomers, which can be separated by anion exchange HPLC. For the unseparated product, the extinction coefficient at 259 nm was determined to be 17,200 using 0.8 mmol of the product dissolved in water: m.p. 186°C (decomposition); 1H NMR (Me2SO-d6) 9.1-8.6 ppm (m, 2), 8.0-7.5 ppm (m, 4), 6.1-5.8 ppm (m, 4), 5.5 ppm (m, 3), 4.9 ppm (m, 1), 4.5-3.8 ppm (m, 10), 1.65 ppm (m, 2), 1.50 ppm (dd, J = 18.4, 6.5 Hz, 1). Elemental analysis was performed by Desert Analytics (Tucson, AZ) based on the formula of mono-caged cADPR, C23H28N6O15P2•H2O. Homogenates of sea urchin egg (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) were prepared as described previously(1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen egg homogenates (25%) were thawed at 17°C for 20 min and diluted to 5% with a medium containing 250 mMN-methylglucamine, 250 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 units/ml creatine kinase, 8 mM phosphocreatine, 0.5 mM ATP, and 3 μM fluo-3, pH 7.2, adjusted with acetic acid (GluIM). The homogenates were diluted to 2.5% and finally 1.25% with the medium described and were incubated at 17°C for 1 h between dilutions. Ca2+ release was measured spectrofluorimetrically in 1.25% homogenates with an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. The measurements were done in a cuvette maintained at 17°C, and the homogenates were continuously stirred. The volume of homogenate used was 0.2 ml, and the additions were usually made in 2-μl volumes. All results described are representative of at least three similar experiments. Lytechinus pictus eggs were used for the microinjection experiments. The procedures for microinjection by pressure were as described previously(16Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 18Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Ca2+ changes in the injected eggs were measured using fluo-3. Samples were dissolved in the injection buffer containing 0.5 M KCl, 50 μM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, pH 6.7. The numbers of eggs injected and the statistics of the results are described in the text. Activation of caged cADPR in egg homogenates was achieved in a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter (S-2000) by alternating the excitation wavelength every 2 s between 350 nm for photolysis and 490 nm for monitoring fluo-3 fluorescence. Photolysis of caged cADPR in individual eggs was performed by modifying the epifluorescence attachment of a Nikon inverted fluorescence microscope. A second mercury lamp was attached at 90° to the epifluorescence tube. The light of 300-400 nm for photolysis was selected with a UG1 filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and reflected 90°, first with a 400 DCLP dichroic filter and then directed toward the objective with a second BCECF Sp dichroic filter. For monitoring the fluo-3 fluorescence, 490-nm light from the first mercury lamp was selected with a 485DF22 filter. The excitation light passed through the same 400 DCLP dichroic filter and was reflected by the BCECF Sp dichroic filter toward the objective. The fluo-3 fluorescence was selected by a long pass filter with a 500-nm cutoff and monitored by a SIT camera. This optical arrangement allowed simultaneous measurement of fluo-3 fluorescence during photolysis. HPLC separation was done with columns packed with the AG MP-1 resin (Bio-Rad) and eluted with a nonlinear gradient of trifluoroacetic acid similar to that described previously(2Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Caged cADPR was dissolved in Me2SO-d6 and analyzed with a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer (Bruker AM400). The novel cyclic structure of cADPR may sometimes convey the false impression of fragility, but, in fact, it is a very stable molecule. The half-time of hydrolysis at pH 2.0 is about 24 h even at 37°C, and it is several days at room temperature(2Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1164: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The stability of cADPR allows the use of the procedure developed by Walker et al.(17Walker J.W. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar) for coupling caging groups to molecules containing phosphate, since it requires incubation at acidic pH for an extended period. The caged cADPR synthesized was a mixture of two forms that could be separated by anion exchange HPLC (Fig. 1). After exposing the caged cADPR mixture to 350-nm UV light in a spectrofluorimeter for 2 h, the peaks corresponding to the two caged forms decreased and a single peak corresponding to cADPR appeared. The time course of the uncaging process is shown in the inset. Since the efficiency of uncaging of the two forms appeared to be equal and both were converted to cADPR, the caged cADPR mixture was used in this study without further purification. In principle, two caging groups could be attached to cADPR, producing bis-caged cADPR. The two forms of caged cADPR separated by HPLC as shown in Fig. 1 could represent mono-caged and bis-caged cADPR. However, several lines of evidence indicate clearly that the caged cADPR synthesized contained only a single caging group. First, the measured extinction coefficient of 17,200 M−1 cm−1 at 259 nm agrees well with the 17,500 M−1 cm−1 determined for mono-caged ATP(17Walker J.W. Reid G.P. McCray J.A. Trentham D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7170-7177Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 19Haugland R.P. Molecular Probes Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 1992-1994; : 182Google Scholar). Bis-caged product would be expected to have extinction coefficient about 5,000 M−1 cm−1 higher at the same wavelength. Second, elemental analyses indicate that the caged cADPR contained 38.42% carbon, which is much closer to the 39.05% calculated for hydrated mono-caged product than the 43.42% calculated for the bis-caged form. Finally, the integration of the 1H NMR resonances in D2O also indicates mono- rather than bis-caged products. Table 1 compares the measured ratios of protons in various resonance groups with the calculated values for both mono- and bis-caged products. The number of aryl (Ar) and the adenine (Ad) protons were obtained from integrating the NMR resonances between 9.1 and 7.2 ppm(2Lee H.C. Walseth T.F. Bratt G.T. Hayes R.N. Clapper D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1608-1615Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kaplan J.H. Forbush III, B. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1929-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Similarly, the anomeric (An) and benzylic (CH) protons were obtained from integrating 6.8 to 5.7 ppm, while the methyl (Me) protons of the caging group were from 2.0 to 1.5 ppm. Table 1 shows that the integration ratios of all three regions match those calculated for mono- rather than bis-caged product. Therefore, the two forms separated by HPLC as shown in Fig. 1 most likely represent isomers of mono-caged cADPR. Fig. 2 shows the proposed structure of caged cADPR and illustrates possible mono-caged products that can result from reacting the caging diazoethane with cADPR. Alkylation could occur at either of the two phosphate groups giving rise to constitutional isomers. Also, since each phosphorous is a chiral center and a new chiral center is created at the benzylic position of the caging group upon alkylation of a phosphate, various stereoisomers could be formed. Finally, the orientation of the methyl group in the caging moiety, represented by the wavy bond shown in Fig. 2, can also result in stereoisomers. These various isomers are, however, functionally equivalent since, as shown in Fig. 1, the two forms of caged cADPR can be uncaged with similar efficiency and both regenerate cADPR after uncaging; no further attempt was made to characterize the two forms.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 2The proposed structure of mono-caged cADPR. The chemical structure of cADPR was derived of x-ray crystallography(3Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nature Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Possible isomers of mono-caged cADPR include those with the caging group, (2-nitrophenyl)ethyl, on either of the two phosphates and those with a different orientation of the methyl group (denoted by a wavy line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 shows that adding caged cADPR to egg microsomes did not produce any Ca2+ release. Uncaging with UV light resulted in Ca2+ release after a delay. The release was due to cADPR since addition of an antagonist, 8-amino-cADPR(15Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), during the Ca2+ release immediately stopped the release process and the Ca2+ was resequestered. In the presence of 8-amino-cADPR, uncaging cADPR with UV light did not produce any Ca2+ release. Also shown in Fig. 3 is a control experiment using caged ATP having an identical caging group (Molecular Probes Inc., OR). Caged ATP did not produce any Ca2+ release before or after uncaging with UV light. Therefore, the Ca2+ release observed with caged cADPR was not due to artifacts of exposure to UV or biproducts of the uncaging reaction. The uncaging efficiency was assessed in experiments shown in Fig. 4. The response of egg homogenates to cADPR was first calibrated with the addition of increasing concentrations of cADPR as shown in Fig. 4A. Under constant UV illumination, Ca2+ release activity of caged cADPR was similarly tested as shown in Fig. 4B. Comparing the Ca2+ release, it can be seen that uncaging 10 μM of caged cADPR produced as much Ca2+ release as about 100 nM of cADPR, indicating the efficiency of uncaging is about 1%. The low efficiency is most likely due to the low UV intensity of the light source used in the spectrofluorimeter. The fact that relatively low concentrations of caged cADPR were needed and that a readily available instrument like a spectrofluorimeter was sufficient for photolysis illustrates the usefulness of the caged product. The dependence of the wavelength of the UV light for uncaging is shown in Fig. 5. Shorter UV light was more efficient in uncaging than longer wavelength UV light; not only did the maximal Ca2+ release increase, but the time it took to achieve maximal release was also shorter. The inset of Fig. 5 shows that the effects of wavelength on both the maximal Ca2+ release and the time to maximum Ca2+ release appear to level off for light shorter than about 320 nm. This may be because of the reduction in UV light intensity due to absorption by proteins. Fig. 6 shows that the expected Ca2+ increase can be induced by photolyzing caged cADPR in intact sea urchin eggs. Ca2+ changes in the egg were monitored with the indicator fluo-3, which was co-injected with caged cADPR into the egg. Exposure to UV induced Ca2+ release after a slight delay, which is indicated by a 3-fold increase in fluo-3 fluorescence. The average fluorescence increase was 3.3 ± 1.0-fold (S.E.) measured in 10 eggs injected with 2.3 ± 0.7 μM caged cADPR (Table 2). The time delay between the start of UV exposure and reaching the maximal fluo-3 fluorescence was 44.5 ± 14.1 s (n = 10, S.E.). Also shown in Fig. 6 is the absence of Ca2+ change in a control egg injected with the same concentration of caged ATP, indicating the Ca2+ changes observed with caged cADPR were not due to UV exposure or the biproducts of photolysis. In addition to inducing Ca2+ changes, uncaging also induced the cortical reaction, another index of Ca2+ mobilization. The micrographs in Fig. 6 show an egg injected with caged cADPR before and after UV exposure. After about 20-30 s of UV exposure, a fertilization membrane is formed surrounding the whole egg. The cortical reaction was induced by photolysis in 11 out of 12 eggs injected with 0.2-5.5 μM caged cADPR. As a control, 10 eggs were injected with 1.9-7.2 μM caged ATP, and none of them underwent a cortical reaction after photolysis. These results show that the caged cADPR can also be effectively uncaged inside live cells.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab As shown in Table 2, Ca2+ mobilization as indicated by the increase in fluo-3 fluorescence was lower when induced by photolyzing caged cADPR than following fertilization or activation by direct injection of saturating concentrations of cADPR. The time it takes for the fluorescence to reach maximum (tmax) following uncaging (44 s) was comparable with fertilization (63 s) but was slower than that induced by direct injection of cADPR (9 s). The apparent inefficiency of caged cADPR was mainly due to the barrier filter required for simultaneous measurement of the fluo-3 fluorescence during uncaging, which significantly reduced the UV intensity for uncaging. The cortical reaction following egg activation is another index for Ca2+ mobilization that can be measured without the filter. With the removal of the filter, proper alignment of the light source, and a new mercury light bulb, the time needed to achieve full cortical reaction after turning on the UV excitation for uncaging was reduced to 13 s (Table 2), which is comparable with the 9 s measured by direct injection of saturating concentrations of cADPR. It is expected that the time delay can be further reduced with the use of quartz optics to increase transmittance of UV light. Shown also in Table 2 is that the time required to achieve full cortical reaction following fertilization was about 41 s. It is clear that Ca2+ mobilization in sea urchin eggs occurs with a time scale of seconds and that comparable kinetics can be achieved by activation with caged cADPR. Cyclic ADP-ribose is a new cyclic nucleotide whose discovery was not anticipated. The novelty of the discovery necessitates extraordinary measures to establish the authenticity of its Ca2+-mobilizing activity. The first evidence was that it can induce desensitization, ruling out Ca2+ contamination in the sample as a possible artifact(1Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was further supported by the fact that its biological effect can be heat-inactivated(18Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We next synthesized a series of antagonists that can block both the specific binding of cADPR to its microsomal receptor as well as its Ca2+ mobilizing activity(15Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this study, we synthesized caged cADPR and demonstrated, in vitro as well as in vivo, that it is biologically inactive until photolysis. Together, these results definitively establish the authenticity of the Ca2+-mobilizing activity of cADPR. Another main advantage of the caged cADPR is its remarkable efficiency. Photolysis can be conveniently induced by readily available instruments such as a spectrofluorimeter or an epi-fluorescence attachment. Because these instruments are not specially optimized for uncaging, the kinetics of activation by photolysis were found to be somewhat slower than direct injection of saturating concentrations of cADPR itself. However, comparable rates can easily be achieved by removal of a barrier filter in the optical setup. Indeed, the uncaging efficiency of caged cADPR appears to be better than, or at least comparable with, other caged compounds. For example, egg activation induced by caged GTPγS requires 30 s of UV exposure(21Rakow T.L. Shen S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9285-9289Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is anticipated that with proper optimization and the use of high UV intensity flash lights, photolysis of caged cADPR can be achieved in a sub-second time scale. The availability of caged cADPR should eliminate some common problems encountered in investigating Ca2+ mobilization induced by cADPR. For example, Ca2+ leakage during microinjection could be mistaken as Ca2+ release activated by cADPR. With caged cADPR, Ca2+ release is induced by UV photolysis, thus eliminating the possible injection artifact. Similarly, Ca2+ contamination in the sample can easily be recognized since, with caged cADPR, no Ca2+ changes should be observed without photolysis. Also, the use of caged cADPR may provide alternative approaches for introducing cADPR into cells other than by microinjection. For example, cells can be loaded with caged cADPR and an indicator (e.g. fluo-3) by transient permeabilization using procedures such as electroporation or scrape-loading(22Doxsey S.J. Sambrook J. Helenius A. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Viable cells containing the indicator can easily be identified. After resealing and recovery, photolysis can then be used to regenerate cADPR in these cells, and the resultant Ca2+ changes can be monitored by the indicator. Finally, the increase in hydrophobicity due to the caging group could increase permeability of caged cADPR to cells. Once the cells are loaded, cADPR can be generated, at any time, by exposure to UV. With focused laser light, this can even be accomplished at localized regions anywhere inside large cells, such as sea urchin eggs. Therefore, caged cADPR should be a valuable tool for investigating the temporal as well as spatial aspects of Ca2+ mobilization induced by cADPR. We thank Robert Swezey for convincing one of us (H. C. L.) of the feasibility of synthesizing caged cADPR and Richard Graeff and Timothy Walseth for critical reading of the manuscript."

This multisubunit enzyme is responsible for acidification of endosomal (1Galloway C.J. Dean G.E. Marsh M. Rudnick G. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1986; 854: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) compartments, contributing to cellular processes such as protein transport and degradation. In specialized cell types such as the osteoclast (4Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Ghiselli R. Gluck S. Science. 1989; 245: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) or renal intercalated cell(5Gluck S. Kelly S. Al-Awqati Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9230-9233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the V-ATPase secretes acid from the cell in a vectorial manner by polarization of the enzyme to a specific membrane domain.The overall structure of the V-ATPase appears similar to that of the F0-F1 ATPases in that the enzyme has a “studlike” or “peg” shape, with the head forming a catalytic cytoplasmic domain, while the stem attaches to a membrane-spanning domain forming a proton channel. The catalytic domain contains a Mr = 70,000 or “A” subunit, the site of ATP hydrolysis, and a Mr = 56,000 or “B” subunit whose precise function is unknown. Three copies of each polypeptide assemble to form the head structure(6Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although two A subunit isoforms have been identified in plants(7Starke T. Linkkela T.P. Gogarten J.P. Z. Naturforsch. 1991; 46c: 613-620Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), until recently, only one mammalian form of the A subunit was thought to exist. This form is ubiquitously expressed in all tissue types examined, and cDNA clones have been isolated by our laboratory and others(8Pan Y.-X. Jin S. Strasser J.E. Howell M. Dean G.E. FEBS Lett. 1991; 247: 147-153Google Scholar, 9Marushack M.M. Lee B.S. Masood K. Gluck S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F171-F174PubMed Google Scholar, 10Puopolo K. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Forgac M. J.

Richener H. Evans D.B. Green J.R. Bilbe G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7075-7080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA hybridization analysis of multiple mammalian tissues revealed no expression of this form in tissues other than the osteoclastoma.The Mr = 56,000 or B subunit family includes at least two members whose cDNAs have been isolated by our laboratory and others(12Südhof T.C.

One of these, the B2 or “brain” isoform, is expressed at moderate to high levels in all tissues studied, while the B1 or “kidney” isoform is amplified in kidney cortex and medulla, with lower levels of expression in most other tissues. While different B isoforms predominate in different tissues(14Nelson R.D. Guo X.-L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 3696-3706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not yet clear if these isoforms vary in function.Of the transmembrane polypeptides, a cDNA clone has been obtained only for the Mr = 15,000 subunit, a proteolipid thought to be the major structural component of the transmembrane proton channel(16Nelson H. Nelson N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Gillespie G.A.J. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Weinstat-Saslow D. Reeders S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4289-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although immunoprecipitation of V-ATPase reveals the presence of multiple low molecular weight polypeptides that may also reside in the membrane(18Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that six proteolipid polypeptides assemble to form the transmembrane channel (6Arai H. Terres G. Pink S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8796-8802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The function of other subunits of the mammalian V-ATPase in catalysis has not been established. Those subunits for which cDNA clones have been isolated include the E (Mr = 31,000) (19Hirsch S. Strauss A. Masood K. Lee S. Sukhatme V. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3004-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and the C (Mr = 44,000) (20Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Miedel M. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20390-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) subunits. Immunologic evidence exists for heterogeneity of the E subunit(21Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); only a single form of the C subunit has been reported(20Nelson H. Mandiyan S. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Miedel M. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20390-20393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that while the C subunit enhances activity of the V-ATPase, it is not required for enzyme activity(22Puopolo K. Sczekan M. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5171-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although gene deletion studies of the homologous subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicate that the subunit is essential(23Ho M.N. Hill K.J. Lindorfer M.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An integral membrane protein of Mr = 95,000-120,000 has been copurified with the V-ATPase from some mammalian, plant, and yeast cell extracts (reviewed in (24Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Jones E.W. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 105-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Mutation of the gene for this subunit in Saccharomyces results in loss of bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity and proton transport. However, a requirement for the Mr = 95,000-120,000 subunit may not be universal among all species. Active V-ATPase isolated from mammalian kidney (18Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Golgi-enriched membranes lack this subunit(25Young G.P. Qiao J.Z. Al-Awqati Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 18445-18450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The role of V-ATPase subunits in the amplification and targeting of the enzyme is less clear. V-ATPase expression is greatly amplified in a cell-specific manner in several types of renal tubular epithelial cells, allowing them to transport hydrogen ion efficiently. We showed recently that individual B subunit isoforms are highly amplified in specific kidney cell types present in different segments of the nephron (14Nelson R.D. Guo X.-L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 2R. Nelson, D. Underhill, P. Hmiel, and S. Gluck, submitted for publication. Such variations in V-ATPase composition and abundance among different cell types suggest that the expression of V-ATPase subunits may be under tissue-specific control mechanisms, allowing each subunit to be amplified or suppressed as required in different cells. We were therefore interested to identify a model that would allow us to examine how such regulation of V-ATPase subunits occurs and found that cells of the monocytic lineage increase their expression of V-ATPase during their differentiation into macrophages.Macrophages and other cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system perform several functions that require a high degree of V-ATPase expression. Mature macrophages develop a large reserve of lysosomes, required for intracellular digestive processes, that are acidified by a V-ATPase (reviewed in (27Gabig T.G. Babior B.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1981; 32: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)). Macrophages utilize a plasma membrane V-ATPase, in part, to regulate their intracellular pH in acidic environments(28Swallow C.J. Rotstein O.D. Grinstein S. J. Surg. Res. 1989; 46: 588-592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The osteoclast, a cell type closely related to the macrophage, exhibits amplified expression of the V-ATPase at its ruffled membrane upon attachment to bone(4Blair H. Teitelbaum S. Ghiselli R. Gluck S. Science. 1989; 245: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), creating an acidic resorptive space required for digestion of bone mineral and matrix proteins (reviewed in (30Baron R. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 20: 109-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)).To investigate expression of the V-ATPase in differentiating macrophages, we have studied both human peripheral blood monocytes and a related cell line, THP-1. The human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, has recently come into use as a model for monocyte-macrophage differentiation (reviewed in (31Auwerx J. Experientia. 1991; 47: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar)). Like their more widely used counterparts, HL-60 and U-937, THP-1 cells may be induced to differentiate toward a macrophage-like state by culture with phorbol esters(32Tsuchiya S. Kobayashi Y. Goto Y. Okimura H. Nakae S. Konno T. Tada K. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1531-1536Google Scholar). The THP-1 line, however, is thought to mimic more closely monocyte-derived macrophages in expression of oncogenes and membrane proteins(31Auwerx J. Experientia. 1991; 47: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar).We have examined V-ATPase subunit expression during monocytic differentiation and present evidence for both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms. We show that increased expression of the B2 subunit isoform is mediated primarily at the level of transcription. We have isolated B2 gene fragments containing the first exon and 5′-flanking region and present an initial characterization of the promoter elements responsible for transcriptional control.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsUnless otherwise indicated, all reagents were obtained from Sigma and were reagent grade.Isolation and Culture of CellsPeripheral blood monocytes were isolated by countercurrent elutriation(33Bauer J. Hannig K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 112: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained by culturing purified monocytes on plastic Petri dishes in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) with 12.5% human AB serum (North American Biologicals, Inc., Miami, FL), 2 mML-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. THP-1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, and were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mML-glutamine, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin in a 5% CO2 incubator. THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate by addition of 160 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Upon addition of TPA, THP-1 cells, which are propagated in suspension, stop dividing, become adherent, and differentiate to a macrophage-like state. The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in modified Eagle's medium with Earle's salts, 10% fetal calf serum, and 20 μg/ml gentamicin.AntibodiesMonoclonal antibody E11 was used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot detection of the V-ATPase E (Mr = 31,000) subunit(21Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-peptide rabbit antiserum rB1-CT was utilized for detection of the B1 isoform subunit.2 The B2 isoform was detected with rabbit antiserum rB2-NT, derived to a fusion protein construct encompassing the N-terminal 120 amino acid residues added to the carboxyl terminus of the Escherichia coli maltose binding protein.2ImmunoprecipitationFor metabolic labeling of monocytes or macrophages, one 100-mm tissue culture plate of cells was incubated with 100 μCi of Tran35S-label (ICN) in 4 ml of methionine-free medium overnight. 1 × 106 human peripheral blood monocytes or macrophages were solubilized by 14 passes through a motorized Teflon-glass homogenizer (Wheaton, Millville, NJ) in solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mM sodium azide, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS). Insoluble material was pelleted at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, and H+-ATPase complexes were precipitated from the supernatant using monoclonal antibody E11 coupled to protein A-Sepharose as described previously(18Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 2-h incubation at 4°C, the E11-coupled beads were pelleted briefly in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with ice-cold Net-gel buffer(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.26-18.75Google Scholar). The supernatants from the first immunoprecipitations were removed to separate tubes, and a second precipitation was performed to verify quantitative recovery of V-ATPase complexes. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE gel-loading buffer, and one-third of each sample was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, treated in Fluorohance (RPI, Mount Prospect, IL), and juxtaposed to film.ImmunoblotsFor whole cell extracts, 0.5 × 106 human peripheral blood monocytes or macrophages were solubilized by heating for 10 min at 95°C in SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer, and samples were applied directly to lanes of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C in blocking solution(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.26-18.75Google Scholar). Primary antibody E11, as tissue culture supernatant, or rB1-CT or rB2-NT antiserum diluted 1:300 in blocking solution, was incubated with the membranes for 2 h at room temperature. Following washing of the membrane using standard conditions, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated with the membrane(34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.26-18.75Google Scholar), and bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL reagents and protocol from Amersham Corp.cDNA Probes and AntibodiesA 1.1-kb cDNA clone for the human V-ATPase Mr = 15,000 (proteolipid) subunit was the kind gift from S. Reeders (Harvard University). A 0.27-kb ApaI-EcoRI fragment from the 3′ end of this clone was used as a probe for RNA hybridization (Northern) analysis, while the intact cDNA in a pBluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a probe for the nuclear runoff assay. The cDNA for the human E subunit was isolated as reported previously(21Hemken P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length 1.3-kb fragment in pBluescript was used for the nuclear runoff assay, while a 0.43-kb EcoRI-KpnI fragment from the 5′ end was used for the RNA hybridization analysis. A cDNA clone for the human V-ATPase B1 (kidney) isoform cDNA was isolated by polymerase chain reaction from a human kidney cDNA library (a generous gift from Dr. Graham Bell, University of Chicago) using oligonucleotides derived from the published sequence(12Südhof T.C. Fried V.A. Stone D.K. Johnston P.A. Xie X.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6067-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A 400-base pair fragment from the 5′ end was used directly for RNA hybridization analysis, and was subcloned into pBluescript for the nuclear runoff analysis. A cDNA clone for the human V-ATPase B2 (brain) isoform encompassing the start codon was isolated previously(14Nelson R.D. Guo X.-L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). From this clone, a 0.56-kb EcoRI-ClaI fragment from the 5′ end was used for both RNA hybridization and nuclear runoff analysis. Although the cDNA clones for the B1 and B2 subunit isoforms are highly homologous in some internal regions(14Nelson R.D. Guo X.-L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3541-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the 5′ regions used here as isoform-specific probes exhibit an identity of only 65%, and therefore specific hybridization to a single isoform was easily attained under high stringency conditions. A 2.5-kb partial cDNA clone for the human V-ATPase A subunit was also isolated in this laboratory. 3M. Marushack, B. S. Lee, and S. L. Gluck, unpublished data. This clone, which extends from nucleotide 840 in the coding region to the poly(A) tail, was used directly for RNA hybridization and was subcloned into pBluescript for the nuclear runoff assay. A cDNA probe for the human enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), was used for normalization of mRNA levels in the RNA hybridization analysis.Densitometry of the autoradiograms was performed with a Hoefer Scientific (San Francisco, CA) model GS300 scanning densitometer in transmittance mode connected to a Spectra-Physics SP4270 integrator.Isolation of RNA and Hybridization AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was isolated from cells by treatment with guanidinium and acid-phenol(35Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62993) Google Scholar). Poly(A)-selected mRNA was prepared with a FastTrack commercial isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), using the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was electrophoretically separated in a formaldehyde-containing agarose gel under standard conditions, and was transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-a-Gene random priming labeling kit from Promega (Madison, WI), and were allowed to anneal bound RNA using a hybridization solution recommended by the manufacturers of Nytran. Final washes of the membrane prior to exposure to film were usually in 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 55°C, unless specified otherwise in the text.Nuclear Runoff AnalysisPreparation of THP-1 nuclei and radiolabeling of nascent transcripts were performed as described by Greenberg(36Greenberg M.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1987: 4.10.1-4.10.8Google Scholar). Radiolabeled RNA was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate acid-phenol method described above. Concentrations of radiolabeled RNA samples from different time points were adjusted to equal counts/min and were added to nylon membranes to which 10 μg of linearized denatured plasmid containing the appropriate cDNA probe had been applied in a slotted filtration manifold (Bio-Rad). Hybridization and washing of the membrane strips were performed as described by Greenberg(36Greenberg M.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1987: 4.10.1-4.10.8Google Scholar).Southern Analysis, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and DNA SequencingDNA hybridization (Southern) analysis was performed by standard procedures. Following electrophoretic separation of DNA, the DNA fragments were transferred to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a Vacu-Blot vacuum transfer apparatus (Hoefer). Hybridization of 32P-labeled probes to membrane-bound DNA was performed under standard conditions(37Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1987: 2.10.1-2.10.16Google Scholar). Final washes of the membrane prior to exposure to film were usually in 0.2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 55°C, unless specified otherwise in the text.The B2 subunit cDNA probe used in these studies for library screening and Southern hybridization was an 85-bp PCR-amplified cDNA spanning the region from −29 to +56 with respect to the translational start site. The oligonucleotides designed to amplify this region were 18 mers of the sequences 5′-GCTGGGCCAGTCGGGACA-3′ (sense direction) and 5′-ACGGGTAGCTCGGGTGCG-3′ (antisense direction). This probe was amplified from 50 ng of a B2 subunit cDNA clone 4B. S. Lee and S. L. Gluck, unpublished data. derived from a human fetal brain library (Clontech). PCR was performed under standard conditions using the following cycling temperatures and times: 94°C, 40 s; 58°C, 1 min; 72°C, 40 s. After 30 cycles, the product was run in 2.0% low melting-point agarose. The gel slice was excised and melted, and PCR was performed from 5 μl of the gel slice as above, except 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mM) were added to the reaction mixture. After 15 cycles, the product was purified over a Sephadex G-50 spin column for use in hybridization.DNA sequencing was performed using the TaqTrack sequencing system from Promega. Gene-specific oligonucleotides were used to prime sequencing extension reactions, and the sequencing ladder was visualized by incorporation of 35S-dATP into the extended products.Isolation of Promoter Fragments1 × 106 plaques from a WI38 human lung fibroblast genomic DNA λ phage library (courtesy of V. Sukhatme, Harvard University) were screened with an 85-bp PCR-amplified cDNA probe corresponding to a 5′ region of the B2 subunit mRNA (described above). Hybridization and washing conditions were the same as those described for Southern analysis, above. Following two rounds of screening, two λ clones were isolated. From one of these, two overlapping subclones, pBSL217 and pBSL220 were isolated. Further details are described in the text.Primer Extension and Ribonuclease Protection AssaysA commercial kit (Promega) was used for the primer extension analysis. Eight micrograms of total cellular RNA from resting or induced THP-1s were annealed with either of two 32P-end-labeled antisense primers: 5′-ATCTTGTCTCCTCTGTCC-3′ (+2 to −16); or 5′-ACGGGTAGCTCGGGTGCG-3′ (+56 to +39). The primer extension reactions were performed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extension products were separated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 1 × TBE (0.09 M Tris borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) as a buffer, and using 32P-labeled φX174-HinfI fragments as markers. The gel was fixed in 25% ethanol, dried, and exposed to film. Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using the RPA II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 0.5-1.0 μg of poly(A)-selected mRNA from TPA-induced THP-1s or 293 cells were hybridized overnight at 45°C with a 32P-labeled RNA probe made using a Riboprobe (Promega) transcription system and T7 RNA polymerase. The probe contained 222 bp of 5′-untranslated and flanking regions (between a NarI site at −96 and an MluI site at −317) plus 33 bp of pBluescript polylinker. Following RNase digestion according to the manufacturer's protocol, protected fragments were separated in a 6% polyacrylamide gel with 1 × TBE buffer. The gel was fixed in 25% ethanol, dried, and exposed to film.Promoter Fusion ConstructsFor construction of promoter-luciferase fusion plasmids, the 5′-flanking regions from pBSL217 and pBSL220 were first spliced together in pBluescript at a common SpeI site. The resulting plasmid, pBSL222, contained approximately 4.5 kb of B2 subunit 5′-flanking region plus 30 bp of coding sequence. From this spliced promoter region, smaller fragments were isolated and cloned into pGL2-basic (Promega) upstream of the luciferase coding sequences.Transfection of CellsFor optimal transfection efficiency, cells were cultured at a density of 2-5 × 105/ml, and were grown continuously for no more than 6 weeks. Transfections of THP-1 cells were performed essentially as described by Mackman et al.(38Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Each 100-mm plate of cells was transfected with 5 μg of the test plasmid and 2 μg of pRSVcat as an internal control. Forty-six h after transfection, cultures were divided in half, and each half was incubated an additional 5 h in the presence or absence of 160 nM TPA.293 cells were transfected by the method of calcium phosphate precipitation(39Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Each 100-mm plate (at about 80% confluence) was incubated overnight with a buffered calcium phosphate mixture containing 5 μg of the test plasmid and 2 μg of pRSVcat. The medium was changed the following morning, and after an additional 24 h, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 160 nM TPA for 5 h.Luciferase and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase AssaysCell extracts for luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity measurements were prepared by standard procedures(40Kingston R.E.

Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was measured by a modification of the two-phase diffusion assay of Neumann et al.(41Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar), except the final reaction mixture contained 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mM chloramphenicol, 30 μM acetyl-CoA, and 0.4 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA (ICN, 5-15 Ci/mmol).Luciferase activity was measured in an Optocomp II luminomet"

PDBu (100 nM) caused a time-dependent decrease in the steady-state levels of m2 receptor mRNA and in specific [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine binding. Preincubation with the PKC inhibitor GF-109203X inhibited the reduction in M2 receptor and mRNA levels induced by PDBu, confirming the involvement of PKC. Chronic PDBu treatment also caused desensitization of the receptor as forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, inhibited by carbachol in control cells, was lost upon treatment with PDBu for 24 h. Co-incubation with PDBu and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, inhibited PDBu-mediated reduction of m2 receptor mRNA, indicating new protein synthesis is required for down-regulation. Half-life studies using the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D suggested that the stability of the m2 receptor mRNA was not altered by PDBu treatment (t1/2 = 2 h). Nuclear run-on assays showed a 50% reduction in the rate of m2 receptor gene transcription after treatment with PDBu for 12 h. In conclusion we have provided evidence for heterologous regulation of m2 receptor gene expression through changes in gene transcription resulting in uncoupling of M2 receptors. Furthermore, the synthesis of an unidentified factor is required for the down-regulation process. m2 muscarinic receptor gene expression was investigated following stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) with the phorbol ester 4β-phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) in HEL 299 cells.

Results from these experiments suggest that, in the unlabeled triplex, the preferred orientation of the third strand is parallel to the purine strand of the duplex. DNA triple helix formation has been the focus of much attention recently in terms of its potential use as a method for selective regulation of gene expression(1Helene C. Anticancer Drug Des. 1991; 6: 569-584PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides can inhibit protein synthesis in several different ways. In the antisense strategy, an oligonucleotide binds to a targeted mRNA molecule in a sequence-specific manner to prevent subsequent translation of the message into protein. Alternatively, binding of an oligonucleotide directly to a gene or gene promoter, via triplex formation, can arrest or block transcription. The process of down-regulating gene expression through triple helix formation is referred to as the antigene strategy. Triple helix formation has also been utilized in the development of artificial nucleases, created by tethering a cleaving agent to a triplex-forming oligonucleotide(2Strobel S.A. Dervan P.B. Science. 1990; 249: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Strobel S.A. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Riba L. Housman D.E. Dervan P.B.

This leads to breaks in double-stranded DNA at very specific sites. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using oligonucleotides in gene regulation(5Duval-Valentin G. Thuong N.T. Helene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 6Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Kessler D.J. Murphy M. Jayaraman K. Zendegui J.G. Hogan M.E.

Several properties need to be better understood in order to design optimally effective therapeutic agents based on triplex formation. These include sequence specificity of triplex formation, stability of the complex formed, delivery of the oligonucleotide into cells, and resistance of the oligonucleotides to endogenous nucleases. The primary requirement for triple helix formation is a homopurine-homopyrimidine sequence in the target duplex. Typically, the third strand sequence is also homopurine or homopyrimidine. Depending on the nature of the third strand, there are two main categories of triple helices: pyrimidine∗ purine∗pyrimidine (pyr∗pur•pyr) or purine∗purine•pyrimidine (pur∗pur•pyr), where ∗ represents Hoogsteen base pair formation between the third strand and the purine strand of the duplex and • denotes the Watson-Crick base pair of the duplex. Most studies to date have focused on pyr∗pur•pyr triplexes. This type of triplex is more stable at low pH because the cytosines on the third strand require protonation in order to form Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds with the purine strand of the duplex. In contrast, pur∗pur•pyr triplexes are stable at neutral pH. Thermal denaturation studies on pur∗pur•pyr triplexes often reveal a single transition, suggesting the simultaneous dissociation of all three strands(8Pilch D.S. Levenson C. Shafer R.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In most examples of pyr∗pur•pyr triplexes, a biphasic transition is observed, with the third strand dissociating at a lower temperature than the duplex(9Pilch D.S. Brousseau R. Shafer R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5743-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10Plum G.E. Park Y.W. Singleton S.F. Dervan P.B. Breslauer K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This suggests that a pyrimidine third strand may be less stable, in general, than a purine third strand. Unlike the Watson-Crick base-paired double helix, in which the two strands are bound antiparallel to each other, the third strand of a triple helix can be either parallel or antiparallel with respect to the purine strand to which it is hydrogen-bonded. The polarity of the third strand in the triplex is dependent on the sequence as well as the base composition(13Sun J.S. Helene C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 345-356Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 14Thuong N.T. Helene C. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 666-690Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar). A homopyrimidine third strand containing cytosine and/or thymine binds to the purine strand in a parallel orientation. The binding of a homopurine oligonucleotide to the purine strand depends on the sequence. Experimental evidence has been reported for both parallel (15Ouali M. Letellier R. Sun J.S. Akhebat A. Adnet F. Liquier J. Taillandier E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4264-4270Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and antiparallel (16Chen F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4472-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) orientations of the third strand in triplexes composed solely of G∗G•C triplets. But if the third strand contains both Gs and As, the polarity of the third strand will be antiparallel with respect to the purine strand(8Pilch D.S. Levenson C. Shafer R.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Beal P.A. Dervan P.B.

However, there have been only a limited number of physical studies on triplexes formed by such sequences. Helene and co-workers (13Sun J.S. Helene C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 345-356Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 20Sun J.S. De Bizemont T. Duval-Valentin G. Montenay-Garestier T. Helene C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1991; 313: 585-590PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the orientation of a G, T third strand depends on its sequence. Calculations indicate that, for a 10-mer triplex whose third strand is composed of equal number of G and T bases (with corresponding G and A bases in the purine strand of the target duplex), the third strand will be antiparallel to the duplex purine strand if there are three or more GpT or TpG steps; otherwise it will be parallel. According to the calculations of Sun and Helene(13Sun J.S. Helene C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 345-356Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar), this can be explained in terms of a balance between the preference for the parallel orientation (Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding) in an all G third strand and the better tolerance for the lack of isomorphism between G∗G•C and T∗A•T triplets in the antiparallel orientation (reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding). Radhakrishnan et al.(21Radhakrishnan I. de los Santos C. Patel D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1403-1418PubMed Google Scholar) carried out NMR studies on an intramolecular triplex composed of a third strand containing Gs and one T. These studies provided clear evidence for the distortion induced by insertion of a T∗A•T triplet within a stack of G∗G•C triplets. In earlier studies, we have targeted the d(G3A4G3)• d(C3T4C3) for triple helix formation with either d(C3T4C3), to make a pyr∗pur•pyr triplex(9Pilch D.S. Brousseau R. Shafer R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5743-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), or with d(G3A4G3), to make a pur∗pur•pyr triplex(8Pilch D.S. Levenson C. Shafer R.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We have recently described the Fourier transform infrared spectrum of the pyr/pur∗pur•pyr intermolecular triplex d(G3T4G3)∗d(G3A4G3)•d(C3T4C3) (22Dagneau C. Liquier J. Scaria P.V. Shafer R.H. Taillandier E. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Proceedings of the Eighth Conversation, State University of New York, Albany NY. Adenine Press, Schenectady, NY1994: 103-111Google Scholar). Here we employ UV, CD, gel electrophoresis, and NMR to further characterize this triplex. While results from fluorescence energy transfer experiments are inconclusive regarding the orientation of the third strand relative to the purine strand of the duplex, UV melting analysis of fluorescently labeled triplexes suggests that the preferred orientation of the third strand is parallel to the purine strand of the duplex in the unlabeled triplex. Oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized using standard phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated DNA synthesizer as described earlier(8Pilch D.S. Levenson C. Shafer R.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The deprotected oligonucleotides were extensively dialyzed against 1 mM Tris-HCl with several changes of buffer over a period of 2-3 days. The purity of the resulting oligonucleotides was checked by NMR and gel electrophoresis and found to be greater than 95%. Molar extinction coefficients of various oligonucleotides in 1 mM Tris-HCl were determined by phosphate analysis(23Griswold B.L. Humoller F.L. MacIntyre A.R. Anal. Chem. 1951; 23: 192-194Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the concentration of the stock solutions was determined using the following values: d(G3A4G3): ∊255 = 11500 cm−1(mol of base)−1L; d(C3T4C3): ∊271 = 8300 cm−1(mol of base)−1L; d(G3T4G3): ∊256 = 9900 cm−1(mol of base)−1L; d(T2C3T4C3T2): ∊269 = 8500 cm−1(mol of base)−1L. All experiments were carried out in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl with 50 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.4. Duplex and triplex samples were prepared by mixing the oligonucleotides at appropriate ratios in the desired buffer, followed by heating at 80°C for about 5 min and cooling slowly to room temperature. The samples were equilibrated at 5°C overnight before use. Labeled oligonucleotides were synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry on ABI 394 DNA synthesizers. The 3′-labels were coupled to oligonucleotides prepared using the 3′-DMT-C6 amine-ONTM controlled pore glass (Clontech). The 5′-carboxytetramethlyrhodamine was added to a 5′-aminohexyl-derivatized oligonucleotide (Glen Research). All amino oligonucleotides were ion-exchanged to their lithium salts by precipitation from ethanol-acetone as described previously(24Levenson C. Chang C. Innis M.A. Sinsky D.H. White T.J. PCR Protocols: a Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 99-112Google Scholar). The crude, derivatized oligonucleotides were dissolved in sodium carbonate buffer (0.25 ml, 0.1 M, pH 9.0) and treated with 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Applied Biosystems, 3 μl in Me2SO) or Malachite Green isothiocyanate (1 mg in 50 μl of dry N,N-dimethylformamide, Molecular Probes). After coupling overnight at room temperature, the oligonucleotides were again precipitated as their lithium salts from ethanol-acetone. The oligonucleotides were resuspended in triethylammonium acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0, buffer A), filtered, and purified by reverse-phase HPLC 1The abbreviation used is: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. on a Waters 996 Diode Array Detector system with a Hamilton PRP-1 column (300 × 7 mm) using a gradient of 0-40% acetonitrile in buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. high performance liquid chromatography. The 5′-Malachite Green oligonucleotides were made directly on the DNA synthesizer using a leuco-Malachite Green phosphoramidite, details of which will be published elsewhere. 2S. G. Will and D. Knowles, manuscript in preparation. The oligonucleotides were coupled to the Malachite Green amidite using normal activation and oxidation steps. On removal from the instrument, the synthesis columns were treated with a solution of freshly prepared iodosobenzene in dichloromethane (0.01 M, 30 s) and washed with more solvent and air-dried. The derivatized controlled pure glass was treated with ammonia for 4 h at 55°C, then the supernatants were passed through NAP-10 columns (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnol), and the desired oligonucleotides were purified by reverse phase-HPLC as described above. The UV absorbance and melting studies were carried out on a Gilford 2600 UV/Vis spectrophotometer equipped with a Gilford 2527 thermoprogrammer or on a Cary 3 spectrophotometer. UV melts were done with a heating rate of 0.25 or 0.3 deg/min. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J500A spectropolarimeter using cells of 0.1-, 1.0-, or 10-mm optical pathlength, with temperature controlled by an external circulating water bath. CD spectra reported are the average of eight scans. CD melting experiments were done by manually changing the temperature of the bath and letting it equilibrate at the desired temperature for 5 min. The cell temperature was monitored by attachment of a microprobe directly onto the sample cell. The ellipticity data were collected at various wavelengths, and each point on the melting curve represents the average of 100 readings taken over a period of 100 s. Mixing curves were constructed from data obtained from the CD spectra of samples containing varying mole ratios of duplex and the third strand, with the total concentration of the duplex plus the third strand held constant. Thermodynamic parameters for the formation of the triplex were estimated from the concentration dependence of the thermal melting temperature of the triplex in the concentration range 10 to 850 μM. Since the two transitions were well separated from each other over a wide concentration range, we were able to follow the concentration dependence of each transition separately. Assuming a two-state model for each transition, we analyzed the biphasic melting curves according to the procedure described by Pilch et al.(9Pilch D.S. Brousseau R. Shafer R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5743-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) using the equation, 1/Tmax = (R/ΔH°)lnC + (ΔS° - 0.188R)/ΔH° for each individual transition. ΔH° and ΔS° are the enthalpy and entropy changes, respectively, associated with the respective structural transitions, Tmax is the temperature corresponding to the maximum of the dA/d(1/T) plot derived from the melting curves, where A is the absorbance, C is the total concentration of the d(G3T4G3) strand (which is equal to the total concentration of each of the other two strands), and R is the gas constant. ΔH° and ΔS° were calculated from the slope and intercept of the straight lines obtained by fitting the data points on 1/Tmaxversus lnC plots by linear regression. The UV melting curves used for the thermodynamic analysis were obtained at a heating rate of 0.25°/min; a window of ± 2°C was used for calculating the derivative. The reversibility of the transitions was checked by heating the sample at 1°C/min up to 90°C followed by cooling at the same rate. No hysterisis was observed in the melting curves showing that the equilibrium is maintained at each point on the melting curve. Gel electrophoresis was carried out under non-denaturing conditions in 15% polyacrylamide gels containing acrylamide and bis(acrylamide) in a 29:1 ratio, cast in 90 mM Tris-borate and 50 mM MgCl2. Samples for electrophoresis were prepared in 90 mM Tris-borate and 50 mM MgCl2 and were diluted into loading buffer containing 90 mM Tris-borate, 50 mM MgCl2, and 5% Ficoll, so that the final concentration ranged from 50 to 60 μM in single strand, duplex, or triplex. Then, 40 μl of each sample were loaded into the wells, and electrophoresis was carried out in buffer containing 90 mM Tris-borate and 50 mM MgCl2, in the cold room (4°C) or at room temperature (25°C) at about 7 V/cm for 24 h. Gels were then visualized by UV shadowing on a fluorescent background and photographed. Proton NMR spectra of the samples were recorded at 500 MHz on a General Electric spectrometer (GN-500) equipped with an Oxford Instruments magnet and a Nicolet 1280 computer. Spectra of the samples were taken in aqueous solutions containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0-50 mM MgCl2, and 85% H2O, 15% D2O, at 5 or 20°C. MgCl2 titrations were carried out by adding aliquots of MgCl2 into samples containing the duplex and the third strand in equimolar ratios (1 mM each) dissolved in the buffer. After each addition of MgCl2, the samples were heated at 80°C for 5 min and cooled. The spectra were acquired using a T331 pulse sequence for solvent suppression, with a pulse repetition time of 5 s and interval delay of 109 μs. We have shown previously that the oligonucleotide d(G3T4G3), used here as the third strand for triplex formation, can, in the presence of monovalent cations such as Na+ or K+, self-associate to form a quadruplex structure(25Scaria P.V. Shire S.J. Shafer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10336-10340Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This quadruplex structure can be eliminated by dialysis against 1 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Tris, a bulky cation, does not promote quadruplex formation of d(G3T4G3), nor do the concentrations of Mg+2 used in this study to stabilize the triplex (data not shown). A 1:1 mixture of d(G3T4G3) and the duplex, at typical UV concentrations, shows a melting profile similar to that of the duplex and to that of the d(G3A4G3)∗d(G3A4G3)•d(C3T4C3) triplex, composed of a single transition occurring at a temperature corresponding to the melting temperature of the duplex. However, melting curves for d(G3T4G3)∗d(G3A4G3)•d(C3T4C3) measured at higher concentrations reveal the presence of a broad transition at lower temperature, well below the duplex melting temperature (see below). This low temperature transition represents the dissociation of the third strand from d(G3T4G3)∗d(G3A4G3)•(C3T4C3) and was investigated by additional techniques, such as CD and gel electrophoresis, in order to further characterize this change in conformation. As mentioned above, UV melting curves showed evidence of a low temperature transition only at DNA concentrations higher than those typically used in spectrophotometric studies. Hence, we initiated CD studies at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mM in either single strand, duplex, or triplex. Fig. 1 shows the CD spectra of d(G3T4G3) alone, the d(G3A4G3)•d(C3T4C3) duplex, the duplex and the third strand in a 1:1 ratio, all at the same concentration and in buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl and 50 mM MgCl2, along with the mathematical sum of the spectra of the duplex and d(G3T4G3). It is apparent that the CD spectrum of the mixture of duplex and d(G3T4G3) is very different compared to that of the sum of the duplex and the third strand spectra, especially in the long and short wavelength regions. The spectrum of the mixture has three large negative bands centered at 277, 240, and 210 nm, and a positive band around 260 nm. The mathematical sum of the spectra of the duplex and the third strand has no negative band in the 277 and 210 nm regions. The large differences observed in these two spectra clearly indicate interaction between the duplex and the third strand to form the triplex and hence the CD spectrum of the mixture represents the spectrum of the triplex (see below). Thermal denaturation of the d(G3T4G3)∗d(G3A4G3)• d(C3T4C3) triplex was studied by temperature induced changes in the CD spectrum at the same high oligonucleotide concentrations. Fig. 2a shows a typical thermal denaturation profile of the triplex monitored by CD changes at 240 and 277 nm. As the temperature increases, the ellipticity values at the two wavelengths also increase, except for a small decrease at high temperature for the 277 nm band. The change in ellipticity with temperature is biphasic and cooperative for both wavelengths, with the two transitions centered around 38 and 60°C. It is evident from Fig. 2a that the low temperature transition is most readily followed at 277 nm while the high temperature transition is best monitored at 240 nm. Fig. 2b shows the CD melting profile of the duplex at the same two wavelengths. The duplex shows only one transition around 60°C. The ellipticity at 277 nm does not show any cooperative change in the lower temperature region, where the triplex shows a large change. As in the case of the triplex, however, the temperature profile shows a relatively small but cooperative decrease in ellipticity around 60°C. The 240-nm melting curve is also monophasic, with a transition at the same temperature. Hence the transition that occurs around 38°C for the triplex is due to the dissociation of the third strand from the triplex while that at 60°C is due to the dissociation of the duplex into single strands. The differences in the CD spectra elicited by the binding of d(G3T4G3) to the duplex were utilized to construct a mixing curve that provides further evidence for complex formation between the duplex and the third strand and also determines the stoichiometry of the complex formed. Fig. 3 presents the mixing curve for the binding of d(G3T4G3) to the duplex monitored by the CD changes associated with complex formation for the 277 nm band. The titration of the third strand into the duplex was carried out by varying the mole ratio of the duplex and the third strand, keeping the total concentration, duplex plus third strand, constant. The discontinuous change in slope in the mixing curve observed when the mixture contains equal amounts of the duplex and the third strand demonstrates that the stoichiometry of the complex formed is 1 duplex/1 strand of d(G3T4G3). UV melting studies of the triplex showed a marked dependence of the melting temperature on the concentration of the triplex. The concentration dependence of the biphasic melting curves was thus analyzed in order to estimate the thermodynamic parameters for these structural transitions. Fig. 4 shows the dependence of the melting temperature on oligonucleotide concentration, plotted in terms of 1/Tmaxversus lnC for both transitions. The first transition, the dissociation of the d(G3T4G3) strand from the underlying duplex, is more sensitive to the concentration than the second transition, which corresponds to the dissociation of the duplex. The following thermodynamic parameters, relating to formation of the triplex, were obtained from the slope and intercept of the plots in Fig. 4: ΔH° = −19.8 ± 2 kcal/mol and ΔS° = −47 ± 5 cal/mol-deg. The low value of ΔH° is reflected in the large slope observed for the 1/Tmaxversus lnC curve for the first transition. The enthalpy change obtained for triplex formation is less than that reported for triplexes formed by the binding of an all purine or all pyrimidine third strand to the same underlying duplex (8Pilch D.S. Levenson C. Shafer R.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Pilch D.S. Brousseau R. Shafer R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5743-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and presumably reflects the presence of a mixed purine/pyrimdine third strand. The thermodynamic parameters for dissociation of the underlying duplex were similar to those reported earlier(8Pilch D.S. Levenson C. Shafer R.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6081-6088Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Pilch D.S. Brousseau R. Shafer R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5743-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern of d(G3A4G3), d(G3T4G3), d(C3T4C3), duplex, and 1:1 mixture of the duplex and d(G3T4G3), all under triplex forming conditions at 4°C (Fig. 5a) and 25°C (Fig. 5b). Lanes 1-3 contain the oligonucleotides d(G3A4G3), d(C3T4C3), and d(G3T4G3), respectively, which run as single bands. Lane 4, containing d(G3A4G3) and d(C3T4C3) in equimolar amounts, again shows a single band due to formation of the d(G3A4G3)•d(C3T4C3) duplex, which possesses a mobility similar to that of the single-stranded oligonucleotides d(G3A4G3) and d(G3T4G3). The single strand d(C3T4C3) migrates faster than the other two oligonucleotides. Lane 5 shows the migration of the sample containing a mixture of all the three oligonucleotides in 1:1:1 ratio. At 4°C, this lane shows a new band that migrates significantly more slowly than the duplex or any of the three oligonucleotides. This new band corresponds to the triplex, which, as one would expect, migrates more slowly than any of the other species. Under the same buffer and salt conditions but at 25°C, this band has disappeared, indicating that the triplex is unstable at this temperature. The single band observed in lane 5 at 25°C is slightly broadened due to comigration of the dissociated third strand with the duplex. This experiment clearly demonstrates the dissociation of the third strand from the triplex at a temperature considerably lower than the duplex dissociation temperature, in accord with the UV and CD melting profiles. We have employed one-dimensional imino proton NMR spectra as a direct probe for monitoring base triplet formation. Fig. 6 shows the exchangeable proton region of the NMR spectrum of the triplex and that of the mixture of the non-interacting duplex and third strand. The imino proton region in the absence of MgCl2 gives a spectrum identical to that of the duplex alone (data not shown). Addition of Mg2+ to the mixture results in the appearance of new resonances accompanied by substantial broadening of all signals. These new peaks arise from hydrogen bonding interactions between the third strand and the purine strand of the duplex. At 20°C, the temperature at which the spectra in the Fig. 6 were recorded, CD melting studies suggest that the triplex may not be completely formed. Lowering the temperature resulted in considerable line broadening, rendering the spectrum essentially unusable for further analysis. In an effort to sharpen the NMR lines, we designed another triplex in which the pyrimidine strand has two extra thymines at each end, the other two strands being same as in the original triplex. With this “overhang” triplex, d(G3T4G3)∗d(G3A4G3)• d(TTC3T4C3TT), we were able to reduce the temperature and maintain reasonably narrow line widths for the imino proton peaks. Fig. 7 provides a comparison of the spectra obtained for this triplex with that of the “blunt end” triplex, d(G3T4G3)∗ d(G3A4G3)•d(C3T4C3), at 5°C. The blunt end spectrum is very broad and featureless whereas the overhang spectrum has fairly well resolved peaks. In this case, the addition"

Since the γ chain is indispensable for T cell growth and development, its expression could be one of important steps critical for regulation of both differentiation in the T cell development and activation in the T cell response. It is thus intriguing to see the mechanism by which the expression of the γ chain is regulated. In this study, to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of the γ chain gene expression, we examined function of the transcriptional regulatory region of the γ chain gene in response to T cell stimulants. Our results illustrate that the regulatory region contains elements positively responsive to TPA, Tax, and PHA and negatively responsive to IL-2. MOLT4, TL-OmI, Jurkat, MT-1, MT-2, ILT-Mat, TCL-Kan, and HUT 102 are human T cell lines. Jurkat αβ-17 is a subline of Jurkat, which constitutively expresses IL-2 receptor from the exogenously introduced cDNA for the α and β chains with the endogenous γ chain. The IL-2 receptor on Jurkat αβ-17 binds IL-2 with a high affinity, which can mediate internalization of IL-2 and tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-2 receptor β and γ chains. JPX-9 is a transformant of Jurkat expressing inducibly Tax from pMAXRHneo-1(33Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y.

PBL was cultured with 1 μg/ml PHA (Difco) and recombinant IL-2 (500 pM, Ajinomoto, Tokyo) in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. Raji, BALL-1, RAMOS, and LCL-Kan are human B cell lines. YT-C3 is a human natural killer cell line. M-TAT is a human megakaryoblastic cell line. K562, EoL-3, HL-60, and THP-1 are human myelomonocytic cell lines. These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa, a human epithelial cell line, was grown in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% calf serum. A reporter plasmid, PGV-B (Toyo Ink, Tokyo) was used to measure the promoter activity of the human IL-2 receptor γ chain gene. Another luciferase vector, pSV2-Luc, served as a positive control(35Shibata K. Muraosa Y. Tomita Y. Tagami H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20584-20588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase expression vector, pRSV-β gal, was used for the internal reference except for the experiment with TPA(35Shibata K. Muraosa Y. Tomita Y. Tagami H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20584-20588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pMAXRHneo-1 is a metallothionein promoter-directed HTLV-I Tax expression vector, and pMAXRHneo/M expresses an inactive mutant Tax(33Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Nagata K. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1589-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Tax and mutant Tax were induced in Jurkat cells with CdCl2 for 16 h. A human genomic library in EMBL 3 was obtained from Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. The library was screened with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe encompassing human IL-2 receptor γ chain (whole) cDNA(4Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed as previously described(36Miura S. Ohtani K. Numata N. Niki M. Ohbo K. Ina Y. Gojobori T. Tanaka Y. Tozawa H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1313-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Five positive clones were rescreened with a double strand 25-mer oligonucleotide probe, which was labeled at the 5′ termini with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham, United Kingdom) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. One out of five, γ-5, was positive. The nucleotide sequence has been given the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank accession number D16358. The nucleotide sequence was determined by the dideoxy termination method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.) using synthetic primers as previously described (36Miura S. Ohtani K. Numata N. Niki M. Ohbo K. Ina Y. Gojobori T. Tanaka Y. Tozawa H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1313-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture contained 1 ng of template DNA, 100 pM oligonucleotide primers, 200 μM dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in reaction buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.01% (w/v) gelatin). The reaction was carried out with a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) for 25 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 56°C for 2 min, and polymerization at 72°C for 3 min. The 633-bp HindIII-HaeII fragment of γ-5 was inserted into the SmaI site of PGV-B. The resultant plasmid carrying the fragment in the sense orientation was named pPBγ600 and in the antisense orientation pPBAγ600. A series of 5′-deletion mutants of the IL-2 receptor γ chain promoter was constructed by PCR (Fig. 4). Amplification of the promoter sequences was performed between a synthesized oligonucleotide primer for the 3′-end of the promoter, 3P (TTGCTCTTCATTCCCTGGGTGTAGT), and one of following synthesized oligonucleotide primers for the truncated 5′-ends of the promoter: 5P-398 (CTTTGACAGAGATTTAAGGGTGACC), 5P-161 (AGCACCTAATCTCCTAGAGACTTA), 5P-116 (ATTTGCCACACCCTCTGTAAAGCCC), 5P-91 (TGGTTATAAGGTTCTTTCCACCGG), 5P-80 (GTTCT TCCACCGGAAGCTAGACAGAGGA), and 5P-58 (AAGAGGAAACGTGTGGGTGGGGA). A substitutional mutation in pPBγ80cc was introduced by PCR amplification between primer 5P-80M (GTTCTTCCACCCCAAGCTAGACAGAGGA) and 3P. The amplified fragment between 5P-80M and 3P was used to generate the other substitutional mutants, pPBγ398cc and pPBγ161cc, along with 5P-398 and 5P-161, respectively. The amplified PCR products were subsequently cloned into the SmaI site of PGV-B. All newly constructed plasmids were verified by sequencing. Total RNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate method as previously described(36Miura S. Ohtani K. Numata N. Niki M. Ohbo K. Ina Y. Gojobori T. Tanaka Y. Tozawa H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1313-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed through a 1.0% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde and blotted onto Hybond-N nylon membranes. After UV cross-linking with Stratalinker (model 1800, Stratagene), the membranes were hybridized with the full-length cDNA probe, washed twice in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 30 min, and exposed using an imaging plate. The imaging plate was subjected to a bio-image analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo). The synthetic oligonucleotides, GPE1 and GPE2 (Fig. 2 C), were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 37°C. Poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) was purified from MOLT4 and HeLa cells by two rounds of chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) as previously described (36Miura S. Ohtani K. Numata N. Niki M. Ohbo K. Ina Y. Gojobori T. Tanaka Y. Tozawa H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1313-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and incubated overnight at 37°C with 105 cpm of the primers in hybridization buffer (0.167 M Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, and 0.3 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)). After ethanol precipitation, the precipitate was resuspended in 25 μl of reverse transcriptase mix (3.5 μl of 4 mM dNTPs, 1 μl of RNAsin (50 units/μl, Takara, Kyoto, Japan), 2.5 μl of 10 × reverse transcriptase buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 M KCl, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), and 18 μl of H2O), and then 40 units of murine mammary tumor virus reverse transcriptase were added. The samples were incubated for 90 min at 42°C, treated with 20 μg/ml pancreatic ribonuclease-A for 30 min at 37°C, and precipitated and resuspended in TE buffer. The samples were subsequently electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel with 7 M urea with sequencing ladders generated with the same primers. Supercoiled plasmid DNA was transfected into 5 × 106 cells of Jurkat, Jurkat αβ-17, and THP-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as previously described(33Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Noda T. Ito Y. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Saito S. Nagata K. Sugamura K. Hinuma Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1589-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640. Plasmid DNA in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (DEAE-dextran stock solution, 5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) was mixed with the cell suspension, and the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Na-heparin (1 unit/ml in RPMI 1640) (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was then added. The cells were cultured for 40 h at 37°C. PHA (1 μg/ml), TPA (5 ng/ml or 1 ng/ml), or a combination of these reagents were added to the culture 12 h after transfection. Treatment with Cd2+ ion was performed for 16 h by adding indicated concentrations of CdCl2. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of 25 mM Tris-phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100. Soluble extracts were prepared by centrifugation (800 × g for 5 min) and assayed for the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities(35Shibata K. Muraosa Y. Tomita Y. Tagami H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20584-20588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The luciferase assay was performed with a PicaGene™ assay kit (PGK-L100; Toyo Ink). Light intensity was measured by Lumat (LB9501, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Luciferase activity was expressed as light intensity after correction of transfection efficiency by the β-galactosidase activity(35Shibata K. Muraosa Y. Tomita Y. Tagami H. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20584-20588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Relative luciferase activity was expressed as values of ratio compared with the light intensity of pPBAγ600. The protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and used for normalization of the luciferase assays. The luciferase assay results shown in figures are representative of experiments independently repeated at least 3 times. Various cells including normal and PHA-activated peripheral blood leukocytes were examined for the γ chain expression by the Northern blot analysis. In addition to lymphoid lineage cell lines (MOLT4, Jurkat, MT-1, MT-2, ILT-Mat, and Raji) previously tested (4Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar), the other hematopoietic cell lines (HUT102, BALL-1, RAMOS, LCL-Kan, TCL-Kan, YT-C3, M-TAT, K562, EoL3, and HL-60) expressed at least the 1.8-kilobase transcript from the γ chain gene (Fig. 1). The 3.6-kilobase message hybridized with the γ chain probe was seen with PHA-PBL, MOLT4, Jurkat, LCL-Kan, YT-C3, and M-TAT. Among hematopoietic lineage cell lines tested so far, THP-1 was exceptional; it did not show any appreciable expression of mRNA for the γ chain (Fig. 1). No expression of the γ chain mRNA was seen with glioma (Onda11, U-251MG, and Hs683), neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH), epithelial (HeLa), hepatocytic (HepG2), and fibroblastic (WI-38 and Detroit 532) cell lines (data not shown). A human PBL genomic library in EMBL 3 was screened with the full-length cDNA probe. Finally, one clone obtained, γ-5, was analyzed in terms of physical mapping (Fig. 2A). The clone encompasses the exon containing the ATG codon and approximately the 5.0-kilobase non-coding upstream region. To identify the transcription initiation site of the γ chain gene, we carried out primer extension by using mRNA from MOLT4 cells with a 32P-labeled primer, GPE1. Electrophoresis of synthesized cDNA revealed three major fragments of 91, 95, and 97 bp, indicating the transcription initiation sites at A nucleotides 32, 36, and 38 bp upstream from the ATG codon (Fig. 2B). The same result was obtained with a different primer, GPE2 (data not shown). These transcription initiation sites were identical to those previously observed(37Noguchi M. Adelstein S. Cao X. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No primer-extended product was seen with mRNA from HeLa and primer GPE1 (Fig. 2B). The 633-bp HindIII-HaeII fragment of the γ-5 clone had seven nucleotides different from those in the previous report (37Noguchi M. Adelstein S. Cao X. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). A region upstream of the transcriptional initiation sites contains several sequences similar to previously identified transcription regulatory elements: four P.U.1 recognition sites (two GAGGAA at −468 and −55 and two inverted complementary sequences, TTCCTC at −581 and −541)(38Klemsz M.J. Mckercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), one PEA-3 site (ACACTTCCT at −545)(39Gutman A. Wasylyk B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), one TATA-like sequence (TTTATAA at −88), and one Ets binding site (CCGGAAGC at −70) (44Tanimura A. Teshima H. Fujisawa J.-I. Yoshida M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5375-5382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the promoter ability, the HindIII-HaeII fragment was ligated to the luciferase gene in PGV-B, generating pPBγ600. The luciferase activity in Jurkat introduced with pPBγ600 was profoundly higher than that in the same cells transfected with pPBAγ600 carrying the HindIII-HaeII fragment in an antisense orientation, which gave a background level of the luciferase activity as low as that with the promoterless, enhancerless PGV-B plasmid (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the 633-bp HindIII-HaeII fragment contains the basic promoter and probably other regulatory elements. To clarify those elements, a series of mutants of the fragment was examined for their transcriptional activities. A fragment deleted up to nucleotide position −398 (pPBγ 398) exhibited 60% of the luciferase activity with the HindIII-HaeII fragment, the −161 (pPBγ161), −116 (pPBγ116), and −91 (pPBγ 91) mutants exhibited approximately 25, 12, and 30%, respectively, and the −80 mutant (pPBγ 80) exhibited 28% (Fig. 4). pPBγ 80 and pPBγ 91 reproducibly exhibited higher luciferase activity than pPBγ116. The other mutant fragment carrying up to nucleotide position −58 (pPBγ 58) showed the activity indistinguishable from the background activity with PGV-B. These data suggest that there are two positively regulatory regions (−600 to −161 and −80 to +35) and probably a negatively regulatory region (−161 to −116). Although the endogenous γ chain expression was not detected on THP-1, pPBγ600 exhibited significant luciferase activity in THP-1 (Fig. 3). The γ chain promoter contains a TATA-like sequence, TTTATAA, at −88. To assess the activity of the TATA-like sequence, we introduced a substitutional mutation in the sequence, in which TTTATAA was converted to TTGCTAA named pPBγ91 gc. Jurkat transfected with the construct gave the same luciferase activity as the parental reporter plasmid, pPBγ91 (Fig. 4). The result suggests that the TATA-like sequence, TTTATAA, does not have the conventional activity as a TATA-box in this gene. Based on the above studies, the basic promoter activity is obviously present in the region downstream from −80, which contains one GT box and two consensus sequences for the c-ets family, the Ets binding site at −70, and the P.U.1 site at −55. The transcription factors belonging to the c-ets family regulate transcriptional initiation from a variety of cellular and viral gene promoter/enhancer elements(45Karim F.D. Urness L.D. Thummel C.S. Klemsz M.J. Mckercher S.R. Celada A. Beveren C.V. Maki R.A. Gunther C.V. Nye J.A. Graves B.J. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1451-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To determine the functional significance of the Ets binding site at −70, we constructed substitutional mutants of the Ets binding site, pPBγ398cc, pPBγ161cc, and pPBγ80cc. The mutant plasmids have two nucleotide substitutions in the core motif of GGAA yielding CCAA. All of the substitutional mutants showed the background luciferase activities (Fig. 4). Taking into account the lack of the basal promoter activity with pPBγ 58, which contains putative one P.U.1 box and GT box, the region from −80 to −58, carrying the putative Ets binding sequence, is essential for the basal promoter activity of the human IL-2 receptor γ chain gene. TPA, an activator of protein kinase C, leading to the activation of the AP-1 and κB sites, is reported to enhance expression of the IL-2 gene and IL-2 receptor α chain gene(20Ballard D.W. Böhnlein E.

Science. 1989; 244: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Jurkat and THP-1 introduced with pPBγ600 were treated with TPA. Interestingly, despite the absence of typical TPA-responsive element in the cloned HindIII-HaeII fragment, TPA strikingly enhanced transcriptional activity in both cell lines (Fig. 5A). To confirm the enhancing effect of TPA, we further examined expression of the endogenous γ chain mRNA in Jurkat and THP-1. The level of γ chain mRNA in Jurkat increased within 3 h after exposure to TPA, reached a maximum at 12 h, and decreased (Jurkat, Fig. 5B). The increases were 2.3-fold by the densitometric analysis. Little, if any, effect of TPA on endogenous expression of the β chain was seen with Jurkat (data not shown). Even though THP-1 did not endogenously express mRNA for the γ chain, TPA treatment induced the γ chain expression (THP-1, Fig. 5B). Expression of the γ chain was induced within 3 h, increased in a time-dependent manner, and reached a maximum level at 48 h after TPA exposure. To identify a TPA-responsive region in the γ chain promoter, luciferase assays were performed in Jurkat transiently transfected with different constructs, pPBγ600, and a series of the 5′-deletion mutants, pPBγ398, pPBγ161, pPBγ116, pPBγ91, pPBγ80, and pPBγ58. The five constructs, pPBγ600, pPBγ398, pPBγ161, pPBγ116, and pPBγ91 showed 7.3-8.2-fold increase in the luciferase activities in response to TPA (Fig. 6A). pPBγ80 showed 5.4-fold induction of the luciferase activity in response to TPA, whereas 4.0-fold induction was seen with pPBγ58. PGV-B showed little or no increase. These results suggest that complete TPA-responsive elements are present downstream from nucleotide position −91. Similar experiments were carried out to examine effect of PHA on the γ promoter activity in Jurkat cells. Cells transfected with pPBγ600 were cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml PHA. The transcriptional activity of the HindIII-HaeII fragment was slightly enhanced by treatment with PHA"
https://openalex.org/W2037338173,"Transcription of the luteinizing hormone receptor gene is dependent on Sp1-induced promoter activation from two Sp1 binding domains (Sp1<sub>2</sub> and Sp1<sub>4</sub>) within the 173-base pair promoter. Of the two Sp1 binding domains, the canonical GC box (GGGCGG) was determined by mutation to be the binding element for only the Sp1<sub>2</sub> domain. The Sp1 binding element within the Sp1<sub>4</sub> domain was identified by mutation and immunological/competition studies as the 5′-GGG GTG GGG that conforms to a Zif-268 like three zinc finger binding domain, rather than the canonical 3′ Sp1<sub>4</sub> GC box (GGGCGG). The guanines in the third trinucleotide (GGG GTG G<i>GG</i>) were not required for Sp1 binding, although they increased binding affinity. Non-Sp1 protein(s) bind the 3′ Sp1<sub>4</sub> GC box, and by themselves exhibit transcriptional activity. Tissue specific differences were localized to this non-Sp1 binding domain, which functionally substituted for the downstream activating M1 regulatory domain in non-expressing but not in expressing cells. Mutations of both non-Sp1 and M1 domains were required for inhibition of promoter activity in constructs that retained the Sp1 binding elements in non-expressing cells, indicating that together these domains may play a role in regulation of luteinizing hormone receptor gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2090371338,"The capacity of antisense sequences to the thrombin receptor to selectively inhibit thrombin receptor expression and limit mitogenic responses in vascular wall cells was investigated in vitro. Eight phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides based on the sequences of the rat thrombin receptor (including sense, antisense, scrambled, and missense controls) were synthesized, characterized, and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN 4) inhibitory effect was sequence-specific and both time- and concentration-dependent. A reduction in serum or α-thrombin-induced smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation was noted as early as 3 days at 30 μM (82%; 6.17 ± 1.01 versus 34.08 ± 3.89 × 104 cells/well; p < 0.05) and at a dose as low as 15 μM after 4 days in culture (19%; p < 0.05). Nonspecific effects were enhanced after prolonged exposure of SMC to the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (≥6 days). A reduction of inositol phosphate generation greater than 50% (p < 0.05) was detected after exposure of SMC to antisense but not to sense or scrambled nucleotide sequences. This was observed after stimulation with both thrombin and SFFLRN (thrombin receptor peptide agonist). Northern blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed 50 and 22% decreases, respectively, in thrombin receptor mRNA and protein (cell surface) levels in antisense oligonucleotide-treated (72 h) SMC as compared to untreated cells, suggesting that thrombin receptor down-regulation occurred at the pretranslational level. Thus, thrombin receptor-specific antisense sequences inhibit growthrelated effects both of serum and thrombin on smooth muscle cells, potentially providing a new strategy for selective inhibition of receptor-mediated arterial injury responses.

In support of a role for thrombin in vascular lesion formation, Okazaki et al.(5Okazaki H. Majesky M.W. Harker L.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have reported that thrombin, but not other vasoactive agonists or growth factors, produces a pattern of transiently increased platelet-derived growth factor-A and decreased platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells both in vitro and in vivo, a pattern similar to that observed after vascular injury. Finally, a number of in vitro and in vivo studies have documented smooth muscle proliferation following thrombin exposure(6Graham D.J. Alexander J.J. J. Vasc. Surg. 1990; 11: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Herbert J.M. Lamarche I. Dol F.

Teuscher E. Voigt B. Wagner G. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1986; 45: 1199-1202PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these reports and our general knowledge that thrombin mediates procoagulant, mitogenic, vasoactive, and inflammatory effects (all of which may potentially promote a proliferative vascular wall response), we know little of the mechanism by which thrombin initiates the events leading to arterial wall healing.The thrombin receptor has been cloned and classified as a member of the G-protein-coupled family of receptors. This is consistent with observations of phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide turnover(11Paris S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1970-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Huang E.M. Detwiler T.C. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 958-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after thrombin stimulation. Furthermore, expression of the thrombin receptor gene has been identified in proliferating arterial smooth muscle cells in vitro(16Zhong C. Hayzer D.J. Corson M.A. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16975-16979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and enhanced expression of this gene after arterial wall injury in vivo has been documented(17Coughlin S.R. Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This suggests that both thrombin receptor gene regulation and receptor activation contribute to vascular wall healing under normal conditions. Likewise, thrombin receptor overexpression could well be a primary event in facilitating maladaptive responses associated with neointimal hyperplasia, both after bypass grafting and in restenosis following balloon catheter angioplasty.Although several research groups have synthesized oligopeptides and monoclonal antibodies as thrombin receptor antagonists, these attempts have met with limited success. Thus, the importance of thrombin receptor activation on vascular SMC after mechanical vascular wall injury has yet to be determined. Antisense strategies have had some success in the reduction of eukaryotic cell surface receptors, including the reduction by nearly 90% of the epidermal growth factor receptor (18Moroni M.C. Willingham M.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2714-2722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dramatic inhibition of the activity of the muscarinic receptor(19Davidson A. Mengod G. Matus-Leibovitch N. Oron Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), luteinizing hormone receptor(20West A.P. Cooke B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 79: R9-R14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and acetylcholine receptor subunits(21Listerud M. Brussaard A.B. Devay P. Colman D.R. Role L.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1518-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). With regard to thrombin, the relative contributions to vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenesis of thrombin receptor activation, thrombin-mediated platelet activation, and fibrin generation, as well as binding or cleavage of other cell surface proteins by this serine protease, are unknown. Thus, the major advantage of using an antisense approach to inhibit thrombin receptor-mediated events in vascular cells is mechanistic, to determine the effect of inhibiting thrombin receptor expression without affecting the role of thrombin in coagulation or the effects of thrombin that result from its binding to other proteins on or near the cell surface, including thrombomodulin(22Soff G.A. Jackman R.W. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1991; 77: 515-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), antithrombin III(23Knoller S. Savion N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), and protease nexin(24Low D.A. Scott R.W. Baker J.B. Cunningham D.D. Nature. 1982; 298: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).We report that specific reduction of thrombin receptor-mediated events is possible using a receptor-specific antisense DNA sequence. An important determinant of specificity in the system we studied was the purity of the nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide sequences. HPLC purification was required to minimize degenerate fragments and the potential of nonspecific gene suppression. The down-regulation of receptor expression in this model is produced by a pretranslational mechanism. Further, we report that when thrombin receptor expression is inhibited using an antisense sequence specific for nucleotides 4-20 of the rat thrombin receptor, there is a significant reduction of smooth muscle cell mitogenesis, not only in response to α-thrombin but also in response to stimulation with 10% fetal bovine serum.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CulturePrimary vascular SMC were isolated from the thoracic aortas of 250-300-g male Sprague-Dawley rats using a modification of the method of Travo et al.(25Travo P. Barrett G. Burnstock G. Blood Vessels. 1980; 17: 110-116PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aortas were dissected, and the adventitia and endothelium were mechanically removed and digested with collagenase and elastase. The identity of cultured cells as SMC was confirmed by staining with an anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody (antibody A2547 from Sigma). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DME) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, used in passages 2-5, and maintained in culture at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.Oligonucleotide SynthesisPhosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA) 380B DNA synthesizer. Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were deprotected in saturated aqueous NH4OH (12-15 ml/10 μmol of ODNs) for 16-24 h at 55°C and then dried in a vacuum concentrator. ODNs were then resuspended in 50 mM triethylamine-acetate buffer (TEA•Ac) (pH 6.5) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a Water's Delta Prep 3000 system (Milford, MA). A Vydac C8 column (22 × 250 mm, 10-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) was utilized and eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile buffered in 35-50 mM TEA•Ac (pH 6.5). Fractions were collected and desiccated. After partial evaporation, an aliquot was run on a microbore reverse-phase HPLC using an ABI (Foster City, CA) VeloSep cartridge (3.4 × 40 mm, C-8 silica, 3-μm particle size) for purity verification.Proliferation AssaySMC were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/well in six-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The following day cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the medium replaced with 0.1% BSA-DME (growth-arrest medium). The cells were maintained in growth-arrest medium for 48 h, after which the media was changed to DME with 10% fetal bovine serum (DME, 10% FBS) and synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides added. The medium and oligodeoxynucleotides were changed every 48 h. Cells were trypsinized and counted manually using a hemocytometer after exposure to ODNs for 3, 4, and 6 days. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least two additional times. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D.D-myo-Inositol Phosphate AssaySMC were plated onto 35-mm dishes, allowed to reach 90% confluence, then growth arrested for 48 h. The medium was then changed to DME, 10% FBS, and oligodeoxynucleotides were added for 96 h. During the last 24 h of the 96-h incubation, myo-[3H]inositol (15 μCi/ml) was added. Unincorporated label was removed by washing cultures in a warm balanced salt solution (termed Na+ solution): 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 20 mM HEPES (buffered to pH 7.4 with Tris base), 10 mM dextrose, 10 mM LiCl. SMC were incubated in 1 ml of Na+ solution for 20 min at 37°C and then stimulated with 140 nM α-thrombin, 25 μM SFFLRN, or PBS for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by rapid aspiration of the buffer and addition of 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (20:40:1, by volume). A second wash with 500 μl of chloroform/methanol/HCl was performed. Organic and aqueous phases were separated by the addition of 900 μl of distilled water and 500 μl of chloroform. After centrifugation (500 × g for 10 min at 4°C) and two chloroform washes, the organic phases were pooled and evaporated to dryness under N2. Inositol phosphates in the aqueous phase were analyzed by ion-exchange chromatography on Dowex AG-1X8 resin and quantified by liquid-scintillation spectrometry.ImmunohistochemistryFor bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry, cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h with bromodeoxyuridine (30 μg/ml). Cells were then washed in PBS and fixed in acid ethanol. After pretreatment with 10% sheep serum and washes in PBS, cells were incubated with mouse anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody (Amersham Corp.) for a 90-min incubation. This and subsequent steps were performed according to the manufacturer's specifications. The cells were again washed with PBS, incubated for an additional 30 min with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, and stained with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Amersham).Northern Blot AnalysisGrowth-arrested SMC were treated for 72 h with DME containing 10% FBS in the presence or absence of antisense (ODN 4) or sense (ODN 3) oligonucleotides, and total cellular RNA was isolated using Tris reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Newark, NJ) using the manufacturer's protocol. Ten μg of RNA were size fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose, 2% formaldehyde gel and then transferred to a Nytron filter (Schleicher & Schuell). RNA was cross-linked to the filter using UV irradiation (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After a 4 h prehybridization in 50% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 5 × Denhardt's (1 × Denhardt's = 0.02% (w/v) each of Ficoll, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and bovine serum albumin), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 250 μg/ml of sheared salmon sperm DNA at 42°C, the Nytran filter was hybridized in the above buffer containing 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate and 1 × 106 counts/min/ml of 32P-labeled rat thrombin receptor cDNA probe for 16 h at 42°C. The filter was washed in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 60 min at 60°C (with two changes of solution), and the bands were visualized and quantitated by the use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The same filter was rehybridized with 32P-labeled human rDNA probe to demonstrate equal amounts of RNA in each lane. Labeling of probes with [α-32P]dCTP was done using a multiprime labeling system kit (Amersham,).Adherent Cell ELISA AssayGrowth-arrested SMC were treated as described above and washed with DME/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were then incubated with rabbit anti-rat thrombin receptor polyclonal antibodies. After incubation of cells with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, the color was developed with ABST peroxidase substrate according to the manufacturer's protocol (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) and the ODs were read at 405 nm.RESULTSSynthetic OligonucleotidesEight DNA sequences were synthesized and are summarized in Table 1. Comparison of sequence 7 with sequence 4 shows four mismatched nucleotides. Sequence 8 is a scrambled version of sequence 4, containing the same nucleotide composition overall but in a random sequence not found in the Genbank data base. The approximate yield following HPLC purification was 50% (Fig. 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 1Oligonucleotide purification. A, pre-HPLC profile. B, post-HPLC profile.

Serum-induced mitogenesis was reduced after a 72-h exposure to media containing 30 μM of sequence 4, but was minimally affected by incubation with the remaining seven oligodeoxynucleotide sequences (Fig. 2). This inhibitory effect was both dose- and time-dependent. Inhibition of mitogenic responses was not observed over the dose range of 0.1-5 μM for any sequence. However, a reduction in SMC proliferation was noted beginning at 15 μM after 4 days in culture and at 10 μM after 6 days in culture. At a concentration of 30 μM, SMC proliferative responses were reduced at 3 days. There was almost complete inhibition of SMC proliferation after a 6-day exposure period (Fig. 3), although at this time there was also a significant inhibitory effect by the sense oligodeoxynucleotide. Concentration dependence was noted at both 4 days (Fig. 4) and 6 days (not shown) in culture. Uniformly, at higher oligodeoxynucleotide doses and longer incubation periods, nonspecific inhibition of serum-induced mitogenesis was observed. For confirmation, tritiated thymidine uptake in response to SFFLRN and α-thrombin was reduced, and the increase in c-fos mRNA expression, typical of thrombin-induced mitogenesis(26Gibbons G.H. Yang Z. McDonald T. Patel S. Clin. Res. 1993; 41 (abstr.): 143Google Scholar), did not occur following incubation with sequence 4 (data not shown).Figure 2SMC proliferation. Growth-arrested SMC were incubated with DME- 10% FBS alone, DME-BSA alone, or DME-10% FBS plus PBS or the indicated ODN sequences (30 μM). After 72 h of incubation, cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Antisense oligonucleotide, 5′ASTR-2 (30 μM) reduced serum-induced proliferation of SMC (82%; 6.17 ± 1.01 versus 34.08 ± 3.89 × 104 cells/well; p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Percent inhibition of serum-induced SMC proliferation: sense (sequence 3) versus antisense (sequence 4) oligonucleotides. At a concentration of 30 μM, sequence 4 reduced the SMC proliferative responses to 10% FBS at 3 days, an effect notably enhanced after a 6-day exposure period.

Inhibition of mitogenic responses was not observed over the dose range of 0.1-5 μM.

Depending on the timing of the assay, this increase represents an approximate 30-150% increase over base-line total inositol phosphate levels. As a measure of the effect of inhibiting thrombin receptor expression using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, we measured total inositol phosphates in cultured SMC following stimulation with either α-thrombin or SFFLRN. Total inositol phosphates did not increase following stimulation with either α-thrombin or SFFLRN of arterial smooth muscle cells treated with antisense sequence 4 (Table 2). The response of SMC treated with either the scrambled or missense sequence was not significantly different from that of SMC treated with PBS.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab ImmunohistochemistryProliferating vascular smooth muscle cells were detected in vitro using BrdU immunohistochemistry. Representative micrographs of BrdU uptake under various culture conditions are presented in Fig. 5. Treatment of cells with antisense sequence 4, but not sense or missense sequences, reduced BrdU uptake in a manner which paralleled the reduction of SMC proliferation noted by either direct cell counting or tritiated thymidine uptake.Figure 10Anti-bromodeoxyuridine immunoperoxidase staining.

Oligonucleotide sequences were used at a final concentration of 30 μM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Northern Blot AnalysisTo determine whether the growth-inhibitory effect of sequence 4 is due to a decreased synthesis of thrombin receptor, we first analyzed its effects on thrombin receptor mRNA levels. Growth-arrested SMC were treated with DME, 10% FBS for 72 h in the presence or absence of 30 μM antisense (ODN 4) or sense (ODN 3) oligonucleotides and total cellular RNA was isolated. An equal amount of RNA (10 μg) from each condition was then analyzed for thrombin receptor transcripts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubation of SMC with antisense oligonucleotide (ODN 4) caused a 50% decrease in thrombin receptor mRNA levels as compared with the amounts in untreated cells (Fig. 6). Neither antisense nor sense oligonucleotides affected rRNA levels, suggesting that the effect of antisense oligonucleotide on thrombin receptor mRNA is specific.Figure 6Down-regulation of thrombin receptor mRNA by antisense oligonucleotides. SMC were treated for 72 h with 30 μM of indicated antisense or sense oligonucleotides and total cellular RNA was isolated. Ten μg of RNA from each treatment were analyzed for thrombin receptor transcripts by Northern blotting using the respective 32P-labeled cDNA probe. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Adherent Cell ELISA AssayTo further prove that the decrease in thrombin receptor mRNA levels in SMC treated with antisense sequence also resulted in a comparable reduction in the protein, cell surface thrombin receptor protein levels were quantitated in cells treated identically to those described above using adherent cell ELISA assay. As evident from Fig. 7, SMC treated with antisense oligonucleotide (ODN 4) had significantly lower levels of thrombin receptor antigen compared to untreated cells.Figure 7Decreased thrombin receptor protein in antisense oligonucleotide-treated SMC. Cells were treated for 72 h with 30 μM of antisense (5′ASTR-2) or sense (5′-STR-2) oligonucleotides and cell surface associated thrombin receptor protein content was measured by adherent cell ELISA assay. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIncreasing evidence suggests that thrombin generation may contribute to normal vessel wall healing following arterial injury, as well as to those maladaptive responses which lead to atherosclerosis, neointimal hyperplasia, or restenosis. For example, Sarembock et al.(27Gimple L.W. Gertz S.D. Haber H.L. Ragosta M. Powers E.R. Roberts W.C. Sarembock I.J.

Hemostasis. 1993; 69: 804Google Scholar) have reported that antithrombin treatment with recombinant hirudin or [sca]d-phenylalanine-proline-arginine-chloromethyl ketone, an irreversible active site thrombin inhibitor) reduces restenosis after in vivo balloon catheter angioplasty in a rabbit model. Nonetheless, no means exist to block thrombin receptor activation selectively in order to delineate precisely the role of receptor-mediated events in this complex pathway. Indeed, although it is tempting to speculate that thrombin initiates neointimal hyperplasia via a direct effect on smooth muscle mitogenesis, other thrombin receptor-mediated phenomena may well hold as great or greater significance, including: (a) the initiation of extracellular matrix production by SMC(30Bar-Shavit R.

Further, the functional relevance of other known cell surface thrombin-binding proteins is unknown. These questions cannot be adequately addressed until selective blocking of the thrombin receptor is achieved. To date, both small peptide sequences and antibodies have been investigated as possible thrombin receptor antagonists without significant success in vivo. 2S. Hanson and L. Harker, personal communication. We have observed that an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide which follows the initiation codon of the thrombin receptor mRNA selectively inhibits the mitogenic responses of vascular smooth muscle cells to fetal bovine serum, α-thrombin, and the thrombin receptor agonist peptide, SFFLRN. The observed nonspecific inhibitory effects could be due to the presence of contaminating short nucleic acid sequences following ODN synthesis because removal of these sequences by HPLC minimized the nonspecific effects. A significant and specific reduction in proliferation, whether measured by direct cell counting or tritiated thymidine and BrdU incorporation, was noted following a 72-96-h exposure of vascular SMC to ODN sequence 4, but not to sense, missense, or scrambled nucleotide sequences. However, nonspecific inhibition of cell proliferation by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides was observed under conditions of either high concentration or prolonged incubation.Based on our data, the specific inhibition of mitogenic responses at lower concentrations and at early time points is most likely a consequence of a direct decrease in receptor expression. Indeed, as determined by adherent cell ELISA assay, thrombin receptor protein was decreased significantly in antisense oligonucleotide-treated cells. The effect of the antisense ODN appears to be at the level of pretranslation as it affected the thrombin receptor mRNA levels. A similar effect of antisense oligonucleotides on the down-regulation of the respective mRNA was reported for protein kinase Cα in human A549 lung carcinoma cells(39Dean N.M. McKay R. Condon T.P. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16416-16424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin receptor-dependent signal transduction, as measured by inositol phosphate generation and mitogenesis, is decreased when SMC are exposed to antisense sequence 4. These findings thus show a correlation between thrombin receptor down-regulation and decreased growth in antisense oligonucleotide-treated SMC.The ability of an antisense sequence to the thrombin receptor to inhibit serum-induced SMC proliferation probably reflects significant levels of α-thrombin in the serum. This hypothesis may be supported further by the fact that hirudin, an inhibitor of thrombin, reduced serum-induced growth of SMC by only 30%, yet hirudin completely blocked α-thrombin-induced SMC proliferation (data not shown). In addition, Melzig et al.(10Melzig M. Harms C. Teuscher E. Voigt B. Wagner G. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1986; 45: 1199-1202PubMed Google Scholar) documented that heparin and synthetic inhibitors of thrombin decreased the rate of division of porcine vascular smooth muscle cells in culture supplemented with 10% calf serum. Our own studies have shown low levels of natural thrombin inhibitors, including antithrombin III, in commercial serum. 3K. Wick and M. Runge, unpublished data. The inability to completely abolish the serum-induced SMC proliferation no doubt reflects the presence of other well-known smooth muscle cell mitogens in the serum which are unaffected by the presence of antisense sequences.We have demonstrated selective inhibition of thrombin receptor expression using an antisense approach. Admittedly, the flexibility of this approach is limited by the requirement for ODN supplementation to culture media and the inevitable nonspecific reduction in cell proliferation after prolonged incubation. Nonetheless, this work provides an important first step by which the role of these receptor-mediated events in atherosclerosis and injury-induced vascular restenosis can be precisely defined.

In support of a role for thrombin in vascular lesion formation, Okazaki et al.(5Okazaki H. Majesky M.W. Harker L.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have reported that thrombin, but not other vasoactive agonists or growth factors, produces a pattern of transiently increased platelet-derived growth factor-A and decreased platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor mRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells both in vitro and in vivo, a pattern similar to that observed after vascular injury. Finally, a number of in vitro and in vivo studies have documented smooth muscle proliferation following thrombin exposure(6Graham D.J. Alexander J.J. J. Vasc. Surg. 1990; 11: 307-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Herbert J.M. Lamarche I. Dol F.

Teuscher E. Voigt B. Wagner G. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1986; 45: 1199-1202PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these reports and our general knowledge that thrombin mediates procoagulant, mitogenic, vasoactive, and inflammatory effects (all of which may potentially promote a proliferative vascular wall response), we know little of the mechanism by which thrombin initiates the events leading to arterial wall healing.The thrombin receptor has been cloned and classified as a member of the G-protein-coupled family of receptors. This is consistent with observations of phospholipase C-mediated phosphoinositide turnover(11Paris S. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1970-1976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Huang E.M. Detwiler T.C. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 958-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after thrombin stimulation. Furthermore, expression of the thrombin receptor gene has been identified in proliferating arterial smooth muscle cells in vitro(16Zhong C. Hayzer D.J. Corson M.A. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16975-16979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and enhanced expression of this gene after arterial wall injury in vivo has been documented(17Coughlin S.R. Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This suggests that both thrombin receptor gene regulation and receptor activation contribute to vascular wall healing under normal conditions. Likewise, thrombin receptor overexpression could well be a primary event in facilitating maladaptive responses associated with neointimal hyperplasia, both after bypass grafting and in restenosis following balloon catheter angioplasty.Although several research groups have synthesized oligopeptides and monoclonal antibodies as thrombin receptor antagonists, these attempts have met with limited success. Thus, the importance of thrombin receptor activation on vascular SMC after mechanical vascular wall injury has yet to be determined. Antisense strategies have had some success in the reduction of eukaryotic cell surface receptors, including the reduction by nearly 90% of the epidermal growth factor receptor (18Moroni M.C. Willingham M.C. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2714-2722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dramatic inhibition of the activity of the muscarinic receptor(19Davidson A. Mengod G.

Science. 1991; 254: 1518-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). With regard to thrombin, the relative contributions to vascular smooth muscle cell mitogenesis of thrombin receptor activation, thrombin-mediated platelet activation, and fibrin generation, as well as binding or cleavage of other cell surface proteins by this serine protease, are unknown. Thus, the major advantage of using an antisense approach to inhibit thrombin receptor-mediated events in vascular cells is mechanistic, to determine the effect of inhibiting thrombin receptor expression without affecting the role of thrombin in coagulation or the effects of thrombin that result from its binding to other proteins on or near the cell surface, including thrombomodulin(22Soff G.A. Jackman R.W. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1991; 77: 515-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), antithrombin III(23Knoller S. Savion N. Eur. J.

Nature. 1982; 298: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).We report that specific reduction of thrombin receptor-mediated events is possible using a receptor-specific antisense DNA sequence. An important determinant of specificity in the system we studied was the purity of the nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide sequences. HPLC purification was required to minimize degenerate fragments and the potential of nonspecific gene suppression. The down-regulation of receptor expression in this model is produced by a pretranslational mechanism. Further, we report that when thrombin receptor expression is inhibited using an antisense sequence specific for nucleotides 4-20 of the rat thrombin receptor, there is a significant reduction of smooth muscle cell mitogenesis, not only in response to α-thrombin but also in response to stimulation with 10% fetal bovine serum."
https://openalex.org/W1532616107,"The POU transcription factor Pit-1 activates the prolactin gene in pituitary lactotrophs and may integrate responses of the gene to external signals. To study the role of Pit-1 in dopaminergic inhibition of the prolactin gene, we transiently transfected Pit-1 and dopamine D2 receptor vectors into a series of heterologous cell lines and examined dopamine regulation of the prolactin gene promoter. Regulation was Pit-1-dependent in all cell lines tested. Moreover, dopamine responsiveness was cell type-specific: stimulatory in fibroblasts (COS-7) and muscle-type cells (P19/Me<sub>2</sub>SO-induced) and inhibitory in pancreatic endocrine (RIN, InR1-G9) and neural-like (P19/retinoic acid-induced) cells. Because dopaminergic responses in Pit-1-transfected RIN cells paralleled those in pituitary GH4 cells, the islet cell line was used to test for sequences in Pit-1 that mediate negative hormone signals. Dopamine responsiveness of the Pit-1 transactivation domain (residues 8-80) was examined using a chimeric LexA construct. LxPit-1, LxSp1, and Lx-glucocorticoid receptor fusions all activated basal transcription, but only LxPit-1 was regulated by dopamine. Regulatory responses of LxPit-1 and full-length Pit-1 were quantitatively similar. In addition, gain-of-function G<sub>α</sub> mutants that inhibit Pit-1-dependent promoters in GH4 cells also suppressed selectively Pit-1- or LxPit-1-dependent promoters in RIN cells. This demonstrates that Pit-1 can function as a specific target for distinct inhibitory G protein signals. Interestingly, Pit-1 sequences N-terminal to the DNA-binding POU domain appear to be sufficient in mediating regulation by these pathways."

In order to better understand the structural and enzymatic mechanisms by which herpesviral thymidine kinases recognize their substrates, photoaffinity labeling with [α-32P]5-azido-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate and [γ-32P]8-azidoadenosine-5′-triphosphate was used to characterize the thymidine, thymidylate, and ATP active sites of the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase. For this study, HSV-1 thymidine kinase and a site-specific mutant enzyme (C336Y, known to confer acyclovir resistance) were expressed in bacteria and purified by a rapid, two-step protocol. The specificity of photoaffinity labeling of these HSV-1 thymidine kinases was demonstrated by the ability of site-directed substrates such as thymidine, thymidylate, acyclovir, 5-bromovinyl-2′-deoxyuridine, and ATP to inhibit photoinsertion. Differences in inhibition patterns of photoaffinity labeling correlated with kinetic differences between the wild-type and C336Y HSV-1 thymidine kinases. Cumulative results suggest that the acyclovir-resistant cysteine 336 mutation primarily affects the ATP binding site; yet it also leads to alteration in the binding affinity of nucleoside drugs in the thymidine site.

This targeting is based primarily on the differences in substrate specificity compared to the cellular TKs. As a highly regulated enzyme of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, the cytosolic cellular TK specifically phosphorylates thymidine with ATP as the phosphoryl donor (4Okazaki R. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 275-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HSV-1 TK has a much broader range of substrates which include most pyrimidine nucleosides, many guanosine derivatives (e.g. ACV), and most purine and pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates(5Kit S. Leung W.C. Trkula D. Jorgensen G. Int. J. Cancer. 1974; 13: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HSV-TK also possesses a thymidylate kinase activity, and it has been suggested that the thymidine and TMP sites are shared or overlapping(6Chen M.S. Walker J. Prusoff W.H. J. Biol.

Due to significant amino acid sequence homology between the herpesviral TKs, six putative regions involved in active-site formation have been identified(9Harrison P.T. Thompson R. Davison A.J. J.

In addition, drug-resistant and site-directed mutants have been helpful in identifying some regions involved in substrate binding(11Darby G. Larder B.A. Inglis M.M. J. Gen.

Because clinical isolates of herpesviruses resistant to ACV are increasing in frequency(15Coen D.M. Antiviral Res. 1991; 15: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Safrin S. J. Aquir. Immun. Defic. Syndrome. 1992; 5: S29-S32PubMed Google Scholar), this structural information is critical for designing TK molecular models and improving nucleoside drugs. Additionally, HSV-1 TK is currently being delivered to tumor cells as a toxin gene, via retroviral vectors, whereby these cells are killed after administration of ganciclovir(17Ram Z. Culver K.W.

Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of HSV-TK could lead to future customized, drug-specific TKs for gene therapy. herpes simplex virus type 1 5-bromovinyl-2′-deoxyuridine acyclovir herpes simplex virus type 2 thymidine kinase 8-azidoadenosine-5′-triphosphate 5-azido-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate 5-azido-2′-deoxyuridine thymidine monophosphate fast protein liquid chromatography deoxyuridine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type. Toward these goals, we have expressed HSV-1 TK and a site-specific mutant in Escherichia coli and purified them for use in photoaffinity labeling analysis with base-substituted, azidonucleotide analogs. These analogs have found many applications in the characterization, identification, and purification of nucleotide-binding proteins(19Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Upon UV irradiation, a highly reactive nitrene intermediate of short half-life is generated which allows indiscriminant insertion into active-site amino acids in a nucleotide-binding protein(19Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The most commonly used photoaffinity analogs are the 8-azidopurine nucleotides(19Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and more recently 5-azidouridine derivatives(20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both classes of analogs are currently finding wide usage for the identification of active-site (or regulatory-site) peptides and amino acids involved in nucleotide binding(21Salvucci M.E. Chavan A.

Prior to this report, base substituted azidonucleosides have not been reported in the literature for use as inhibitors of viral replication or in the study of herpesviral-encoded proteins. In this study, we report the bacterial expression and a rapid, two-step purification of HSV-1 TK and a site-specific mutant TK containing a tyrosine at position 336 in place of cysteine (C336Y). A similar mutant isolated from an acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strain, in which C336Y was proposed to constitute part of the ATP and nucleoside-binding sites, was shown to have higher Km values for thymidine, ATP, and ACV relative to wild-type TK(11Darby G. Larder B.A. Inglis M.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We have used two photoaffinity analogs, [γ-32P]8-N3ATP and [α-32P]5-N3dUMP, for comparative analysis of the wild-type and mutant HSV-1 TKs. This active-site directed technique is shown to be an effective tool for studying HSV-1 TK and related site-specific mutants. All reagents and nucleotides were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. [methyl-3H]Thymidine (specific activity, 59 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]Pi (specific activity, 5-10 mCi/μmol) were from ICN Radiochemicals. Whatman DE81 filter paper discs and DE-52 resin were purchased from Fisher. The Bio-Scale Q2 column was from Bio-Rad. Restriction endonucleases, Vent polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a GE 300 MHz spectrophotometer using Me2SO-d6 as the solvent and internal standard. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 475 spectrophotometer and UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1201 spectrophotometer. pHSV106, containing the HSV-1 TK coding sequence of the HSV-1 strain MP, was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Synthetic DNA primers, containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, were utilized for polymerase chain reaction amplification of the TK coding region with Vent polymerase. This polymerase chain reaction product was subsequently ligated into a T7 expression vector, pET-9a (purchased from Novagen), to form pET-TK1. The recombinant pET-TK1 was sequenced by the method of Sanger et al.(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) and confirmed to be that of the HSV-1 TK MP strain, ligated correctly for expression. The C336Y mutation was first created by site-directed mutagenesis using a modified version of Kunkel (24Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) as described in Black and Hruby(25Black M.E. Hruby D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17584-17592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HSV-1 TK gene was cloned into the pET-8c at the NcoI site using the NcoI site at the initiating methionine codon and an NcoI site 3′ to the HSV-TK open reading frame(26Black M.E. Hruby D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9743-9748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The orientation, site of insertion, and C336Y mutation were confirmed by sequencing. E. coli SY211 cells (TK−, derived from the BL21 cell line and obtained as a gift from Dr. William Summers, Yale University), in which T7 RNA polymerase, under control of the isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible lacUV5 promoter(27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar), were transformed with pET-TK1. These cells were grown to A600 = 0.6, expression induced by 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5 h, and lysed in buffer A (20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin (1 μg/liter)) by sonication for 3 min. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to separate insoluble material. The soluble lysate was loaded onto a 15 × 3-cm column of DE-52 and washed extensively with buffer A. Selective elution of TK activity was achieved with buffer B (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as modified from the procedure of Larder et al.(28Larder B.A. Derse D. Cheng Y.C. Darby G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2027-2033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions with TK activity were pooled and concentrated to 10 ml in an Amicon filtration apparatus with a 20-volume excess of buffer A. Aliquots of 1 mg were loaded onto a Bio-Scale Q2 column equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a 40-200 mM NaCl gradient for 60 min by FPLC (Pharmacia). Purified HSV-1 TK was stored in buffer B with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at −80°C. This approach has reproducibly led to greater than 95% purified TK, with cumulative yields ranging from 0.5 to 2 mg of protein. The activity of the purified HSV-1 TK was determined using the following reaction mixture: 0.5-5 ng of protein, 4 μM [methyl-3H]thymidine (4Ci/mmol), 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaF, 40 mM KCl, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 25 μl for 10 min at 37°C. For TMP kinase activity, 10-20 μM [methyl-3H]TMP was substituted for thymidine. To identify phosphorylated products, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was loaded onto a DE-81 filter, washed three times in 95% ethanol, and counted for radioactivity(29Furlong N.B. Anal. Biochem. 1963; 5: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was loaded onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate and developed in 0.5 M LiCl (30Chen M.S. Prusoff W.H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3310-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) to separate the thymidine from the thymidine monophosphate (TMP) and diphosphate products. Radioactivity was determined using an LKB 1214 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter and corrected for background using controls with enzyme incubated in the absence of ATP. A unit of enzyme activity is equal to the formation of 1 nmol of TMP or thymidine diphosphate/min/mg at 37°C. The basic synthetic protocol is analogous to that reported for the synthesis of 5-N3UMP (20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or 5-N3dUMP(31Evans R.K. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These reactions involve nitration of UMP with nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate, reduction of the 5-nitro compound to the amine with zinc/HCl, and azide exchange with sodium azide via a diazonium intermediate(20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Evans R.K. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To synthesize the 5-azidouridine nucleosides, the only modifications to the basic protocol involve different purification steps of the 5-amine and 5-azido compounds. From 250 mg of deoxyuridine (dU), 5-nitro-dU is quantitatively produced and extracted as described previously(20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After Zn reduction, the resulting 5-amino-dU is separated from unreacted 5-nitro-dU with a Dowex 50W-H+ column (1 × 8 cm) resin: 5-nitro-dU does not bind and the 5-amino-dU is eluted with 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide. After the azide exchange reaction (19Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the resulting 5-azido-dU was passed through a Dowex 50W-H+ column (1 × 4 cm) for desalting and applied to a Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridge equilibrated with water. 5-N3dU was eluted with 1 ml of methanol and stored at −20°C. Final product yields vary between 10 and 20% of the starting material. This identical procedure was utilized to produce 5-N3U and 5-N3dU from the corresponding starting nucleosides.

An extinction coefficient of 7,600 M−1 cm−1 previously determined for 5-N3dUMP was used(31Evans R.K. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For [32P]5-N3dUMP, purified HSV-1 TK (0.5 μg), 0.5 μmol of 5-N3dU, 40 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/μmol) were incubated at 37°C for 20 min in a total of 0.15 ml. ATP (2 μmol) was added for 5 min prior to column purification. The resulting [32P]5-N3dUMP was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously for other 5-azidouridine nucleotides(20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]8-N3ATP was synthesized from 8-N3ATP (19Haley B.E.

J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). For photolabeling studies(20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), 10 μg of DE-52-purified TK in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM KCl, was incubated with the appropriate concentration of the photoprobe, [γ-32P]8-N3ATP or [α-32P]5-N3dUMP for 10 s. The sample was then irradiated for 90 s with a hand-held UV lamp (254 nm UVP-11, Ultraviolet Products, Inc.) at a distance of 3 cm. For competition experiments, varying concentrations of nonradiolabled competitors were incubated in the reaction mixture for 20 s prior to the addition of photoprobe. All reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 10 min, and pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The protein was resuspended in a solublization mixture (20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Dried gels were exposed to film for 0.5 to 3 days. The intensity of the bands corresponding to TK on the autoradiographs were determined using a laser densitometer (Bio-Rad Model GS-670 Imaging Densitometer). Vero cells, in Dulbecos's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, were grown to confluency (approximately 1 × 106) in 60 × 15-mm tissue culture plates and infected with HSV-1 (strain KOS) or HSV-2 (strain 333) for 1 h. Medium was subsequently replaced with fresh medium containing the test compounds (0-50 μM range) for plaque reduction assays (300 plaque forming units/plate) after 48 h post-infection as described previously(34Oakes J.E. J. Infect. Dis. 1975; 131: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cytotoxic effects of the compounds on uninfected cells were determined using a soluble tetrazolium dye, Alamar blue, as directed by the manufacturer (Alamar, Sacramento, CA). The purification and expression scheme was designed to allow rapid isolation of milligram amounts of WT and mutant HSV-1 TK enzyme. A bacterial T7 expression system (Novagen) was utilized to express the native enzyme and resulted in ranges of 4-10% of the total protein being HSV-1 TK. Purification on DEAE-cellulose was achieved by a combination of protocols described previously(28Larder B.A. Derse D. Cheng Y.C. Darby G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2027-2033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the key modification being the use of 20 mM Tris loading buffer, then selective elution of HSV-1 TK in a 50 mM phosphate buffer (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, the final step of purification entailed FPLC using a Bio-Scale Q2 column. The SDS-PAGE profile of this two-step purification of HSV-1 TK is shown in Fig. 1 and described in Table 1. The final purification was 74-fold as determined by specific activity (Table 1), although this has varied depending on the initial levels of the induced HSV-1 TK. Simliar results were also found for the C336Y mutant with identical FPLC elution profiles (data not shown). To show that the expression of the native enzyme in E. coli did not result in altered activity, the WT and C336Y enzymes were analyzed kinetically: the Km values for thymidine were 1.3 (WT) and 10 (C336Y) μM; for ATP, 30 μM (WT) and 1.3 mM (C336Y) (data not shown). These values agree with previously published kinetic analyses of HSV-1 TK(8Maga G. Focher F. Wright G.E. Capobianco M. Garbesi A. Bendiscioli A. Spadari S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Larder B.A. Derse D. Cheng Y.C. Darby G. J. Biol.

Pooled DEAE-cellulose fraction (1 mg) was applied to a Bio-Scale Q2 column in a Pharmacia FPLC system previously equilibrated with Buffer A. HSV-1 TK was eluted in Buffer A by a 40-200 mM NaCl gradient as indicated by protein absorbance at 280 nm (-). Thymidine kinase activity(- - -) was determined by assaying 15 μl of each fraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fractions 40-45 were pooled, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab For photoaffinity labeling, a photoactive thymidine analog was synthesized, 5-azidodeoxyuridine (5-N3dU), and tested as a substrate of HSV-1 TK. Using [3H]5-N3dU, products corresponding to [3H]5-N3dUMP (major) and [3H]5-N3dUDP (<10%) were detected in TLC assays. In kinetic experiments using 5-N3dU as an inhibitor of thymidine phosphorylation, it was shown that 5-N3dU had complex mixed inhibition patterns due to its dual function as both a competitive inhibitor and substrate. Half-maximal inhibition of thymidine phosphorylation by 5-N3dU was 1 μM. 5-N3dU was readily converted to [α-32P]5-N3dUMP using [γ-32P]ATP and HSV-1 TK. Since previous kinetic experiments (5Kit S. Leung W.C. Trkula D. Jorgensen G. Int. J. Cancer. 1974; 13: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) indicated that thymidine and thymidylate kinase activities have a single or overlapping active-site, we utilized [32P]5-N3dUMP to examine these sites. By use of the TK assay buffer minus bovine serum albumin and standard procedures(19Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 230: 330-339Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), photolabeling of WT and the C336Y HSV-1 TKs by [α-32P]5-N3dUMP was pursued. Although not shown, photoincorporation of the photoprobes with the HSV-1 TKs was always dependent on UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3, half-maximal saturation of photoinsertion of [32P]5-N3dUMP was 6 (WT) and 8 (C336Y) μM. These values are consistent with the reported Km values of TMP for both of these HSV-1 TKs(8Maga G. Focher F. Wright G.E. Capobianco M. Garbesi A. Bendiscioli A. Spadari S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 28Larder B.A. Derse D. Cheng Y.C. Darby G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2027-2033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are indicative of specific active-site incorporation. To further test the active-site specificity of photolabeling, known nucleoside and nucleotide substrates at varying concentrations were included in the photolabeling reactions with [32P]5-N3dUMP and the two TKs. As shown in Fig. 4, A-C, photolabeling of WT HSV-1 TK was competitively inhibited in a concentration dependent manner by thymidine, TMP, ACV, BVDU, 5-N3dU, and 5-N3dUMP. The concentrations of inhibitors that reduce photoincorporation by 50% (ICP50) were derived from densitometric scanning of the autoradiographs in Fig. 4 and are are listed in Table 2.Figure 4Effect of various substrates on photolabeling of WT and C336Y HSV-1 TK with [α-32P]5-N3dUMP. Either wild-type or C336Y HSV-1 TKs (10 μg) were incubated in the presence of the indicated concentrations of HSV-1 TK substrates, photolyzed with 15 μM [α-32P]5-N3dUMP, and subjected to SDS-PAGE.

The C336Y HSV-1 TK consistently resulted in 1.3-fold higher levels of photoincorporation of 15 μM [32P]5-N3dUMP relative to WT HSV-1 TK (data not shown). Of the compounds tested, ICP50 values for TMP did not differ between C336Y and WT HSV-1 TKs, and were over 2-fold higher for 5-N3dUMP. However, these values significantly differed for the nucleosides tested: thymidine 5.7-fold, 5-N3dU 16.7-fold, ACV >6-fold, and BVDU >16.7-fold (Table 2). Addition of ATP (Fig. 4D) to inhibit [32P]5-N3dUMP photolabeling resulted in ICP50 values of 150 μM for WT and >1 mM for C336Y HSV-1 TKs. To study the nucleoside triphosphate active site of the HSV-1 TKs, the ATP analog, [γ-32P]8-N3ATP, was used. As shown in Fig. 5, half-maximal saturation of photoincorporation of [32P]8-N3ATP for WT was 90 μM, while photolabeling of the C336Y HSV-1 TK did not saturate at concentrations of up to 1 mM. Photoincorporation of 15 μM [32P]8-N3ATP for the C336Y mutant was 20% of the WT levels (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, addition of ATP, GTP, or TTP (ICP50s: 80, 185, and 137 μM, respectively) inhibited photoincorporation of [γ-32P]8-N3ATP into HSV-1 TK in a concentration-dependent manner, while CTP had little effect. In contrast, only minor inhibition of [32P]8-N3ATP photolabeling by competing NTPs was observed with the C336Y TK (see Fig. 6). Cumulatively, the photoaffinity data suggest that the C336Y HSV-1 TK mutant is primarily altered at the ATP site.Figure 6Inhibition of [γ-32P]8-N3ATP photoinsertion into WT and C336Y HSV-1 TKs by nucleoside triphosphates.

One of the underlying assumptions at the initiation of these studies was that photoactive analogs of known anti-HSV drugs could be used to study cellular and viral drug metabolizing enzymes, and more importantly, that this information would reflect actual intracellular drug metabolism. To test this directly, 5-azidouridine (5-N3U), 5-N3dU, and 5-azidodideoxyuridine (5-N3ddU) were tested as inhibitors of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication in Vero cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Compared to previous values obtained for BVDU(3Machida H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 29: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), 5-N3dU was an effective inhibitor of HSV-1 replication leading to 50% inhibition of viral plaque formation at 0.2 μM (Table 3), yet had no activity against HSV-2. 5-N3U had no apparent activity or cytoxicity. 5-N3ddU was inhibitory, but its antiviral activity was difficult to distinguish from its cytoxic properties. An additional metabolic experiment was done by incubating [3H]5-N3dU with control and HSV-1 infected cells for 1 h, followed by perchloric acid extraction of the cells and TLC analysis of the recovered nucleotides. [3H]5-N3dUMP was only detected in extracts derived from HSV-1 infected cells (data not shown), which is indicative of phosphorylation by HSV-1 TK.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In order to facilitate rapid and high-yield purification of HSV-1 TKs expressed in bacteria, a novel purification protocol was developed independent of the conventional thymidine-affinity chromatography resins routinely employed with this enzyme. Because we intend to apply this purification protocol to other HSV-1 TKs mutated in the thymidine or TMP active-sites, the thymidine affinity resins would have had limited utility for these purposes. The rapid purification technique consists of only two steps following sonication of the isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced E. coli cells: a selective, modified DEAE-cellulose chromatography procedure and Q2 FPLC. This purification reproducibly results in greater than 95% purity of HSV-1 TK. Comparison of specific activities obtained with this protocol and thymidine-affinity chromatography indicates little differences(28Larder B.A. Derse D. Cheng Y.C. Darby G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2027-2033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies of HSV-1 TK have been useful in correlating conserved sites with activity(12Liu Q. Summers W.C. Virology. 1988; 163: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Dube D.K. Parker J.D. French D.C. Cahill D.S. Dube S. Horwitz M.S.Z. Munir K.M. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11760-11767Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Black M.E. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11618-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the basis of the molecular differences in substrate and drug specificities of the HSV-1 TK remains unclear. In combination with site-specific mutants of HSV-1 TK, the active-site directed photoaffinity analogs described here should aid in elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying HSV-1 TK activity. As a model, we have compared the photoaffinity labeling of the WT and an ACV-resistant TK, C336Y, with 5-N3dUMP and 8-N3ATP. The experiments presented in Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 indicate specific active-site photoincorporation of these analogs and highlight several important observations regarding the nature of the C336Y mutation and ACV resistance. For WT HSV-1 TK, the most effective inhibitors of [32P]5-N3dUMP photolabeling are nucleosides, not TMP or 5-N3dUMP (Table 2). This observation is consistent with previous kinetic studies which have shown the Km values for thymidine and TMP differ by 12-25-fold, and both compounds to be competitive inhibitors of each other, indicating that their sites overlap or are partially shared (6Chen M.S. Walker J. Prusoff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10747-10753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chen M.S. Prusoff W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1325-1327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Maga G. Focher F. Wright G.E. Capobianco M. Garbesi A. Bendiscioli A. Spadari S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4A, the TMP site in the C336Y mutant remains unaffected in contrast to the thymidine and ATP sites (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). This suggests that although nucleosides (and nucleoside derived drugs) are preferred in the T/TMP site(s) compared with nucleoside monophosphates, the thymidine kinase and thymidylate kinase activities can be uncoupled and are independent. The data also suggests that a mutation at either the nucleoside/drug-binding site or in the ATP site will lead to increases in Km values for both substrates and potentially lead to a drug-resistant enzyme. This is currently being tested with the photoaffinity analogs and other HSV-1 TK site-specific mutants containing amino acid substitutions thought to be involved in either TK or TMP kinase activity. The photolabeling data with [32P]8-N3ATP and the C336Y mutant (Figure 5, Figure 6) indicate that the primary effect of this amino acid substitution is in the ATP site. Therefore, an apparent structural conformation change as a result of the mutation somehow alters ATP/nucleoside binding, yet still retains a WT-like ATP/TMP binding. The cysteine 336 of HSV-1 TK is believed to comprise part of the ATP-binding site, as suggested by comparison of homologous domains with other viral TKs and a related motif conserved in porcine adenylate kinase(8Maga G. Focher F. Wright G.E. Capobianco M. Garbesi A. Bendiscioli A. Spadari S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Darby G. Larder B.A. Inglis M.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 8-N3ATP was used to identify an ATP active-site peptide 5 amino acids N-terminal to this conserved site in adenylate kinase(21Salvucci M.E. Chavan A. Haley B.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4479-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, if this homology is reflective of HSV-1 TK function, Cys-336 is likely to be near the adenine base in the ATP site. An interesting question to address in the C336Y mutant is why the altered affinity for ATP binding effects phosphorylation of nucleosides, but does not apparently affect thymidylate kinase activity. The lack of competition by CTP of [32P]8-N3ATP photolabeling for either HSV-1 TK was not expected. Consistent with previous studies(5Kit S. Leung W.C. Trkula D. Jorgensen G. Int. J. Cancer. 1974; 13: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the purified HSV-1 TK utilizes CTP as a phosphoryl donor very efficiently (data not shown). This lack of CTP inhibition of photolabeling may indicate a distinct binding site for CTP and is currently being studied. BVDU is one of the most potent inhibitors of HSV-1 replication in cell culture, yet has little effect on the replication of HSV-2(3Machida H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 29: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of the azidonucleosides tested, the best inhibitor of HSV-1 replication was 5-N3dU (Table 3). This compound would be the closest structural mimic of BVDU, so it is not surprising that it had anti-HSV-1 activity and little activity against HSV-2. The 5-azido moiety is consistent with the criteria established for determining the effectiveness of a 5-substituted deoxyuridine as an anti-HSV-1 compound (35Goodchild J. Porter R.A. Raper R.H. Sim I.S. Upton R.M. Viney J. Wadsworth H.J. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) : it is an unsaturated, hydrophobic, electronegative 5-substituent of no more than 4 atoms in length. Metabolic labeling experiments indicate that [3H]5-N3dU can be phosphorylated by HSV-1 TK in HSV-1 infected cells. Even though 5-N3dU is a potent inhibitor of HSV-1 replication in cell culture, the poor half-maximal cytoxicity doses of 10-20 μM preclude any potential clinical applications. These results, however, do validate the hypothesis that azidonucleosides can act as biological mimics of anti-HSV nucleoside drugs. Therefore, if they are used as photoaffinity analogs and UV-cross-linked to HSV-TK active-site peptides, these are likely to be the same peptide domains that interact with the known antiviral drug. Cumulatively, this study has shown that 5-N3dUMP and 8-N3ATP are effective tools for determining the active-site environment of HSV-1 TK."

Gutkind J.S. Mahadevan D. Li W. Meyers K.A. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine the functional role of distinct structural domains of αPDGFR in ligand-dependent biological responses, two carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants lacking amino acid residues 1025-1089 or 977-1089, designated αRΔC1 and αRΔC2, and a group of point mutations substituting phenylalanine for tyrosine residues 988, 993, or 1018, designated αR(Y988F), αR(Y993F), and αR(Y1018F), were generated (Fig. 1A). In addition, we have reported previously the construction of a αPDGFR deletion mutant lacking amino acid residues 710-789 of the kinase insert domain, designated αRΔki-1, and point mutations within this domain converting tyrosine 731, 742, or both to phenylalanine, designated as αR(Y731F), αR(Y742F), and αR(Y731F+Y742F), respectively(12Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Lombardi D. Ruggiero J. Gutkind T. Matsui T. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 134-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yu J.C. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Gutkind J.S. Lombardi D. Ruggiero M. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3780-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Since the NIH/3T3 line is a cell type that normally expresses both α and βPDGFRs, it provides a physiologically relevant microenvironment for analyzing PDGFR signal transduction. To overcome activation of endogenous αPDGFR, the cytoplasmic domain of αPDGFR mutants were linked to the ligand-binding domain of the human CSF-1R (c-fms), which is not normally expressed in NIH/3T3 cells. Expression vectors containing the chimerae were transfected into NIH/3T3 cells, and the ability of these chimerae to mediate CSF-1-stimulated anchorage-independent growth, focus formation, and chemotactic responses in NIH/3T3 cells was studied. We first examined the effect of these mutations on αPDGFR autophosphorylation. NIH/3T3 cells transfected with fms/αRWT, fms/αR(Y988F), fms/αR(Y993F), fms/αR(Y1018F), fms/αRΔC1, fms/αRΔC2, and fms/αRΔki-1 were untreated or treated with CSF-1. Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-Tyr(P)). The proteins in immune complexes were electrophoretically separated, transferred to a membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-Tyr(P). As shown in Fig. 1B, while fms/αRΔC2 showed approximately 50% reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation, the other chimerae exhibited levels of tyrosine phosphorylation that were comparable to that of fms/αRWT. Consistent with previous findings, we did not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous αPDGFR upon CSF-1 triggering (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). These data suggest that amino acids 977-1024 within the carboxyl-terminal domain of αPDGFR may contain relevant tyrosine autophosphorylation sites. Alternatively, the reduction in the level of fms/αRΔC2 tyrosine phosphorylation may be due to conformational changes induced by deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain of αPDGFR. To examine the expression levels of chimeric receptors in the NIH/3T3 transfectants, immunoprecipitates were prepared from equivalent amount of cell lysates using antiserum directed against the extracellular domain of c-Fms (anti-CSF-1R). The immune complexes were then electrophoretically separated and immunoblotted with anti-αPDGFR antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 959-973 of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 1C, the levels of fms/αR chimeric proteins expressed were comparable among each NIH/3T3 transfectant. Under the same conditions, endogenous αPDGFR protein could not be detected in the anti-CSF-1R immune complex prepared from control NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 1). Cell surface expression levels of the chimeric proteins were also determined to be very similar by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the CSF-1R (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that the stoichiometry of CSF-1-induced tyrosine autophosphorylation of all mutant receptors, except fms/αRΔC2, was comparable to that of fms/αRWT. We next examined the effect of these mutations on receptor association with its known substrates. The ectopic expression and biochemical analyses of αRΔC1 and αRΔC2 in 32D hematopoietic cells indicated that amino acid residues 977-1024 contain the major determinants necessary for PLCγ association and activation (data not shown). Therefore, the ability of mutant fms/αR chimerae to coimmunoprecipitate with PLCγ was compared using anti-CSF-1R antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, this antibody coimmunoprecipitated comparable levels of PLCγ from NIH/3T3 cells expressing fms/αRWT and fms/αRΔC1. In contrast, the level of anti-CSF-1R- recoverable PLCγ was either reduced by about 90% in NIH/3T3 cells expressing fms/αR(Y988F), fms/αR(Y993F), or it was completely abolished in fms/αRΔC2 or fms/αR(Y1018F) transfectants after CSF-1 stimulation. Consistent with these results, the level of anti-Tyr(P)-recoverable PLCγ protein was also reduced (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1E, each chimera associated to a similar extent with the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85). Thus, our findings indicate that amino acid residues 977-1024 within the carboxyl terminus of αPDGFR contain the major binding site for PLCγ but not p85. These results are consistent with previous data demonstrating that tyrosine 1021 of the βPDGFR is required for association with PLCγ, since the amino acid residues surrounding tyrosine 1018 of the αPDGFR are very similar to those surrounding tyrosine 1021 of the βPDGFR (16Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, fms/αRΔki-1, fms/αR(Y731F), and fms/αR(Y731F+Y742F) failed to coprecipitate p85, even though the ability of these mutants to associate with PLCγ was not impaired (data not shown). To examine the effect of these mutations on ligand-stimulated biological responses, we next tested the ability of each transfectants to form colonies in semisolid medium. As shown in Fig. 2, NIH/3T3 expressing fms/αRWT formed colonies of sizes greater than 30 μm in diameter with an efficiency of around 25% (panels C and D). Moreover, each transfectant exhibited a similar ability to form progressively growing colonies in the presence of CSF-1 except NIH/3T3 cells transfected with the vector alone (panels A and B). These data suggest that ligand-stimulated association of PLCγ with αPDGFR is not required for colony formation in soft agar, since fms/αR(Y1018F), which failed to bind PLCγ completely, exhibited CSF-1-induced colony forming efficiency comparable to that of the fms/αRWT transfectant. In addition, neither deletion of 80 amino acids from the kinase insert nor truncation of 112 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of αPDGFR detectably impaired the ability of CSF-1 to mediate colony formation. Taken together, our findings suggest that either the kinase insert or carboxyl-terminal domain is dispensable for anchorage-independent cellular growth. CSF-1 has been shown to induce efficient focus formation of NIH/3T3 cells expressing fms/αRWT, fms/αR(Y731F), and fms/αR(Y731F+Y742F)(15Yu J.C. Gutkind J.S. Mahadevan D. Li W. Meyers K.A. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to examine the ability of individual mutant chimera to mediate CSF-1-dependent focus formation of NIH/3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, CSF-1 treatment induced approximately 140 foci in NIH/3T3 cells transfected with 1 μg of the fms/αRWT expression vector (panels C and D). Truncation of 64 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus (fms/αRΔC1) or 80 amino acid residues from the kinase insert domain (fms/αRΔki-1) did not affect the level of ligand-stimulated focus formation, respectively (Fig. 3, panels E and F and panels O and P). In striking contrast, truncation of an additional 48 amino acid residues (fms/αRΔC2) resulted in 10-fold less focus forming activity in response to CSF-1 treatment (Fig. 3, G and H). These data suggest that amino acid residues 977-1024 within the carboxyl-terminal domain of the αPDGFR are important for mediating focus formation. Transfection of chimeric receptor containing mutation of tyrosine 988, 993, or 1018 within this domain each reduced CSF-1-induced focus formation by about 5-10-fold (Fig. 3, panels I and J, K and L, and M and N). A similar number of marker-selected colonies were observed in parallel plates, suggesting that equal levels of DNA were transfected into these cells (data not shown). Since the CSF-1-dependent focus formation of NIH/3T3 cells by various constructs correlated well with the ability of mutant receptors to bind PLCγ, our results suggest that PLCγ is probably involved in the focus forming function mediated by the αPDGFR. However, it is still possible that other putative substrates of αPDGFR that interact with this region may also be involved in mediating this response. In contrast to the mutations within the carboxyl-terminal domain, none of the mutations within the kinase insert domain of αPDGFR reduced ligand-induced focus-formation (data not shown and (15Yu J.C. Gutkind J.S. Mahadevan D. Li W. Meyers K.A. Pierce J.H. Heidaran M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). These data suggest that substrates that bind to phosphotyrosine residues within amino acid residues 710-789 of the kinase insert domain of the αPDGFR, including p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, are not required for efficient focus formation in NIH/3T3 cells. Ligand-stimulated αPDGFR is able to mediate chemotactic signaling in 32D hematopoietic and NIH/3T3 cells(9Matsui T. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Greenberger J.S. LaRochelle W.J. Ruggiero J. Aaronson S.A.

Commun. 1994; 204: 628-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To compare the ability of the various fms/αR mutants to mediate chemotactic responses in NIH/3T3 cells, we examined the ability of each transfectant to migrate through a membrane toward the CSF-1 ligand (14Rapesh L.A. Invasion Metastasis. 1989; 9: 192-208PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, while deletions of amino acid residues 1025-1089 (fms/αRΔC1) or mutation of residues Tyr-988 or Tyr-993 did not impair CSF-1 dependent chemotactic response, deletion of amino acid residues 977-1089 (fms/αRΔC2) or mutation of Tyr-1018 inhibited chemotaxis by less than 50%. Therefore, our results suggest that mutation within the carboxyl terminus of αPDGFR did not impair chemotaxis to the same extent as focus formation. In contrast, deletion of 80 amino acids within the kinase insert domain or mutations of PI 3-kinase association sites reduced ligand-dependent chemotactic responses in NIH/3T3 cells by greater than 80%. Thus, our findings suggest that substrates interacting with the kinase insert domain of αPDGFR are required for efficient chemotactic responses in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Mutation of the PLCγ association site of the βPDGFR or fibroblast growth factor receptors has been reported to have no effect on ligand-stimulated mitogenic responses(16Valius M. Bazenet C. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 133-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. Rosario M.D. Mirda D. William L.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, ectopic expression of αRΔC1 or αRΔC2 in 32D hematopoietic cells indicates that amino acid residues 977-1089 encompassing the PLCγ binding site are not necessary for PDGF-induced mitogenic responses (data not shown). Moreover, our data indicate that fms/αR transfectants containing a mutation of the PLCγ binding site or even a larger truncation of amino acid residues 977-1089 of the carboxyl-terminal domain of αPDGFR did not reduce the ability of the receptor to mediate formation of colonies in the presence of the CSF-1. In contrast, analyses of carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants to mediate CSF-1-induced focus formation revealed that the presence of amino acids 977-1024 of the αPDGFR was necessary for this effect (see Fig. 3). Interestingly, mutation of Tyr-988, Tyr-993, or Tyr-1018 within this domain each reduced not only the CSF-1-induced focus formation but also receptor association with the PLCγ. These findings suggest that activation of PLCγ is likely to be involved in focus formation but not in anchorage-independent cell growth. We have observed that the inhibitory effect of Y1018F mutation on the CSF-1-induced focus formation or receptor association with PLCγ was more pronounced than that shown by mutation of either Y988F or Y993F. Although the biological significance of the difference observed remains to be established, our data suggest that Tyr-1018 may be differentially involved in receptor association with PLCγ and mediating the focus forming activity of αPDGFR. PDGF-induced focus formation of NIH/3T3 cells is characterized by the loss of contact inhibition and morphological alterations, which are considered to be the hallmark of neoplastic diseases. Interestingly, diacylglyceride and inositol trisphosphate, the enzymatic reaction products of PLCγ activation, have also been implicated in stimulating redistribution of cytoskeletal components in a variety of transformed cells(19Ridley A.J. Hall A. EMBO. 1994; 13: 2600-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 20Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar, 21Rhee S.G. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.-H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent report suggests that protein kinase C-∊ is involved in transformation of NIH/3T3 cells(22Mischak H. Goodnight J.A. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that PLCγ and its associated proteins may mediate focus forming activity of PDGF by stimulating protein kinase C-dependent changes in the cytoskeletal architecture of NIH/3T3 cells. In contrast to the mutations within the carboxyl-terminal domain, a double mutation within the kinase insert domain of αPDGFR that completely abrogated receptor-associated PI 3-kinase fully inhibited ligand-stimulated cell movement but not focus formation or colony formation of NIH/3T3 transfectants. This result is consistent with previous findings showing that PDGF-induced PI 3-kinase association with the βPDGFR is required for chemotactic response(23Kundra V. Escobedo A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 476Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Thus our findings indicate that the region of αPDGFR involved in ligand-dependent chemotactic signaling is distinct from that required for focus formation and anchorage-independent growth functions mediated by the αPDGFR. Finally, we would be remiss not to mention the possibility that differences between the signaling mechanisms uncovered in this study may potentially reflect the inherent property of CSF-1R/αPDGFR chimera utilized.

https://openalex.org/W1991511126,"Recently, DNA ring closure assays showed that high mobility group protein HMG-1 and its close homolog HMG-2 mediate sequence-independent DNA flexion. This DNA-bending activity appears to be central to at least some of the recently elucidated functions of HMG-1/2, such as the enhancement of progesterone receptor DNA binding. Here we show that standard purification procedures utilizing perchloric and trichloroacetic acid can produce HMG-1 significantly deficient in its abilities to bind and bend double-stranded DNA, while acid-independent methods purify HMG-1 that is superior in these respects. Significant losses of DNA ring closure activity were seen upon limited 2-5-h exposures of non-acid-purified HMG-1/2 to perchloric acid and/or trichloroacetic acid. Measurements of the apparent DNA dissociation binding constant (Kd(app)) of acid-extracted preparations of HMG-1 gave a wide range of values, and only those preparations demonstrating little DNA ring closure activity had Kd values near the previously published value (∼10−6M). The highest ring closure activities and lowest Kd(app) (<3 × 10−9M) were obtained for HMG-1 purified without acids. These combined results support the use of alternative, non-acid purification procedures for preserving the DNA-bending activity of HMG-1/2 and suggest that past procedures utilizing acids have led to an underestimation of the affinity of HMG-1 for DNA.

In this regard, several laboratories recently described a hitherto unknown activity of HMG-1, the ability to induce sequence-independent DNA flexion, or bending(7Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J.

More significantly, there is evidence that this ability to alter DNA structure by bending may be important to at least some of the cellular functions of the protein. high mobility group perchloric acid para-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate dithiothreitol 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid polybuffer exchanger base pair(s). Paull et al.(7Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), for example, have demonstrated that HMG-1 (or the closely related HMG-2) can functionally substitute for the bacterial DNA-bending protein HU in vitro in a recombinational DNA inversion reaction requiring a sharp bending and looping of the DNA, and it is speculated that HMG-1 may function in analogous recombination reactions in eukaryotic systems. Oñate and colleagues (9Oñate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that HMG-1 serves as an accessory factor in facilitating the binding of the human progesterone receptor to its target DNA sequences in vitro, with evidence for a mechanism based on DNA bending. Studies in our laboratory 2J. P. Wagner, C. Kunsch, and D. E. Pettijohn, manuscript in preparation. also showed a similar stimulatory effect of HMG-1 on transcription factor NF-κB, with additional evidence for an effect mediated through DNA bending. The combined results suggest that HMG-1, by altering DNA structure, may be functioning to cooperatively assist the bindings and interactions of transcription factors and other proteins that require energetically unfavorable DNA distortions, such as loops or bends. During our recent experiments using HMG-1 purified by standard denaturing/oxidizing methods involving perchloric/trichloroacetic acid extractions, we assayed many preparations of the protein that possessed suboptimal DNA-associated activities, i.e. higher dissociation constants, lower DNA-bending activities, and reductions in ability to stimulate binding of transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate that these activities of HMG-1 are improved when HMG-1 is prepared by alternative methods that avoid acids. Our results also indicate that past purification techniques have led to an underestimation of the affinity of HMG-1 for double-stranded DNA. These combined results support the use of alternative non-acid procedures in purifying the protein. T4 ligase-dependent ring closure assays and the origin of the linear DNA fragments used in these assays have been previously described(9Oñate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R.

Several preparations of acid extracted calf thymus HMG-1 were purified in the laboratory of Dr. Raymond Reeves, Washington State University, by a modification of the acid-dependent method of Adachi et al.(10Adachi Y. Mizuno S. Yoshida M. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These procedures included exposures of up to several hours to 5% perchloric acid (PCA) and 25% trichloroacetic acid with final purification on a polybuffer exchange column, PBE 94 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)(10Adachi Y. Mizuno S. Yoshida M. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rat liver nuclei were prepared from fresh rat livers following the method of Blobel and Potter(11Blobel G. Potter V.R. Science. 1966; 154: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), but including 5 mM DTT and 2 mMpara-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS), a protease inhibitor, in the liver homogenate and TKM buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2). Phenylsulfonyl fluoride was not used because of a report that it stimulates proteolysis of HMG-1 and HMG-2(12Oka T. Thakur M.K. Miyamoto K. Sassa T. Suzuki I. Natori Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Nuclei were centrifuged at low speed and resuspended immediately at 4°C for 30 min in a severalfold excess volume of hypotonic lysis buffer: 0.1 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mM CaCl2, 2 mM pCMBS, 5 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (or Triton X-114). Nuclei were again centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. After washing several times in hypotonic buffer minus detergents, nuclei were resuspended at 4°C for 30 min in a severalfold excess volume of 0.35 M protein extraction buffer: 0.35 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 12 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM pCMBS. Nuclei were again centrifuged and the supernatant removed as the “0.35 M extract.” Nuclei were re-extracted in 0.35 M buffer, and the wash fraction was pooled with the bulk of the 0.35 M extract. The extract was immediately heated for 3 min in boiling water and cooled on ice for 10 min, the denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant (containing HMG-1/2 and other heat-resistant proteins) was removed as the “0.35 M boiled supernatant.” (It was observed that rapid heating of the extract inhibited proteolysis of the 28-kDa form of HMG-1 to its 23-kDa form (p23), which was seen in the absence of heating and which was reported by others to form quickly in rat liver extracts(5Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). 3 mM additional fresh DTT was added to the boiled extract, and the extract was stored on ice. Following essentially the “non-acid” method of Adachi et al.(10Adachi Y. Mizuno S. Yoshida M. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but without prior dialysis of the extract, the 0.35 M boiled supernatant was chromatographed on a PBE 94 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.35 M NaCl, 5 mM DTT and using approximately 1.5 ml of PBE 94 resin per starting rat liver. HMG-2 and HMG-1 eluted at about the 0.6 M and 0.75 M points, respectively, in a 0.35-1 M NaCl gradient. These steps purified HMG-1 and HMG-2 to >90% homogeneity with 33% yield of starting ring closure activity (see Table 1). Purified HMG-1 and HMG-2 were desalted on Centriprep 10 devices (Amicon) versus 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and concentrated to ∼100 ng/μl by volume reduction on the Centripreps. Fresh DTT was added to 5 mM, and the proteins were frozen in 10-μl aliquots at −70°C. Occasionally, a significant contaminant of about 40 kDa was retained with HMG-1 after the PBE column. Carboxymethyl cellulose was found to not bind this contaminant, but to avidly retain HMG-1, indicating that this resin may be useful for achieving further purity of HMG-1, if needed. Several different preparations of non-acid-extracted HMG-1 and HMG-2 (HMG-1/2) of varying degrees of purity were used to test the effects of PCA and trichloroacetic acid on the ring closure activity. Aliquots of the HMG-1/2 proteins, at protein concentrations between ∼45 ng/μl and 3 μg/ul total protein, were made 5% in PCA, and placed at 4°C for different times as specified, and the acid was then neutralized by the addition of a 21-fold volume excess of 0.1 M Tris, pH 8. The Tris buffer also served to resuspend any precipitated protein. The solutions were reconcentrated by volume reduction on Amicon Microcon or Centricon microconcentrators (10,000-kDa molecular weight cutoff). Control aliquots not exposed to PCA were taken through the same manipulations as the acid treated aliquots, and equivalent amounts of each sample were assayed in the ring closure assay. The procedure for measuring trichloroacetic acid-induced inactivation was similar, except that the HMG-1/2 aliquots were made 25% in trichloroacetic acid and untreated control tubes received an equal volume of T.E. (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8). Although some adsorptive losses were observed during reconcentration on the Amicon devices in these inactivation experiments, the losses were found to be reproducible. Moreover, a PCA inactivation experiment utilizing a neutralizing buffer of higher pH (eliminating the need to reconcentrate the control and treated solutions) demonstrated an activity loss for the PCA-treated aliquot that was nearly identical to that measured using the microconcentrators. Electrophoresis of proteins was on 10% polyacrylamide gels with 4% stacking gels(13Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10342) Google Scholar). Gels were silver-stained as described elsewhere(14Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). Tween 20 at 0.05% in gel buffers helped reduce silver stain backgrounds. Pierce's colorimetric bicinchoninic acid assay was used to determine protein concentrations(15Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18059) Google Scholar). DTT was removed to use the standard protocol. Histone H1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a standard. N-terminal Edman degradation protein sequencing was performed on non-acid-purified HMG-1 on an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer in the Microsequencing Facility of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. The identity of the protein as HMG-1 was verified by an exact match of the first 8 residues to the published sequence, G-K-G-D-P-K-K-P(16Walker J.M. Gooderham K. Hastings J.R.B. Mayes E. Johns E.W. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Standard binding buffer contained 10 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. 0.1 ng of a 33P-labeled restriction fragment was incubated 15 min at 25°C with specified amounts of HMG-1 protein (in molar excess of DNA) in 10 μl of binding buffer, and the mixture was layered onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel made up in 5 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 5 mM potassium glutamate, 5 mM DTT, 5% glycerol. Gels were loaded running at 10 V/cm to reduce the electrophoretic dead time and after the samples entered the gel matrix, electrophoresis was continued at 4 V/cm for 2 h at 25°C. Recirculation of the cathodic and anodic buffers was necessary to maintain a neutral pH within the gel. After electrophoresis, gels were dried, visualized by phosphorimaging on a Molecular Dynamics Series 400 PhosphorImager, and quantitated using the ImageQuant software. The Kd(app) was estimated as the protein concentration at the point in the titration where half of the input DNA had been complexed with protein, with protein in molar excess(17Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Some gel shift experiments with linear DNA followed essentially the procedure of Pil and Lippard (18Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) which utilizes different parameters, including an alternate DNA binding buffer (designated here as buffer B): 10 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mM DTT and 20% glycerol. Studies using ligase-catalyzed DNA ring closure assays indicate that HMG-1 and HMG-2 are the major sequence-independent non-histone DNA-bending proteins in mammalian nuclei(7Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 8Pil P.M. Chow C.S. Lippard S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9465-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 9Oñate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell.

M. I. Dissertation Services, Ann Arbor, MIGoogle Scholar). During the course of our recent experiments, significant variations were observed in the DNA-bending activities of different preparations of HMG-1 made by standard acid extraction methods. To avoid the possible detrimental effects of acid, a non-acid procedure for the purification of HMG-1 and HMG-2 from rat liver nuclei, a modification of the non-acid method of Adachi et al.(10Adachi Y. Mizuno S. Yoshida M. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was developed. The procedure (see “Materials and Methods” and Table 1) isolates HMG-1 and HMG-2 in high purity, yield, and activity without the use of harsh acid treatments, exposure to strong oxidizing agents (perchloric acid) (20Merck & Co.The Merck Index. Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ1983: 1028Google Scholar), acetone treatments, or multiple rounds of freeze/thawing, and the proteins are maintained under reducing conditions (in 5 mM DTT or more) throughout the isolation. The heating step in the procedure, although providing a manyfold purification of HMG-1/2 and inhibiting proteolysis (see “Materials and Methods”), may also be somewhat harmful to the proteins, as about 25% of the starting ring closure activity is lost on boiling the 0.35 M NaCl extract 3 min (Table 1). Some of this loss is probably due to trapping of HMG-1/2 protein within the heat-sensitive proteins as they are precipitated, but some may also be due to inactivation. Ideally, a future method might substitute a milder procedure for this heating step. Adachi et al.(10Adachi Y. Mizuno S. Yoshida M. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 530: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) reported that HMG-1 and 2 can be purified directly from 0.35 M NaCl extracts of porcine thymus by chromatography on PBE 94. Our experience indicates that this is probably insufficient in purifying HMG-1/2 from rat liver. Purified or partially pure preparations of non-acid-extracted HMG-1/2 were exposed to 5% PCA and/or 25% trichloroacetic acid for differing times to verify the suspicion that acids and oxidizing agents inactivate the proteins. A 4-h PCA treatment caused a significant drop in the amount of 88 bp of monomer circle formed during ring closure compared to that formed using untreated HMG-1/2 (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Densitometric quantitation shows this to be a 77% reduction in the ratio of monomer circle reaction product:total DNA for the treated sample compared to the unexposed control (data not shown). As described previously(21Hodges-Garcia Y. Hagerman P.J. Pettijohn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14621-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), short DNA fragments significantly less than ∼150 bp do not form the monomer circle reaction product in the absence of active DNA-flexing proteins as demonstrated in control reactions (lane 3). Other experiments not shown here demonstrated that exposure to PCA for times as short as 3 h gave significant losses (>35%) of ring closure activity, and the activities generally showed further decreases with increasing times of exposure. It should be noted that it is not uncommon for the HMG proteins to be exposed to PCA for several hours or longer in large scale acid-dependent purification schemes. Trichloroacetic acid was also found to be detrimental to the DNA-bending activity of HMG-1/2 (Fig. 1, lanes 4-6). After a 2-h incubation in 25% trichloroacetic acid, the neutralized HMG-1/2 (lane 5) showed a substantial loss (45%) in ring closure activity relative to the untreated control (lane 4). Another aliquot (lane 6), after sequential exposure to 5% PCA for 5 h and 25% trichloroacetic acid for 2 h, lost nearly 70% of the original ring closure activity. The above ring closure assays used amounts of HMG-1/2 less than required to convert all the DNA to monomer circles in the reactions. Under these conditions, there is a linear relationship between the amount of DNA cyclized and the amount of active HMG-1 in standard ring closure reactions (data not shown), suggesting that an observed fractional decrease in ring closure activity after acid treatment directly reflects the losses incurred. Gel mobility shift methods were developed to study the binding of HMG-1 to double-stranded DNA fragments of different sequences (see “Materials and Methods”). A typical binding titration done at high protein:DNA molar ratios shows that roughly 50% of the DNA was bound at an HMG-1 concentration of 6 nM (Fig. 2, lanes 1-4). The retarded band is assumed to represent the complex of equimolar amounts of HMG-1 and the DNA fragment, because higher concentrations of HMG-1 result in a ladder of increasingly retarded bands (data not shown). Repeats of this experiment have indicated that the Kd(app) (the apparent Kd for the equimolar protein:DNA interaction) of active HMG-1 is in the range 2-8 nM under standard conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). When HMG-1 preparations demonstrating a Kd in the 2-8 nM range were assayed in binding buffer B (see “Materials and Methods”), Kd values slightly higher (3-20 nM), but overlapping the former range, were found (Fig. 2, lanes 5-10). Acid-extracted HMG-1 preparations showed much variability in their Kd values, sometimes giving a Kd(app) of ∼10−6M or greater. The DNA binding data for several different preparations of HMG-1, including the corresponding Kd(app) of each preparation is given in Fig. 3. Also indicated (Fig. 3B) is the ring closure activity of each preparation, estimated by titrations of each in ring closure assays (data not shown). There was a consistent relationship between the Kd of an HMG-1 preparation and its ring closure activity: those with the lowest Kd values correspondingly had the highest specific ring closure activity (units/μg of HMG-1 protein). It is noteworthy that the preparation with the highest affinity for DNA (and also the most ring closure activity) was the preparation prepared by the non-acid procedure. The discrepancy between the low Kd values determined here for active HMG-1 and earlier reports that the Kd for HMG-1 was about 10−6M in buffer/salt mixtures similar to buffer B (18Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) (see also (22Butler A.P. Mardian J.K.W. Olins D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10613-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), may be attributable to purification using acids, non-ideal storage conditions, and/or use of recombinant HMG-1. Indeed, the acid-extracted preparation designated as prep 2 shows a Kd(app) approximating the previously reported values (Fig. 3). Through its ability to bind and bend double stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner, protein HMG-1 appears to be serving, at least in one of its roles, as a general accessory factor that facilitates the binding and interactions of other DNA-binding proteins (7Paull T.T. Haykinson M.J. Johnson R.C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1521-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Oñate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol.

Commun. 1994; 202: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).2 In this regard, the results of the present report are of significance in that they demonstrated that the most common purification protocols utilizing perchloric and trichloroacetic acid extraction can lead to inactivation of HMG-1 as measured by two important parameters, its ability to bind DNA with high affinity and its ability to flex double stranded DNA as measured by DNA ring closure assays. Short exposures to both PCA and trichloroacetic acid were shown to have significant detrimental effects on the ring closure activity of different non-acid-extracted preparations of HMG-1/2 (Fig. 1). These results are in agreement with several previous studies, undertaken before the DNA-bending activity of HMG-1/2 was known, which showed that these acids could affect other properties of HMG-1/2. Cockerill et al.(24Cockerill P.N. Goodwin G.H. Cary P.D. Turner C. Johns E.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 745: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), for example, saw a significant difference in the circular dichroism spectrum of perchloric acid-extracted HMG-1 versus HMG-1 prepared under nondenaturing conditions, which was interpreted as a decrease of 24% in the relative α-helical content of the acid extracted HMG-1. Their results are particularly interesting in light of the recent NMR structural determination of one of the two conserved DNA-binding domains (or boxes) of HMG-1(25Read C.M. Cary P.D. Crane-Robinson C. Driscoll P.C. Norman D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3427-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Weir H.M. Kraulis P.J. Hill C.S. Raine A.R.C. Laue E.D. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1311-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), which show it to be composed chiefly of three α-helices arranged in a V-shape, possibly providing the contacts that are responsible for constraining the DNA in a bent form. It seems possible that some of the losses in DNA-bending (and DNA-binding) activities observed in the present report for acid-extracted HMG-1 could be due to perturbations in the α-helices of these DNA binding domains. Oxidation of cysteine sulfhydryl groups, to form intramolecular disulfide bridges, has been reported to occur rapidly during purification of the HMG-1/2 proteins in the absence of reducing agents or EDTA (27Kohlstaedt L.A. King D.S. Cole R.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4562-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 28Elton T.S. Reeves R. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and to adversely affect the interaction of HMG-1/2 with histone H1(29Kohlstaedt L.A. Cole R.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 570-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although not specifically examined in the present report, oxidation of cysteines, 3 of which lie within the two DNA binding domains of mammalian HMG-1/2(30Bustin M. Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 31Landsman D. Bustin M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), could be contributing to the adverse effects of the oxidizing PCA (20Merck & Co.The Merck Index. Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ1983: 1028Google Scholar) and/or nonreducing environments seen here. The non-acid purification procedure outlined under “Materials and Methods” included 5 mM DTT in all buffers to minimize these effects. The studies of HMG-1 binding to double-stranded DNA indicated a Kd(app) in the range of 2-8 nM when the interaction utilized protein prepared in the absence of acids and/or demonstrating high levels of ring closure activity (>200 units/μg HMG-1). It was noted that this Kd differed by several orders of magnitude from published values(18Pil P.M. Lippard S.J. Science. 1992; 256: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 22Butler A.P. Mardian J.K.W. Olins D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10613-10620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments using different DNA fragments of unrelated sequence yielded similar Kd values for the same HMG-1 preparations (results not shown), indicating that DNA sequence was not responsible for the discrepancy. The finding that the lowest Kd values were obtained for non-acid-extracted HMG-1, while only acid-extracted preparations demonstrated values in the published range, suggests that past purification procedures utilizing acid extractions and other harsh treatments have led to an underestimation of the affinity of HMG-1 for DNA. Variations in the time of exposure to the acids or variations in the effects of the acids on different HMG-1 preparations may explain the wide range of binding affinities determined here for different acid extracted HMG-1 preparations and may be responsible for some of the conflicting reports in the literature about the properties of HMG-1/2. There was a consistent correspondence between the ring closure activity and Kd(app) for individual preparations of HMG-1. Such a correlation is expected since the HMG-1/2 protein must first bind the DNA before it can bend it. Previous studies suggest that the DNA binding domains themselves may be primarily responsible for the DNA-bending activities of HMG-1/2 since each domain alone mediates DNA cyclization(9Oñate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Titrations show, also as expected, that maximal ring closure activities occur at concentrations of HMG-1 above its Kd and in molar excess of the DNA fragment in the ring closure incubation (data not shown). The alternative procedure described here for purifying HMG-1/2 avoids acids and is as convenient to use as the conventional methods based on acid precipitations. In addition to producing HMG-1 and HMG-2 in high yields, purity, and activity, the early heating step in this procedure seems to minimize the proteolytic cleavage of HMG-1/2 that commonly occurs at early stages in rat liver extracts (5Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) using conventional protocols. It is anticipated that this approach will facilitate future studies of the HMG-1/2 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1572015290,"A number of studies have demonstrated that the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) UL9 protein, which is a homodimer in solution, binds to two high affinity binding sites in each origin of replication. Interaction between the proteins bound at the two sites leads to the formation of a complex nucleoprotein structure. The simplest models for this binding interaction predict two possible binding stoichiometries: 1) one UL9 dimer is bound at each site; or 2) one UL9 monomer is bound at each site so that one UL9 dimer occupies both sites. Two recent papers have addressed this issue by using indirect methods to measure the binding stoichiometry. Martin et al. (Martin, D. W., Muñoz, R. M., Oliver, D., Subler, M. A., and Deb, S.(1994) Virology 198, 71-80) reported that a monomer of [Medline] UL9 binds to a single high affinity site, and Stabell and Olivo (Stabell, E. C., and Olivo, P. D.(1993) Nucleic Acids Res. 21, 5203-5211) concluded that a dimer of UL9 binds to a single high affinity site. We have directly measured the stoichiometry of binding of the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of UL9 (t-UL9) to the origin of replication using a double-label gel shift assay. Using a short synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single UL9 binding site, one protein-DNA complex was detected in the gel shift assay, and the molar ratio of UL9 DNA binding domains to DNA binding sites in this complex was determined to be 2.0 ± 0.1 (n = 13). Using the minimal origin sequence excised from plasmid DNA, two protein-DNA complexes were detected. The binding stoichiometry of the faster migrating complex was 1.8 ± 0.1 (n = 15), and the stoichiometry of the more slowly migrating band was 3.7 ± 0.4 (n = 15). The simplest explanation for these data is that UL9 binds to the origin of replication as a homodimer with one dimer bound at both high affinity sites.

The herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1The abbreviation used is: HSVherpes simplex virus. genome contains three cis-acting regions that function as origins of replication: two identical copies of a sequence called oriS and one copy of a very closely related sequence called oriL(3Allen F.S. Gray D.M. Roberts G.P. Tinoco J.I. Biopolymers. 1972; 11: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which DNA replication is initiated at these sequences is not yet known, there is considerable information regarding both the elements of the origin sequence that are important for replication and the proteins with which the origin interacts. OriS contains at least five functional domains: two high affinity binding sites (called site I and site II or box I and box II) for UL9, a virally encoded DNA-binding protein that is known to be essential for viral DNA replication(3Allen F.S.

Sites I and II are located on the arms of a 46-base pair palindrome and separated by the A/T-rich region. Nuclease protection, chemical modification, and saturation mutagenesis studies have shown that the high affinity recognition sequence for UL9 (site I) is contained in the 10-base pair sequence 5′-CGTTCGCACT(8Elias P.

In addition, this domain also appears to mediate dimerization and protein-protein interactions between UL9 molecules(22Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14309-14315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UL9 has not been shown to unwind fully duplex DNA or to unwind preferentially origin-containing sequences(19Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3986-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 671-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, by analogy with better characterized viral initiator proteins such as the simian virus 40 T antigen or the λ O protein (reviewed in 25), UL9 may initiate HSV DNA replication by binding to the origin and unwinding a local region of DNA to allow or direct the assembly of the HSV DNA replication machinery. UL9 is a homodimer in solution (18Bruckner R.C. Crute J.J. Dodson M.S. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3986-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and binds to oriS in a cooperative manner at sites I and II(8Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol.

The simplest models for the binding of UL9 to the origin, therefore, entail the binding of either one UL9 dimer to oriS, with a monomer unit bound each at site I and site II, or two UL9 dimers bound to oriS, one each to site I and site II. It is likely that a complete understanding of the early events of viral DNA replication will depend on an accurate determination of the binding stoichiometry between UL9 and the origin. Recently, two groups have used the carboxyl-terminal 317-amino acid DNA binding domain of UL9 in a gel shift assay to measure the binding stoichiometry between UL9 and the origin. The two groups, however, obtained opposing results: Martin et al.(1Martin D.W. Muñoz R.M. Oliver D. Subler M.A. Deb S. Virology. 1994; 198: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that a monomer of UL9 binds to a single high affinity UL9 binding site; in contrast, Stabell and Olivo (2Stabell E.C. Olivo P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) concluded that a dimer of UL9 binds to a single high affinity site. These two results cannot be reconciled easily. The conclusions drawn from these gel shift assays, however, were inferential; both indirectly measured the binding stoichiometry of UL9 and oriS. We have, therefore, directly measured the stoichiometry of binding between the carboxyl-terminal DNA binding domain of UL9 and the origin of replication. In this paper, we show that two monomer DNA binding domains of UL9 bind to a single high affinity UL9 binding site. Furthermore, in the context of the intact oriS, four monomer UL9 binding sites are bound: two each to site I and site II. Wild type and recombinant baculoviruses were propagated as described previously(26O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 46-67Google Scholar). The recombinant baculovirus expressing His-tagged t-UL9 was constructed as follows. The gene fragment corresponding to the UL9 DNA binding domain, from 20708 to 21659 in the HSV-1 sequence, was cloned into the EcoRI to BglII site in the baculovirus transplacement vector pSynXIVVI+X3 (26O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 46-67Google Scholar) with the DNA sequence 5′-(CAT)6 placed immediately 5′ to the UL9 sequence. The plasmid was recombined into linear AcRP23.lacZ baculovirus DNA (PharMingen, San Diego), and occlusion-positive, lacZ-negative plaques were picked, as described(26O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 46-67Google Scholar). ∼Four × 108Sf9 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of approximately 10 plaque-forming units/cell with recombinant baculovirus encoding His-tagged t-UL9. At 36 h postinfection, the medium was replaced with leucine-free Graces medium, incubated for 1 h at 27°C, the medium replaced with fresh medium containing 5 mCi/flask of L-[2,3,4,5-3H]leucine (131 Ci/mmol) (ICN), and the cells further incubated for 10 h at 27°C. Nuclear extract was prepared as reported previously as for UL9(19Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3986-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed to equilibrium with 20 mM NaHPO4, pH 7.8, 0.5 M NaCl, 2 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A; the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the soluble fraction was applied to a 1-ml NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column (1.3 × 0.5 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 30 ml of loading buffer, then 30 ml of the same buffer at pH 6.0, and the proteins eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 0 to 0.3 M in 20 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.0, 0.5 M NaCl. The fractions were assayed for origin binding activity using a filter binding assay(19Fierer D.S. Challberg M.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3986-3995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to 0.1 ml in a Microsep 10 (Filtron), and dialyzed to equilibrium with 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol (buffer C), 0.1 M NaCl. Fifty μl of the protein extract was applied to a 3.2 × 30-mm Superose 12 PC column (Smart System, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) previously equilibrated in buffer C, 0.1 M NaCl, run at 0.1 ml/min. Twenty-five-μl fractions were collected, run on a 4-20% polyacrylamide gel(27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and evaluated by staining with silver. The gel was then soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.), dried under vacuum, and evaluated by autoradiography. The peak fractions containing 3H-labeled His-tagged t-UL9 were pooled, dialyzed into fresh buffer C, 0.1 M NaCl, and frozen at −85°C. The molar extinction coefficient of t-UL9 was determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel(28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar), using the formula ∊M,Gdn-HCl = a∊M,Tyr+ b∊M,Trp+ c/2∊M,Cys, where a, b, and c represent the number of tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine residues, respectively, in the predicted sequence of t-UL9, and ∊M represents the molar extinction coefficient. To establish the relationship between the molar extinction coefficient of the native protein (∊M,Nat) and the molar extinction coefficient of the denatured protein (∊M,Gdn·HCl), an aliquot of purified His-tagged t-UL9 was diluted either with 3 volumes of 20 mM KHPO4, pH 7.35, or 3 volumes of 8 M guanidine HCl, 20 mM KHPO4, pH 7.35, (6 M guanidine HCl, final concentration). The absorbance of the protein mixtures at 280 nm was measured using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. The ratio of ∊M,Nat to ∊M,Gdn·HCl was determined to be 0.90; adjusting for this ratio, the extinction coefficient for t-UL9 was determined to be 34,047 M−1 cm−1. The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing site I of oriS (site I oligonucleotide) was constructed by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotide strands; the top strand was 5′-GGGCGAAGCGTTCGCACTTCGTCCCAA and the bottom strand was 5′-TTGGGACGAAGTGCGAACGCTTCG, followed by purification by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The DNA was labeled by the incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) using the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. The oriS sequence used in the double-label gel shift assay was the HindIII to EcoRI fragment of pUC201 (derived from the plasmid pS201(29Lockshon D. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4018-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)). This plasmid was isolated using a Qiagen plasmid kit and was purified further by CsCl/ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation. The HindIII to EcoRI fragment was gel purified from an agarose gel and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as above. The concentration of DNA was obtained using ∊260 = 6,600 M−1 cm−1(3Allen F.S. Gray D.M. Roberts G.P. Tinoco J.I. Biopolymers. 1972; 11: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reactions (20 μl) contained 12 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 4 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM EDTA, 0.03% Tween 20, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 30 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, and the appropriate 32P-labeled ori DNA fragment. The protein was added, the reactions incubated 10 min at room temperature, and the reactions resolved by native gel polyacrylamide electrophoresis(30Lane D. Prentki P. Chandler M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 509-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were then exposed while wet to x-ray film for 4-16 h. Excised fragments of the gel were dissolved by incubation at 65°C overnight in 0.5 ml of 20% H2O2, 20% HClO4(31Carey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The vials were cooled to room temperature, 15 ml of Ready Safe liquid scintillation mixture (Beckman) was added, the vials were vortexed extensively, and the radioactivity was quantitated using a Beckman LS 5000 TA liquid scintillation counter. Two separate preparations of the site I oligonucleotide and the oriS DNA fragment were used. Thirteen protein-DNA complexes were analyzed from experiments that used the 32P-labeled site I oligonucleotide, and 15 protein-DNA complexes from each of the two lower mobility complexes were analyzed from experiments using the 32P-labeled oriS DNA fragment. Single-label and dual-label quench curves were constructed using the methods described by the manufacturer. The specific activities of the labeled protein and DNA substrates were determined after addition of an aliquot of protein or DNA to a 1.0 × 0.5-cm slice of polyacrylamide gel. The mixture was dissolved and counted as described above. The DNA binding domain of UL9 (t-UL9) was used to determine the binding stoichiometry for UL9 and oriS by using a double-label gel shift assay 2S.-j. Um and R. McMacken, personal communication.

First, t-UL9 causes a much simpler pattern in gel shift experiments than UL9, probably because it does not have a tendency to aggregate. Second, t-UL9 has been reported to be a monomer in solution, a fact that simplifies the interpretation of binding stoichiometry measurements. A recombinant baculovirus was constructed which expresses a polypeptide comprising amino acids 534-851 of UL9, with an oligo-histidine affinity tag placed at the amino terminus to facilitate the isolation of chemically homogeneous protein of high specific activity. The protein was labeled in vivo with [3H]leucine and was purified to chemical and radiochemical homogeneity in a two-step process from the infected nuclear extract using nickel-agarose affinity chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. The silver-stained polyacrylamide gel of the peak fractions from the gel permeation column and the corresponding fluorogram of the silver-stained gel are shown in Fig. 1. The minor band migrating at a slightly lower molecular weight from t-UL9 was seen in varying proportions to the major band in different t-UL9 preparations and is likely to be a proteolytic product of t-UL9.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14309-14315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the 3H-labeled His-tagged t-UL9 were the same as those described previously for similar untagged molecules. The molar extinction coefficient of His-tagged t-UL9 was calculated to be 37,830 M−1 cm−1, using the method of Gill and von Hippel(28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The absorbance at 280 nm of t-UL9 denatured with 6 M guanidinium HCl, however, was 10% lower than the absorbance of the native protein. The molar extinction coefficient of the 3H-labeled t-UL9 was therefore adjusted to 34,047 M−1 cm−1, and the specific activity was calculated to be 27,978 dpm/pmol. Varying amounts of 3H-labeled t-UL9 were mixed with a fixed amount of 32P-labeled 24-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide containing site I. The protein-DNA complexes were separated from the unbound DNA by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As seen in Fig. 2, a single lower mobility band was seen at all t-UL9 concentrations. The lower mobility complex in each lane was excised from the gel, dissolved, and the amount of 3H and 32P radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. The results from this experiment are shown (Fig. 2). The labeled bands contained 1 × 104 to 1 × 105 dpm of 3H and 32P radioactivity, with 3H dpm in approximately 3-fold excess over 32P dpm; both amounts are in a range where counting errors are negligible. In a separate experiment similar to that shown in Fig. 2, one lane of the gel was cut into 0.5-cm slices, and the radioactivity in each slice was determined. As depicted graphically in Fig. 3, the 3H-labeled protein was associated predominately with the 32P-labeled DNA and was not distributed throughout the gel. The ratio of t-UL9 monomers to UL9 binding sites was determined to be 2.0 ± 0.1 (n = 13).Figure 3Plot of radioactivity versus distance migrated. A representative lane from an experiment similar to that shown in Fig. 2 was sectioned into 0.5 × 1.0-cm slices from the well to the bottom of the gel. The slices were dissolved, counted, and the data plotted. The slower mobility peak in the plot corresponds to the position on the autoradiogram of the gel of the low mobility complex. The faster mobility peak in the plot corresponds to the position on the autoradiogram of the gel of the faster mobility complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To control for possible errors that might have been introduced by the use of a synthetic oligonucleotide, a DNA substrate prepared by a different process was also used. HSV-2 oriS was excised from highly purified plasmid DNA, endlabeled with 32P, and the labeled DNA fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel shift assay was performed as described above with the synthetic oligonucleotide. The addition of 3H-labeled t-UL9 to reactions containing this DNA fragment resulted in the appearance of two lower mobility complexes, with the faster mobility of the two predominating at low t-UL9 concentrations and the slower mobility complex predominating at higher concentrations of t-UL9 (Fig. 4). DNase I footprint analysis of the DNA in the two complexes revealed protection over sites I and II only, with more complete protection of both sites I and II in the lower mobility complex (data not shown). The ratio of monomer t-UL9 molecules to UL9 binding sites was 1.8 ± 0.1 (n = 15) for the higher mobility complex and 3.7 ± 0.4 (n = 15) for the lower mobility complex. These data are in close agreement with those obtained with the synthetic oligonucleotide that contained a single UL9 binding site. Thus, two UL9 binding domains are necessary and sufficient for binding to a single UL9 binding site. These findings, therefore, confirm the previously published results of Stabell and Olivo(2Stabell E.C. Olivo P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, these results show that four UL9 binding domains are bound to oriS. Taken together, these data are consistent with a model (Fig. 5) in which two UL9 dimers are bound to oriS, one each at site I and site II.Figure 5Model diagram depicting the binding of oriS by: A, t-UL9; and B, UL9. A/T is the A/T-rich region between the two UL9 binding sites in oriS. The bipartite shaded regions of sites I and II depict the overlapping inverted binding half-sites. The small, lightly shaded area between monomer UL9 molecules of the UL9 homodimer represents the monomer-monomer interaction between UL9 molecules of the homodimer molecule. The larger shaded regions between UL9 homodimers bound to oriS represent the interaction between UL9 homodimers as suggested by the cooperative binding of UL9 to oriS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is clear that these conclusions are critically dependent on the accuracy of the measurements. Since the standard error derived from the average of 15 independent measurements was between 1 and 3%, it seems unlikely that the conclusions are affected by random experimental error. Possible sources of systematic error, and the potential magnitude of such errors, are, however, worth noting. In addition to the quantity of 3H and 32P radioactivity present in various samples, the only other measured values in the described experiments were the chemical amounts of DNA and protein. In both cases, these quantities were determined spectrophotometrically, and therefore the conclusions depend on the accuracy of the extinction coefficients used. The extinction coefficient of double-stranded DNA at 260 nm is known precisely and is essentially independent of the sequence of the DNA(3Allen F.S. Gray D.M. Roberts G.P. Tinoco J.I. Biopolymers. 1972; 11: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, as an internal control in our determinations of the binding stoichiometry, two different DNA molecules isolated from independent sources were used, and essentially the same result was obtained with each. The specific activity of the 32P-labeled DNA, therefore, is unlikely to be a source of significant error in the calculation of the binding stoichiometry. Precise determination of the extinction coefficient of t-UL9 is somewhat more problematic. In contrast to DNA, proteins do not have a uniform extinction coefficient at 280 nm. The method of Gill and von Hippel (28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) was used to derive the extinction coefficient for t-UL9. This method is based on the demonstration by Edelhoch (40Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar) that only tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine residues contribute significantly to the measured optical density of a denatured protein at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient of the protein of interest is calculated by multiplying the number of residues of each of the three absorbing amino acids by the molar extinction coefficients of model peptides containing these residues. This method for calculating molar extinction coefficients was calibrated by calculating the extinction coefficients for 18 globular proteins whose extinction coefficients were accurately known(28Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The mean deviation between the experimental and the calculated values was +3.8%± 6%, with no deviation greater than +14.9% (for human serum albumin). Since the method was calibrated using native proteins, the largest potential error in this calculation is likely to be the effect of tertiary structure of the native protein on the absorbance of the individual absorbing amino acids. This effect was measured by comparing the absorbance at 280 nm of native and denatured t-UL9, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A small difference (10%) between the absorbance of the native and denatured proteins was observed, and the extinction coefficient of t-UL9 was adjusted appropriately. On the basis of this small difference in absorbance between the native and denatured protein and on the basis of the prior results of Gill and von Hippel, the estimated error in the calculated value for the extinction coefficient of t-UL9 is less than 15% and is likely to be much lower. Recently, two other laboratories have used gel shift assays to measure the binding stoichiometry between t-UL9 and the origin; the results of these two studies were not in agreement. Stabell and Olivo (2Stabell E.C. Olivo P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) titrated Fab fragment directed at the carboxyl terminus of UL9 into a gel shift mixture containing t-UL9 bound to a single UL9 binding site and detected two bands of lower electrophoretic mobility, suggesting that two t-UL9 molecules bound the site. Martin et al.(1Martin D.W. Muñoz R.M. Oliver D. Subler M.A. Deb S. Virology. 1994; 198: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) used in vitro transcription/translation to obtain t-UL9 and a slightly truncated t-UL9 molecule. In gel shift experiments in which both of these forms of t-UL9 were present, the investigators observed only two complexes, the mobilities of which corresponded to the mobilities of the complexes observed with each form of t-UL9 alone. This result suggested that no heterodimers between the larger and smaller polypeptides were formed during cotranslation and therefore that t-UL9 bound to a single binding site as a monomer. The disparate conclusions from these sets of experiments are difficult to reconcile; both, however, required significant assumptions about the gel shift banding pattern without knowledge of the composition of the bands. The experiments presented in this paper have significant advantages over the indirect approaches described above. Foremost, no assumptions are required as to the interpretation of the banding pattern in the gel shift experiments, as the composition of each complex was determined directly. In addition, the t-UL9 used in the double-label gel shift experiments was highly purified and well characterized, and secondary heterologous protein binding was not required for the stoichiometric determinations. The conclusions, therefore, are based on direct measurements of physical constants and require only that the labeled protein and DNA were chemically pure and that the extinction coefficient for t-UL9 was determined accurately. The results, then, confirm those of Stabell and Olivo(2Stabell E.C. Olivo P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5203-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), that t-UL9 binds to a single high affinity UL9 binding site as a dimer, and they extend the findings to demonstrate that two t-UL9 dimers bound to oriS. Taken together, the simplest interpretation of these data is that one full-length UL9 dimer binds to a single UL9 binding site and that two full-length UL9 dimers bind to oriS (Fig. 5). The underlying assumption of this model is that the results obtained with t-UL9 can be extrapolated directly to what occurs with the full-length protein. Other more complicated models, however, are consistent with the available data. For example, it is possible that full-length UL9 monomers comprising a UL9 dimer are oriented so that the two monomeric units cannot both bind to the same DNA binding site. According to this model, a single binding site would be occupied by two UL9 dimers, with two unoccupied monomeric units available to bind to another site. To address this question, the double-label gel shift experiment was employed using -3H-labeled full-length UL9. As has been reported previously(23Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14309-14315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), UL9 and the site I oligonucleotide formed a large number of complexes that were resolvable by gel electrophoresis. Moreover, the complexes did not differ in the protein:DNA ratio by an integral number of UL9 molecules, nor was there a monotonic increase or decrease in the protein:DNA ratio of the complexes as a function of electrophoretic mobility (data not shown). We currently have no simple interpretation of these data, although we assume that the large number of protein-DNA complexes formed with full-length UL9 is related to its tendency to aggregate. In any case, these data do not distinguish between the model presented in Fig. 5 and alternative models. The binding of two t-UL9 monomers to a specific binding site is highly cooperative, since no intermediate t-UL9-site I complex containing a single monomer of t-UL9 was detected (see Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The simplest explanation for this high degree of cooperativity is that t-UL9 monomers interact with each other. As noted above, t-UL9 is a monomer in solution, at least at concentrations less than ∼1 × 10−6M. Higher order association between t-UL9 molecules in concentrated solutions has been observed, however, 3E. C. Stabell and P. D. Olivo, personal communication. 4D. S. Fierer and M. D. Challberg, unpublished results. and experiments designed to confirm this finding using highly purified protein are in progress. There are also other possible explanations for the highly cooperative nature of t-UL9 binding to site I. For example, it has been reported that UL9 binding to the origin distorts the DNA near its binding site(39Koff A. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3284-3292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the change in free energy associated with this DNA conformational change contributes to cooperativity. Alternatively, the t-UL9 may undergo conformational changes upon binding to DNA that increase the magnitude of protein-protein interactions. A rigorous analysis of the energetics of UL9-DNA interactions will be required to distinguish among these possibilities. The finding that two UL9 DNA binding domains bind to a single binding site predicts that the DNA sequence of the binding site should contain a 2-fold axis of symmetry. The consensus 10-base pair UL9 recognition site 5′-CGTTCGCACT, however, does not contain a simple 2-fold axis of symmetry. Koff and Tegtmeyer (12Koff A. Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4096-4103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that similar to the SV40 T antigen recognition sequence, site I is composed of inverted overlapping repeats that could be the binding half-sites for UL9. A more recent mutational analysis of oriS by Hazuda et al.(9Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has provided data consistent with this hypothesis. Although it would be without precedent, it is also possible that the UL9 homodimer binds asymmetrically to DNA. Further, more detailed investigation of the binding of UL9 to its recognition sequence will be required to determine the exact nature of this binding interaction."

Conditional stimulation of AC by βγ has been hypothesized to integrate cross-talk between G<sub>s</sub>- and non-G<sub>s</sub>-coupled regulation of cellular cAMP (Tang, W. J., and Gilman, A. G.(1991) <i>Science</i> 254, 1500-1503). Although [Medline] observations in cells expressing recombinant receptors, G<sub>α</sub>s, and AC support this hypothesis (Federman, A. D., Conklin, B. R., Schrader, K. A., Reed, R. R., and Bourne, H. R.(1992) <i>Nature</i> 356, 159-161), this mechanism has not been investigated in differentiated cells. Expression of AC II has been reported only in lung, olfactory, and brain tissue. We found that rat lung alveolar type II cells express AC II and IV. Therefore, we hypothesized that βγ conditionally stimulates AC in type II cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist UK14304 did not affect basal cAMP in type II cells but potentiated terbutaline-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin partially inhibited terbutaline-stimulated cAMP accumulation and completely inhibited the effects of UK14304. In type II cell membranes, purified βγ tripled the terbutaline-stimulated increase in AC activity. In contrast, βγ inhibited AC activity in the absence of terbutaline. The addition of purified G<sub>oα</sub> blocked βγ-induced effects. In summary, type II cells expressing endogenous AC II and IV regulate cAMP accumulation and AC activity in a manner consistent with conditional stimulation by βγ. These observations support the overall hypothesis that conditional stimulation of AC by βγ integrates cross-talk between signal transduction systems in differentiated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1609032905,"The 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen gene (BPAG1) is expressed exclusively in basal keratinocytes of epidermis. In this study, we have identified a novel cis-element, keratinocyte responsive element 3 (KRE3), at position −216 to −197 of the human BPAG1 gene. A promoter-CAT construct containing this element had ∼50-fold higher expression than a similar construct devoid of this sequence when tested in transient transfections of cultured human keratinocytes. However, there was no effect on the low base-line level of expression in cultured skin fibroblasts. KRE3 contains a palindromic sequence 5′-CAAATATTTG-3′, and mutations in this sequence significantly reduced the promoter activity. Gel mobility shift assays with an oligomer containing KRE3 sequence demonstrated binding activity with nuclear proteins isolated from keratinocytes. One of the DNA/protein complexes was clearly specific, since competition with >12.5-fold excess of the unlabeled oligomer resulted in disappearance of this band. No specific binding activity was noted with nuclear proteins extracted from fibroblasts. Thus, KRE3 appears to serve as the binding site for keratinocyte-specific trans-activating factor(s), and KRE3 may thus confer the tissue-specific expression to the BPAG1 gene.

Bullous pemphigoid (BP) 1The abbreviations used are: BPBullous pemphigoidKREkeratinocyte responsive elementKTPkeratinocyte transcriptional proteinCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasekbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)NHKnormal human keratinocyteNHFnormal human fibroblast. is a blistering skin disease characterized by circulating IgG autoantibodies which recognize two distinct proteins, the 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG1) and the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BPAG2) (Stanley, 1989; Uitto and Christiano, 1992). These two proteins are components of hemidesmosomes, attachment structures anchoring the basal keratinocytes to the underlying cutaneous basement membrane (Uitto and Christiano, 1992). Recent cDNA cloning and chromosomal mapping of the BP antigen genes have clearly demonstrated that BPAG1 and BPAG2 are distinct gene products (Sawamura et al., 1992). Specifically, cloning of BPAG1 has demonstrated that the 230-kDa protein is a non-collagenous intracellular component of hemidesmosomal plaque (Tanaka et al., 1991; Sawamura et al., 1991a, 1991b). In contrast, the 180-kDa BP antigen is a transmembrane collagenous protein (Giudice et al., 1991, 1992; Hopkinson et al., 1992; Li et al., 1992), recently designated as type XVII collagen (Li et al., 1993). In addition to cDNA cloning, the entire gene structure and the intron-exon organization of human BPAG1 has been delineated (Tamai et al., 1993). The gene has been shown to consist of 22 distinct exons spanning ∼20 kb of the genomic DNA in the short arm of human chromosome 6 (Sawamura et al., 1990; Tamai et al., 1993). Bullous pemphigoid keratinocyte responsive element keratinocyte transcriptional protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) normal human keratinocyte normal human fibroblast. The expression of the BPAG1 in skin, as determined at the mRNA level, has been shown to be limited to keratinocytes with proliferative, basal keratinocyte-like phenotype (Arnemann et al., 1993). The specificity of the expression of this gene has also been demonstrated by transient cell transfections utilizing BPAG1 promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene constructs (Tamai et al., 1993). The latter studies revealed a marked, >20-fold higher expression in cultured human keratinocytes, as compared with dermal fibroblasts. Previously, we have identified a specific cis-regulatory element, designated as keratinocyte responsive element 2 (KRE2), with the nucleotide sequence 5′-TGGTTCCCTAAGGCTAGTT-3′ (Tamai et al., 1993, 1994). This sequence, which resides in the position −1,786 to −1,778 (upstream from the transcription initiation site) within the BPAG1 promoter, contains an AP2 binding site (underlined in the sequence). Elimination of KRE2 sequence from the BPAG1 promoter/CAT constructs significantly reduced the promoter activity in keratinocytes, whereas cloning of the KRE2 sequence in front of the truncated BPAG1 promoter/CAT construct re-established the high level of keratinocyte-specific expression. It was noted, however, that elimination of the KRE2 sequence resulted only in about 60% reduction in the CAT activity in transient keratinocyte transfections, although this activity was still significantly higher than the corresponding activity noted in fibroblasts transfected in parallel. We concluded, therefore, that additional factors are necessary for keratinocyte-specific expression of the BPAG1 gene. In this study, we have identified a novel nucleotide sequence within the human BPAG1 promoter in the position −216 to −196. This sequence clearly confers keratinocyte-specific expression to the BPAG1 promoter/CAT construct, in comparison with fibroblasts which do not express the endogenous gene, as determined at the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we provide evidence which suggests that distinct binding proteins are necessary for the KRE3 activity. Keratinocyte cultures were established from skin samples obtained during cosmetic surgery procedures. The cultures were maintained in serum-free, low calcium (0.15 mM) keratinocyte growth medium which is supplemented with epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, insulin, and bovine pituitary extract (KGM, Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA). The cell cultures were passaged by trypsinization and studied in passage 2. Adult human skin fibroblast cultures were established from similar tissue specimens by explantation method, and the cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calfs serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Fibroblast cultures were examined in passages 2-5. For Northern hybridizations, total RNA was isolated from cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts by a single-step extraction procedure (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987). Total RNA, 30 μg/lane, was fractionated on 1.0% agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Sambrook et al., 1989). The filters were prehybridized and hybridized with the following cDNAs. For detection of BPAG1 mRNA, a 2.3-kb human cDNA (Sawamura et al., 1991a) was used; for detection of type I collagen mRNA, a 1.8-kb α2(I) collagen cDNA (Myers et al., 1981) was used; for detection of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, a 1.3-kb human cDNA (ATCC) was used. The cDNAs were labeled radioactive with [α-32P] CTP and [α-32P] GTP by nick translation using a commercial kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The filters were washed to the final stringency of 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. The filters were then exposed to x-ray films for varying time periods up to 48 h. For immunostaining, keratinocytes and fibroblasts were cultured on glass chamber slides under conditions described above. The slides were then fixed in cold (−20°C) ethanol, rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, and preincubated for 60 min with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then exposed to a human monoclonal anti-human 230-kDa BP antigen antibody (Sugi et al., 1989). After overnight incubation at 4°C, the slides were washed with Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Miles Laboratories). Control cultures were incubated with the secondary antibody only, which gave essentially negative staining. After a 60-min incubation at room temperature, the slides were washed with Tris-buffered saline for 60 min, rinsed with distilled water, mounted, and examined with a fluorescent microscope. A series of human BPAG1 promoter/CAT reporter gene plasmids, containing a human BPAG1 promoter region of varying size, were used for transient transfections of cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts. These cultures were also transfected with a human α2(I) collagen promoter/CAT construct (Boast et al., 1990), type I collagen being a characteristic gene product of dermal fibroblasts (see Uitto and Chu(1988)). The cells were co-transfected with a RSV/β-gal construct, which was used as an internal control of transfection efficiency. The transfections of keratinocytes were performed with a commercial kit (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim), and fibroblasts were transfected with the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (Sambrook et al., 1989). After 24 h of incubation, CAT activity was determined in cultures by incubating cell extracts with [14C]chloramphenicol as substrate, followed by separation of its acetylated and non-acetylated forms by thin layer chromatography (Sambrook et al., 1989). The promoter activity was determined by counting the radioactivity in the acetylated forms of chloramphenicol, expressed as percent of the total radioactivity in the sample, after correction for the β-galactosidase activity in the same cell extract. For DNA binding assays, nuclear proteins were isolated from cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts using a small-scale preparation technique (Schreiber et al., 1989). For the binding assay, double-stranded oligomers were end labeled with 32P, and aliquots containing approximately 5 × 104 cpm was incubated with 8 μg of nuclear protein extracts, as described previously (Tamai et al., 1994). In some reactions, a competing oligomer in 12.5-100-fold excess was added as a competitor. After the binding reaction, DNA-protein complexes were fractionated on 4% polyacrylamide gels under nondenaturing conditions, as described elsewhere (Tamai et al., 1994). The gels were dried, and autoradiographs were developed by exposure to x-ray films with intensifying screens at −70°C. Previous studies have suggested that the BPAG1 gene is specifically expressed in epidermal keratinocytes (see Stanley(1989)). In this study, we have examined the specificity of the keratinocyte expression by parallel comparison of cutaneous epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. To verify the cell type-specific expression in the cultures of these cells, immunofluorescence and Northern analyses were performed on normal human keratinocytes and fibroblasts (Fig. 1, A and B). Northern analyses were performed with a BPAG1 cDNA, as well as with an α2(I) collagen cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1, two different cell strains of normal human keratinocytes clearly expressed the BPAG1 mRNA with the apparent size of ∼9 kb, whereas no evidence of the corresponding mRNA in two different normal human fibroblast strains was noted. In contrast, type I collagen mRNAs (5.8 and 4.8 kb transcripts) were evident in fibroblast cultures, whereas there was no expression of this gene in keratinocytes (Fig. 1). The presence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was noted in both types of cells (Fig. 1B). The selective expression of the BPAG1 gene in keratinocytes was confirmed at the protein level by indirect immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody recognizing a 230-kDa BP antigen epitope. Bright immunofluorescence staining was noted on keratinocytes, whereas fibroblasts displayed only background staining (Fig. 1A), similar to that observed in negative controls stained with secondary antibody alone (not shown). To demonstrate the selective expression of these genes at the transcriptional level, keratinocytes and fibroblasts were transfected with a BPAG1- or an α2(I)-collagen-promoter/CAT reporter gene construct in parallel. The BPAG1/CAT construct used for transfection contained 296 bp of 5′-flanking sequence upstream from the transcription initiation site. Keratinocytes clearly expressed the BPAG1/CAT construct, whereas no evidence for CAT activity was noted in fibroblast cultures (Fig. 2). Conversely, activity of the α2(I) collagen-promoter/CAT containing 3.2 kb of 5′-flanking DNA was clearly detected in fibroblasts, whereas no evidence for the expression of this construct in keratinocytes was noted (Fig. 2). Thus, normal human keratinocytes in culture selectively express the BPAG1 promoter, as compared with normal human fibroblasts which do not express this gene at the mRNA or protein levels. These results also indicate that the cis-elements conferring keratinocyte-specific expression to the BPAG1 gene reside within 0.3 kb of the 5′-flanking DNA. To pinpoint the sequences responsible for the keratinocyte-specific expression of the BPAG1 gene, 5′ deletion libraries of the promoter/CAT construct were developed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Truncation of the clone pBP296 CAT from the 5′ end to −176 resulted in complete loss of keratinocyte-specific expression, and this loss of specificity was similarly evident in three additional clones with their 5′ ends at −106, −56 and −26, examined under identical conditions (Fig. 3). To define more precisely the keratinocyte-specific element(s) within the region extending from −296 to −176, several additional 5′ deletion clones were developed. As shown in Fig. 4, the relative CAT activity remained essentially unaltered as a result of truncation of the construct pBP296CAT down to −216. However, further deletion of 20 bp, to generate the clone pBP196CAT, resulted in complete loss of the CAT activity (Fig. 4). This segment was designated as keratinocyte responsive element 3 (KRE3). Examination of the nucleotide sequence between −216 and −197 revealed the presence of a palindromic sequence, 5′-CAAATATTTG-3′. This sequence was just upstream from the canonical CAAT box, 5′-CCAAT-3′, and an overlapping SP1 site, 5′-CGCCC-3′ (asterisks in Fig. 4). To further characterize the role of the KRE3 region in providing keratinocyte-specific expression to the BPAG1 promoter, nucleotide substitutions were introduced to this region by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers with altered sequence. The mutated promoter constructs were then tested in transient transfections of keratinocyte cultures in parallel. One of the mutated constructs (M5), containing two adjacent nucleotide substitutions, was expressed at the same level as the control promoter construct, pBP216 CAT (Fig. 5). Substitution of the two most 5′ nucleotides (M1) or central nucleotides (M4) resulted in 48 and 24% inhibition of the activity, respectively (Fig. 5). However, substitution of two As by Ts (construct M2) or two Ts by As (construct M3) significantly (78 and 68%, respectively) decreased the promoter activity (Fig. 5). The nucleotide substitutions in the M2 and M3 constructs were within the palindromic 10-bp segment (Fig. 5, underlined). Thus, this core sequence within KRE3 may play a critical role in providing tissue specificity to the BPAG1 expression. To examine the putative functionality of the KRE3 sequence, nuclear proteins were isolated from keratinocytes, and gel mobility shift assays with the 20-bp oligonucleotide corresponding to KRE3 were performed, as shown in Fig. 6. Incubation of the oligomer extending from −216 to −196 with the nuclear protein extracts from keratinocytes resulted in the formation of three distinct DNA/protein complexes (Fig. 6, second lanes). The binding in band a was specific, since competition with a 100-fold excess of the same unlabeled oligomer resulted in disappearance of this band (Fig. 6, third lanes). This displacement by competitor was noted in separate experiments with as little as 12.5-fold excess of the same oligomer (not shown). However, the DNA/protein complexes b and c were still detectable after competition, suggesting less specific binding. Furthermore, a 100-fold excess of an oligomer overlapping with the 3′ end of KRE3 but devoid of the palindromic sequence as a competitor failed to abolish the formation of the complex a (Fig. 6, fourth lanes). Similar gel mobility shift assays were performed with the 20-bp KRE3 oligomer using nuclear extracts from cultured dermal fibroblasts (NHF). No specific binding activity similar to the bands noted with keratinocyte protein extracts could be detected in fibroblasts (Fig. 6). Thus, keratinocytes appear to contain specific binding protein(s) which interact with the KRE3 within the BPAG1 promoter. Expression of the BPAG1 gene, encoding the 230-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen, is highly restricted, as determined both at the protein and the mRNA levels (Jordan et al., 1967, 1971; Mutasim et al., 1985; Sawamura et al., 1991a, 1991b; Tamai et al., 1993). Specifically, this gene is expressed only in stratifying squamous epithelia, such as the epidermis, and its expression within the epidermis is limited to basal keratinocytes with mitotic phenotype. We have previously identified a cis-acting element, KRE2, which resides within the BPAG1 promoter region at position −1786 to −1778 (Tamai et al., 1993, 1994). We demonstrated that elimination of KRE2 from the promoter region cloned in CAT constructs significantly reduced the expression of the BPAG1 promoter in transient transfection of keratinocytes, whereas it had no effect on the low level of expression in fibroblasts. The KRE2 had sequence similarity with the AP2 consensus binding site, and in fact, AP2 trans-activating factor was able to bind to an oligomer containing the KRE2 sequence in gel mobility shift assays (Tamai et al., 1994). More importantly, however, we were able to demonstrate a novel keratinocyte-specific binding protein, KTP-1, which was binding to the KRE2 sequence. Utilizing gel mobility shift assays, UV cross-linking studies, and Southwestern analysis, we clearly demonstrated that KTP-1 is distinct from AP2 in molecular size and subunit composition, but has similar binding activities (Tamai et al., 1994). In this study, we have identified a novel keratinocyte-responsive element, KRE3, a 20-bp segment at −216 to −196, which appears to be necessary for keratinocyte-specific expression of the gene. Elimination of KRE3 from BPAG1 promoter/CAT constructs abolished the promoter activity in keratinocytes, and similarly, introduction of distinct point mutations within the KRE3 region significantly suppressed the promoter activity. The critical region within KRE3 appeared to consist of a palindromic sequence, 5′-CAAATATTTG-3′. In this context, it is of interest that several regulatory cis-elements, such as the binding sites for AP1 and AP2, similarly demonstrate a palindromic sequence (Angel et al., 1987; Williams and Tjian, 1991). Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated three bands with binding activity, one of them being specific, as illustrated by competition assays. The specific nature of this binding activity is currently unknown, but the KRE3 binding site is clearly distinct from that for AP2. Thus, it is conceivable that KRE3 plays a critical role in providing tissue-specific expression to the BPAG1 gene. Several other genes, in addition to BPAG1, are also expressed exclusively in the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis, including the BPAG2 gene encoding the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen, as well as keratin 5 and 14 genes (KRT5 and KRT14). In case of the genes encoding epidermal keratins, there is considerable evidence for the role of AP2 in participating in the keratinocyte-specific expression (Leask et al., 1990, 1991; Snape, 1990, 1991; Byrne and Fuchs, 1993). In particular, in KRT14 promoter region, an AP2 site within −220 plays a critical role in providing tissue-specific expression, and elimination of this element reduces the overall activity of the promoter. However, an additional contribution to the tissue-specificity is provided by an upstream distal element between −2,100 and −1,700. This distal element appears to act in concert with the proximal AP2 element in the KRT14 promoter to confer keratinocyte specificity (Leask et al., 1990). In case of KRT5, deletion of an AP2 binding site at position −104 to −94, as well as mutations in this cis-element, reduced the overall level of KRT5 expression in cultured keratinocytes (Byrne and Fuchs, 1993). However, in either case was the cell type specificity preserved, a result which was confirmed in transgenic mice. Thus, it appears that in case of KRT5 gene expression, AP2 is implicated primarily in regulating the level of gene expression, but this regulatory element does not contribute appreciably to the epithelial cell-specific expression which is displayed by the 90-bp segment of promoter in transgenic animals. Collectively, it appears that the epithelial cell-specific expression of the KRT5 gene is regulated by two protein complexes (see Byrne and Fuchs(1993)). One of them, complex 1-2, binds close to the transcription initiation site, whereas the other, complex 4, binds in the vicinity of the TATA box. As indicated above, BPAG1, as well as KRT5 and KRT14, are expressed exclusively in the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis in vivo, and their expression is not at all detectable at the suprabasal level. At the same time, the terminal differentiation of the epidermal keratinocytes involves induction of keratin 1 and 10 gene expression (Fuchs and Green, 1980; Moll et al., 1982). Furthermore, the expression of other suprabasal genes, including desmosomal proteins and the cornified envelope genes, will be activated (Steinert and Roop, 1988; Huff et al., 1993; Saunders et al., 1993). The mechanisms for suppression of BPAG1 gene expression in the suprabasal keratinocytes are currently not known. However, since inactivation of KRE3 results in complete loss of BPAG1 gene expression, the lack of trans-activation of KRE3 could potentially explain down-regulation of this gene in suprabasal levels. Of particular interest to the epidermal differentiation process is a recent discovery of a gene family characterized by a bipartite binding motif referred to as the POU domain (Sturm et al., 1988; Ko et al., 1988; Clerc et al., 1988). These domains serve as binding sites for cell-specific transcription factors, many of which have been suggested to be important in terminal differentiation of neuronal, pituitary, and B lymphocyte cell types, respectively (see Andersen et al., 1993). These differentiation processes have been suggested to be mediated by cell-specific trans-activating factors, including Oct-2 (see Schöler, 1991). In addition, Oct-1 is a ubiquitous activator of gene programs required for cell proliferation and may also play a cell-specific role (Fletcher et al., 1987; Tanaka et al., 1988; Verrijzer et al., 1990; Luo et al., 1992). Recently, two functionally distinct trans-activating factors, Skn-1a and Skn-1i, which are highly related to Oct-2, have been shown to be selectively expressed in terminally differentiating epidermis (Anderson et al., 1993). The two factors are members of the POU domain family of transcriptional regulators. One of these factors, Skn-1i, contains an amino-terminal domain that inhibits DNA binding and can inhibit trans-activation of genes by Oct-1. The second form, Skn-1a, contains an alternative amino terminus and serves specifically to activate keratin 10 gene expression (Anderson et al., 1993). These two factors are products of alternative RNA splicing, and Skn-1a contains 113 unique amino acids at the NH2 terminus replacing 31 amino acid residues in Skn-1i. Expression of a mutant Skn-1i lacking 60 amino acids from the amino terminus also activated the KRT10 promoter. It is likely, therefore, that the critical function of NH2-terminal sequences of Skn-1a is to relieve the action of the Skn-1i inhibitory domain, rather than to serve as a trans-activation domain (Anderson et al., 1993). Collectively, these data suggest that the Skn-1a/i system represents tissue-restricted POU domain factors that exert selective activating and inhibiting functions in developing epidermis. Similar mechanisms may be operative in allowing expression of other suprabasal genes, such as KRT1, desmosomal cadherins, and the cornified envelope proteins. Conversely, an analogous system could be regulating the expression of BPAG1, as well as KRT5 and KRT14, by limiting their expression to the basal keratinocytes. In conclusion, our data on BPAG1, together with previous studies on other epidermal-specific genes, such as keratins (Fuchs and Green, 1980), suggest that the mechanisms governing the cell-specific and differentiation-specific gene expression are complex, and both positive and negative regulatory systems may explain the tightly controlled expression during developmental organogenesis and physiologic terminal differentiation of epidermis.

A complete understanding of the mechanism of transduction of chemical energy into mechanical energy necessitates a description of the structural changes in the actomyosin interface in connection with the biochemical steps. The recent determinations of the three-dimensional structures of actin(6Kabsch W. Mannherz H.C. Suck D. Pai E. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar), of the myosin head(7Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Weisenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar), and the combination of these crystallographic data with the low resolution electron microscopy structure of the decorated filament (8Milligan R.A. Whittaker M. Safer D. Nature. 1990; 348: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) have led to a structural model for the F-actin-myosin subfragment-1 rigor complex(9Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar). An alternative approach to the functional changes in the actomyosin interface consists in characterizing the small size complexes formed between the myosin head and monomeric actin. These complexes, which are precursors in the myosin subfragment-1 (S1)-induced polymerization of G-actin into decorated filaments, are helpful to define the minimum actin-S1 contractile unit. It was found (10Valentin-Ranc C. Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17872-17879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that S1 forms binary (GS) and ternary (G2S) tight complexes with G-actin at low ionic strength and in the absence of ATP. Both nucleotide effects on the stability of GS and G2S and cross-linking studies (11Combeau C. Didry D. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14038-14046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the G-actin-S1 interface is very similar to the F-actin-S1 interface in the rigor state. The second step in the polymerization process of G-actin induced by S1 appears to be the condensation of G2S units in small oligomers (12Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21543-21550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which emphasizes the functional relevance of the interaction of the myosin head with two actin molecules. The interaction of the myosin head with two actin subunits, adjacent along the long pitch helix of the filament, is also an essential feature of the structural model of the actin-myosin rigor complex(9Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar), which may have important implications in the mechanism of force generation. The present paper is a kinetic analysis of the interaction of monomeric pyrenyl-G-actin with the two myosin subfragment-1 isoforms carrying either the A1 or the A2 light chain. The pyrene probe has previously been used to characterize the interaction of S1 with F-actin (13Coates J.A. Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17872-17879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of G-actin interaction with S1(A1) and S1(A2) presented here confirm the existence of GS and G2S complexes with both S1 isoforms and show that G2S is more easily dissociated by MgATP than GS, which may have implications in muscle contraction. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder (16Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Eisenberg E. Kielley W.W. J. Biol.

Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) at 4°C in G buffer (5 mM Tris-Cl− pH 7.8, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM CaCl, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.01% NaN3). Actin was fluorescently labeled on Cys374 using pyrene iodoacetamide(19Kouyama T. Mihashi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The labeling stoichiometry was routinely 0.80-1.0. The 1:1 complex ATP-G actin without free ATP was prepared by treatment of CaATP-G-actin solutions in G buffer with Dowex 1-X8 equilibrated in G0 buffer (i.e. G buffer containing no ATP) (20Mockrin S. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5358-5363Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Myosin was purified from rabbit back and leg muscles as described (21Offer G. Moos C. Starr R. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 74: 653-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) up to the ammonium sulfate fractionation step (included) and stored at 6-10 mg/ml at −20°C in 75 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA and 50% glycerol. Chymotryptic myosin subfragment-1 (22Weeds A. Pope B. J. Mol.

Carlier M.-F. J. Biol.

Both actin and S1 were used within 2 weeks following purification. Just prior to the experiments, S1 was rapidly equilibrated in G0 buffer by 1-h dialysis using Spectra Por 2 membranes. 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. Bovine pancreatic DNaseI grade II was purchased from Boehringer and purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography(23Price P.A. Liu T.Y. Stein W.H. Moore S. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 917-923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of DNaseI was determined by titration of an aliquot of the purified preparation by G-actin using the DNase inhibition assay(24Blikstad I. Markey F. Carlsson L. Persson T. Lindberg U. Cell. 1978; 15: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 25Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The DNA substrate was bought from Sigma. Actin and S1 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically as described(12Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21543-21550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of reaction of S1(A1) or S1(A2) with pyrenyl-labeled G-actin was monitored by fluorescence using a stopped-flow (DX.17 MV, Applied Photophysics), with the excitation monochromator set at 366 nm and a KV 380 Schott filter placed on the emission beam. Experiments were carried out in G0 buffer at 4°C, to avoid the formation of actin-S1 oligomers(12Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21543-21550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal was analyzed using a software attached to the instrument. The dead time of the apparatus was 0.8 ms. Dissociation of G-actin S1 complexes by nucleotides was carried out as follows. One of the drive syringes contained either calcium nucleotide (prepared as an equimolar CaCl2-nucleotide mixture diluted to the desired concentrations in buffer G0), or magnesium nucleotide (prepared in the same way but diluted in buffer G0 containing 100 μM MgCl2 instead of 100 μM CaCl2). The other drive syringe contained the G-actin-S1 complex rapidly preformed at 0°C immediately before being brought in the syringe. For experiments with magnesium nucleotide, G-actin-S1 was in buffer G0 containing only 10 μM CaCl2 so that after mixing the nucleotide was 90% magnesium nucleotide. Examination of both the amplitudes and the kinetics of the change in pyrenyl-actin fluorescence upon interaction with S1, in series of experiments in which the concentrations of either pyrenyl-G-actin or S1 were varied, led us to propose the minimum kinetic model able to account for the data. Values of equilibrium dissociation constants and intrinsic fluorescence of the different actin and actin-S1 complexes were derived from the actin and S1 concentration dependences of the amplitudes and observed rate constants as described under “Appendix.” Time courses of the change in pyrene fluorescence under various experimental conditions were simulated according to this proposed model, using the KINSIM softwares kindly provided to us by Drs. Carl Frieden and Thomas Pollard. Values of yet undetermined rate constants were then adjusted to obtain the best fit of simulated kinetic curves to experimental stopped-flow traces. In a first series of experiments, pyrenyl G-actin at a constant concentration (2 μM) was rapidly mixed with S1(A1) or S1(A2) at different concentrations in the range 0-20 μM. The resulting increase in pyrene fluorescence fitted a single exponential process at all S1 concentrations. Fig. 1a shows typical time courses of the reaction at three different concentrations of S1(A1) and the exponential best fit. In a second series of experiments, the concentration of S1 was kept constant (0.4 μM), and the concentration of pyrenyl-G-actin was varied. In the whole range of actin concentrations (0-2 μM), the time courses of the increase in pyrene fluorescence were again well fitted by monoexponentials (Fig. 1b). The actin and S1 concentration dependences of the amplitudes and kobs were analyzed as follows. When the concentration of pyrenyl-G-actin was constant, the amplitude of the fluorescence change showed a saturation behavior upon increasing S1(A1) or S1(A2) concentration. As illustrated in Fig. 2, and in agreement with previous static fluorescence titration curves(12Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21543-21550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all data points fell above the stoichiometric line corresponding to the formation of a 1:1 GS complex of infinitely high affinity and were close below the stoichiometric line corresponding to a 2:1 G2S complex of infinitely high affinity. Similar data were obtained with S1(A1) and S1(A2), S1(A1) displaying an apparently slightly higher affinity than S1(A2). The amplitude of the fluorescence change was maximum at 2-3 μM S1 and did not show any further increase with up to 20 μM S1. The maximum increase in pyrenyl G-actin fluorescence at saturation by S1 was 2.1-fold in satisfactory agreement with the 3.3-fold enhancement observed (10Valentin-Ranc C. Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17872-17879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in equilibrium measurements performed with higher spectral resolution of excitation and emission wavelengths. When the concentration of S1 was constant the dependence of the amplitude of the fluorescence change on G-actin concentration, shown in Fig. 3, was consistent with the formation of a tight G2S complex when S1 was saturated by G-actin. Note that interpretation of the fluorescence titration curve of S1 by G-actin within the formation of a single 1:1 GS complex would imply that the affinity is low (KD∼ 0.3 μM), and this interpretation would be totally inconsistent with the titration of G-actin by S1 shown in Fig. 2. Solid curves in Figure 2, Figure 3 are calculated within, (see “Appendix”), and values of parameters shown in Table 1.Tabled 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Analysis of the rate constants showed the following. When G-actin was constant, the observed first-order rate constant for the fluorescence increase varied with S1 in a sigmoïdal fashion, as shown in Fig. 4, between two limits of 50 s−1 at low S1 to 200 s−1 at saturating S1 (20-30 μM). On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 5, when S1 was constant, the observed first-order rate constant decreased upon increasing G-actin from ∼100 s−1 to a lower limit of 55-60 s−1 at high G-actin. The fact that the rates reach a limit indicates that the change in fluorescence monitors a conformation change following the formation of rapid equilibrium complexes. However, the complex formed when G-actin is saturated by S1 (k = 200 s−1) is not identical to the one obtained when S1 is saturated by G-actin (k = 55 s−1). Hence the kinetic data confirm the interpretation of previous (10Valentin-Ranc C. Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17872-17879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and present amplitude data and lead to the conclusion that the rate constant of 200 s−1 represents the sum of the rate constants for isomerization of a 1:1 GS complex, while the rate constant of 55-60 s−1 represents the sum of the rate constants for isomerization of a 2:1 G2S complex. The sigmoidal appearance of the change in kobsversus S1 (Fig. 4) reflects the fact that, as illustrated in Fig. 10a under “Appendix,” the formation of G2S* is the predominant reaction (k = 55 s−1) at low S1, and the formation of GS∗ (k = 200 s−1) becomes increasingly predominant upon increasing S1. The converse argument holds for the decrease in kobs upon increasing G-actin at constant S1 (compare Fig. 5 and 10b).Figure 5G-actin concentration dependence of the first-order rate constant for interaction of pyrenyl G-actin with S1.

G+S⇔K1GS⇔K−3K+3GS∗GS+G⇔K2G2S⇔K−4K+4G2S∗ In the above scheme, GS and G2S are rapid equilibrium complexes. The fluorescence change is associated to the isomerization steps leading to GS* and G2S*. This scheme therefore represents an extension of the one previously proposed (10Valentin-Ranc C. Combeau C. Carlier M.-F. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17872-17879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which no isomerization of GS and G2S was included. The details of the procedure used to derive the analytical expression of the fluorescence change at equilibrium within, to fit the values of the equilibrium dissociation constants to the data, to derive the rate constants, and simulate the kinetic curves are all given under “Appendix.” Fig. 1, a and b, show the superimposed experimental and calculated time courses at a constant G-actin (resp. S1) concentration and varying S1 (resp. G-actin) in a 10-20-fold concentration range. The simulated time courses were consistent with monoexponentials. The calculated rate constants varied with either S1 or G-actin in a manner quantitatively consistent with experimental data (large symbols in Figure 4, Figure 5), which confirmed the validity of. In all experiments presented in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, G-actin has CaATP as bound nucleotide. Since under physiological conditions actin has MgATP as bound nucleotide, supplementary experiments were carried out in which CaATP-pyrenyl-G-actin 1:1 complex at a concentration ≤4 μM was rapidly converted into MgATP-G-actin by addition of 15 μM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM EGTA 3 min before being rapidly mixed with S1. The amplitude of the pyrene fluorescence change upon addition of S1 gave titration curves (data not shown) superimposable with those obtained in Figure 2, Figure 3(controls with CaATP-G-actin from the same preparation were run in parallel in the same experiment). The rate constants for the isomerizations, k+3+ k−3 and k+4+ k−4, were 80 s−1 for GS → GS∗ and 30 s−1 for G2S → G2S* transitions, respectively, i.e. about twice lower than the corresponding values obtained with calcium G-actin. Hence all conclusions drawn here with calcium-actin also apply to the physiological magnesium-actin species. For technical reasons the work was done with calcium-actin which is more stable and does not give rise to oligomers with concomitant hydrolysis of actin-bound ATP. To test the proposed model for the mechanism of interaction of G-actin with S1, a chase experiment was designed in which pyrenyl actin was chased off the G-actin-S1 complexes by unlabeled actin. Preformed complexes were rapidly mixed with unlabeled G-actin at different concentrations. A monoexponential decrease in pyrenyl fluorescence was observed. The amplitude of the change increased with G-actin, total dissociation of the fluorescent complex being observed at saturation by G-actin (data not shown). The rate constant of the exchange process decreased upon increasing G-actin from a value of ∼140 s−1 at low G-actin to a limit value of 60 s−1 at saturating G-actin levels in a fashion similar to the change in kobs upon increasing pyrenyl G-actin shown in Fig. 5. The interpretation of these data within is as follows: the exchange of unlabeled for labeled G-actin in the non-fluorescent actin-S1 complexes is extremely rapid, and the fluorescence change is rate-limited by the isomerization processes, as in the association reaction of S1 with pyrenyl-G-actin, and at saturation by G-actin the observed rate constant in the chase experiment again represents k+4+ k−4 = 60 s−1. Previous static measurements (12Valentin-Ranc C. Carlier M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21543-21550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the GS and G2S complexes were dissociated by ADP and, more efficiently, by ATP. The kinetics of dissociation were monitored by the decrease in pyrene fluorescence upon rapid mixing of ATP or ADP with preformed G-actin-S1 complexes. The decrease in fluorescence was a first-order process at all nucleotide concentrations. The amplitudes of the fluorescence decrease showed a saturation behavior as a function of nucleotide concentration, and the rate constants increased linearly with nucleotide concentration up to at least 400 μM, i.e. above the range shown in the figures. The minimum kinetic scheme accounting for this process is the following. GnS∗+N⇔KTGnSN∗⇔K−K+GnSN∗∗⇔nG+SNKD where n = 1 or 2, and N represents the nucleotide (MgATP or CaATP or MgADP). K and KD are rapid equilibrium dissociation constants and k+ and k− the isomerization rate constants corresponding to the conformational change, which is monitored by the change in fluorescence and through which the affinity of S1 for G-actin decreases. 1) The dissociation of G2 S by nucleotides was first examined. Pyrenyl G-actin (3 μM) and S1A1 (0.5 μM) were premixed and reacted with nucleotide at different concentrations. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Given a total concentration of 0.5 μM ATP-binding sites, the amplitude data (Fig. 6a) showed that the equilibrium dissociation constant for MgATP, KTk−/k+ was too low (≤0.1 μM) to be measured. In other words, with MgATP, the value of KD is very high, and the reaction is quasi irreversible. From the slope of the linear increase of kobs with MgATP (Fig. 6b), a value of 1.6 μM−1 s−1 was derived for k+/KT. The value of k−, as derived from the ordinate origin, was ≤0.2 s−1. Only a lower estimate of 400 μM can be proposed for KT. When the dissociating nucleotide was CaATP or MgADP, the values found for kT× k−/k+ were 2.8 and 1 μM, respectively. The slopes of kobsversus CaATP or MgADP were similar to those obtained with MgATP, however, the values of k− were definitely higher (∼2 s−1), indicating that the reaction is reversible and that the value of KD must be lower than with MgATP. 2) The dissociation of GS by nucleotides was investigated in a similar fashion, and qualitatively similar data were obtained, pointing out to the same mechanism for nucleotide-induced dissociation of GS. However, a large quantitative difference between GS and G2S was observed regarding the efficiency of MgATP to promote dissociation of S1 from G-actin. In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, the GS* complex was preformed and rapidly mixed with different amounts of MgATP. Essentially GS* was present, with S1/G ratios of 5 and 16, respectively. The decrease in fluorescence linked to dissociation of GS* varied with MgATP in an identical fashion at the two Sn/G ratios, consistent with a much lower affinity of MgATP for GS than for G2S. In this experiment, MgATP binds to GS* and free S1. The fact that identical amplitude patterns were observed although the concentration of S1 was different in the two assays (hence some competition between GS and S1 for binding ATP was expected), suggests that the binding of MgATP to GS* is completed before its binding to S1. The analysis of the rate constants, gave k− = 0.4 ± 0.1 s−1 and k+/KT = 0.08 ± .01 μM−1 s−1 (Fig. 7, inset), a value 20-fold lower than the one (1.6 μM−1 s−1, Fig. 6b) obtained for G2S. Using these two numbers, a value of 5 ± 1.8 μM was derived for K′T. This estimate is consistent with the amplitude data which can be well fitted using an equilibrium dissociation constant K′T of 3 μM, a value again 30-fold higher than the one found for the binding of MgATP to G2S. An alternative model implying dissociation of GS as a consequence of the initial binding of MgATP to free S1 has not been considered here. In conclusion both amplitude and kinetic data indicate that MgATP is much more efficient to promote dissociation of G2S than to promote dissociation of GS. A comparison of these data, with the ATP-induced dissociation of F-actin-S1(26Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) is interesting. At 0.5°C and in the presence of 0.1 M KCl, values of K′T < 0.01 μM, and k+/KT = 0.6 μM−1 s−1 have been reported, which compare well with the data obtained here for the dissociation of G2S by MgATP, but differ significantly from the data obtained for the dissociation of GS. All equilibrium and rate parameters for nucleotide-induced dissociation of GS and G2S are summarized in Table 2.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab DNaseI forms a very tight 1:1 complex with G-actin, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.5-2 nM(24Blikstad I.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2941-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), which led the authors to conclude that the affinity of DNaseI for G-actin was unaffected by S1; the fluorescence titrations of pyrenyl G-actin by S1 in the presence of DNaseI indicated that the affinity of S1 for G-actin was decreased at most 4-5-fold by DNaseI(30Chen T.

Whether the fluorescence of pyrenyl actin in the ternary complex DNase-actin-S1 is the same as or lower than in the G-actin-S1 complex does not appear clearly from available data. The binding of S1 to pyrenyl G-actin in the presence of DNaseI was investigated in the stopped-flow as follows. A first experiment showed that upon mixing DNaseI with the preformed fluorescent pyrenyl-G-actin-S1 complex (0.5 μM G-actin, 3 μM S1(A2)), a decrease in pyrene fluorescence was observed.

Using an inducible recA promoter and the g10-L ribosome-binding site, recombinant non-glycosylated interleukin 4 (IL-4) was expressed as 17% of total cellular protein in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, as a reduced, inactive 14.5-kDa polypeptide. The protein was refolded and aggregates dissociated when three disulfide bonds were reformed by slowly decreasing the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride and cysteine. The oxidized monomer was purified to homogeneity by sequential ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. When compared with native IL-4, E. coli-derived IL-4 displayed an identical specific activity of 4-7 × 107 units/mg. This recombinant IL-4 contained a threeamino-acid NH2-terminal extension, which did not affect its biological activity. Purified biologically active protein consisted of three isoforms as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, with a pI greater than 9.0. These data suggest that neither glycosylation nor the NH2 terminus of mouse IL-4 play a critical role in contributing to its in vitro biological activity. Mouse Interleukin 4 is a 20-kDa glycoprotein, synthesized by activated T lymphocytes and mast cells, which regulates the growth and/or differentiation of a broad spectrum of target cells of the immune system, including B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using an inducible recA promoter and the g10-L ribosome-binding site, recombinant non-glycosylated interleukin 4 (IL-4) was expressed as 17% of total cellular protein in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, as a reduced, inactive 14.5-kDa polypeptide. The protein was refolded and aggregates dissociated when three disulfide bonds were reformed by slowly decreasing the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride and cysteine. The oxidized monomer was purified to homogeneity by sequential ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. When compared with native IL-4, E. coli-derived IL-4 displayed an identical specific activity of 4-7 × 107 units/mg. This recombinant IL-4 contained a threeamino-acid NH2-terminal extension, which did not affect its biological activity.

https://openalex.org/W1986586388,"Extensive effort has been directed toward a quantitative evaluation of forces which operate between biomacromolecules since the characterization of such forces is essential to a thorough understanding of fundamental biological processes. However, all studies hitherto reported were conducted in vitro, using isolated species. Here we report the first quantitative characterization of forces operating between DNA molecules within living bacteria. Evaluation of x-ray scattering studies conducted on intact bacteria indicates that, at DNA-DNA surface separations characteristic of DNA assemblies, interactions are dominated by repulsive hydration forces which originate from the structuring of water molecules. The results support the notion that the mechanisms by means of which macromolecules function, fold, and interact with each other crucially depend upon their hydration properties."
https://openalex.org/W2003214405,"A method for preparation of transcriptionally active nuclear extracts from the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila is described. Cells were lysed in the presence of gum arabic, and nuclei were further purified in the presence of Ficoll 400. Highly concentrated nuclear extracts were prepared by ultracentrifugation of nuclei in a buffer containing potassium glutamate and spermidine. These extracts supported accurate transcription initiation of T. thermophila class II and III genes. Using the histone H3-II gene as a template, we demonstrated that physiologically induced changes in transcriptional activity in vivo were reflected in the transcriptional activity of the nuclear extract in vitro. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, five conserved sequence elements in the upstream region of the histone H3-II gene were shown specifically to bind proteins in extracts from exponentially growing as well as from starved cells, and by UV cross-linking we further characterized the specific binding of two proteins to an oligonucleotide containing a conserved CCAAT box motif. Transcription competition experiments showed that addition of this oligonucleotide decreased transcription significantly. Competition with oligonucleotides corresponding to the two proximal conserved sequence elements almost completely abolished transcription of the H3-II gene suggesting that binding of transacting factors to these elements is crucial for initiation of transcription.

In higher eukaryotes mRNA levels are controlled by a complex interplay of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In lower eukaryotes examples of post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA abundance have been described (Warner et al., 1993), but generally, transcriptional control of mRNA levels appears to prevail. The ciliated protozoans represent one of the earliest divergent branches of the eukaryotic lineage (Sogin et al., 1986) and have as model organisms been of considerable importance for studies of fundamental molecular mechanisms such as RNA self-splicing (Zaug et al., 1986) and telomere formation (Greider and Blackburn, 1987). A considerable number of protein-encoding genes from ciliates have been cloned and characterized, but no functional analyses of promoter regions have been reported. To date, analyses of promoter structures in Tetrahymena have been limited to mapping of DNase hypersensitive regions in the promoters of the L1 and S25 ribosomal protein genes (N⊘rgaard et al., 1992) and in the promoter of the histone H4-I gene (Pederson et al., 1986). Apart from these studies, identification of putative promoter elements in ciliates has been restricted to computer-assisted searches for sequence elements exhibiting similarity to known eukaryotic promoter elements (Brunk and Sadler, 1990). Recently, transformation of Tetrahymena thermophila with protein-encoding genes was reported (Yao and Yao, 1991; Kahn et al., 1993; Gaertig et al., 1994), but transformation was in all cases accomplished by homologous recombination making this approach unsuitable as a general procedure for functional analyses of promoters in ciliates. An alternative approach would be to develop an in vitro transcription system specific for ciliate genes. Systems capable of accurate in vitro transcription are well established for higher eukaryotes (Manley et al., 1980; Dignam et al., 1983; Parker and Topol, 1984), but it has consistently been found difficult to achieve in vitro transcription of class II genes in extracts from lower eukaryotes (Lue and Kornberg, 1987). Tetrahymena extracts capable of accurate transcription of rDNA by polymerase I have been described (Sutiphong et al., 1984; Matsuura et al., 1986), but transcription in vitro of ciliate class II genes has not been reported. In this report we describe the preparation of a nuclear extract from T. thermophila that supports accurate transcriptional initiation of exogenously added ciliate class II and class III genes. Extracts prepared from exponentially growing and starved cells, respectively, differed in their ability to transcribe the histone H3-II gene. By competition with double-stranded oligonucleotides, we demonstrated that four conserved sequence elements in the intergenic region between the divergently transcribed histone H3-II and H4-II genes are involved in the regulation of transcription of the histone H3-II gene. Interestingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that these oligonucleotides bound different complements of proteins in extracts prepared from exponentially growing and starved cells, respectively. A partial genomic library was generated by ligating size fractionated EcoRI/HindIII fragments of T. thermophila macronuclear DNA into the selection vector pUN121 (Nilsson et al., 1983). A clone containing a 3.6-kilobase EcoRI/HindIII fragment harboring the entire H4-II histone gene (HHF2 according to the nomenclature of Thatcher et al.(1994)) and the 5′-end of the H3-II histone gene (HHT2) down to position +237 relative to the A in the ATG start codon was isolated by screening with a cDNA specific for histone H4-II. The 3.6-kilobase fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene). This plasmid was named pG78 RH3.6 1R. Hummel, unpublished results. (Fig. 1).

Hallberg, Department of Biology, Syracuse University) with 145 bp of upstream sequences and the entire transcribed region except for the last 4 bp in the 3′-end of the gene. This fragment was cloned into the SalI site of pBluescript KS+. The following oligonucleotides were obtained from Otto Dahl, Chemical Laboratory II, University of Copenhagen: oligonucleotide 1A, 5′-TTGTTGTCGATAAAGAATT-3′; oligonucleotide 1B, 5′-TTTTTAATAAAATTCTTTATCG-3′; oligonucleotide 2A, 5′-CAGGATTATGCCAAACATTT-3′; oligonucleotide 2B, 5′-AGATCATTTGAAATGTTTGGC-3′; oligonucleotide 3A, 5′-AAATCATCCAATCAAAATTGTTC-3′; oligonucleotide 3B, 5′-GAGAAGATATGAACAATTTTG-3′; oligonucleotide 4A, 5′-GGATAAAATCTCAAAAATCTGAT-3′; oligonucleotide 4B, 5′-GAAAGGAAATCAGATTTTTGAGAT-3′; oligonucleotide 5A, 5′TTATTTAATTATCCAAATT-3′; oligonucleotide 5B, 5′-CTCCGAGCAATTTGGATAA-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed pairwise by mixing 50 μl each of oligo(A) and (B) (100 pmol/μl) with 6.8 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 μl of 100 mM EDTA. This mixture was boiled for 3 min and then cooled slowly to the annealing temperature (23°C for oligonucleotides 1 and 2, 20°C for oligonucleotides 3 and 5 and 33°C for oligonucleotide 4). After annealing for 1 h, 1.7 μl of 1 M MgCl2, 1.7 μl of 100 mM DTE, 17 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 42.5 μl of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (2 mM each), and 16 units of T7 DNA polymerase were added. The fill-in reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at the annealing temperature. Five μl of 0.5 M EDTA and 16 μl of 3 M sodium acetate were added, and the reaction mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform. For preparation of labeled oligonucleotides, 4 pmol were annealed in a volume of 10 μl and filled-in in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were precipitated by addition of 3 volumes of 99% ethanol and were subjected to electrophoresis in a native 12% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis the part of the gel containing the double-stranded oligonucleotide was detected by UV shadowing or autoradiography and isolated. The oligonucleotides were eluted by the addition of 200 μl of elution buffer (0.5% SDS, 250 mM sodium acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) followed by gentle shaking overnight at 37°C. The supernatant was isolated, and 200 μl of elution buffer was added to the gel pieces followed by an additional incubation for 2 h. The supernatants were combined and extracted with phenol/chloroform. The oligonucleotides were precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol, washed twice with 75% ethanol, dried, and dissolved in a solution of 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. The concentrations of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were determined by UV spectroscopy. T. thermophila, strain SB715 (Turkewitz et al., 1991) was grown in 0.75% proteose peptone, 0.75% yeast extract, 10 mM MgSO4, 0.05 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM ferri citrate for at least five generations to a density of approximately 4 × 105 cells/ml. The growth of the culture was monitored by counting the cells in a Coulter counter. Two liters of culture were mixed with crushed ice, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Beckman JA10 rotor at 2,500 rpm for 3 min at 2°C followed by washing in 800 ml of nuclei buffer (0.1 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTE) and recentrifugation. The collected cells were resuspended in 60 ml of nuclei buffer with 4% gum arabic and inhibitors (0.01 TIU/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate) and lysed in a Potter-Elverhjem homogenizer with a tight-fitting Teflon pestle (Braun-Melsungen) at 1,500 rpm. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 5 min at 2°C in a Beckman JS13.1 swinging bucket rotor, and the supernatant was aspirated. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 60 ml of nuclei buffer with 4% gum arabic and inhibitors and recentrifuged as above. The nuclei were resuspended in 60 ml of nuclei buffer with 18% Ficoll 400 and inhibitors and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min at 2°C in a JS13.1 rotor. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet recentrifuged for a few seconds. The last traces of supernatant were removed, and the nuclei were resuspended in 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.8 M potassium glutamate, 4.5 mM spermidine, 3.3 mM magnesium acetate, 0.3 mM EDTA, 7 mM EGTA) per g of nuclei. The viscous suspension was transferred to 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and extraction was allowed to proceed for 30 min before the tubes were floated on water and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 1 h at 2°C in a Beckman SW28 rotor (100,000 × g). The supernatant was mixed with 0.3 volumes of 87% glycerol and frozen in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. Protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy as described by Warburg and Christian(1942). Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). For a standard transcription reaction, the following was mixed at room temperature in a total volume of 20 μl: 3.8 μl of transcription buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 7.5 mM spermidine, 16 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM EDTA), 3 μl of 10 mM DTE, 3 μl of nucleotide mix (5 mM each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP), 25 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.5 μg of template DNA. Transcription was initiated by addition of 5 μl of nuclear extract, allowed to proceed at 25°C for 30 min, and then stopped by digestion with 20 units of DNase I (RNase-free, Boehringer) for 5 min. Proteins were digested by the addition of 100 μl of stop buffer (0.5% N-lauryl-sarcosine, 50 μg/ml proteinase K, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml wheat germ tRNA) followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 h. The synthesized RNA was precipitated by the addition of 170 μl of GdSCN precipitation mixture (2 volumes of isopropyl alcohol added to a solution of 6 M guanidine thiocyanate and 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 7, in water), washed twice with 75% ethanol, and dried gently in a Speed-vac concentrator. Linearized plasmids were transcribed with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The transcripts were labeled with [α-32P]UTP (specific activity 130 Ci/mmol). Following transcription the template (0.2-0.6 μg) was digested with 10 units of DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim, RNase-free) at 37°C for 30 min, and 50 μl of stop buffer were added. After digestion at 37°C for 30 min, the antisense transcripts were purified, either by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation or by precipitation using the GdSCN precipitation mixture. The transcripts were washed twice with 75% ethanol, dried gently, and finally dissolved to a specific activity of 105 counts/min/μl in water. An improved RNase protection procedure 3N. E. Petersen, L. K. Larsen, H. Nissen, L. G. Jensen, M. Horder, N. Gregersen, and K. Kristiansen, manuscript submitted for publication. was followed. Briefly, total RNA or in vitro synthesized RNA was dissolved in 3 μl of antisense transcript solution and 24 μl of deionized formamide, and then 3 μl of hybridization buffer (400 mM PIPES, pH 6.4, 10 mM EDTA, 4 M NaCl) were added. The RNA was denatured by heating to 85°C for 10 min and hybridized overnight at 37°C. Three-hundred μl of RNase digestion mixture (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 700 units/ml RNase T1, 40 μg/ml RNase A) were added, and digestion was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 15°C. The digestion was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 10% N-lauryl-sarcosine, 10 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K, and 5 μg of tRNA. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and the RNA was precipitated by the addition of 500 μl of GdSCN precipitation mixture, washed once with 75% ethanol, dried, and redissolved in 4 μl of formamide-dye mix (98% deionized formamide, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol). Two μl were loaded per lane on a sequencing gel. The following was mixed at room temperature in a total volume of 6 μl: 1.5 μl of transcription buffer, 1 μl of 10 mM DTE, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim) and competitor as stated in the figure legends. Prebinding (Demczuk et al., 1991) was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of nuclear extract diluted to a concentration of 2.5 μg/μl (in a mixture of 963 μl of extraction buffer, 3 μl of 0.5 M DTE, 2034 μl of water, 900 μl of 87% glycerol). After 5-10 min of prebinding, the binding reaction was initiated by addition of 2 μl (10 fmol) of labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. After 20 min of binding at room temperature, the reaction was loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 38:2, w/w) gel containing 50 mM Tris, 380 mM glycine, 2 mM EDTA, pH ∼8.5. The gel had been pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 13 V/cm using the same buffer as running buffer. Electrophoresis was continued at the same voltage until the bromphenol blue in a marker lane had migrated through two-thirds of the gel. Binding reactions were mixed as above in a total volume of 25 μl, incubated for 20 min, and then subjected to irradiation at 254 nm from a Camag lamp held at a distance of 5 cm for 15 min. Twenty-five μl of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) were added, the samples were boiled for 3 min and immediately loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel. (Laemmli, 1970) with prestained markers (Pharmacia). The standard procedure for preparation of nuclear extracts for in vitro transcription involves lysis of cells in hypotonic buffers followed by isolation of nuclei and extraction of nuclear proteins with 0.42 M potassium chloride (Dignam et al., 1983). A major problem in this approach is leakage of nuclear proteins during lysis of cells and during purification of nuclei (Shapiro et al., 1988; Lue and Kornberg, 1987). To minimize this problem, disruption of cells in an isotonic buffer and inclusion of polymers like gum arabic or Ficoll in the nuclei buffers have been employed (Lue and Kornberg, 1987). However, attempts to prepare active extracts from T. thermophila following these lines were unsuccessful. The resulting extracts did not support in vitro transcription of cloned T. thermophila genes, and furthermore, had very low protein concentrations caused in part by substantial losses of nuclear proteins during dialysis. Recently, Kamakaka et al.(1991) described the preparation of a soluble nuclear fraction with high protein concentration capable of efficient RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. In this procedure nuclei are extracted with potassium glutamate and subjected to high speed centrifugation. Potassium glutamate, even in concentrations as high as 400 mM, does not inhibit transcription in vitro (Verdier et al., 1990; Kamakaka et al., 1991), and thus, the dialysis step necessary in the procedure of Dignam et al. (1983) can be omitted. By using this procedure and by adding Ficoll during the preparation of nuclei, we were able to obtain nuclear extracts containing 20-80 mg of protein/ml. As described below, these extracts supported in vitro transcription of cloned genes from T. thermophila. The divergently transcribed H3-II and H4-II genes are well suited for in vitro transcription experiments because the intergenic region can be expected to possess the elements necessary for initiation of transcription. Initial experiments employing the H3-II gene as a template showed that inclusion of promoter sequences up to position −213 (relative to the A in the ATG start codon, cf.Fig. 6) was sufficient for an efficient in vitro transcription as exemplified by the in vitro transcription of pH3-II RB449 shown in Fig. 2. Transcription with 5 μl of extract prepared from exponentially growing cells resulted in distinct bands (Fig. 2, lane 1) and was sensitive to α-amanitin at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (Fig. 2, lane 2), indicating that transcription was dependent on RNA polymerase II (Eichler and Corr, 1989). No transcription was observed when pBluescript was used as a template (Fig. 2, lane 3). Extracts prepared from cells starved for 24 h in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were inactive (Fig. 2, lane 5). A 1:1 mixture of extracts from starved and exponentially growing cells exhibited a decrease in transcriptional activity that was roughly proportional to the reduction in amount of nuclear extract from the exponentially growing cells (Fig. 2, lane 6) indicating that the nuclear extract prepared from starved cells did not contain inhibitors that per se affected transcription in vitro. Under our standard conditions for in vitro transcription approximately 0.001 transcripts were generated per template.Figure 2In vitro transcription of the histone H3-II gene. The transcription products were detected with T3 RNA polymerase generated antisense transcripts of XbaI linearized pH3-II RB449. Lane 1, 0.5 μg pH3-II RB449 transcribed with 5 μl (165 μg) of nuclear extract; lane 2, as lane 1, but with 2 μg/ml α-amanitin; lane 3, 0.5 μg of pBluescript KS+ transcribed with 5 μl of nuclear extract; lane 4, as lane 1 but stopped immediately after the addition of nuclear extract; lane 5, 0.5 μg of pH3-II RB449 transcribed with 5 μl of nuclear extract from starved cells; lane 6, 0.5 μg of pH3-II RB449 transcribed with 2.5 μl of nuclear extract from starved cells and 2.5 μl of nuclear extract from exponentially growing cells; lane t, RNase protection with 40 μg of wheat germ tRNA; lane T, RNase protection with 40 μg of T. thermophila total RNA. Open and closed arrows indicate in vitro and in vivo transcribed RNA, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To demonstrate that the nuclear extract supported accurate transcription initiation, transcripts from a number of different templates were analyzed (Fig. 3). Analysis of total RNA isolated from exponentially growing T. thermophila showed that transcription of the H3-II gene was initiated at two sites mapping to position −60 (major transcription start point) and −46 (minor transcription start point) relative to the A in the translation start codon ATG (Fig. 3, lane T). The in vitro transcription with pH3-II RH3.6 and pH3-II RB449 as templates revealed that the same transcription start points were used in vitro (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Transcripts generated from pH3-II KB351 contain 14 nucleotides of the polylinker region in common with the labeled antisense RNA. Accordingly, transcription of pH3-II KB351 gave rise to protected products that were extended by 14 nucleotides (Fig. 3, lane 3). Addition of α-amanitin to 2 μg/ml abolished transcription (Fig. 3, lane 4). Thus, the in vitro transcription system displayed the expected α-amanitin sensitivity and utilized transcription start sites identical to those used in vivo. However, it is noteworthy that transcripts initiated at position −60 dominated in vivo, whereas transcripts initiated at position −46 were most abundant in vitro. We examined the influence of DNA topology by comparing in vitro transcription of a supercoiled template with a linearized template (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 5). In this particular experiment, the linearized template was more efficiently transcribed than the supercoiled one, but other experiments showed no difference between supercoiled and linearized templates. Preliminary experiments had shown that the concentrations of Mg2+ and spermidine had profound effect on the in vitro transcription activity. Hence, the effects of varying the concentration of Mg2+ and spermidine were analyzed (Fig. 4). The maximal rate of transcription was obtained at 0.25 mM Mg2+ and 1.5 mM spermidine. However, the highest proportion of accurately initiated transcripts was obtained at 2.5 mM Mg2+ and 1.5-20 mM spermidine. Consequently, the combination 2.5 mM Mg2+ and 1.5 mM spermidine was selected as a standard for in vitro transcription reactions. It should be noted that the results in Figure 2, Figure 3 were obtained by using these concentrations of Mg2+ and spermidine. The performance of the in vitro transcription system was investigated using other templates. Accurately initiated transcripts were found with the histone H4-I gene and the actin gene, but not with ribosomal protein genes (results not shown). The RNA polymerase III activity was analyzed using a 5 S rRNA gene as template. RNase protection of 5 S rRNA present in the extract (Fig. 5) or in total RNA (not shown) gave rise to multiple bands. These multiple bands can be explained by a combination of incomplete trimming by RNase A and by sequence heterogeneity in the 5 S rRNA genes of T. thermophila (Leuhrsen et al., 1980; Kumazaki et al., 1982). Thus, based on the known specificity of RNase A and T1, incomplete trimming of the sequence 5′-AAAAU-3′ in the 3′-end of the labeled antisense transcript complementary to the 5′-ATTTT-3′ sequence immediately upstream from the transcription start point will result in a “protected” antisense RNA that is five nucleotides longer than the full-length protected probe. Furthermore, an A/G heterogeneity in position 4 relative to the 5′-end of the 5 S rRNA, and a C/T heterogeneity in position 114 can be anticipated to give rise to protected fragments that deviate three nucleotides and one nucleotide, respectively, from a full-length protected probe. A C/T heterogeneity in position 2 cannot be detected with RNase A or T1. In vitro transcription of the cloned 5 S rRNA gene followed by RNase protection (Fig. 5, lane 1) gave rise to two products with a size difference of five nucleotides. The 206 nucleotides product marked by the upper asterisk in Fig. 5 corresponds in size to that expected for a correctly initiated transcript, whereas the 211 nucleotide species in analogy with the results obtained by analysis of endogenous 5 S rRNA in all probability arose by incomplete trimming of the 3′-end of the antisense probe. Thus, the in vitro transcription system appears to support accurate initiation of transcription of the 5 S rRNA gene. The intergenic regions of the divergently transcribed H3-II and H4-II genes from 29 Tetrahymena species and Glaucoma chattoni have been cloned and aligned (Brunk and Sadler, 1990). In addition, we have performed a thorough analysis of the intergenic region using the Pileup program of the GCG package (Deveraux et al., 1984) and the Signal Scan program (Prestridge, 1991). These analyses revealed the presence of several conserved sequence elements. As conservation may indicate functional importance, the conserved elements were further characterized using the Signal Scan program. Brunk and Sadler noted that the sequences of two conserved regions, positions −160 to −149 and −192 to −203, conformed to the consensus for a CCAAT box. In addition, our analyses revealed that three additional conserved regions exhibit similarity with known cis-acting consensus sequences, a H4TF-1 consensus sequence GATTTC (Dailey et al., 1986) in position −176 to −171 which with one mismatch is repeated in an inverted orientation in position −178 to −183, a HiNF-A (van Wijnen et al., 1987) consensus sequence AGAAATG (one mismatch) in position −108 to −113, and an octamer binding sequence ATTTGCAT (one mismatch) (Sive and Roeder, 1986; Barberis et al., 1987; Staudt et al., 1988) in position −221 to −229. To analyze the functional importance of the conserved elements, double-stranded oligonucleotides (Fig. 6) corresponding to these regions were prepared. Oligonucleotide 1 encompasses the transcription initiation site, oligonucleotide 2 the HiNF-A homology, oligonucleotide 3 one of the CCAAT boxes, oligonucleotide 4 the H4TF-1 consensus, and oligonucleotide 5 the octamer consensus site. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Staudt et al., 1986) showed that all oligonucleotides bound protein(s) in the extracts prepared from exponentially growing and starved cells, respectively, and furthermore, reciprocal competition experiments demonstrated that the binding was specific for each oligonucleotide (Fig. 7). An unrelated oligonucleotide did not bind any protein in the nuclear extract (results not shown). The complexes formed with nuclear extracts from exponentially growing cells were clearly distinct from those formed with nuclear extracts prepared from starved cells (Fig. 7, and results not shown). Oligonucleotide 3 contains a canonical CCAAT motif. This motif was originally recognized as an important promoter element in several vertebrate genes and binds to a large family of transacting factors (Santoro et al., 1988). Interestingly, members of this family are structurally and functionally related to the yeast Hap2/Hap3 transcriptional regulators (Chodosh et al., 1988). From a phylogenetic point of view, it was therefore of interest to characterize in more detail the proteins which bind to the CCAAT containing oligonucleotide 3. Fig. 8 shows that two proteins in the nuclear extract from exponentially growing cells could be specifically cross-linked to oligonucleotide 3. Competition with the non-related oligonucleotide 1 did not prevent cross-linking, whereas competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide 3 completely suppressed cross-linking to the labeled oligonucleotide 3 (lanes 2 and 3). No labeled species could be observed when the UV cross-linked reaction mixture was treated with proteinase K prior to electrophoresis (lane 4). The labeled species migrated as proteins of molecular weight 34,000 and 42,000. The migration of DNA-protein cross-linked molecules in SDS gels closely follows the log molecular weight migration relationship of pure proteins. Assuming that only one strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotide became covalently attached to each of the binding proteins, the masses of the proteins binding to oligonucleotide 3 can be estimated to be 23.5 and 31.5 kDa, respectively. To investigate the functionality of the conserved sequence elements, transcription competition experiments were performed (Vaccaro et al., 1990; Hai et al., 1988; Verdier et al., 1990). Fig. 9 shows how transcription of the H3-II gene was affected by competition with a 100-fold molar excess of each of the double-stranded oligonucleotides 1-5. Addition of oligonucleotide 1 or 2 resulted in a marked reduction in transcriptional activity, while addition of oligonucleotide 3 or 4 resulted in a minor reduction. Addition of oligonucleotide 5 only reduced transcription marginally. Thus, interference with binding of transacting factors to the two proximal conserved sequence elements resulted in a dramatic decrease in transcriptional activity suggesting that these regions are crucial at least for basal promoter activity. Of interest, oligonucleotide 1 encompasses an AT-rich region similar to those previously suggested to be part of a transcription initiation motif in Tetrahymena (Rosendahl et al., 1991; Hansen et al., 1991). In this report we describe the preparation of a nuclear extract from the ciliated protozoan T. thermophila that supports accurate transcription initiation in vitro by RNA polymerase II and III. Previous attempts to achieve in vitro transcription of ciliate class II and III genes have been unsuccessful. The reasons for these failures are probably related to the preparation of the nuclear extract itself as well as to problems concerning the choice of suitable templates for in vitro transcription. Since no functional analyses of ciliate promoters have been performed so far, rational delimitation of a functional promoter has in most cases been impossible. Therefore, we decided to use clones of the histone H3-II gene as model templates for the development of a Tetrahymena based in vitro transcription system. In ciliates the genes encoding histones H3-II and H4-II are clustered and oriented in a head to head fashion with an intergenic region of approximately 345 bp (Brunk and Sadler, 1990). No introns are present in the two genes, and consequently, the intergenic region can be expected to contain the sequences necessary for at least basal transcription. Furthermore, the organization of the two histone genes has been shown to be conserved in a large number of ciliates making it possible to identify conserved sequence elements of possible regulatory importance (Brunk and Sadler, 1990; this report). For preparation of active nuclear extracts, minimization of nuclear leakage during isolation of nuclei was clearly of importance. Several ways of preparing nuclei were investigated, and the most successful combination was found to be disruption of the cells in a Potter-Elverhjem homogenizer in the presence of 4% gum arabic (Gorovsky, 1975), followed by a final purification of nuclei in a buffer containing 18% Ficoll 400 (Lue and Kornberg, 1987). Cell lysis in buffers containing Nonidet P-40 resulted in inactive extracts with very low concentrations of protein. Furthermore, the use of a potassium glutamate and spermidine containing buffer and centrifugation for the preparation of a nuclear extract with high concentration of protein according to the procedure of Kamakaka et al.(1991) were instrumental in obtaining active extracts. Finally, a number of observations has suggested that chloride ions inhibit the transcriptional activity of nuclear extracts (Lue and Kornberg, 1987; Shapiro et al., 1988; Verdier et al., 1990). Consequently, we substituted acetate for chloride, although we did not perform a systematic comparison of the performance of extracts prepared with chloride or acetate. The transcriptional efficiency of the nuclear extract from T. thermophila was lower than those reported for metazoanderived systems (Shapiro et al., 1988; Kamakaka et al., 1991), but comparable to those reported for extracts prepared from yeast (Lue et al., 1989; Verdier et al., 1990) and Neurospora (Tyler and Giles, 1985). This relatively low transcriptional activity may be characteristic for extracts from lower eukaryotes, but the promoter organization and transcription start site patterns of the genes used as templates for in vitro transcriptions may well add to the low transcriptional efficiency. Thus, the genes from lower eukaryotes which have been used as templates for in vitro transcription initiate transcription from multiple start sites in vivo (Lue and Kornberg, 1987; Lue et al., 1989; Verdier et al., 1990; Tyler and Giles, 1985), and it is a general observation that such genes even in the more efficient extracts from mammalian cells normally are poorly transcribed in vitro (Farnham and Schimke, 1986; Osborne et al., 1987; Kageyama et al., 1988). Most if not all ciliate class II genes also seem to initiate transcription in vivo from multiple transcription start sites (Nielsen et al., 1986; Rosendahl et al., 1991; Hansen et al., 1991). In higher eukaryotes a substantial number of genes that initiate transcription from multiple start sites encode housekeeping proteins (Dynan, 1986). To this class of genes belongs the ribosomal protein genes which have been notoriously difficult to transcribe in vitro (Zahradka and Sells, 1988; Yoganathan et al., 1992; Chung and Perry; 1991). Like other genes encoding housekeeping proteins, these genes lack canonical TATA boxes in the promoter region. Interestingly, mutating an AT-rich region in the promoter of the S16 ribosomal protein gene to a canonical TATA box increased in vitro transcription dramatically (Chung and Perry, 1991). It is also noteworthy that in vitro transcription of other TATA-less mammalian genes from which transcription in vivo is initiated at multiple start sites failed to reflect the in vivo utilization of the individual start sites. Thus, minor in vivo start sites became the most prominent start site in vitro, whereas transcription from major in vivo transcription start sites became barely detectable in vitro (Farnham and Schimke, 1986; Osborne et al., 1987; Kageyama et al., 1988). The same phenomenon was observed by in vitro transcription of the T. thermophila histone H3-II gene, where the most abundant transcript was initiated at position −46, and the less abundant transcript at position −60, whereas the reverse was observed in vivo. Similarly, preferential utilization in vitro of minor in vivo transcription start sites was also observed with yeast extracts (Lue and Kornberg, 1987) and Neurospora extracts (Tyler and Giles, 1985). The reason for this difference in transcription start site utilization remains to be established, but it is obviously not a peculiarity of the Tetrahymena system. The physiological variation in the rate of transcription of the histone H3-II gene according to the nutritional status of the cells (Bannon et al., 1983) is clearly reflected in the transcriptional activity of extracts prepared from exponentially growing and starved cells, respectively. Thus, extracts from starved cells did not support detectable transcription of the H3-II gene. The results obtained by mixing extract prepared from exponentially growing and starved cells suggested that the extract from starved cells did not contain grossly inhibitory substances. Rather, the lack of detectable transcriptional activity could be attributed to a lack of positively acting factors. A computer-assisted comparison of the intergenic region between the H3-II and the H4-II genes in 30 different ciliates identified five conserved sequence elements. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, oligonucleotides corresponding to each of these elements were found specifically to bind proteins in extracts from exponentially growing as well as starved cells. Interestingly, each oligonucleotide bound a different complement of proteins in extracts from exponentially growing cells and starved cells. Oligonucleotide 3 harbors a canonical CCAAT motif. By UV cross-linking, we showed that two proteins in the extract from exponentially growing cells bound to this oligonucleotide. The molecular masses of these proteins were estimated to 23.5 and 31.5 kDa, respectively. In mammals as well as in yeast, CCAAT motifs appear to be recognized by a large family of transacting factors that bind in the form of heterodimers to the target sequences. This pattern appears to be followed in T. thermophila, and furthermore, the molecular masses of the two binding proteins are comparable with those of the Hap2 and Hap3 proteins in yeast for which predicted molecular masses of 16 and 30 kDa, respectively, have been reported (Chodosh et al., 1988). The functional importance of the conserved sequence elements was assessed in transcription competition experiments. These experiments revealed that oligonucleotides 1 and 2, in particular, exerted a profound effect on transcriptional activity of the histone H3-II gene leading to an almost complete abrogation of H3-II transcription implying that factors binding to these two proximal elements are critical for transcription. Oligonucleotides 3 and 4 also significantly decreased transcription, whereas oligonucleotide 5 only affected transcription marginally. Thus, the CCAAT box-binding proteins in T. thermophila appear to be bona fide transacting factors, although less decisive than the factors binding to the two proximal elements. The performance of the T. thermophila transcription system was investigated using other class II and class III T. thermophila genes as templates. Accurate initiation of transcription was achieved with the histone H4-I gene and the actin gene. However, in analogy with results obtained with other in vitro transcription systems, we were unable to detect specific initiation of transcription from either of four ribosomal protein genes. Using a 5 S rRNA gene as template, we demonstrated that the nuclear extract also supported accurate and efficient transcription of a class III gene. Of interest, the 5 S rRNA gene utilized in this study did not contain a canonical TATA box in the proximal upstream region. In N. crassa (Tyler, 1987), Drosophila (Sharp and Garcia, 1988), and Bombyx mori (Morton and Sprague, 1984), the presence of a TATA box approximately 25 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site was shown to be essential for efficient and accurate initiation of 5 S rRNA transcription in vitro. Interestingly, another 5 S rRNA gene cloned from T. thermophila (Pederson et al., 1984) possesses a canonical TATA box at position −30 to −26. Thus, it is possible that a TATA box may be dispensable for 5 S rRNA transcription in the T. thermophila system as it is in Xenopus derived systems, where no conserved sequences upstream from the transcription start site are necessary for accurate initiation (Sakunjo et al., 1980; Morton and Sprague, 1984). Although no pseudogenes have been identified in T. thermophila to date, formally it can not be excluded that the 5 S rRNA gene used in this study is a pseudogene which, in analogy with a human pseudogene lacking upstream promoter elements (Nielsen et al., 1993), can be transcribed in vitro albeit with a low efficiency.

Photoaffinity labeling of the receptors with 4-azidobenzoyl (AZB)-125I-ANP and competitive binding studies with 125I-ANP, ANP, and atriopeptin I (API) revealed that NPR-GC was detected as the predominant ANP-binding protein at 0°C, whereas at 37°C natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C) was detected as the predominant protein. The ratio of NPR-GC and NPR-C was 89:11 at 0°C for 40 min, respectively, whereas 6:94 at 37°C. AZB-125I-ANP bound to NPR-GC dissociated from the binding site within 5 min at 37°C but not at 0°C, whereas ANP bound to NPR-C did not dissociate from the binding site at 0 and 37°C. The dissociated AZB-125I-ANP rapidly rebound to NPR-GC at 37°C but not to NPR-C, and the dissociated NPR-GC was capable of binding. Some AZB-125I-ANP was hydrolyzed by a membrane-bound proteinase(s). Phosphoramidon inhibited the hydrolysis of AZB-125I-ANP. Thus, the dissociated AZB-125I-ANP rebound to NPR-GC and NPR-C. These results suggest that usually intact ANP repeatedly binds to NPR-GC until hydrolysis. Furthermore, the majority of ANP bind to NPR-GC before binding to NPR-C under physiological temperature.
