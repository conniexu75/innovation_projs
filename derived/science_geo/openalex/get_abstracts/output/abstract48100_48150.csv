https://openalex.org/W1480165684,"The biosynthesis, glycosylation, movement through the Golgi system, transport to lysosomes, and turnover of three lysosomal integral membrane proteins (LIMPSs) have been studied in normal rat kidney cells using specific anti-LIMP monoclonal antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy studies revealed the presence of LIMPs in secondary lysosomes, Golgi cisterna, and coated and uncoated vesicles located in the trans-Golgi cisterna, area. Pulse-chase experiments recorded LIMP precursors of 27 (LIMP I), 72 (LIMP II), and 86 kDa (LIMP III) and mature LIMPs of 35-50 (LIMP I), 74 (LIMP II), and 90-100 kDa (LIMP III). Time course studies on the acquisition of endoglycosidase H resistance by LIMPs indicated that all three LIMPs moved from the site of their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to the medial Golgi within 30-60 min after their synthesis. All three LIMPs were fully glycosylated before leaving the Golgi system, the process during which LIMP I was retained in the trans side of the organelle. LIMP I reached the lysosomes with a halftime of 2 h and LIMPs II and III with half-times of 1 h after their synthesis by a mechanism that was independent of N-linked carbohydrates. LIMPs free of N-linked carbohydrates displayed much shorter half-lives than fully glycosylated LIMPs, suggesting an important role of the sugars in protecting LIMPs against proteolytic degradation. Double immunofluorescence microscopy experiments showed that LIMP I, LIMP II, and LIMP III are localized in the same lysosomes."

Sialylparaglobosides (IV3NeuAc-nLc4Cer, IV6NeuAc-nLc4Cer), I-active and i-active (VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer) gangliosides, and GM3-NeuAc commonly exhibited significant specific receptor activity toward the viruses. A/PR/8/34 recognized IV3NeuAc-nLc4Cer containing the NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal sequence preferentially over IV6NeuAc-nLc4Cer containing NeuAc alpha 2-6Gal, whereas the other two recognized the NeuAc alpha 2-6Gal sequence preferentially over NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal. Responsiveness of erythrocytes labeled with gangliosides containing NeuGc to the viruses used was considerably lower than that of erythrocytes labeled with gangliosides containing NeuAc. The activities of GM1a, GM2, and GD1b bearing NeuAc on inner galactose of the ganglio series core were also very low. These results indicate that sialyloligosaccharides of IV3NeuAc-nLc4Cer, IV6NeuAc-nLc4Cer, I-active ganglioside, and VI3NeuAc-nLc6Cer in addition to GM3-NeuAc and GM1b-NeuAc (Suzuki, Y., Matsunaga, M., and Matsumoto, M. (1985), J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1362-1365; Suzuki, Y., Matsunaga, M., Nagao, Y., Taki, T., Hirabayashi, Y., and Matsumoto, M. (1985) Vaccine 3, 201-203) are functional receptor determinants toward hemagglutinin of human influenza A viruses, and the viruses differentiate microdomains of the gangliosides, such as the sialic acid species (NeuAc, NeuGc) and the sequence of sialic acid linkages (NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal, NeuAc alpha 2-6Gal)."

https://openalex.org/W1495748721,"Micromolar concentrations of cupric ion (Cu2+) and mercaptans such as cysteine, cysteamine, and homocysteine trigger large and rapid release from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. At the concentrations used, Cu2+ alone does not induce release nor does cysteine alone; both are required to induce release from SR. Cu2+ is known to catalyze the autooxidation of cysteine to its disulfide form cystine; Cu2+/mercaptan-induced release appears to be caused by Cu2+-catalyzed formation of a mixed disulfide between the exogenous mercaptan and a critical sulfhydryl on a transmembrane protein. In the oxidized state the SR is highly permeable to Ca2+. Supporting evidence for this interpretation is as follows. The order of Ca2+-releasing reactivity of the mercaptans is the same as the order in which these compounds undergo oxidation to disulfide forms in the presence of Cu2+. efflux induced by cysteine and Cu2+ can be reversed by the addition of the disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol. Hypochlorous acid and plumbagin, both potential sulfhydryl oxidants, induce rapid efflux from SR vesicles; in addition, Cu2+, which catalyzes H2O2 oxidation of cysteine, enhances H2O2-induced release. Oxidation-induced release from SR can be partially reversed or blocked by ruthenium red or the local anesthetics procaine and tetracaine. The efflux rates are strongly Mg2+ dependent and are significantly higher in heavy SR than in light SR. These data suggest that the efflux thus induced is via the Ca2+ release channel and that the oxidation state of a critical sulfhydryl group on this protein may be the principal means by which the permeability of the SR is regulated in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2108797073,"Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase was purified to near homogeneity from the cytosol fraction of porcine leukocytes by ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody against the enzyme. The purified enzyme was unstable (half-life of about 24 h at 4 degrees C) but was markedly protected from the inactivation by storage in the presence of ferrous ion or in the absence of air. The lag phase which was observed before the start of the enzyme reaction was abolished by the presence of 12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. An apparent substrate inhibition was observed with arachidonic acid and other active substrates; however, the substrate concentration curve was normalized by the presence of 0.03% Tween 20. Arachidonic acid was transformed to the omega-9 oxygenation product 12-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid. C-12 oxygenation also occurred with 5-hydroxy- and 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids; the respective maximal velocities were 60 and 150% of the rate with arachidonic acid. Octadecaenoic acids were also good substrates. gamma-Linolenic acid was oxygenated in the omega-9 position (C-10), while linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids were subject to omega-6 oxygenation (C-13). A far more complex reaction was observed using 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid as substrate. Reaction occurred at 70% of the rate with arachidonic acid. The dihydroperoxy and dihydroxy products were identified by their UV absorption spectra, high performance liquid chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among these products, (8S,15S)-dihydroperoxy-5Z,9E,11Z,13E-eicos atetraenoic acid and (14R,15S)-erythro-dihydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E, 12E-eicosatetraenoic acid were produced in larger amounts than the (8R)- and (14S,15S)-threo isomers, respectively; these products were attributed to 8- and 14-oxygenation of the 15-hydroperoxy acid. Furthermore, formation of 14,15-leukotriene A4 was inferred from the characteristic pattern of its hydrolysis products comprised of equal amounts of (8R,15S)- and (8S,15S)-dihydroxy-5Z,9E,11E,13E-eicosatetraenoi c acids together with smaller amounts of (14R,15S)-erythro- and (14S,15S)-threo-dihydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,12E-eicosate traenoic acids. Thus, both lipoxygenase and leukotriene synthase activities were demonstrated with the homogeneous preparation of porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1558746399,"We have found that the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) prepared from a mouse lymphoma exists in homodimeric form under physiological conditions and has the ability to bind to F-actin (Koyasu, S., Nishida, E., Kadowaki, T., Matsuzaki, F., Iida, K., Harada, F., Kasuga, M., Sakai, H., and Yahara, I. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press). Here we show that calmodulin regulates the binding of HSP90 to F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The binding of HSP90 to F-actin occurred optimally under physiological solution conditions, i.e. in 2 mM MgCl2 + 100 mM KCl. The binding was saturable in a molar ratio of about 1 HSP90 (dimer) to 10 actins. HSP90 was dissociated from F-actin by the binding of tropomyosin to F-actin. Calmodulin was found to inhibit the binding of HSP90 to F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Moreover, the equilibrium gel filtration demonstrated that calmodulin binds to HSP90 in the presence of Ca2+, but not in the absence of Ca2+. These data indicate that HSP90 complexed with Ca2+-calmodulin is unable to bind to F-actin. Ca2+-dependent interaction of HSP90 with calmodulin as well as calmodulin-regulated binding of HSP90 to F-actin revealed here may provide new insight into the function of HSP90 and the regulation of actin structure in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562209938,"Phorbol esters which activate protein kinase C increased the percentage of membrane-bound protein kinase C activity in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells from less than 10 to 20-50% within 30 min. Permeabilization of chromaffin cells with digitonin in the absence of Ca2+ and phorbol esters caused virtually 100% of the protein kinase C activity to leave the cells within 1 h, which is consistent with protein kinase C being soluble and cytosolic. However, if cells were incubated for 15-30 min with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) prior to permeabilization, 50-60% of the protein kinase C activity exited from the cells within 1 h of permeabilization. In cells not incubated with phorbol ester, permeabilization in the presence of 1-10 microM Ca2+ also decreased the rate at which protein kinase C exited from the cells. The slower release of protein kinase C caused by prior incubation of the cells with TPA or because of the presence of micromolar Ca2+ in permeabilized cells was associated with increased membrane-bound protein kinase C. The effects of TPA and permeabilization in the presence of micromolar Ca2+ were approximately additive. Active phorbol esters had different abilities to cause retention of protein kinase C in digitonin-treated cells. Dioctanoylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C in vitro and enhanced Ca2+-dependent secretion from permeabilized chromaffin cells similarly to TPA, also increased membrane-bound protein kinase C in intact cells, but had no effect on the retention of protein kinase C in permeabilized cells in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The different abilities of protein kinase C activators to cause retention of protein kinase C in subsequently permeabilized cells suggest differences in the reversibility of the binding. The mixed nicotinic-muscarinic agonist carbachol and the nicotinic agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium, but not the muscarinic agonist muscarine, caused 3-10% of the total protein kinase C activity to become membrane-bound within 3 min in intact chromaffin cells. Thus, nicotinic stimulation of chromaffin cells may rapidly activate protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1659135706,"The cytochrome P-450-mediated reactions of the synthetic stilbene estrogen (E)-diethylstilbestrol (DES) and of 2-hydroxyestradiol have been investigated in vitro. Depending on the cofactor used, microsomal enzymes catalyzed reductions and/or oxidations of the estrogens: Phenobarbital-induced rat liver microsomes catalyzed the oxidation of DES to 4',4-diethylstilbestrol quinone (DES quinone) with cumene hydroperoxide as cofactor. The quinone was unstable and spontaneously rearranged to (Z,Z)-dienestrol. DES quinone was reduced to a mixture of E- and Z-isomers of DES by NADPH catalyzed by purified cytochrome P-450 reductase. After rearrangement of the quinone to (Z,Z)-dienestrol, reduction reactions did not proceed. Rat liver microsomes and NADPH catalyzed the conversion of DES to (Z,Z)-dienestrol and (Z)-DES, but DES quinone could not be detected. The reactions described provide direct evidence for microsome-mediated redox cycling of estrogens. Although DES quinone could not be detected in the incubation of DES, microsomes, and NADPH as cofactor, the intermediacy of the quinone is demonstrated by the formation of (Z,Z)-dienestrol, the marker product for oxidation. The quinone could not be detected because it was rapidly reduced to DES and its Z-isomer. Microsome-mediated redox cycling between 2-hydroxyestradiol and the corresponding quinone was also demonstrated. Using cumene hydroperoxide as cofactor, the oxidation to the quinone was favored, while with NADPH as cofactor the reduction to 2-hydroxyestradiol was preferred. It is postulated that microsome-mediated redox cycling of estrogens plays a role in hormonal carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2107115514,"In primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes, transcription of the albumin gene, measured as incorporation of [alpha-32P]UTP into mRNA in isolated nuclei, decreased dramatically during culture without addition of serum and hormone, becoming almost negligible 10 h after plating. Of the hormones tested, dexamethasone (0.1 microM) prevented this decrease and restored the transcription within 2 h to the same level as that before culture. The half-maximum dose of dexamethasone for induction of transcription of the albumin gene was about 30 nM. The in vitro finding that expression of the albumin gene is strictly regulated by glucocorticoid was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in adrenalectomized rats showing that the transcription decreased markedly 14 days after adrenalectomy, but was restored rapidly by administration of hydrocortisone. This finding was also supported by identification of a glucocorticoid regulatory sequence from -50 to -62 base pairs between the TATA box and CAT box upstream of the 5'-end of the albumin gene. Cycloheximide inhibited the induction of transcription of the albumin gene by dexamethasone, suggesting that a rapidly induced mediator protein, which is also regulated by glucocorticoid, is involved in the induction of albumin gene expression by glucocorticoid. The albumin gene was also regulated by various other hormones besides glucocorticoid. Glucagon markedly enhanced the transcription induced by dexamethasone, although glucagon alone had no effect. Conversely, epinephrine suppressed stimulation of expression of the albumin gene by dexamethasone. Insulin and triiodothyronine had no effect on transcription of the albumin gene. From these findings we conclude that expression of the albumin gene depends strictly on glucocorticoid, and this dependence is modulated by other hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1487147159,"The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of specific proteins was demonstrated directly in the intact vertebrate nervous system in vivo. By exploiting the neurons' ability to segregate a select group of cytoskeletal proteins from most other phosphorylated constituents of the cell by axoplasmic transport, we were able to examine the dynamics of phosphate turnover on neurofilament proteins in mouse retinal ganglion cell neurons simultaneously labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and [3H]proline in vivo. Three [3H]proline-labeled neurofilament protein (NFP) subunits, designated H (160-200 kDa), M (135-145 kDa), and L (68-70 kDa), entered optic axons in a mole:mole ratio similar to that of isolated axonal neurofilaments, supporting the notion that newly synthesized NFPs are transported along axons as assembled neurofilaments. NFP subunits incorporated high levels of 32P before reaching axonal sites at the level of the optic nerve. As neurofilaments were transported along axons, however, many initially incorporated [32P]phosphate groups were removed. Loss of these phosphate groups occurred to a different extent on each subunit. A minimum of 50-60 and 35-40% of the labeled phosphate groups was removed in a 5-day period from the L and M subunits, respectively. By contrast, the H subunit exhibited relatively little or no phosphate turnover during the same period. Dephosphorylation of L in axons is accompanied by a decrease in its net state of phosphorylation; changes in the phosphorylation state of H and M, however, also reflect ongoing addition of phosphates to these polypeptides during axonal transport (Nixon, R.A., Lewis, S.E., and Marotta, C.A. (1986) J. Neurosci., in press). The possibility is raised that dynamic rearrangements of phosphate topography on NFPs represent a mechanism to coordinate interactions of neurofilaments with other proteins as these elements are transported and incorporated into the stationary cytoskeleton along retinal ganglion cell axons."
https://openalex.org/W1827258403,"Conditions have been established which promote the accumulation of the dihydrolanosterol C-32 demethylation intermediates lanost-8-en-3 beta,32-diol and 3 beta-hydroxylanost-8-en-32-aldehyde with intact hepatic microsomes. Accumulation of dihydrolanosterol-derived oxysterols occurs with a variety of assay manipulations which include short incubation times, limiting enzyme amounts, high pH, and increasing substrate concentration. In addition, competitive inhibition of dihydrolanosterol demethylation by lanosterol, or the reciprocal inhibition of lanosterol demethylation by dihydrolanosterol, leads to oxysterol accumulation at the expense of demethylated end product. Similarly, the nonsteroidal demethylase inhibitors miconazole and ketoconazole promote oxysterol accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, cholesterol loading of isolated microsomes results in changes in the measured kinetic constants, Km and Vmax, and results in enhanced oxysterol accumulation above that seen in control microsomal preparations. The major oxysterol intermediate accumulated under all the conditions described above is the C-32 aldehyde in an approximate 3:1 ratio to the C-32 alcohol. These data support the conclusion that a single enzyme species is responsible for all three oxidations of the C-32 demethylation sequence. In addition, intermediates which do not routinely accumulate during demethylation are freely diffusible from the enzyme when appropriate conditions are established to prevent their further metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2140704929,"Lipoprotein biosynthesis in larvae of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) was investigated. By immunoblotting, it was shown that the apoproteins are present in the fat body, but not in the midgut. Fat body incubated in vitro with [35S]methionine secreted labeled apoproteins. However, when the density of the secreted particle was determined, it was found at 1.24-1.28 g/ml instead of 1.15 g/ml, which is the density of the circulating lipoprotein. Lipid analysis of immunoprecipitated lipoprotein secreted by the fat body showed a phospholipid/diacylglycerol ratio of 8.3 rather than 0.9, the ratio found in the circulating lipoprotein. When labeled oleic acid or triolein was fed to larvae, it was found that greater than 98% of the label in the circulating lipoprotein was in diacylglycerol. In studies using animals raised on a fat-free diet, it was shown that the circulating lipoprotein has properties comparable to those of the material secreted in vitro by the fat body and that this diacylglycerol-poor particle can be converted to the normal lipoprotein by feeding a bolus of triolein. These data support the hypothesis that the fat body makes and secretes a nascent lipoprotein which contains apoproteins and phospholipid, but is devoid of diacylglycerol. The diacylglycerol is then picked up from the midgut to complete assembly of the mature circulating lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1517922196,"Rabbit secretory components (SC) constitute a family of markedly heterogeneous glycoproteins which are released in the secretions as free SC or as SC bound to polymeric immunoglobulins. The aim of this work was to determine the region of the SC polypeptides which is involved in IgA binding. The high and the low Mr forms of free SC (or IgA-dissociated bound SC) and the native secretory IgA complex were subjected to limited tryptic digestion. Chemically characterized peptides ranging in apparent size from 15 to 20 kDa, depending upon the allotype, were shown to be necessary and sufficient for efficient noncovalent binding to IgA dimers (subclass g). These fragments encompass the amino-terminal first domain of SC, i.e. residues 1-126, when aligned with the predicted amino acid sequence from a cDNA clone encoding the rabbit polymeric Ig receptor (Mostov, K.E., Friedlander, M., and Blobel, G. (1984) Nature 308, 37-43). The high and the low Mr forms of SC exhibited the same relative affinity for IgA dimers, suggesting that the postulated internal deletion in the smaller polypeptide (Kuhn, L. C., Kocher, H.-P., Hanly, W.C., Cook, L., Jaton, J.-C., and Kraehenbuhl, J.-P. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6653-6659) does not impair the IgA dimer recognition function."
https://openalex.org/W1571929744,"The effects of the polyamine spermine on the regulation of Ca2+ transport by subcellular organelles from rat liver, heart, and brain were investigated using ion-sensitive minielectrodes and a 45Ca2+ tracer method. Spermine stimulated Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria but not by microsomes. In the presence of spermine, isolated mitochondria could maintain a free extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration of 0.3-0.2 microM. Stimulation of the initial rates of Ca2+ uptake and 45Ca2+ cycling of mitochondria by spermine shows that this was accomplished through a decrease of the apparent Km for Ca2+ uptake by the Ca2+ uniporter. The half maximally effective concentration of spermine (50 microM) was in the range of physiological concentrations of this polyamine in the cell. Spermidine was five times less effective. Putrescine was ineffective. The stimulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by spermine was inhibited by Mg2+ in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the diminished contribution of the mitochondria to the regulation of the free extraorganellar Ca2+ concentration could mostly be compensated for by microsomal Ca2+ uptake. Spermine also reversed ruthenium red-induced Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria. It is concluded that spermine is an activator of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter and Mg2+ an antagonist. By this mechanism, the polyamines can confer to the mitochondria an important role in the regulation of the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration in the cell and of the free Ca2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1605386958,"Model membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine, various cerebrosides, and cholesterol have been studied by electron microscopy, deuterium NMR, and phosphorus-31 NMR. Large variations in phosphatidylcholine membrane morphology are observed when cerebrosides are present in phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Large spherical liposomes, small spherical liposomes, and long tubular liposomes are formed, depending on the relative acyl chain lengths of the phosphatidylcholine and cerebroside. In some cases, cholesterol can reverse the morphological effects of cerebrosides. These results suggest that cerebrosides, which are found in high concentrations in certain highly specialized membranes, can affect membrane shape and may be involved in the mechanism of formation of membranes with unusual morphology, e.g. neural myelin and the brush border membrane of the intestinal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1607897070,"Tyrosine countertransport was used to demonstrate the existence of a carrier system for neutral amino acids in the lysosomal membrane of FRTL-5 thyroid cells. In addition to tyrosine, the carrier system recognized the neutral amino acids leucine, histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. Cystine and lysine, amino acids for which a lysosomal carrier system has been demonstrated, showed no competition with tyrosine for countertransport. The tyrosine system showed stereospecificity and cation independence. It did not require an acidic lysosome or the availability of free thiols. The apparent Km for tyrosine was approximately 100 microM; the energy of activation of the system was approximately 9.7 kcal/mol. This new lysosomal membrane carrier system for neutral amino acids resembles the plasma membrane L system in 3T3 Chinese hamster ovary cells and melanoma B-16 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1510726200,"NC1 subunits were purified from gel filtration pools of acid-extracted, collagenase-digested human glomerular basement membranes (hGBM). This methodology, which enriches 28-kDa monomers (M28) in the total digest, allowed purification of these monomers and 24-kDa (M24) and 26-kDa (M26) monomers free from dimers. Reactivity of these subunits with Goodpasture autoantibodies using immunoblotting of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis gels showed strong reactivity with the purified M28 subunits. Inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, used to quantitate the reactivity of the purified NC1 subunits, indicated that M28 had a greater than 10-fold increase in ability to inhibit binding to NC1 than NC1 itself. Comparison of hGBM NC1 components were made with those obtained from collagenase digests of salt and acid-extracted bovine and sheep GBM and Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor similarly purified by gel filtration and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two-dimensional gel analysis of these NC1 isolates revealed absence of the very cationic M28 monomers. Reactivity with antibodies eluted from diseased kidneys of sheep immunized with hGBM (Steblay nephritis) was compared with Goodpasture autoantibody reactivity by immunoblotting two-dimensional gels of hGBM NC1. We conclude that a very cationic M28 monomer (M28 ) found only in hGBM is the probable target in Goodpasture syndrome, that the epitope is present on most NC1 components from extracted and unextracted hGBM, and is exposed by urea denaturation which is enhanced by acid treatment. A weakly cationic M28 monomer (M28+) is present in GBM from other species and is the probable target in Steblay nephritis. Differential recognition of the two M28 components by these antibodies points to different genetic origins or possibly distinct post-translational modifications for these components. This is supported by their presence or absence in different species and tissues, as well as biochemical differences from the M24/26 monomers which presumably are derived from alpha 1(IV) and alpha 2(IV) collagen chains."
https://openalex.org/W1607165233,"Radiation inactivation analysis was used to determine the target size of rat liver microsomal glutathione S-transferase both in situ and following purification. When Tris-HCl-washed microsomes were irradiated, there was a 1.5-2.0-fold increase in enzymatic activity over the first 3-6 megarads followed by a decrease in enzymatic activity. Above 48 megarads the radiation inactivation curve of the Tris-HCl-washed microsomes was described by a monoexponential function which gave a target size of 48 kDa. The enzymatic activity of the microsomal enzyme was selectively increased by treating the Tris-HCl-washed microsomes either with N-ethylmaleimide or washing the microsomes with small unilamellar vesicles made from phosphatidylcholine. The inactivation curves obtained with both types of treated microsomes were simple monoexponential decays in enzymatic activity with target sizes of 46 kDa (N-ethylmaleimide) and 44 kDa (unilamellar vesicles). The microsomal enzyme was detergent solubilized and purified. The Mr value of the purified protein was 15,500 (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). These data suggest that the functional unit of the microsomal form of glutathione S-transferase in situ is a trimer. The target size of the purified enzyme solubilized in Triton X-100 was 85 kDa, and no increase in activity was observed at the lower radiation doses. The increase in the target size of the purified enzyme could not be ascribed solely to the presence of the detergent. This result suggests that the microsomal form of this enzyme can exist as catalytically active oligomers of different sizes depending on its environment."
https://openalex.org/W1516916006,"Weanling male Wistar rats were deprived of dietary and light sources of vitamin D for 11-18 weeks along with age-matched diet vitamin D-repleted controls to evaluate the role of lipid fluidity in the stimulatory effect of calcitriol on Ca transport. The static component of fluidity of proximal small intestine brush border membrane, as assessed by steady-state fluorescence techniques using the fluorophore 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, was similar between these two groups. In contrast, the component of fluidity, as assessed by DL-2-(9-anthroyl)-stearic acid and DL-12-(9-anthroyl)-stearic acid, was decreased in membranes of D-deprived animals. Lipid composition was analyzed to evaluate the potential mechanism mediating these fluidity changes. In vitamin D-deprived rats, linoleic (18:2) and arachidonic (20:4) acids of the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fractions of the membrane were decreased, whereas palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acids were increased in the phosphatidylethanolamine fraction of the membrane. These associated fatty acyl alterations could explain, at least in part, the differences in membrane fluidity between D-repleted and D-deprived rats. Membrane fluidity, lipid composition, and duodenal Ca transport were also analyzed 1, 2, and 5 h after the acute administration of 1-25-dihydroxycholecalciferol to D-deprived animals. In D-deprived rats, within 1-2 h, this hormone restored to levels of vitamin D-repleted controls the dynamic component of fluidity and concentrations of the same membrane phospholipid fatty acids. Since these changes temporally precede detectable increases in Ca absorption (demonstrable only during the 5th h), these data support the hypothesis that alterations in membrane fluidity and lipid composition may play an important role in the stimulation of intestinal calcium transport by calcitriol."
https://openalex.org/W4077927,"Recombinant human CuZn superoxide dismutase as expressed in yeast has been crystallized in three different crystal forms. Hexagonal plates grow from 2.4 M ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, and belong to the space group P6(3)22, with cell dimensions a = b = 113.5(3), c = 151.5(5) A, and Vm = 2.21 A3/dalton for two dimers per asymmetric unit. At 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5, chunky wedges grow in space group C222(1), a = 205.2(6), b = 166.5(4), c = 145.4(4) A with a Vm of 2.43 A3/dalton for eight dimers per asymmetric unit. With polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5-8.0, hexagonal prisms are obtained with cell dimensions a = b = 197.4(6), c = 43.1(2) A, space group P6, and Vm = 2.53 A3/dalton for three dimers per asymmetric unit. All of these forms diffract to high resolution, are stable to x-rays, and appear suitable for determination of the atomic structure. Crystals of the doubly mutated enzyme (Cys6----Ala, Cys111----Ser) grown from both micro- and macroseeds of the wild type protein demonstrate the feasibility of isomorphous crystallization of site-directed mutants of the cloned parent enzyme for comparative structure-function studies."
https://openalex.org/W123576738,"We have purified the luteinizing hormone (LH)/human choriogonadotropin (hCG) receptor by sequential affinity column on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose and hCG-Sepharose. The method was designed to allow also the purification of lactogen receptor from the initial starting material. The purified LH/hCG receptor retained full binding affinity and was identified as a single protein of Mr = 73,000 +/- 3,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Cross-linking studies performed after binding of hCG to the purified LH/hCG receptor indicated that the hCG alpha-subunit undergoes predominant interaction with the receptor molecule. The influence of the beta-subunit in this interaction seems to occur mainly through its association with the alpha-subunit, presumably by conferring specificity to the alpha-subunit for its hormonal interaction with the receptor. The technique described in this study is simple and allows rapid purification of microgram amounts of biologically active receptor suitable for further molecular characterization, microsequencing, and functional reconstitution studies."

https://openalex.org/W1509203675,"Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity has been detected and identified in human liver samples by ligand blotting with biotinylated lipoproteins and by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody raised against the bovine adrenal LDL receptor. The molecular weight of the human liver LDL receptor, approximately 132,000 on nonreduced polyacrylamide gels, is identical to that of LDL receptors detected in normal human skin fibroblasts by the same methods. LDL receptor-dependent binding activity in human liver samples has been semi-quantitated by integrating the areas under the peaks after scanning photographs of ligand blots, and receptor protein determined by radioimmunoassay with purified bovine adrenal LDL receptor protein as the standard. There was a highly significant correlation between the values obtained by each method for seven different liver samples (r = 0.948). The LDL receptor protein content of liver membranes from 10 subjects as determined by radioimmunoassay was inversely related to the plasma LDL cholesterol concentration (r = 0.663, p = 0.05) but not to other plasma lipid values, including total plasma cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, or plasma triglyceride concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1528261927,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates the renal conversion of 25-OH-vitamin D3 to 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 in young animals. There is evidence that PTH acts via cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but the identity of the phosphorylated protein(s) is unknown. The present study investigates the possibility that phosphorylation modification of specific components of the renal mitochondrial, cytochrome P-450-linked 25-OH-vitamin D3-1 alpha-hydroxylase is involved in the regulation of 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 production. Mitochondria were isolated from [32P]phosphate-labeled renal cortical slices which had been divided into control and agonist-treated groups. The hydroxylase protein components from the solubilized mitochondria were partially purified using p-chloroamphetamine-Sepharose affinity chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation was observed only in a protein with an Mr = 12,000 and a pI of 4.2 by autoradiography of the gels. This radiolabeled protein was immunoprecipitated with adrenodoxin antibody. Additionally, the protein in the same Mr region of the polyacrylamide gel reacted with adrenodoxin antibody and co-migrated with bovine adrenodoxin. PTH and forskolin treatment resulted in decreased phosphate incorporation into the protein, whereas A23187 treatment increased the phosphorylation. In parallel experiments, affinity-isolated hydroxylase from control and PTH-treated slices was used to assess in vitro hydroxylase activity using [3H]25-hydroxyvitamin D3 as substrate. The hydroxylase activity derived from PTH-treated tissue was significantly higher than that of control. From these data, it is proposed that renal response to PTH in terms of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 hydroxylase stimulation involves dephosphorylation of renoredoxin, the ferrodoxin component of this hydroxylase complex."
https://openalex.org/W2916572865,"The isolation and sequencing of cDNA clone coding for the entire sequence of human nonhistone chromosomal protein HMG-14 is described. Sequence analysis reveals that the open reading frame constitutes only 25% of the transcript, that the 5'-untranslated region is extremely rich in GC residues (75%), and that the 3'-untranslated region is highly enriched in AT residues. The amino acid sequence, deduced from the reading frame, is 94% homologous to the calf thymus protein suggesting evolutionary constraints on the conformation of the protein. The human genome contains 60-90 HMG-14 gene copy equivalents which, as suggested by Southern analysis, are not tandemly arranged. Northern analysis of RNA isolated from several sources reveals that a single-sized mRNA codes for this protein. Southern analysis reveals that cross-hybridizing sequences are present in the genome of several different species indicating that the evolutionary origin of this gene was over 350 million years ago. The overall features of the human HMG-14 cDNA are very similar to those of the human HMG-17 cDNA, and the number of gene equivalents present in the human genome is similar for the two proteins. However, their nucleotide sequence is significantly different indicating that the multigene family coding for HMG-14 is distinct from that coding for HMG-17."
https://openalex.org/W1590156434,"Actobindin is a new actin-binding protein isolated from Acanthamoeba castellanii. It is composed of two possibly identical polypeptide chains of approximately 13,000 daltons, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and with isoelectric points of 5.9. In the native state, actobindin appears to be a dimer of about 25,000 daltons by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. It contains no tryptophan and probably no tyrosine. Actobindin reduces the concentration of F-actin at steady state and inhibits the rate of filament elongation to extents consistent with the formation of a 1:1 actobindin-G-actin complex in a reaction with a KD of about 5 microM. The available data do not eliminate the possibility of other stoichiometries for the complex, but they are not consistent with any significant interaction between actobindin and F-actin. Despite the similarities between the effects of actobindin and Acanthamoeba profilin on the polymerization of Acanthamoeba actin, the two proteins are quite distinct with different native and subunit molecular weights, different isoelectric points, and different amino acid compositions. Also, unlike profilin, actobindin binds as well to rabbit skeletal muscle G-actin and to pyrenyl-labeled G-actin as it does to unmodified Acanthamoeba G-actin."
https://openalex.org/W1601854459,"A 3.7-kilobase pair deletion including the entire beta major globin gene results in beta-thalassemia in a murine model of the disease (Skow, L. C., Burkhart, B. A., Johnson, F. M., Popp, R. A., Popp, D. M., Goldberg, S. Z., Anderson, W. F., Barnett, L. B., and Lewis, S. E. (1983) Cell 34, 1043-1052). There is a compensatory increase in synthesis of beta minor globin, resulting in a beta minor/alpha globin ratio of 0.75 in the homozygous thalassemic mouse, as compared to 0.2 in the normal homozygous diffuse mouse. The results presented here demonstrate that the increase in beta minor globin synthesis occurs at translation rather than at transcription. RNase T1 analysis of reticulocyte mRNA reveals that the beta/alpha ratio of globin mRNA is 0.3, significantly lower than the globin synthetic ratio of 0.7. However, the beta/alpha ratio of mRNA on polysomes is higher than unassociated mRNA, demonstrating that beta minor mRNA is preferentially translated. Elevated synthesis of beta minor globin is maintained during in vitro translation in thalassemic reticulocyte lysate. In this system, partial inhibition of translational elongation by cycloheximide decreases the beta minor/alpha globin synthetic ratio, whereas partial inhibition of initiation by hemin deficiency increases the beta minor/alpha synthetic ratio. This suggests that beta minor mRNA competes with alpha-mRNA for a limiting mRNA binding factor at initiation of translation."

A mutation in the gene sin4 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe leads to loss of 5-(methoxycarbonylmethyl) thiouridine (mcm5s2U) from the first anticodon position of tRNAs. This resembles the phenotype of sin3 (Heyer, W. D., Thuriaux, P., Kohli, J., Ebert, P., Kersten, H., Gehrke, C., Kuo, K. C., and Agris, P. F. (1984) J. Biol.

In vivo 35S-labeled tRNA from the parental suppressor strain sup3, the antisuppressor strains sin3 and sin4, and the double mutant sin3 sin4 has been digested to nucleosides and analyzed with high performance liquid chromatography methods. The major sulfur-carrying nucleoside in wild-type S. pombe tRNA is mcm5s2U. It is reduced in the mutant strains. Two other thiolated nucleosides are also present: 2-thiouridine and a nucleoside of unknown structure. Neither was affected by the antisuppressor mutations. Thiocytidine has not been found. Independent from their effect on suppressors, the two mutations sin3 and sin4 reduce the growth rate of cells, and sin3 also increases cell length. In vivo decoding of the serine codon UCG by the UCA reading serine tRNA is not promoted by the two antisuppressor mutations."

LBr, in addition to the broader lines normally associated with bacterial cellular material. These narrow lines arise from poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate). The cellular carbon contained in this storage material can be measured quantitatively and nondestructively from the solid-state NMR spectra. We find that cells starved for phosphorus store up to 50% of their total carbon as poly(beta-hydroxybutyrate).

https://openalex.org/W2144239922,"Band 3, the erythrocyte anion transporter, has been shown to transfer between human erythrocytes and sonicated vesicles (Newton, A. C., Cook, S. L., and Huestis, W. H. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 6110-6117). Functional band 3 becomes associated with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles incubated with human red blood cells. Proteolytic degradation patterns reveal that the transporter is transferred to the vesicles in native orientation. In erythrocytes, native band 3 is degraded on the exoplasmic membrane face by chymotrypsin and on the cytoplasmic surface by trypsin (Cabantchik, Z. I., and Rothstein, A. (1974) J. Membr. Biol. 15, 227-248; Jennings, M. L., Anderson, M. P., and Monaghan, R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9002-9010). Band 3 in intact protein-vesicle complexes is degraded by exogenous chymotrypsin but not by trypsin. In contrast, trypsin entrapped in the lumen of the vesicles proteolyses the vesicle-bound band 3 quantitatively. Band 3 remaining in the membranes of vesicle-treated cells and in cell fragments is not degraded detectably by vesicle-entrapped trypsin. These observations indicate that band 3 is unlikely to transfer between cell and vesicle membranes via a water-soluble form or to adhere nonspecifically to the vesicle surface; the aqueous contents of vesicles and cells (or membrane fragments) are not pooled during cell-vesicle incubations, hence no cell-vesicle fusion occurs; and the band 3 associated with the sonicated vesicle fraction is inserted in the vesicle bilayer in native orientation, with its cytoplasmic segment contacting the aqueous contents of the vesicle lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1482341644,"The accumulation in large amounts of bisnucleoside polyphosphates (Ap4X) after heat shock in Xenopus laevis oocytes or cultured hepatoma cells (HTC cells) is observed after exposure to temperatures of 45 degrees C or higher. The accumulation is a transient phenomenon, with the collapse in cellular ATP concentration severely affecting the rate of synthesis of Ap4X, allowing degrading activities to empty the pool of these compounds under prolonged heat shock. This accumulation of Ap4X to high levels, compared to the basic content, is only observed under conditions leading to irreversible damage, ultimately resulting in the death of the cell. It is shown that the increase in Ap4X after hyperthermia is due to the partial or almost complete inhibition of their degradation pathways, rather than to a stimulation of their rate of synthesis. Finally, the synthesis of heat-shock proteins could be observed under conditions which do not lead to important accumulation of Ap4X, therefore ruling out the possibility that these adenylylated nucleotides would behave as chemical signals (alarmones) triggering the synthesis of heat-shock proteins. Nevertheless, on the basis of our earlier results (Guedon, G., Sovia, D., Ebel, J. P., Befort, D., and Remy, P. (1985) Embo J. 4, 3743-3749), it cannot be excluded that Ap4X might play a role in the regulation of the heat-shock response; this would, however, rely on variations in Ap4X concentrations which do not exceed a factor of 2."
https://openalex.org/W1600011641,"Short microtubules can be formed by shearing a sample at polymerization steady state of microtubules formed by glycerol-induced assembly of pure tubulin dimer. Such short microtubules show a rapid increase in mean length. The rate of this increase is too fast to be accounted for by statistical redistribution of subunits between microtubules. We propose that the fast length changes are a result of the end-to-end annealing of microtubules demonstrated by Rothwell et al. (Rothwell, S. W., Grasser, W. A., and Murphy, D. B. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 102, 619-627). This proposal has been tested by measuring the rate of annealing of free microtubules to Tetrahymena axonemes under conditions identical to those used for the lengthening of sheared microtubules. That free microtubules anneal to axonemal microtubules is indicated by the following observations. Axonemes elongate at both ends in the presence of steady state microtubules, as predicted for a symmetrical annealing process; under conditions where the microtubule number concentration is greater than that for axonemes, the initial rate of axoneme elongation is more rapid with a low concentration of long microtubules at steady state than with a high number concentration of short microtubules at steady state. These observations are inconsistent with the predictions of a model based on microtubule dynamic instability (Mitchison, T., and Kirschner, M. (1984) Nature 312, 237-242). The annealing rate observed with axonemes can account for the rate of elongation of sheared steady state microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1561636435,"Human nonhistone chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 are encoded by genes which are part of multigene families. Southern analysis of human, mouse, and rat genomic restriction digests reveals that the two families are distinct. Although the cDNAs of HMG-14 and HMG-17 do not cross-hybridize, they have several similar structural features: the open reading frame comprises only 23% of the transcripts, the 5'-untranslated region is extremely GC rich whereas the 3'-untranslated region is unusually long and AT rich. The overall sequence homology between the two transcripts is highest (71%) in the 90 nucleotides coding for the DNA-binding domains of the proteins. The sequence of the human HMG-14 and HMG-17 proteins, deduced from the open reading frame, differs by more than 50%; the DNA-binding domains of the proteins show 74% sequence homology. However, even in this 30-residue long peptide there are significant differences between the proteins as the proline content of HMG-17 (8 residues) is twice that of HMG-14. The two proteins have different hydropathy index profiles and are serologically distinct. The multigene families may have evolved independently from similar genetic elements or from a shared ancestral gene in which the nucleotide sequence coding for the DNA-binding domain of the protein is the most conserved region. The structural differences between the molecules and the differences in their DNA-binding domains suggest that the proteins may be involved in distinguishable cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1523703364,"Rat liver nuclear thyroid hormone receptor was subjected to limited trypsin digestion, and the tryptic fragment of the 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)-receptor complex was characterized. Rat liver nuclear thyroid hormone receptor is an asymmetrical protein with Stokes radius of 34 A, sedimentation coefficient of 3.4 S, and molecular weight of 49,000. A globular T3-receptor complex with Stokes radius of 22 A, sedimentation coefficient of 2.8 S, and molecular weight of 26,000 was obtained by tryptic digestion. This fragment had no DNA binding activity, whereas undigested receptor showed significant DNA binding activity. Addition of undigested receptor to the tryptic fragment did not restore DNA binding activity of digested receptor, nor did mixing inhibit DNA binding activity of undigested receptor complex. Undigested receptor bound to core histones, and this activity was stronger than with other proteins tested (H1 histone, cytochrome c, and ovalbumin). The tryptic fragment of receptor maintained core histone binding activity comparable to that of undigested receptor. The tryptic fragment had affinity for T3 comparable to undigested receptor as assessed by Scatchard analysis and the same rate for dissociation of [125I]T3 from receptor. The tryptic fragment of the T3-receptor complex was more stable than undigested receptor at 43 degrees C. Digestion of receptor unoccupied by T3 caused a significantly larger loss of T3 binding capacity than did digestion of T3-occupied receptor, suggesting a protective effect of T3 on a second trypsin-sensitive site on the receptor, which, when cut, destroys T3 binding activity."

Reserpine treatment produced profound effects on the molecular weight profile of nearly all enkephalin-containing peptides. Increased production of low molecular weight immunoreactive [Met5]enkephalin, [Leu5]enkephalin, [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8, and [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 was observed in reserpine-treated cultures; immunoreactivity corresponding to several intermediate sized enkephalin-containing peptides such as Peptide B and the high molecular weight [Met5]enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 immunoreactive peptide was decreased. The production of two amidated opioid peptides, amidorphin and metorphamide, was greatly accelerated in the presence of reserpine. The increased levels of low molecular weight enkephalins could not be accounted for by assuming decreased basal release. These results indicate that reserpine treatment is able to increase the extent of post-translational processing of proenkephalin within chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1500269813,"Defining how extramitochondrial high-energy phosphate acceptors influence the rates of heart oxidative phosphorylation is essential for understanding the control of myocardial respiration. When the production of phosphocreatine is coupled to electron transport via mitochondrial creatine kinase, the net reaction can be expressed by the balanced equation: creatine + Pi----phosphocreatine + H2O. This suggests that rates of oxygen consumption could be regulated by changes in [creatine], [Pi], or [phosphocreatine], alone or in combination. The effects of altering these metabolites upon mitochondrial rates of respiration were examined in vitro. Rat heart mitochondria were incubated in succinate-containing oxygraph medium (pH 7.2, 37 degrees C) supplemented with five combinations of creatine (1.0-20 mM), phosphocreatine (0-25 mM), and Pi (0.25-5.0 mM). In all cases, the mitochondrial creatine kinase reaction was initiated by additions of 0.5 mM ATP. To emphasize the duality of control, the results are presented as three-dimensional stereoscopic projections. Under physiological conditions, with 5.0 mM creatine, increases in Pi or decreases in phosphocreatine had little influence upon mitochondrial respiration. When phosphocreatine was held constant (15 mM), changes in [creatine] modestly stimulated respiratory rates, whereas Pi again showed little effect. With 1.0 mM Pi, respiration clearly became dependent upon changes in [creatine] and [phosphocreatine]. Initially, respiratory rates increased as a function of [creatine]. However, at [phosphocreatine] values below 10 mM, product deinhibition was observed, and respiratory rates rapidly increased to 80% State 3. With 2.0 mM Pi or higher, respiration could be regulated from State 4 to 100% State 3. Overall, the data show how increasing [creatine] and decreasing [phosphocreatine] influence the rates of oxidative phosphorylation when mediated by mitochondrial creatine kinase. Thus, these changes may become secondary cytoplasmic signals regulating heart oxygen consumption."

Specific cross-linked products were separated on a two-dimensional Triton-acid-urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel system, located by autoradiography, excised, and quantified. Disulfide bonds in the cross-links were then cleaved, and the protein constituents were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. HMG 17 cross-linked primarily to histone H2A while lower levels of cross-linking occurred between HMG 17 and the other histones. In contrast, cross-linking between 2 HMG 17 molecules bound on the same nucleosome core particle was relatively rare. We have concluded that H2A comprises part of the HMG 17 binding site. Less contact occurs between HMG 17 and the other core histones, and there is little contact possible between the 2 bound HMG 17 molecules. These results are in agreement with the current model for the structure of the nucleosome and the proposed binding sites for HMG 17."
https://openalex.org/W1565925650,"The interaction of three monoclonal rheumatoid factor IgM molecules with IgG antigens has been studied utilizing immunoglobulins isolated from three mixed cryoglobulins. Static light scattering measurements show that the stoichiometry of these immune complexes changes in a temperature-dependent manner from IgM(IgG)0-2 at temperatures greater than 37 degrees C to IgM(IgG)5 complexes at temperatures below 15 degrees C. These results were confirmed by the analysis of the composition of polyethyleneglycol-precipitated complexes. For one mixed cryoglobulin (Glo), temperature-dependent changes in stoichiometry were also verified by chemical cross-linking studies. Binding constants were determined by Scatchard analysis of light scattering data and by fluorescence polarization measurements. Values on the order of 10(5) M-1 were obtained for three monoclonal rheumatoid factor IgM molecules. Glo was further investigated by dynamic light scattering and partial specific volume measurements. Both dynamic light scattering and partial specific volume measurements provided evidence for surprising shape changes of the IgM X IgG complex as a function of temperature and IgG stoichiometry. Collectively, the data support the simple hypothesis that cryoprecipitation of mixed cryoglobulins occurs as a consequence of increases in the size (stoichiometry) of the complexes that are formed at low temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W1587663357,"The flux of 13C-labeled carbons from the soluble metabolite 2,3-cyclopyrophosphoglycerate (CPP), a novel compound found in high concentrations exclusively in methanobacteria and methanobrevibacter, into carbohydrate-containing material has been deduced by solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy which strongly argues for a role in gluconeogenesis for this unique metabolite. The turnover rates, but not the steady-state levels, of CPP labeled by 13CO2 or [13C]acetate depend dramatically on cell growth conditions. When the demand for carbohydrate synthesis is reduced (i.e. in stationary phase), the rates of CPP biosynthesis and degradation decrease 10-fold, and the disaccharide alpha, alpha-trehalose accumulates. Valinomycin, a metabolic inhibitor of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum growth, does not affect steady-state levels of CPP, but does decrease 13C uptake into the CPP pool. The effects of these different conditions on CPP labeling suggest stringent regulation of CPP linked to cellular metabolism. Labeling of CPP by [6-(13)C]glucose, which does not serve as an energy or carbon source for this organism, provides strong evidence that glucose is cleaved by the reverse of the gluconeogenesis pathway. This metabolic pathway linking glucose with triose phosphate type precursors and an analysis of the 13C NMR spectrum of CPP labeled by incubating cells with [U-13C]glucose have established that in vivo phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase must be reversible."
https://openalex.org/W33426708,Computer-generated models of the structures of deoxymyoglobin and CO-bound myoglobin show that the CO molecule is not packed so tightly by the amino acid residues of the distal pocket to prevent its motion away from the iron atom upon photodissociation. A simulation of low temperature photodissociation by energy minimization techniques shows that the CO moves to a position approximately 4 A away from the iron atom due to the van der Waals forces. The final position of the CO molecule requires far larger motion of the carbon atom than the oxygen atom and thereby suggests that the isotope dependence of the molecular tunneling is a consequence of the orientation of the photodissociated CO.

Gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate revealed a radioactive material with Mr greater than 200,000 that, on digestion with zymolyase containing an active protease, was converted sequentially to radioactive components with Mr = 134,000, 60,000, and 40,000."
https://openalex.org/W1513789664,The ability of 9-aminoacridine to induce mutagenic lesions during DNA replication in vitro was investigated. The ampicillinase gene of pBR322 was replicated in vitro in the presence of 9-aminoacridine. Transfection of the replicated DNA into Escherichia coli gave Amps mutants. Determination of the base changes in 76 of these mutants indicated that the spectrum of mutations induced by 9-aminoacridine was consistent with its action in vivo. Both large (407-base) and small (1- and 2-base) deletions were induced at repetitive sequences. The frequency of deletion mutations depended on the identity of the base deleted and sequences surrounding the deletions. The characteristics of the frameshift mutations induced were consistent with the interactions of 9-aminoacridine with DNA. These results establish that 9-aminoacridine can induce frameshift mutations during the replication process and provide an in vitro model of frameshift induction for mechanistic studies.

Glycopeptides obtained by Pronase digestion of each isolated chain were passed sequentially over columns of immobilized concanavalin A, Lens culinaris lectin, and phytohemagglutinins E and L in a prescribed manner to generate a lectin affinity profile which could be used to assign a minimal oligosaccharide structure for each glycopeptide studied. The data presented here demonstrate that a given class II polypeptide chain can bear several different oligosaccharides. Comparison of the glycosylation patterns of the HLA-DR and -DQ molecules shows that they are similar in most respects. However, there are qualitative differences in the oligosaccharides borne by HLA-DQ and -DR molecules. In addition, comparison between HLA-DQ and the homologous murine I-A molecules shows species-specific glycosylation patterns."
