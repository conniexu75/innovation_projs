https://openalex.org/W4232273699,"CEM15/APOBEC3G is a cellular protein required for resistance to infection by virion infectivity factor (Vif)-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Here, using a murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based system, we provide evidence that CEM15/APOBEC3G is a DNA deaminase that is incorporated into virions during viral production and subsequently triggers massive deamination of deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine within the retroviral minus (first)-strand cDNA, thus providing a probable trigger for viral destruction. Furthermore, HIV Vif can protect MLV from this CEM15/APOBEC3G-dependent restriction. These findings imply that targeted DNA deamination is a major strategy of innate immunity to retroviruses and likely also contributes to the sequence variation observed in many viruses (including HIV)."
https://openalex.org/W1971333632,"Cell shape in most eubacteria is maintained by a tough external peptidoglycan cell wall. Recently, cell shape determining proteins of the MreB family were shown to form helical, actin-like cables in the cell. We used a fluorescent derivative of the antibiotic vancomycin as a probe for nascent peptidoglycan synthesis in unfixed cells of various Gram-positive bacteria. In the rod-shaped bacterium B. subtilis, synthesis of the cylindrical part of the cell wall occurs in a helical pattern governed by an MreB homolog, Mbl. However, a few rod-shaped bacteria have no MreB system. Here, a rod-like shape can be achieved by a completely different mechanism based on use of polar growth zones derived from the division machinery. These results provide insights into the diverse molecular strategies used by bacteria to control their cellular morphology, as well as suggesting ways in which these strategies may impact on growth rates and cell envelope structure."
https://openalex.org/W2097664345,"The nuclear RNA binding protein, FCA, promotes Arabidopsis reproductive development. FCA contains a WW protein interaction domain that is essential for FCA function. We have identified FY as a protein partner for this domain. FY belongs to a highly conserved group of eukaryotic proteins represented in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the RNA 3' end-processing factor, Pfs2p. FY regulates RNA 3' end processing in Arabidopsis as evidenced through its role in FCA regulation. FCA expression is autoregulated through the use of different polyadenylation sites within the FCA pre-mRNA, and the FCA/FY interaction is required for efficient selection of the promoter-proximal polyadenylation site. The FCA/FY interaction is also required for the downregulation of the floral repressor FLC. We propose that FCA controls 3' end formation of specific transcripts and that in higher eukaryotes, proteins homologous to FY may have evolved as sites of association for regulators of RNA 3' end processing."
https://openalex.org/W2145149844,"The Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain constitutes a recently recognized protein-protein interaction domain found in the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoenzymes, λ/ι- and ζPKC; members of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) modules like MEK5, MEKK2, and MEKK3; and in several scaffold proteins involved in cellular signaling. Among the last group, p62 and Par6 (partitioning-defective 6) are involved in coupling the aPKCs to signaling pathways involved in cell survival, growth control, and cell polarity. By mutation analyses and molecular modeling, we have identified critical residues at the interaction surfaces of the PB1 domains of aPKCs and p62. A basic charge cluster interacts with an acidic loop and helix both in p62 oligomerization and in the aPKC-p62 interaction. Subsequently, we determined the abilities of mammalian PB1 domain proteins to form heteromeric and homomeric complexes mediated by this domain. We report several novel interactions within this family. An interaction between the cell polarity scaffold protein Par6 and MEK5 was found. Furthermore, p62 interacts both with MEK5 and NBR1 in addition to the aPKCs. Evidence for involvement of p62 in MEK5-ERK5 signaling is presented.

Specific protein-protein interactions mediated by modular protein domains are instrumental for ensuring specificity in cellular signal transduction (1Pawson T. Nash P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1027-1047PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins involved in signaling generally harbor multiple domains, allowing combinatorial use of these domains as modules in the assembly of specific multiprotein complexes (1Pawson T. Nash P.

Before the extent of the PB1 domain was recognized, a 28-amino acid sequence motif termed the octicosapeptide repeat (OPR) was noted to be present in the mammalian atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms λ and ζ, MEK5, p40 phox , p62, and two other mammalian proteins as well as in Drosophila Ref(2)p, yeast Cdc24, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Scd1 (6Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this sequence motif has been denoted Phox and Cdc (PC) or aPKC interaction domain (AID) (7Moscat J.

Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The OPR/PC/AID motifs are localized within the larger PB1 domains and have now been renamed OPCA motifs (3Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, a subset of PB1 domains does not contain the OPCA motif.The recently solved structure of the PB1 domain of the yeast protein Bem1p revealed a ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold similar to the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf-1 (4Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, except for a reported interaction between ζPKC and Ras (9Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), none of the proteins harboring this domain have been shown to bind to Ras (4Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Instead, several proteins containing PB1 domains have been shown to interact with each other. Thus, the scaffold proteins p62 and Par6 (partitioning-defective 6) use their PB1 domains to specifically interact with the PB1 domain of aPKCs (10Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl.

Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6959-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The interaction between p62 and aPKC is evolutionary conserved, since the Drosophila orthologue of p62, Ref(2)p, binds to aPKC (19Avila A. Silverman N. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8787-8795Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Par6 protein physically links the aPKCs to the Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, thus forming signaling complexes involved in cell polarity decisions (12Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G.

Nunoi H. Wakamatsu K. Tsunawaki S. Sato K. Ito T. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6312-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another PB1 domain protein that may potentially be engaged in heteromeric interactions with other PB1-domain proteins is TFG (TRK fused gene). TFG is known as a fusion partner to the nerve growth factor tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA in papillary thyroid carcinoma (22Greco A. Mariani C. Miranda C. Lupas A. Pagliardini S. Pomati M. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6118-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and to the Alk tyrosine kinase in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (23Hernandez L. Pinyol M. Hernandez S. Bea S. Pulford K. Rosenwald A. Lamant L. Falini B. Ott G. Mason D.Y. Delsol G. Campo E. Blood. 1999; 94: 3265-3268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oncogenic fusion gene products encode an N-terminal region of TFG, including the PB1 domain fused to the kinase domain of TrkA or Alk. The PB1 domain is necessary for full transforming activity (24Greco A. Fusetti L. Miranda C. Villa R. Zanotti S. Pagliardini S. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).PB1 domain interactions may also play an important role in a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module consisting of MAP/ERK kinase kinases (MEKK)-2 or -3, MEK5, and ERK5. This MAPK module is implicated in both proliferative and stress-induced signaling (25English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T. Shivakumar L. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

The N-terminal regions of all three proteins contain PB1 domains.Here, we have examined interactions between mammalian PB1 domain proteins. We have identified critical residues creating the interaction surfaces for the PB1-PB1 interactions between aPKCs and p62 and for the oligomerization of p62. In a systematic screen for PB1-mediated interactions, we found three novel interactions within the family of 13 mammalian PB1 domain proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Cultures—HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the antibiotics described above. Subconfluent HeLa and HEK 293 cells were transfected using either the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method or LipofectAmine PLUS (Invitrogen).Plasmid Constructs—Plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. Details on their construction are available upon request. To facilitate the transfer of single cDNA constructs into a variety of expression vectors, cDNA constructs were subcloned into Gateway entry vectors. Expression clones were made as described in the Gateway cloning technology instruction manual (Invitrogen). Destination vectors not obtained from Invitrogen were made by insertion of Gateway cassettes into the polylinker of the desired vectors, using the Gateway Vector Conversion System (Invitrogen). Mutagenesis of plasmid DNA was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All constructs generated by mutagenesis were verified by DNA sequencing using the BigDye sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis, PCR, and DNA sequencing reactions were obtained from Eurogentec, Belgium.Table IPlasmids used in this studyVectorsDescriptionSourcepGADT7Yeast two-hybrid Ga14 activation domain fusion vectorClontechpGBKT7Yeast two-hybrid Ga14 DNA binding domain fusion vectorClontechpcDNA3-HAMammalian HA-tag fusion expression vector, CMV and T7 promotersInvitrogen (48Diaz-Meco M.T.

The transformed yeast strains were mated, and diploids were selected by their ability to grow on media lacking leucine and tryptophan. Interactions were scored following plating on media lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine (quadruple dropout medium).In Vitro Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Expression vectors (0.5 μg) for HA-, GFP-, and Myc-tagged proteins were in vitro co-transcribed/co-translated in a total volume of 25 μl using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Twenty μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins were immediately diluted in 200 μl of ice-cold NET-N buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing one tablet per 10 ml of Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate. The samples were preincubated with a 50% solution of CL-4B Protein A-Sepharose beads in NET-N buffer for 20 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel and then incubated with 0.1 μg of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) for 1 h and for another 30 min in the presence of bovine serum albumin-saturated Protein A-Sepharose beads. The complexes were washed five times with 1 ml of NET-N and resuspended in 15 μl of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel load buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 35S-Labeled proteins were detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strains LE392 or BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). GST pull-down assays with in vitro transcribed and translated proteins were done as described previously (33Mikkola I. Bruun J.A. Holm T. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4109-4118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proteins were detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For GST pull-downs with recombinant HIS-MEK5, the protein was produced in BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen). The pull-downs were performed as for in vitro translated proteins except that the NET-N buffer also contained 6 mm EDTA and 6 mm EGTA. HIS-MEK5 was detected by immunoblotting.In Vivo Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—Subconfluent HEK 293 cells in 10-cm diameter dishes were transfected with LipofectAmine PLUS (Invitrogen) using 3 μg of each expression vector (2 μg when co-expressing three proteins). Due to a high expression level, less was added of expression vectors for HA-tagged p62 (1.5 μg) or GFP-tagged p62 (0.07 μg in the experiment displayed in Fig. 9B, 0.33 μg in the experiment displayed in Fig. 9C). Cells were lysed 20 h after transfection in 400 μl of PD buffer (34Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1218-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) containing inhibitor mixtures for proteases (Roche Applied Sciences) and phosphatases (Calbiochem). Lysates (except for 20 μl stored for later analysis of protein expression) were added to 0.5 μg of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5; Roche Applied Sciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunocomplexes were collected using albumin-saturated protein A-coupled agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min and purified by five washes in 1 ml of lysis buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 15 μlof2× Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. For endogenous proteins, cells (4 × 106) were lysed in 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above using 5 μg of a rabbit anti-MEK5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or 5 μg of preimmune rabbit IgG as a control.Immunoblots—Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (35Perander M. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13015-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (1: 1000; Abcam), goat anti-HA (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-MEK5 (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories), goat anti-Par6 (1:500; N-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Detection and quantification were performed using ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and the LumiAnalyst imager and software (Roche Applied Sciences). Stripping of membranes was done by incubating in 0.2 n NaOH for 10 min before washing and reblocking.Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on 8-well coverglass slides (Nunc) were fixed for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with cold methanol for 10 min, and blocked with 3% serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated at room temperature with primary and secondary antibodies for 60 and 30 min, respectively. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-Myc (1:200; 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA (1:200; 12CA5; Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-p62 (1:200; Transduction Laboratories), and secondary antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor 568 or 488 (1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The mouse anti-MEK5 and anti-p62 (both from Transduction Laboratories) were directly conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 and 555, respectively, using the Zenon labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Images were collected using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a LSM510 confocal module and processed using Adobe Photoshop.Molecular Modeling of PB1 Domains and PB1-PB1 Domain Interactions—The ICM Pro 3.0 program (Molsoft L.L.C., La Jolla, CA; available on the World Wide Web at www.molsoft.com) (36Abagyan R. Totrov M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) was utilized for comparative modeling, structure alignment, computer graphics visualizations, protein-protein docking, energy calculations, and calculations of molecular surfaces and electrostatic potentials. An initial model of the PB1 domain (residue range included Ser23–Phe106) of mouse λPKC (35Perander M. Bjorkoy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13015-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was built by comparative modeling using the homology module of ICM, the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1, and a structural alignment of the c-Raf-1 Ras-binding domain and Bem1p PB1 structures. The x-ray structure of the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1gua) structure was utilized as a template for the β-sheet (β1–β5), whereas the Bem1p (Protein Data Bank code 1ipg) structure was utilized as a template for the α1 and α2 helices. By using the homology module of ICM and a refined λPKC model as a template, models of PB1 domains from 10 other mammalian proteins were constructed. Each model was refined in ICM using energy minimizations, biased probability Monte Carlo simulations of side chain conformations, and local biased probability Monte Carlo simulations of long loops. Rigid body docking simulations were performed, and low energy conformations were collected in a conformational stack for each do"

Comparison of the two resulting atomic models shows that the ribosome changes from a compact structure to a looser one, coupled with the rearrangement of many of the proteins. Furthermore, in contrast to the unchanged inter-subunit bridges formed wholly by RNA, the bridges involving proteins undergo large conformational changes following the ratchet-like motion, suggesting an important role of ribosomal proteins in facilitating the dynamics of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2164845121,"NF-κB-induced gene expression contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. IκB kinase (IKK) is the converging point for the activation of NF-κB by a broad spectrum of inflammatory agonists and is thus a novel target for therapeutic intervention. We describe a small molecule, selective inhibitor of IKK-2, SC-514, which does not inhibit other IKK isoforms or other serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases. SC-514 inhibits the native IKK complex or recombinant human IKK-1/IKK-2 heterodimer and IKK-2 homodimer similarly. IKK-2 inhibition by SC-514 is selective, reversible, and competitive with ATP. SC-514 inhibits transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes in IL-1β-induced rheumatoid arthritis-derived synovial fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. When the mechanism of NF-κB activation was evaluated in the presence of this inhibitor, several interesting observations were found. First, SC-514 did not inhibit the phosphorylation and activation of the IKK complex. Second, there was a delay but not a complete blockade in IκBα phosphorylation and degradation; likewise there was a slightly slowed, decreased import of p65 into the nucleus and a faster export of p65 from the nucleus. Finally, both IκBα and p65 were comparable substrates for IKK-2, with similar Km and K cat values, and SC-514 inhibited the phosphorylation of either substrate similarly. Thus, the effect of SC-514 on cytokine gene expression may be a combination of inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation/degradation, affecting NF-κB nuclear import/export as well as the phosphorylation and transactivation of p65.

In addition, NF-κB is required for the activation of several genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation (4Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immun. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). Thus, modulation of NF-κB activity represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and asthma, both of which result from dysregulated immune processes. The central dogma of NF-κB activation suggests that NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm in resting cells by the inhibitory IκB proteins (5Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G.

In response to a variety of agonists, IκB is rapidly phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, thus releasing NF-κB for translocation into the nucleus to initiate gene transcription (1Karin M.

A number of recent studies, however, suggest that IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB may not be the sole regulatory events in the transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes (12Ghosh S.

However, careful enzymatic analyses comparing these enzymes and their specificities against individual serine sites have not been conducted thus far. Although the sites of phosphorylation appear unique for each kinase implying unique functions, the physiologic role for each of these phosphorylation events requires further study. IκB kinase (IKK) is the convergence point in most signaling pathways activated by many stimuli leading to the inducible phosphorylation and degradation of IκB. IKK is a multisubunit complex that contains two catalytic subunits, IKK-1 and IKK-2, and the regulatory subunit IKKγ (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

Gene knock out studies have clearly demonstrated that IKK-2 and IKKγ subunits of the IKK complex are required for NF-κB activation by all known pro-inflammatory stimuli including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNFα, and IL-1β (34Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 35Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deernick T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Thus a selective inhibitor of IKK-2 would not only be of great interest as a potential anti-inflammatory agent but also as a valuable tool to understand the mechanisms regulating NF-κB activation by these inflammatory agonists. Here we describe a selective IKK-2 inhibitor, SC-514, and we use this inhibitor to study NF-κB activation in rheumatoid arthritis-derived synovial fibroblasts (RASF cells) that have been stimulated with IL-1β. We show that the inhibitor is selective for IKK-2 over 30 other kinases and that it binds specifically at the ATP-binding site of IKK-2. In addition, SC-514 inhibits NF-κB-driven gene expression in a dose-dependent fashion, as measured by a NF-κB-linked reporter gene or endogenous NF-κB-regulated genes. SC-514 is also efficacious in vivo in the rat LPS-induced TNFα model of acute inflammation. Finally, when the mechanism of NF-κB activation was dissected in the presence of this inhibitor, several interesting observations were noted. As expected, the IKK complex is activated normally in the presence of the IKK-2 inhibitor, and the activation of other MAP kinases pathways is likewise unaffected by SC-514. However, the deactivation of IKK-2, presumably via autophosphorylation of the C-terminal serines, may be delayed by SC-514. IKK-2 inhibition by SC-514 demonstrates a slowed, decreased level of IκBα phosphorylation/degradation and diminished p65 translocation into the nucleus in these cells at maximal kinase inhibition. Interestingly, p65 export out of the nucleus is hastened in the presence of SC-514. The phosphorylation of p65 by rhIKK-2 occurs on serine 536 in the transactivation domain with similar catalytic efficiency as that for the IκBs, and SC-514 inhibits both IκB and p65 phosphorylation with comparable IC50 values. Thus, our studies with the selective IKK-2 inhibitor, SC-514, are consistent with the hypothesis that NF-κB activation in IL-1β-stimulated RASF cells is regulated by IKK-2 with novel mechanisms involving nuclear import/export and/or p65 transactivation in addition to the degradation of IκBs.

Cell Culture—Adherent RASF cells were isolated via enzymatic digestions from primary synovial tissue isolated after knee synovectomy and were cultured in DMEM High glucose, containing 15% defined bovine serum (Hyclone) and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. For cytokine and PGE2 release, NF-κB-linked reporter activity, and toxicity determination, 1.5 × 104 cells/well were plated in a 96-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. The growth media were replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1% serum, and the cells were pre-treated with increasing doses of SC-514 in 0.2% Me2SO or 0.2% Me2SO media for 1 h prior to an overnight stimulation with 1 ng/ml IL-1β. Cytokines and PGE2 secreted into the culture media were measured by ELISA. Cytotoxicity was assessed using an MTT assay. For RNA isolation, Western analysis, and in vitro kinase assays, cells were grown to confluence in 162-cm2 flasks. The growth medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 1% serum prior to stimulation. Nuclear NF-κB Translocation Assay—RASF cells in 96-well plates were pre-treated with SC-514 in 0.2% Me2SO or 0.2% Me2SO for 1 h prior to stimulation with 1 ng/ml IL-1β for various times. After stimulation, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 5% BSA followed by 5% goat serum for 30 min each. Cells were stained by incubating with an NF-κB-specific primary antibody at 1:100 for 1 h, washed in 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate at 1:100 and Hoechst stain at 1:2000 for 1 h. Cell images were acquired, analyzed, and quantified for NF-κB translocation using ArrayScan™ HSC software package. RNA Expression Analysis—Confluent RASF cells were pre-treated with SC-514 (1–100 μm) or 0.2% Me2SO vehicle and stimulated with IL-1β for 4 h. Total RNA was isolated from RASF cells using an RNeasy™ Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, which included a DNase step. Purified RNA was quantified using a Beckman DU640B spectrophotometer. 200 ng of total RNA was used to determine expression levels of human IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 by Taqman™ analysis using a 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression levels were normalized to the amount of cyclophilin mRNA. Primer/probe sets specific for human IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2 were designed using Primer Express™ Software (Applied Biosystems) based on published sequences. AdNF-κB-SEAP Construct and SEAP Assay—A secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene containing an upstream response element with three tandem NF-κB consensus binding sites was subcloned into an adenovirus transfer vector, AdBM5. The resulting plasmid was used to co-transform 293 cells with adenovirus DNA to generate recombinant adenovirus particles containing the SEAP reporter construct. Purified virus was produced from three rounds of plaque purification followed by CsCl2 gradient purification. The AdNF-κB-SEAP virus stock was used to transduce adherent RASF cells at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and 24 h prior to stimulation with IL-1β. Production of SEAP was measured in the media after 20 h of IL-1β stimulation. Preparation of Cell Extracts for Western and EMSA Analysis—Confluent RASF cells were pre-treated for 1 h with vehicle or inhibitor (Z-LLLH, 25 μm; EI-278, 10 μm, and SC-514, 1–100 μm) and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1β. Whole-cell lysates were prepared for Western analysis at the indicated times by washing once in cold phosphate buffer and incubating the cells on ice for 30 min in whole-cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were prepared for IKK-2, IκBα, and p65 Westerns after 5 min of stimulation unless a time course was performed. Lysates were prepared after a 15-min stimulation for the analysis of p38, HSP-27, c-Jun, and ERK. Lysates for Western analysis of COX isoforms were made after 20 h of stimulation. Nuclear lysates for p65 Western analysis and EMSA were prepared using a protocol modified from the method described by Schreiber et al. (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acid Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were allowed to swell on ice in a low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) for 15 min, after which Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.5%. The cell suspension was pipetted several times to disrupt the cells, and intact nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. Nuclei were washed once in low salt buffer and resuspended in high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice. Whole-cell and nuclear lysates were cleared of precipitate by centrifugation at 13,000 × g. Western Analysis—2× Laemmli sample buffer was added to cell lysates and boiled for 2 min. Equal amounts of protein (10–30 μg of lysate or immunoprecipitated IKKs) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8% IKK-2, 10% p65, c-Jun, and COX isoforms, and 12% IκB, HSP-27, and p38). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked in 5% dry milk reconstituted in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 30 min at room temperature. Blots were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies (1:300, phospho-IKK1/2; 1:1000, IκBα, phospho-IκBα, IKK-2, p65, HSP-27, phospho-ERK, phospho-c-Jun, c-Jun, phospho-p38, COX-2; 1:5000, p38, ERK, phospho-HSP-27, COX-1) in 1% milk/TBST. The blots were washed 4 times in TBST, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:4000) for 1 h, and washed as above. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL plus) was used for detection. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and frozen at –80 °C until use. NF-κB probe was generated in a 10 μl reaction containing 20 ng of NF-κB double-stranded oligonucleotide, 2 μlof[γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 units/μl), and nuclease-free H2O for 10 min at 37 °C. Unincorporated [32P]ATP was removed with a G-50 spin column. For the binding assay, 5 μg of nuclear extract was pre-incubated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 30 min on ice. 1 μl of unlabeled NF-κB double-stranded oligonucleotide (cold competition) or 1 μl (0.2 μg) of anti-p50 or anti-p65 antibodies (supershift) were added to the pre-incubations. Then 1 μl (50,000 CPM) of 32P-oligonucleotide was added, and the incubation proceeded for an additional 30 min. Samples were separated on a 4–20% gradient acrylamide gel in 1× TBE. The gel was dried, and NF-κB binding was visualized by autoradiography. Kinase Assay—IKK complexes were immunoprecipitated from IL-1β-treated RASF cell lysates (0.5–2 mg) using a NEMO antibody (3–10 μg) followed by the addition of protein A-agarose beads. Antibody complexes were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 1 ml of cold whole-cell lysis buffer followed by 2 washes in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 100–200 μg of immunoprecipitated IKK was analyzed for kinase activity in a reaction containing 10 μm biotinylated IκBα peptide as substrate and 1 μm [γ-33P]ATP (2500 Ci/mmol) as described previously (36Kishore N.

After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, 25 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and added to a SAM™ 96 biotin capture plate. After successive wash steps the plate was allowed to air-dry, and 25 μl of scintillation fluid was added to each well. Incorporation of [γ-33P]ATP was measured using a Top-Count NXT (Packard Instrument Co.). Km determinations of rhIKK-2 have been described previously (36Kishore N. Huynh K.Q. Mathialagan S. Hall T.

Briefly, various concentrations of [γ-33P]ATP or peptide substrates were used in the assay at a fixed (3× Km) concentration of the second substrate and 100 ng of rhIKK-2 in a final volume of 50 μl. Following incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of AG1XB resin in 900 mm sodium formate buffer, pH 3 (the resin is in slurry of 1 volume resin to 2 volume of sodium formate buffer). The resin was allowed to settle, and 50 μl of supernatant was transferred to a top count plate followed by the addition of 150 μl of Microscint 40, mixed well, and counted. For p65 FL-GST, 0.043–2.72 μm concentrations were used. Once Km graphs were fitted using Grafit™ program, K cat values were calculated from V max values and expressed as units/mol of enzyme/h. ATP Binding Assay—The binding of ATP and inhibitors to IKK-2 was analyzed using FLAG-tagged rhIKK-2 immobilized on anti-FLAG M2-agarose. 30 μg of rhIKK-2 was incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (16 μl of anti-FLAG agarose/μg of rhIKK-2) in 3–5 ml of ELISA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immobilized IKK-2 was pelleted, washed once in ELISA buffer and once in kinase buffer, and resuspended in kinase buffer at a concentration of 12.5 μg/ml. Binding assays were performed in 96-well Millipore MultiScreen plates. The binding reaction consisted of 250 ng of rhIKK-2 and varying concentrations of γ-35S-ATP or inhibitors in 50 μl total volume of kinase buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 1000× unlabeled γ-35S-ATP. The binding reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C and then washed under vacuum with 200 μl of cold PBS. The filter plates were air-dried, and 30 μl of scintillation fluid was added to each well. The amount of bound γ-35S-ATP was determined using a Top-Count NXT (Packard Instrument Co.). Phosphatase Treatment of IKK-2—rhIKK-2 and native IKK kinase complexes were subjected to phosphatase treatment as described previously (36Kishore N. Huynh K.Q. Mathialagan S. Hall T. Rouw S. Creely D. Lange G. Caroll J. Reitz B. Donnelly A. Boddupalli H. Combs R.G. Kretzmer K. Tripp C.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, 4–8 μg of rhIKK-2 or 0.5 mg of native IKK complex were immunoprecipitated as described above, washed, and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm MnCl2. The kinase was then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase or λ phosphatase (80 units of CIAP or 1000 units of λ phosphatase per 0.5 mg of native kinase, 500 units of λ phosphatase per μg of rhIKK-2). Phosphatase was removed from the immobilized kinase by washing three times and resuspending in kinase buffer, and the immunoprecipitated IKK was subjected to kinase or binding assays as described above.

https://openalex.org/W2037797901,"A nucleotide-dependent conformational change regulates actin filament dynamics. Yet, the structural basis of this mechanism remains controversial. The x-ray crystal structure of tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide-actin with bound AMPPNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, was determined to 1.85-Å resolution. A comparison of this structure to that of tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide-actin with bound ADP, determined previously under similar conditions, reveals how the release of the nucleotide γ-phosphate sets in motion a sequence of events leading to a conformational change in subdomain 2. The side chain of Ser-14 in the catalytic site rotates upon Pi release, triggering the rearrangement of the loop containing the methylated His-73, referred to as the sensor loop. This in turn causes a transition in the DNase I-binding loop in subdomain 2 from a disordered loop in ATP-actin to an ordered α-helix in ADP-actin. Despite this conformational change, the nucleotide cleft remains closed in ADP-actin, similar to ATP-actin. An analysis of the existing structures of members of the actin superfamily suggests that the cleft is open in the nucleotide-free state.

An analysis of the existing structures of members of the actin superfamily suggests that the cleft is open in the nucleotide-free state. The actin filament (F-actin) is asymmetric, undergoing net incorporation of ATP-actin monomers to the barbed end and dissociation of ADP-actin monomers from the pointed end (1Sheterline P. Clayton J. Sparrow J. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1-103PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). This dynamic process, known as actin filament treadmilling, is an essential part of many forms of cell motility. A driving force behind actin treadmilling is the hydrolysis of ATP by actin. However, in vivo treadmilling is further regulated by a number of factors including a battery of actin-binding proteins. Actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin, for instance, binds preferentially to the ADP-actin monomers that accumulate toward the pointed end of the filament, accelerating their dissociation. Other proteins such as profilin and thymosin-β4 bind ATP-actin with higher affinity than ADP-actin, maintaining a pool of ATP-actin monomers ready for incorporation into the barbed end of the filament. The fact that these proteins can “distinguish” between ATP- and ADP-actin suggests that these two states are structurally different. Consistent with this view, biochemical (3Strzelecka-Golaszewska H.

Visualization of the structural details of such a conformational change has come from a comparison of crystal structures of the actin monomer (G-actin) in the ATP and ADP states.

A comparison of the structures in the two states reveals how the release of the nucleotide γ-phosphate triggers a sequence of events that propagate into a loop to helix transition in the DNase I-binding loop in subdomain 2. However, a proper comparison of the ATP- and ADP-bound states of actin would require for the two structures to be determined under similar conditions. Meanwhile, an analysis of the existing structural data has led to conflicting interpretations. Recent reports have questioned the validity of the structure of TMR-modified actin with bound ADP as truly representative of the ADP state (17Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct.

It has also been suggested that the TMR probe bound to Cys-374 prevents the two domains of actin from opening apart so that actin can assume its “true” ADP conformation (18Sablin E.P. Dawson J.F. VanLoock M.S. Spudich J.A. Egelman E.H. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10945-10947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The TMR probe, rather than the change in the nucleotide, has also been held responsible for the conformational change observed in actin subdomain 2 (17Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 735-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19Nyman T. Schuler H. Korenbaum E. Schutt C.E. Karlsson R. Lindberg U. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, long range allosteric effects due to the binding of the TMR probe to the C terminus of actin could have induced the conformational change observed at the opposite end of the molecule in subdomain 2. Another explanation for the loop to helix transition in the DNase I-binding loop, which disregards any role of the nucleotide state, is that it is triggered by crystal packing contacts (18Sablin E.P. Dawson J.F. VanLoock M.S. Spudich J.A. Egelman E.H. Fletterick R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10945-10947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A structure of monomeric TMR-actin in the ATP state would provide an excellent way to resolve this controversy (23Winder S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Dos Remedios C.G. Chhabra D. Kekic M. Dedova I.V. Tsubakihara M. Berry D.A. Nosworthy N.J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 433-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the structure of TMR-modified actin with bound AMPPNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (25Yount R.G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar), at 1.85-Å resolution. The symmetry and unit cell parameters of the crystals of monomeric AMPPNP-actin are identical to those of the ADP-actin structure reported previously (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). As compared with the ADP-actin structure, the presence of the nucleotide γ-phosphate in the new structure forces the rotation of the side chain of Ser-14, in line with all of the existing structures of ATP-actin (10Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar, 11Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U.

The rotation of Ser-14 brings about a change in the conformation of a neighboring loop, which contains the methylated His-73. Because of the central role that this loop plays in transmitting nucleotide-dependent conformational changes from the catalytic site to subdomain 2, we refer to it as the “sensor loop.” In the current ATP-actin structure, the movement of the sensor loop is propagated into subdomain 2, resulting in a small rotation and increased thermal disorder of this subdomain and the melting of the α-helix in the DNase I-binding loop, this helix being a characteristic feature of the structure of ADP-actin (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). These structural features are common to all of the existing ATP-actin structures (10Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar, 11Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U.

Therefore, it now can be asserted that the differences observed between the structures of monomeric actin in the ATP and ADP states (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) are due to the release of the nucleotide γ-phosphate and not because of crystal packing contacts or the binding of the TMR probe. Protein Preparation—Actin modified with TMR (Molecular Probes) was prepared with minor modification of the protocol described previously (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). All of the steps were carried out at 4 °C. Actin was prepared as described previously (26Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A F-actin pellet was homogenized in G-buffer (2 mm MOPS, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.5) with the addition of 10 mm dithiothreitol to reduce actin fully. After 1 h, actin was dialyzed exhaustively against G-buffer to remove the dithiothreitol and then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to pellet any F-actin that did not depolymerize and any denatured actin. The resulting G-actin at 5–8 mg/ml was reacted with a 2.2-molar excess of TMR (dissolved as a 30 mm solution in dimethylformamide) and stirred overnight, followed by the addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol to react with any excess TMR. The solution was then brought into F-buffer conditions (40 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MOPS, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.5). After 1 h, the solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to pellet any unreacted F-actin and insoluble TMR. The supernatant was exhaustively dialyzed against G-buffer and then against G-buffer in which ATP was replaced with AMPPNP (Sigma). Note that, for two main reasons, in this procedure special effort was made to minimize the time that TMR-actin spent in F-actin buffer. First, nucleotide hydrolysis in F-buffer is significant but practically zero in G-buffer (27Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Gershman L.C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Second, unpublished evidence from analytical ultra-centrifugation 2W. F. Stafford, unpublished data. and electron microscopy 3K. Mabuchi, unpublished data. indicates that TMR-actin kept in F-buffer aggregates slowly into a non-filamentous form that can no longer be crystallized. Crystallization—Crystals of TMR-modified AMPPNP-actin were obtained at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method under conditions somewhat different from those used for ADP-actin (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment, 2 μl of AMPPNP-actin at 9–12 mg/ml (concentrated using a Centricon device) were mixed with an equal volume of a reservoir solution containing 18% polyethylene glycol 3350, 9 mm ACES, pH 7.0, 365 mm CaCl2, and 9% dimethyl sulfoxide. The crystals, which typically formed within 2–3 days, were harvested immediately to minimize the possibility for nucleotide hydrolysis to take place. The crystals were flash-cooled in propane directly from their crystallization buffer. Data Collection and Structure Determination—An x-ray diffraction dataset was collected from a crystal of AMPPNP-actin at the BioCARS beamline 14-ID-B (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL) (Table I). The data was indexed and scaled with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Because the symmetry and unit cell parameters of the crystal of AMPPNP-actin were identical to those of ADP-actin (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), refinement was started from this structure with program CNS (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and using all of the data between 24.0- and 1.85-Å resolution (no σ-cutoff was applied). Graphic inspection of the electron density maps (2Fo – Fc) did not reveal any density for the region encompassing amino acids His-40 to Asp-51, which had been included during the first round of refinement. These amino acids were removed from the model, and some minor changes were made to the structure. During the final stages of the refinement, alternative conformations were assigned to 12 amino acids for which the electron density map revealed more than one rotamer orientation. The important residue, Ser-14, located in the catalytic site, and its neighbor, Ser-33, which marks the beginning of subdomain 2, are among these 12 amino acids. In the case of Ser-14, the second rotamer corresponds to that in the ADP-actin structure. However, Ser-14 spends only 10–15% of the time in that position, whereas the remaining 85–90% of the time, it is oriented as in the other ATP-actin structures (10Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar, 11Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U.

The relative distribution of the two orientations of Ser-14 was determined independently from refinement of the occupancies of the two side chain rotamers and from inspection of difference Fourier electron density maps. A positive peak in the difference Fourier map, corresponding to the second rotamer of Ser-14, appears when its occupancy is estimated to be lower than 0.1 but is substituted by a negative peak for occupancies higher than 0.15. The final model resulted in R-factor and R-free values of 18.7 and 22.6%, respectively. Although the overall quality of the electron density was very good, subdomain 2 was less well ordered and the DNase I-binding loop, in particular, was fully disordered and could not be traced. The final structure (PDB entry 1NWK) includes amino acids Thr-6 to Arg-39, Ser-52 to His-371, the TMR probe, a molecule of AMPPNP, four Ca2+ ions, and 256 water molecules.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionSpace groupC2Unit cell parametersa, b, c (Å)112.22, 37.37, 85.03α, β, γ (∘)90.0, 108.13, 90.0Resolution range (Å)24.4-1.85 (1.97-1.85)aValues in parentheses correspond to last resolution shell.Average I/σ12.13 (7.2)Crystal mosaicity (∘)0.7R-merge (%)bR-merge = Σ |I — 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the intensity of an individual reflection and 〈I〉 its mean value.9.1 (29.0)Completeness (%)98.2 (90.2)Redundancy7.5 (4.3)RefinementR-factor (%)cR-factor = Σ|Fo— Fc |/Σ|Fc |, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors.18.7Free R-factor (%)dFree R-factor, R-factor calculated for a subset of the reflections (5%), which were omitted during the refinement and used to monitor its convergence.22.6Number of amino acids354Number of water molecules256Average B factors (Å2)Protein atoms33.2Solvent atoms44.2Ramachandran plotMost favored region94.1Additionally allowed region5.9R.m.s.d. from ideal geometryBond lengths (Å)0.006Bond angles (∘)1.2PDB accession code1NWKa Values in parentheses correspond to last resolution shell.b R-merge = Σ |I — 〈I〉|/ΣI, where I is the intensity of an individual reflection and 〈I〉 its mean value.c R-factor = Σ|Fo— Fc |/Σ|Fc |, where Fo and Fc are observed and calculated structure factors.d Free R-factor, R-factor calculated for a subset of the reflections (5%), which were omitted during the refinement and used to monitor its convergence. Open table in a new tab General Description of the Structure of TMR-Actin in the ATP State—Crystals of TMR-actin with bound ATP can be obtained under conditions similar to those for ADP-actin (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). However, nucleotide hydrolysis takes place during the time needed to grow these crystals, which is probably the result of the high salt concentration in the crystallization buffer. A way to circumvent this problem was to crystallize TMR-actin with AMP-PNP, a commonly used non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (25Yount R.G. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar). The crystallization conditions for AMPPNP-actin, although similar to those for ADP-actin (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), had to be modified slightly (see “Experimental Procedures”). An analysis of the diffraction pattern from these crystals revealed unit cell parameters and symmetry identical with those of ADP-actin. However, a characteristic feature of the crystals of AMPPNP-actin is that they do not diffract the x-rays as strongly as those of ADP-actin. This is probably due to increased disorder in actin subdomain 2 (see below). After screening a large number of crystals at the BioCARS beamline 14-ID-B, a complete x-ray diffraction dataset was collected from one of the crystals that diffracted to the resolution of 1.85 Å (Table I). Refinement of the structure converged to a R-factor value of 18.7% and a R-free value of 22.6%. The position and geometry of AMPPNP (Fig. 1) is almost indistinguishable from that of ATP in the ATP-bound actin structures (10Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar, 11Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U.

Indeed, a superimposition of AMPPNP-actin (henceforth referred to as ATP-actin) with all of the existing actin structures places the nucleotide and associated divalent cation in nearly identical positions (Fig. 2) with the exception of one of the structures, that of the open state of the actin-profilin complex that contains ATP bound in an unusual manner (22Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (discussed below). Moreover, a comparison of the ATP and ADP bound structures of monomeric TMR-actin reveals how the ADP moiety of the nucleotide and associated Ca2+ ion remain bound after hydrolysis in precisely the same position, linked by a network of conserved interactions that are often mediated by water molecules (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Position and conformation of the nucleotide in all of the actin structures. Included in this figure (green) are the two structures of TMR-actin with bound ADP and AMPPNP, as well as those of actin complexes with DNase I (10Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar), gelsolin (12McLaughlin P.J. Gooch J.T. Mannherz H.G. Weeds A.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), vitamin D-binding protein (14Otterbein L.R. Cosio C. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8003-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the original actin-profilin complex (11Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In actin, as in most phosphoryltransferases, the ADP moiety of the nucleotide and divalent cation remain bound after hydrolysis in a position that is nearly identical to that occupied by the ATP parent molecule. Shown in red is the so-called open-state structure of the actin-profilin complex (22Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) for which the location and conformation of the nucleotide differ from all of the other structures. Observe, in particular, how the divalent cation in this structure occupies the position of the β-phosphate in all of the other structures, breaking the entire network of interactions that characterizes the coordination of the nucleotide and divalent cation in the other actin structures (see also Fig. 3). As described in the “Results and Discussion” section, such a shift of the nucleotide has the effect of weakening the connection between the two major actin domains, allowing them to open apart (see also Fig. 6). The opening of the domains is reflected by a separation of the two homologous β-hairpin motifs on each side of the nucleotide to a distance of ∼8 Å as compared with ∼5 Å in all of the other structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Stereodiagram of the interactions of the nucleotide and divalent cation in the ATP (A) and ADP (B) structures. Many of these contacts are mediated by water molecules, which are held in place through interactions with amino acids from the two homologous β-hairpin loops from subdomains 1 and 3 (see also Fig. 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structures of TMR-actin in the ADP (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and ATP states are similar overall (Fig. 4A). However, important differences occur around the nucleotide γ-phosphate site, Ser-14, the loop containing the methylated His-73, and subdomain 2 (Figs. 1, 3, and 4). Most remarkably, the DNase I-binding loop, which formed a well ordered α-helix in the ADP-actin structure (16Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), is now fully disordered in the ATP structure (Fig. 5). Although the crystals corresponding to the two nucleotide states are identical, the ATP-actin structure is more flexible overall but significantly more so in subdomain 2. The higher thermal mobility of the ATP structure is reflected by higher temperature factor values, which in this case can be compared directly because of the identity of the crystals (30Drenth J. Principles of Protein X-ray Crystallography. 2nd ed. Springer-Verlag, New York Inc., New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). The conformational change upon Pi release can be described as a sequence of events that originate at the nucleotide-binding site and the Ser-14 β-hairpin loop, propagating through the His-73 loop into subdomain 2.Fig. 5Subdomain 2 and the DNase I-binding loop. A, a superimposition of subdomain 2 in the structures of TMR-modified ADP-actin (red, only the main chain backbone atoms are show) and ATP-actin (cyan, all of the atoms are shown). The electron density map corresponding to the ATP state structure is also shown contoured at 1.0 σ. Note that in the ATP state structure there is no electron density visible for the region comprising the DNase I-binding loop (on top of the figure), reflecting disorder. As a result, 12 amino acids (His-40 to Asp-51) are missing in the structure. B, in ADP-actin structure, in contrast, subdomain 2 is very well ordered and clearly defined in the electron density map with the DNase I-binding loop forming a α-helix.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Ser-14 β-Hairpin Loop—In the stru"

The heteromeric Smad complex activates transcription through its ability to functionally cooperate with several promoter-specific transcription factors and/or to bind specific DNA sequences (7Derynck R.

Recent studies have shown R-Smads are regulated by the proteasome-mediated degradation system (9Lin X. Liang M. Feng X.-H. J. Biol.

Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins, predominantly serves to target proteins for their degradation by proteasomes (14Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a number of ubiquitin-related proteins are also present in eukaryotic cells (15Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). These proteins, including the small ubiquitin-like modifier-1 (SUMO-1), utilize a conjugation system that is similar to ubiquitination (16Hay R.T. Trends Biochem.

Smad4 is the central mediator for signaling of TGF-β superfamily, and thus it is important to study the regulation of Smad4. Recently, we and another group identified Smad4 as a substrate of SUMOylation pathway (1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchiors F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 33Lee P.S. Chang C. Liu D. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27853-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here we further elucidate the mechanism of how the SUMOylation regulates Smad4 activity under physiological conditions. We have found that RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of the human Ubc9 gene disrupts Smad4 SUMOylation, decreases Smad4 stability, reduces Smad4 accumulation in the nucleus, and consequently blocks TGF-β signaling. Thus, SUMOylation of tumor suppressor Smad4 provides a novel mechanism to control TGF-β antiproliferative signaling. Plasmids, Cell Lines, and Transfections—Mammalian expression plasmids for epitope (HA, FLAG, and His)-tagged Smad4, Ubc9, and SUMO were described previously (1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y.

Human HeLa cells and mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu (RI-14 line) cells were grown and transfected as described previously (26Feng X.-H. Liang Y.-Y. Liang M. Zhai W. Lin X. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 133-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA Precipitation and Western Blot—Ni-NTA precipitation and Western blot analysis were essentially as described previously (1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchiors F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids for His-tagged Smad4 and FLAG-tagged SUMO1 and harvested in guanidinium lysis buffer (6 m guanidinium HCl, 0.1 m NaPO4, 0.01 m Tris·Cl, pH 8). His-tagged Smad4 was retrieved from the lysates by using Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen), followed by standard gel electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis using anti-Smad4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibody. Transcription Reporter Assays—Transfections, TGF-β treatment, and reporter assays were carried out as described previously (27Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Generally, HeLa cells at 25–30% confluence were transfected with expression plasmids for Smads and/or reporter plasmids. Reporter plasmid SBE-Luc contains the luciferase gene under control of the Smad-binding elements (SBE) (28Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The amount of transfected DNA was always the same by adding vector DNA, whenever needed. 40–45 h after transfection, cells were treated with 200 pm TGF-β for 12 h. Cells were then harvested for measurement of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. All assays were done in triplicate and all values were normalized for transfection efficiency against β-galactosidase activity. Immunofluorescence—HeLa and RI-14 cells, untransfected or transfected as specified in the text and figure legends (Figs. 1, C and E, and 3C), were grown on cover slips, fixed with cold methanol, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7. Cells were then stained with anti-Smad4 or anti-His monoclonal antibodies, followed with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Sigma), and visualized under a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope.Fig. 3Gene silencing of Ubc9 reduces Smad4 SUMOylation and decreases Smad4 stability. A, Ubc9 siRNA down-regulated Ubc9 expression and Smad4 SUMOylation. HeLa cells were tranfected with Ubc9 siRNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Smad4-SUMO conjugates were similarly analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1B. Endogenous Ubc9 and β-actin were detected using anti-Ubc9 and anti-actin antibody, respectively. WCL, whole cell lysates. B, Ubc9 siRNA reduced the steady state level of endogenous Smad4. Endogenous Ubc9, Smad4, Smad2/3, and β-actin were detected using appropriate antibodies in Western blots. C, Ubc9 siRNA inhibited TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of endogenous Smad4. Smad4 was visualized using FITC-conjugated anti-Smad4 antibody. DAPI indicates the nuclear staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pulse-Chase and Ubiquitination Assay—HeLa cells were transfected with His-tagged wild type, K113R/K159R or R100T mutant. 48 h later, cells were pulsed for 30 min with 400 μCi ml–1 [35S]methionine/cysteine, and then chased in regular medium supplemented with non-radioactive methionine/cysteine for varying time periods, as indicated in Fig. 2A. Cell lysates were harvested and subjected to Ni-NTA precipitation. The precipitated Smad4 proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. For ubiquitination assay, we also performed precipitation of Smad4 from lysates of the HeLa cells, which was co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin. Precipitated Smad4 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and its ubiquitination was recognized by immunoblotting with anti-HA (ubiquitin) antibody. RNA Interference—The target sequence of the Ubc9 siRNA was CAAAAAATCCCGATGGCAC (Dharmacon Research), which corresponds with nucleotides 86–104 downstream from initiation codon of the human Ubc9 coding region. siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), as described previously (29Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence, 48 h upon siRNA transfection, cells were treated with TGF-β for 1 h, fixed with ice-cold methanol, and immunostained with FITC-conjugated anti-Smad4 antibody (B8, Santa Cruz) to visualize the endogenous Smad4. For reporter assays, SBE-luc reporter plasmid was cotransfected with siRNA. 24 h later, cells were treated with TGF-β for 12 h and harvested for luciferase analysis. For precipitation-Western analysis, HeLa cells were first transfected with plasmid DNA, as specified in the text. Twenty-four hours upon DNA transfection, the same cells were transfected with Ubc9 siRNA. Forty-eight h later, cells were harvested, and cell lysates were used to detect Ubc9 protein in anti-Ubc9 Western blot or further processed to analyze Smad4 SUMOylation. Cell Proliferation—HeLa cells were first transfected with siRNA as described above. After 24 h, 1 × 103 cells were then replated into each well of a 96-well flat-bottom plate. Upon attachment to the well (3 h), cells were treated with or without TGF-β for 2 or 3 days. Measurement of cell proliferation was then carried out using MTS (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)-based CellTiter96® Aqueous assay (Promega). Tetrazolium compound MTS was added to the cells, which were then returned to the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5%CO2) for 1.5 h. The absorbance of cells was read at 590 nm in a microplate reader. The TGF-β-induced inhibition of cell proliferation was calculated by the following formula: % inhibition = [(OD–TGFβ) – (OD+TGFβ)]/(OD–TGFβ) × 100. SUMOylation of Smad4 Occurs in the Nucleus and Is Regulated by TGF-β—Our recent investigation of Smad4 signaling revealed that Smad4 is SUMOylated in cells (1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchiors F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The modification sites occur on two lysine residues in the MH1 domain of Smad4, i.e. Lys113 and Lys159 (Fig. 1A; Ref. 1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchiors F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To investigate the subcellular location of Smad4 SUMOylation, we examined the in vivo SUMOylation of two Smad4 mutants carrying mutation in the nuclear export sequence (NES) or the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (Fig. 1A; Ref. 30Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). SUMOylation and subcellular localization of Smad4 mutants are shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. Smad4 NES mutant was exclusively localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1C), and its SUMOylation was enhanced (Fig. 1B, lane 6). In sharp contrast, conjugation of SUMO1 to the NLS mutant, which was primarily localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C), could not be detected (Fig. 1B, lane 7). In addition, we compared the SUMOylation of wild type Smad4 in the presence or absence of nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B. Leptomycin B treatment increased the level of SUMOylation of Smad4 (Fig. 1B, lane 4). Thus, our results suggest that Smad4 SUMOylation occurs in the nucleus. Previous studies also point to the nucleus as SUMOylation site (31Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), although SUMOylation may take place in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, SUMOylated Smad4 is more stable in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. We noticed that TGF-β had stimulatory effects on SUMOylation of Smad4 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). We then determined how TGF-β treatment regulated SUMOylation of Smad4. Addition of 200 pm TGF-β to the culture medium increased the level of SUMO1 modification of Smad4 (Fig. 1D). After 4–8-h treatment, the Smad4-SUMO conjugate reached the maximum level; at 12 h, the level dropped to basal or below basal level (Fig. 1D). Thus, the results support the notion that the increase in Smad4 SUMOylation could be attributed to the TGF-β-induced translocation of Smad4 into the nucleus, where SUMOylation occurs. SUMOylation Enhances TGF-β-induced Nuclear Accumulation of Smad4 —One key regulation of Smad4 activity is its nuclear translocation in response to TGF-β. However, Smad4 also has NES (see Fig. 1A), and thus, is frequently shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm (30Pierreux C.E. Nicolas F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In our work, we examined whether SUMOylation influenced Smad4 subcellular accumulation in RI-14 cells. Results from immunofluorescence microscopy are shown in Fig. 1E. Since Smad4 is a shuttling protein, we divided the subcellular localization of Smad4 into two categories: exclusive nuclear (N) or non-exclusive nuclear staining (N/C + C); the latter included cytoplasmic staining (C) or a mixed distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm (N/C). In the absence of TGF-β stimulation, there were about 30% (63/213) of cells that expressed wild type Smad4 exclusively in the nucleus and 70% of cells in the cytoplasm or in both compartments. With TGF-β stimulation, 60% (106/177) of cells expressed Smad4 exclusively in the nucleus, while 40% were in the cytoplasm or both, supporting the notion that TGF-β causes a nuclear shift of Smad4 protein. We also examined the effect of SUMO1 expression on subcellular distribution of Smad4. In the absence of TGF-β stimulation, SUMO1 exerted a moderately stimulatory effects on Smad4 nuclear localization. In comparison with cells without exogenous SUMO1, 42% (45/107) of SUMO1-transfected cells contained Smad4 in the nucleus. More significantly, SUMO1 caused an increase of TGF-β-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad4, with 80% (90/113) of cells exhibiting exclusively nuclear localization of Smad4. Analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of Smad4 also gave similar results (data not shown). Since SUMO expression had no effect on Smad4 nuclear staining in the absence of TGF-β, our results suggest that SUMO1 appear to increase Smad4 retention and/or stability in the nucleus. Correlation between Loss of SUMOylation and Rapid Degradation of Cancer-derived Smad4 Mutant—Unlike ubiquitin, which promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of substrates, SUMO1 has not been linked to protein degradation. It has been suggested that SUMOylation may stabilize conjugated proteins by competing for the same lysine residues for ubiquitination (19Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). During the course of our SUMOylation experiments, we observed that the steady state level of Smad4 is low in the absence of SUMO1, but overexpression of SUMO1 can increase the steady state level of Smad4 (1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchiors F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To examine the metabolic stability of Smad4, we performed pulse-chase experiment. We compared the stability of wild type, K113R/K159R mutant, and a cancer-derived Smad4 mutant with Arg → Thr mutation (R100T) that has previously been shown to undergo faster degradation (11Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The half-life of wild type Smad4 was found to be around 9 h, whereas the level of the K113/159R mutant remained 50% upon 24 h of chase (Fig. 2A). The R100T mutant had only a half-life of 3 h. Similar results were obtained in cycloheximide chase experiments (data not shown). These results suggest that Lys113, Lys159, or both, could also serve as a negative element for regulating Smad4 degradation. Thus, the SUMOylation on Lys113/159 residues or mutation of the same sites simply prevent Smad4 from degradation. This conclusion is consistent with the reduced ubiquitination on the K113R/K159R mutant (Fig. 2B; Ref. 1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchiors F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and increased ubiquitination on the R100T mutant (Fig. 2B; Ref. 11Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This observation is reminiscent of IκB, of which SUMOylation antagonizes ubiquitination through the lysine residue Lys21 (19Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Jab1, a component of COP9 signalosome, was found to promote Smad4 degradation (32Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Jab1 still induced the degradation of K113R/K159R mutant (data not shown), suggesting that additional ubiquitin E3 ligases or factors (other than Jab1 pathway) are responsible for Smad4 degradation through the Lys113 and/or Lys159 residues. Since our data suggest a role of SUMOylation in Smad4 stability, we set out to determine whether the R100T mutant might have a loss or reduction in SUMOylation. As shown in Fig. 2C, the R100T mutant failed to be SUMOylated, while the wild type was efficiently SUMOylated in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the rapid proteolysis of this mutant could be responsible for its inability to be SUMOylated. In light of the observation that the R100T mutant has normal nuclear localization with Smad2 in response to TGF-β (11Xu J. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4820-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), its loss of SUMOylation may be attributed to a conformation change so that efficient SUMO modification cannot occur on the Lys113/159 residues. As SUMOylation competes or blocks ubiquitination on Smad4, the lack of SUMOylation thus contributes to the enhanced ubiquitination and faster degradation of the R100T mutant (Fig. 2, A and B). More importantly, mutations of ubiquitination sites at Lys113 and Lys159 greatly enhanced the metabolic stability of R100T; the cycloheximide experiment clearly showed that the triple mutant (R100T/K113R/K159R) had a much longer half-life than the unstable R100T mutant (Fig. 2D). A similar observation was reported recently (33Lee P.S. Chang C. Liu D. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27853-27863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, insufficient SUMOylation may serve as one mechanism for cells to escape TGF-β growth inhibitory control during cancer development. Reduction in Smad4 SUMOylation Decreases the Steady State Level of Endogenous Smad4 —Taken together, data described above would suggest that SUMO modification plays a positive role in regulating Smad4 activity. Indeed, reporter assays demonstrated that overexpression of SUMO1 and Ubc9 stimulated TGF-β-induced transcriptional responses (1Lin X. Liang M. Liang Y.-Y. Brunicardi F.C. Melchiors F. Feng X.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To test this more directly in a physiologically relevant context, we sought to assess the impacts of disrupting endogenous Ubc9 expression using RNAi. Since Ubc9 is the only E2 enzyme for modification by members of SUMO family, inhibition of its expression should disrupt SUMOylation of its substrates. We used a 21-nucleotide siRNA that specifically targets to the human Ubc9 coding region and examined its effectiveness in silencing Ubc9 expression in HeLa cells. 48 h after transfection with the siRNA, HeLa cells expressed a significantly low level of endogenous Ubc9 protein, in comparison with the mock-transfection control (Figs. 3, A and B, and 4B). In contrast, expression of β-actin remained unchanged (Figs. 3, A and B, and 4B). Treatment of HeLa cells with unrelated RNAi oligonucleotides did not reduce the level of Ubc9 protein (data not shown). We then determined whether diminished Ubc9 expression could affect the SUMOylation of Smad4 and reverse the effects of SUMOylation on Smad4 stability. Our results showed that increasing doses of Ubc9 siRNA caused gradual reduction in the steady state level of SUMO-conjugated Smad4 in transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Accordingly, the steady state level of endogenous Smad4 decreased upon siRNA transfection (Fig. 3, B and C). Smad4 was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and displayed a diffused and weak staining (Fig. 3C). TGF-β treatment induced a concentration of Smad4 in the nucleus, causing a brighter image under microscope. Inhibition of Ubc9 expression with siRNA reversed the effect of TGF-β on Smad4 accumulation. Levels of Smad2 and Smad3 (controls) were the same with or without the siRNA (Fig. 3B). Ubc9 Is Required for TGF-β-induced Growth Inhibition and Endogenous Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) Expression—TGF-β exerts its responses by regulating gene transcription involved in growth regulation and extracellular matrix remodeling. We then investigated the consequence of Ubc9 gene silencing on TGF-β induced gene responses and cell proliferation. We first utilized the synthetic SBE-luc reporter (28Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Treatment of 100 nm siRNA exhibited 70% reduction of TGF-β-induced SBE-luc reporter expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A) as well as HepG2 cells (data not shown). As controls, the sense oligonucleotide of Ubc9 or unrelated GFP siRNA had no effects on SBE-luc activity (Fig. 4A). Suppression of the Ubc9 expression also affected the induction of endogenous target gene products of TGF-β such as PAI-1. In HeLa cells, TGF-β induced the production of PAI-1 protein (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 4). Simultaneous treatment with 20 nm Ubc9 siRNA sufficed to abolish the PAI-1 induction (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 4 and 5). As control, the level of β-actin remained unchanged regardless of TGF-β and/or siRNA treatment. TGF-β also inhibits proliferation of epithelial cells. Growth of HeLa cells can be inhibited by TGF-β, achieving up to 30% growth inhibition (data not shown). Since HeLa cells can be readily transfected using siRNA, we assessed the growth inhibitory response in these cells in the presence or absence of Ubc9 siRNA. Addition of TGF-β (for 2 or 3 days) caused a 25% inhibition on the proliferation of HeLa cells treated with transfection reagent (Vehicle) (Fig. 4C). In sharp contrast, the growth inhibitory response of TGF-β was nearly abolished in Ubc9 siRNA-transfected cells, which exhibited only 4–6% growth inhibition by TGF-β. During the siUbc9 treatment period, HeLa cells displayed a normal proliferation status in comparison to non-siUbc9-treated cells in the absence of TGF-β stimulation (data not shown). Our results suggest that disruption of Ubc9 expression using RNAi can effectively disrupt cellular SUMOylation machinery and consequently inhibit the SUMO-mediated stimulatory effect on Smad4 activity in growth inhibition. Increased Smad4 Expression Restores TGF-β Signaling in Ubc9-depleted Cells—To investigate further the critical role of Ubc9 in Smad4 functions, we determined whether overexpression of Ubc9 could rescue TGF-β signaling in Ubc9-depleted cells. Since mouse and human Ubc9 share identical amino acid sequences, but the selected siUbc9 target nucleotide sequence differs in the human and mouse Ubc9 genes, we reasoned that mouse Ubc9 could substitute for human counterpart without being silenced by siUbc9. As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of the mouse Ubc9 gene could rescue the loss of TGF-β-induced SBE-luc reporter expression. Furthermore, if depletion of Ubc9 caused Smad4 instability and subsequent loss of TGF-β signaling, one might be able to rescue the loss of TGF-β response by overexpressing Smad4. To this end, we transfected HeLa cells with Smad4 or the Smad4(K113R/K159R) mutant. It is observed that expression of Smad4 or KR mutant can reverse the silencing effect of Ubc9 siRNA (Fig. 5B), strongly suggesting that the defective phenotype in TGF-β signaling caused by Ubc9 siRNA is not due to the indirect pleiotrophic effects of other SUMO targets. In summary, our current study elucidated the function of SUMOylation in TGF-β signaling. SUMOylation has positive effects on the growth inhibitory and transcriptional functions of Smad4, at least largely due to an increase in Smad4 stability. SUMOylation appears to compete with ubiquitination at Lys113 and Lys159. Reduced SUMOylation by knocking down Ubc9 expression causes instability of the endogenous Smad4 and abolishes the growth inhibitory and transcriptional functions of Smad4. In consistent with this is the biochemical property of a cancer-derived mutant R100T, which fails to be modified by SUMO and undergoes faster degradation. Therefore, this supports the notion that SUMOylation may be an important gatekeeper that prevents Smad4 from degradation in normal cells. SUMOylation of Smad4 occurs in the nucleus. The stimulatory effects of Smad4 SUMOylation on TGF-β signaling may also be connected to an inhibition of its nuclear export by SUMOylation. The SUMOylation on Lys113 and Lys159, which spans the NES (amino acids 143–148) of Smad4, may block the interaction of the NES with the export machinery. Fig. 5C illustrates our working model on the relationship of SUMOylation, stability, and nuclear retention of Smad4. Further delineation on the mechanism of Smad4 nuclear import and export will provide more insights into the functions of SUMOylation in Smad4-dependent signaling events.

Accumulating evidence indicates that activated alleles of Src may induce cell transformation through Ras-ERK-dependent and -independent pathways. Here we show that Rac1 activity is strongly elevated in Src-transformed cells and that this small G protein is a critical component of the pathway connecting oncogenic Src with cell transformation. We further show that Vav2 and the ubiquitously expressed Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 are phosphorylated in tyrosine residues in cells transfected with active and oncogenic Src. Moreover, phosphorylation of Tiam1 in cells treated with pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, was partially inhibited by the Src inhibitor SU6656. Using truncated mutants of Tiam1, we demonstrate that multiple sites can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src. Furthermore, Tiam1 cooperated with Src to induce activation of Rac1 in vivo and the formation of membrane ruffles. Similarly, activation of JNK and the c-jun promoter by Src were also potently increased by Tiam1. Together, these results suggest that Vav2 and Tiam1 may act as downstream effectors of Src, thereby regulating Rac1-dependent pathways that participate in Src-induced cell transformation.

The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src was initially identified as the protein product of the first discovered viral oncogene, v-src, which is responsible for the transforming ability of the Rous sarcoma virus (1Rous P.

Its normal cellular counterpart, the product of the proto-oncogene c-src (4Spector D.H. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanisms underlying the transforming potential of v-Src have been extensively explored. In particular, expression of oncogenic and activated forms of Src results in tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous intracellular substrates and the consequent activation of multiple signaling pathways that ultimately control cell proliferation. For example, active Src can potently stimulate the Ras-ERK 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding; PAK, p21-activated serine/threonine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase.1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; HEK, human embryonic kidney; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding; PAK, p21-activated serine/threonine kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase. pathway, primarily by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc by Src, followed by the recruitment to the membrane of the adapter protein Grb2 and the Ras-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, thereby promoting Ras activation (8Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, several studies have indicated that Src can also utilize biochemical routes distinct from the Ras-ERK pathway to promote its biological responses (9Turkson J. Bowman T. Adnane J. Zhang Y.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Of interest, the latter has been shown to be dependent on the activation of a GTP-binding protein of the Rho family, Rac1, but not on the Ras-ERK pathway (10Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, can control transcriptional events in the nucleus in addition to their effects on the organization of the cellular cytoskeleton (17Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar, 18Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). In particular, Rac1 has emerged as a key upstream activator of multiple signaling pathways regulating gene expression. For example, Rac1 regulates the transcriptional activity of c-Jun through the JNK pathway (19Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar, 20Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell.

Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). As for other small GTPases, the functional activity of Rac1 is tightly regulated in vivo. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate these GTPases by promoting the exchange of their inactive GDP-bound forms to their active GTP-bound species. Most known GEFs for these proteins share a highly related structural domain of about 250 amino acids, termed the Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is adjacent to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (reviewed in Ref. 21Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The biochemical connection between receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and the activation of Rac1 involves the activation of Rac GEFs and/or the inhibition of GTPase-activating proteins acting on Rac1. For example, we have shown that the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Rac1 exchange factor Vav1, which is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, leads to the activation of the GDP/GTP exchange activity of Rac1 (22Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 23Teramoto H. Salem P. Robbins K.C. Bustelo X.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10751-10755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the exchange activity of Vav2, a more widely expressed member of the Vav family, is also increased upon tyrosine phosphorylation (24Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), suggesting that this GEF may be involved in Rac1 activation by Src kinases in nonhematopoietic cells. However, whether Rac1 activation plays a role in cell transformation by activated alleles of Src and, if so, the precise nature of the Rac GEFs involved are both still poorly defined.In this study, we first examined the role of Rac1 activation in Src-induced transformation. We found that v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells display remarkably high levels of GTP-bound Rac1 and that molecules interfering with the activation of Rac1 or the ability of Rac1 to induce downstream pathways potently inhibited the focus forming activity of v-Src. In search for the underlying mechanism leading to Rac1 activation, we found that endogenous Vav2, which is limitedly expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-Src transformed cells. In addition, we observed that Tiam1, a specific Rac1-GEF that is highly expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in v-Src-transformed cells. Furthermore, we found that active Src strongly potentiates Tiam1-induced Rac1 activation and the consequent stimulation of cellular responses controlled by this small GTPase. These findings suggest that Tiam1 is a novel downstream effector of Src and that Src may utilize Tiam1 and Vav2 to regulate the activity of Rac1, thereby initiating the activation of a variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear events that are necessary for cellular transformation.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines and Transfections—NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum (Bio Whittaker). To establish NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing v-Src (NIH/v-Src), the cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate precipitation technique with pCEFL-v-Src. The cells were selected in culture medium containing G418 (750 μg/ml) for 3 weeks. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections in HEK 293T cells were performed using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.DNA Constructs—The expression vectors pSM-SrcYF (constitutively active) and pSM-SrcYF-KM (dominant negative) were kindly provided by H. Varmus. The plasmids pCEFL-SrcYF and pCEFL-SrcYF-KM were generated by cloning SrcYF and SrcYF-KM in the mammalian expression vector pCEFL. The coding sequence for the Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding (CRIB) domain of the p21-activated serine/threonine kinase 1 (PAK1; amino acids 67–150) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-4T3 in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Full-length Tiam1 was cloned by PCR from murine brain cDNA (Clontech) and subcloned in the vector pCEFL with a C-terminal HA tag. Expression vectors for an N-terminal truncated form of Tiam1 lacking the first 390 amino acids (Tiam1ΔN) and a C-terminal fragment of Tiam1 corresponding to the last 580 amino acids (TiamC580) were kindly provided by J. Collard. The expression vector (pcDNAIII derivatives) for proto-Vav2 was previously reported (24Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCEFL EGFP-Vav2 wild type was generated by cloning Vav2 wild type in pCEFL in frame with the C-terminal EGFP coding sequence. Constitutively activated small G proteins RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 were generated by replacing glutamine for leucine (QL mutants) in a position analogous to codon 61 in Ras and subcloned as AU5 epitope-tagged forms in pCEFL as previously reported (23Teramoto H. Salem P. Robbins K.C. Bustelo X.R. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10751-10755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Dominant negative forms of Rac1 (Rac1 N17) and Cdc42 (Cdc42 N17) were obtained by replacing threonine 17 for asparagine in their corresponding coding sequence (19Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for HA-tagged JNK and a plasmid encoding a luciferase gene driven by a wild type murine c-jun promoter, pJLuc, have been previously described (18Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 535-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Reagents—Human recombinant PDGF-BB (Intergen) was used at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. The SU6656 and PP2 (Calbiochem) inhibitors were used at 2 μm. Specific antibodies to HA and GFP were purchased from Covance. Polyclonal antibody against the C terminus (C-16) of Tiam1 was from Santa Cruz (sc-872). Polyclonal antibody against a unique acidic region of Vav2 was from Bustelo's lab (25Pandey A. Podtelejnikov A.V. Blagoev B. Bustelo X.R. Mann M. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar).Determination of Protein Tyrosine Phosphorylation—For prediction of potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation by members of the Src family, amino acid sequences were analyzed using the Scansite (scansite.mit.edu) and the NetPhos 2.0 prediction servers (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetPhos). For experimental determination of tyrosine phosphorylation, the proteins were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis against phosphotyrosines using a combination of monoclonal antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (4G10) and Santa Cruz (PY-99). The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) using goat anti-mouse IgGs coupled to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody (ICN).In Vivo Rac1 Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assay—In vivo Rac1 activity was assessed by a modified method described elsewhere (26Chikumi H. Vazquez-Prado J. Servitja J.M. Miyazaki H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27130-27134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Servitja J.M. Masgrau R. Pardo R. Sarri E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Gutkind J.S. Picatoste F. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed with ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were incubated for 30 min with a purified, bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing the CRIB domain of PAK1, previously bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), followed by three washes with lysis buffer. The GTP-bound forms of Rac1 associated with GST-CRIB were quantified by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody against Rac1 (BD Transduction Laboratories).Focus Forming Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique with different expression plasmids together with 1 μg of pcDNAIII-β-gal, a plasmid expressing the enzyme β-galactosidase, adjusting the total amount of plasmid DNA with empty vector. The day after transfection, the cells were washed in medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and then maintained in the same medium for 2–3 weeks. The foci were stained and scored as described (18Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 535-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Duplicate plates were fixed with 1× PBS solution containing 2% (v/v) formaldehyde and 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and stained at 37 °C for β-galactosidase activity with a 1× PBS solution containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6, and 0.1% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to evaluate the transfection efficiency.JNK Kinase Assay—HEK 293T cells were seeded at 70–80% confluence and transfected with Polyfect (Qiagen) with the expression vector for HA-tagged JNK1 alone or in combination with other plasmids. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 18 h and incubated in serum-free medium for 2 h. The cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in JNK lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. HA-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco). Immunocomplexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, once with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, and once with kinase reaction buffer containing 12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm vanadate. The samples were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/reaction and 20 μm of unlabeled ATP. 1 μg of purified, bacterially expressed GST-c-Jun was used as substrate for the JNK in vitro kinase assay. After 20 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels, and autoradiographies were performed with the aid of an intensifying screen.Reporter Gene Assay—The plasmid encoding a luciferase gene driven by a wild type murine c-jun promoter (pJLuc) was kindly provided by R. Prywes. The cells were transfected with different expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of the pJLuc and 0.01 μg of pRL-null (a plasmid expressing the luciferase from Renilla reniformis) as an internal control. In all cases, the total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted with pcDNAIII-β-gal. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities present in cellular lysates were assayed using a dual luciferase reporter system (Promega), and light emission was quantitated using the Monolight 2010 luminometer as specified by the manufacturer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory).Fluorescence Microscopy—Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were grown in 24-well plates on coverslips and transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with the pCEFL-EGFP plasmid along with additional expression vectors. The Cells were serum-starved for 8 h and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (in 1× PBS) for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (in 1× PBS) for 10 min. The coverslips were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h with phalloidin conjugated to Texas Red. The coverslips were mounted and visualized using Axioplan2 microscope (Zeiss). The digital images were captured using Spotcam.RESULTSRac1 Is Constitutively Active in v-Src Transformed Cells— To examine the contribution of Rac1 in v-Src-mediated cell transformation, we first explored the status of Rac1 activity in v-Src-transformed cells. To this end, we established NIH 3T3 lines stably expressing v-Src (NIH/v-Src). As a control, these cells exhibited a substantially increased level of phosphotyrosine containing proteins, whose extent of phosphorylation was strongly reduced by the highly selective Src inhibitor SU6656 (28Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). For the analysis of Rac1 activity in vivo, we used a GST fusion protein containing the CRIB domain of the PAK1, prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, to bind and affinity precipitate the activated, GTP-bound forms of Rac1. Using this assay, we observed remarkably high levels of Rac1-GTP in NIH/v-Src cells when compared with those in parental, nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1B). Total Rac1 expression levels were comparable between these two cell populations, and although normal NIH 3T3 cells exhibited low levels of active Rac1 under basal conditions, the amount of active Rac1 in these cells was rapidly and transiently increased upon stimulation with PDGF, which served as a control (Fig. 1C). Thus, stable expression of v-Src results in a remarkable and persistent increase in the levels of active Rac1, comparable with that achievable by acute exposure of NIH 3T3 cells to polypeptide growth factors.Transformation Induced by v-Src Is Inhibited by the Blockade of the Rac1 Pathway—We next explored the contribution of Rac1 to the ability of v-Src to transform NIH 3T3 cells. In this regard, we noticed that v-Src-induced foci are morphologically distinct from the spread out foci induced by an activated form of an upstream kinase of ERK1/2, MEK1 EE, which are typical of other oncogenes stimulating the ERK pathway, such as ras and raf (29Jaffe A.B. Hall A. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 84: 57-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 30Zohar M. Teramoto H. Katz B.Z. Yamada K.M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Indeed, v-Src-induced foci are highly compact and well delineated, resembling more closely the foci induced by members of the Rho GEF family and activated forms of Rho GTPases (30Zohar M. Teramoto H. Katz B.Z. Yamada K.M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When v-Src was cotransfected with expression vectors for either a dominant negative form of Rac1 (Rac1 N17), which interferes with Rac1 activation (31Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), or a GST fusion protein containing the CRIB domain of PAK (PAK-N), that prevents Rac1 function (32Fukuhara S. Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21730-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the number of foci induced by v-Src were significantly reduced. In contrast, the number of foci induced by MEK1 EE was not affected by these Rac1-interfering constructs. Together, these results suggest that Rac1 is an integral component of the transforming pathway utilized by v-Src.Fig. 2Rac1 participates in v-Src-induced focus-formation. NIH 3T3 were transfected with pCDNAIII-β-gal, pCEFL-v-Src, or pCEV-MEK1 EE, alone or in combination with pCEFL-RacN17 and pCEFL-GST-PAK-N. The cells were cultured for 2 weeks in 5% calf serum, then fixed, and stained, and the numbers of foci were counted and represented as the average ± S.E. of foci/plate for the indicated transfected DNAs. All of the data are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Vav2 and Tiam1 Are Phosphorylated on Tyrosine Residues by Active Src and Endogenous Tyrosine Kinases—On the basis of the above observations, we next set out to further define the mechanism underlying Rac1 activation by Src. Because the ubiquitously expressed Vav2 can be regulated by tyrosine kinases (24Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we confirmed that endogenous Vav2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in NIH/v-Src cells (Fig. 3A). However, the expression levels of this GEF for Rho GTPases are relatively low, and large amounts of cellular proteins need to be immunoprecipitated to detect Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, we have recently observed that dominant negative forms of Vav2 inhibit only partially the effects mediated by Src (10Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, other Rac1 GEFs may also contribute to the activation of Rac1 by Src in addition to Vav2.Fig. 3Vav2 and Tiam1 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells transfected with v-Src and active c-Src. A, NIH 3T3 cells and NIH/v-Src cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 3 h. Endogenous Vav2 (three 10-cm plates) and Tiam1 (one 10-cm plate) were immunoprecipitated (IP) using polyclonal Vav2 and Tiam1 antibodies, respectively. The samples were subjected to WB with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Vav2, or anti-Tiam1 antibodies as indicated. B, HEK 293T cells were transfected with GFP-Vav2 or HA-Tiam1, alone or in combination with c-Src, an active form of c-Src (SrcYF), or an inactive form of SrcYF (SrcYF-KM). The cells were serum-deprived for 3 h prior lysis. Immunoprecipitated GFP-Vav2 and HA-Tiam1 were subjected to Western blot (WB) analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) antibody. The amount of GFP-Vav2 and HA-Tiam1 in the immunoprecipitates was determined to confirm similar levels of expression of the GEFs in all conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Among the several members of the growing superfamily of GEFs for Rho proteins, Tiam1 has been shown to have high specificity for Rac1 and to be widely expressed. Of interest, a detailed examination of the amino acid sequence of Tiam1 revealed the existence of potential consensus sites for phosphorylation by members of the Src family (scansite.mit.edu). Thus, we set out to determine whether Tiam1 was a Src effector leading to Rac1 activation. As a first step, we asked whether Src could induce Tiam1 phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous Tiam1 was clearly tyrosine-phosphorylated in NIH/v-Src cells, as judged by its immunodetection by anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies in Tiam1 immunoprecipitates. We next investigated whether an HA-tagged Tiam1 can be phosphorylated in cells transiently transfected with an activated form of Src. As shown in Fig. 3B, immunoprecipitated Tiam1 was only slightly phosphorylated by overexpression of c-Src, whereas an active Src (SrcYF), in which Tyr527 was mutated to Phe, induced a much stronger effect. Both c-Src and SrcYF also effectively tyrosine-phosphorylated ectopically expressed Vav2. To confirm that the kinase activity of Src was required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tiam1 and Vav2 by Src, we used an inactive form of SrcYF with an additional mutation that renders the kinase inactive (SrcYF-KM). Neither Tiam1 nor Vav2 were phosphorylated when cotransfected with SrcYF-KM. Together, these results indicate that Src can phosphorylate Tiam1 on tyrosine residues and that this effect is dependent on the kinase activity of Src.Next, we took advantage of the observation that reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, activate c-Src (33Abe J.

The interaction was confirmed in biochemical pull-down analyses. The interaction was specific, in that PDE4A5 did not interact with the closely related immunophilins AIPL1, FKBP51, or FKBP52. XAP2 also did not interact with other PDE4A isoforms or typical isoforms from the three other PDE4 subfamilies. Functionally, XAP2 reversibly inhibited the enzymatic activity of PDE4A5, increased the sensitivity of PDE4A5 to inhibition by the prototypical PDE4 inhibitor 4-[3-(cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidinone (rolipram) and attenuated the ability of cAMP-dependent protein kinase to phosphorylate PDE4A5 in intact cells. XAP2 maximally inhibited PDE4A5 by ∼60%, with an IC50 of 120 nm, and reduced the IC50 for rolipram from 390 nm to 70–90 nm. Co-expression of XAP2 and PDE4A5 in COS7 cells showed that they could be co-immunoprecipitated and also reduced both the enzymatic activity of PDE4A5 and its IC50 for rolipram. Native XAP2 and PDE4A5 could be co-immunoprecipitated from the brain. The isolated COOH-terminal half of XAP2 (amino acids 170–330), containing its tetratricopeptide repeat domain, but not the isolated NH2-terminal half (amino acids 1–169), containing the immunophilin homology region, similarly reduced PDE4A5 activity and its IC50 for rolipram. Mutation of Arg271 to alanine, in the XAP2 tetratricopeptide repeat region, attenuated its ability to both interact with PDE4A5 in two-hybrid assays and to inhibit PDE4A5 activity. Either the deletion of a specific portion of the unique amino-terminal region or specific mutations in the regulatory UCR2 domain of PDE4A5 attenuated its ability be inhibited by XAP2. We suggest that XAP2 functionally interacts with PDE4A5 in cells. The cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE4) isoform PDE4A5 interacted with the immunophilin XAP2 in a yeast two-hybrid assay.

We suggest that XAP2 functionally interacts with PDE4A5 in cells. Signal transduction mediated by the second messenger cAMP is pivotal in a multitude of cellular processes, including the action of numerous hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors (1Beavo J.A.

PDE4 enzymes can be differentiated from other cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases by sequence homology in the catalytic region of the proteins and by the presence of unique regions of amino acid sequence in the amino-terminal half of the proteins, outside the catalytic region, which are called upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and UCR2) (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In addition, PDE4s are also characterized by their ability to be inhibited by a specific class of drugs, such as rolipram, which have anti-depressant, anti-inflammatory, and smooth muscle relaxant activity in humans (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Conti M. Richter W. Mehats C. Livera G. Park J.Y. Jin C. J. Biol.

At least 15 different PDE4 isoforms have been described in mammals, which are encoded by four different genes (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D), with additional diversity being generated by the generation of alternatively spliced mRNAs from each gene (2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M.

PDE4A5 is a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase isoform encoded by the PDE4A gene that is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including the lung and various regions of the brain (4Bolger G.

Houslay M.D. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PDE4A5 contains UCR1 and UCR2 as well as a unique amino-terminal region (Fig. 1a). The PDE4A5 unique amino-terminal region is highly conserved in mammals; of the 107 amino acids in the human PDE4A4 unique amino-terminal region, 94 (88%) are identical to those in the amino-terminal regions of both the rat and murine PDE4A5 proteins (5Bolger G.B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This high degree of conservation among species suggests that the PDE4A5 unique amino-terminal region has specific functions, which are now being identified. Truncation of the PDE4A5 amino-terminal region alters the enzymatic activity and intracellular targeting of the protein (8Beard M.B. Huston E. Campbell L. Gall I. McPhee I. Yarwood S. Scotland G.

We now report that PDE4A5 selectively associates with the immunophilin XAP2 (also called AIP and ARA9) (11Ma Q. Whitlock J.P.J. J. Biol.

Immunophilins are a large class of proteins, all of which are characterized by the presence of a region of amino acid sequence called the immunophilin domain (14Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In many immunophilins, the immunophilin domain has cis-trans peptidylprolyl isomerase (rotamase) activity and is the target for immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin, FK506, or rapamycin (14Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, XAP2 does not appear to have either of these functions (11Ma Q. Whitlock J.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 15Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

XAP2 was first identified as a protein that interacts with the X protein of hepatitis B virus (16Kuzhandaivelu N. Cong Y.S. Inouye C. Yang W.M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Subsequently, XAP2 has been shown to be capable of interacting with Hsp90 as part of a complex containing the aryl hydrocarbon (dioxin) receptor (11Ma Q. Whitlock J.P.J. J. Biol.

This interaction requires a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) within the carboxyl-terminal region of XAP2 (Fig. 1b) and both the unique amino-terminal region of PDE4A5 and a motif located within UCR2. We also show that XAP2 inhibits the enzymatic activity of PDE4A5, increases its sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram, and attenuates its ability to be phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).

Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) encoding rat PDE4A5 was cloned into the NotI site of pLEXAN (a derivative of pBTM116) (21Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), to generate pLEXAR6. This construct encodes a fusion between the amino-terminal end of PDE4A5 and the DNA binding domain of the Escherichia coli LexA protein. The rat PDE4A5 isoform is the homolog of the human PDE4A4 isoform (GenBank™ L20965) (4Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Screens were performed with a rat brain two-hybrid library (Clontech) cloned into the EcoRI site of the pGAD10 vector. The library expressed proteins as fusions with the activation domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 protein. The library was transformed into the S. cerevisiae strain L40, as described previously (20Bolger G.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 101-131PubMed Google Scholar). Positive clones were initially selected for growth in the absence of histidine (without 3-aminotriazole) and then transferred to patches and assayed for lacZ activity using a filter β-galactosidase assay (20Bolger G.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 101-131PubMed Google Scholar). Library plasmid DNA was then isolated from the positives and then re-assayed for interaction with PDE4A5 (20Bolger G.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 101-131PubMed Google Scholar). For additional two-hybrid experiments, the full ORFs of various human and rat PDE4 isoforms, all described by us previously (see Ref. 2Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar for a review) were cloned into the NotI site of pLEXAN, to create LexA fusions. cDNAs encoding the full ORFs of the immunophilins Cyp40 (GenBank™ number L11667) and FKBP52 (GenBank™ M88279) were purchased from Invitrogen as Genestorm clones and cloned into the NotI site of pGADN (21Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) to encode fusions between the amino terminus of the respective proteins and the activation domain of the S. cerevisiae GAL4 protein. Analogous clones in pGADN were also made for AIPL1 and FKBP51. Generation of Bacterial Expression Constructs—The full ORFs of cDNAs encoding rat PDE4A5, human FKBP12 (GenBank™ M34539), FKBP51, FKBP52, and Cyp40 and rat XAP2 were cloned into the NotI site of pGEX-5x-3 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate fusions between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the amino terminus of the respective proteins. Similar clones were created into the NotI site of pMALN to generate fusions between maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the amino terminus of the proteins. pMALN is a derivative of pMALp2C (New England BioLabs) with a NotI site inserted into the polylinker. Also generated were constructs encoding analogous fusions with the amino-terminal (amino acids 1–169; to create GST-XAP21–169 or MBP-XAP21–169) or carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 170–330; to create GST-XAP2170–330 or MBP-XAP2170–330) regions of XAP2, respectively. Generation of COS7 Cell Expression Constructs—To express PDE4A5, the full ORF of its cDNA was cloned into the NotI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which placed the insert under the control of the cytomegalovirus intermediate early gene promoter. A sequence corresponding to the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein epitope was added immediately downstream from the last codon of the protein to encode a carboxyl-terminal fusion, as described by us previously for PDE4D5 (21Yarwood S.J.

The native stop codon was removed in this process, but a synthetic stop codon was placed immediately downstream from the epitope sequence. Similar expression plasmids were generated to encode other PDE4 isoforms, as we have described previously (6Bolger G.B. McPhee I. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1065-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22McPhee I. Yarwood S.J. Scotland G. Huston E. Beard M.B. Ross A.H. Houslay E.S. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11796-11810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To express XAP2, its full ORF was cloned into the NotI site of pFLAGCMV6c (Sigma). This construct placed XAP2 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, with an amino-terminal FLAG epitope and the native stop codon. Generation of cDNAs Encoding Mutant Forms of PDE4A5 and XAP2—To generate deletions in the PDE4A5 ORF, PCR was used to amplify various regions of PDE4A5, which were then cloned into pcDNA3. NotI sites were added to the PCR primers to aid in cloning. The circular site-directed mutagenesis method was used to generate point mutations in the full-length PDE4A5 or XAP2 cDNAs, using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Verification of Two-hybrid, Expression, and Mutagenesis Constructs—All PCR-generated or mutant constructs were verified by sequencing prior to use. Generation of GST and MBP Fusion Proteins—The E. coli strain JM109 was transformed with pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) for the production of GST or transformed with pMALpC2 for the production of MBP. Clones encoding full-length rat PDE4A5 and various immunophilins as GST fusions and GST-XAP21–169, MBP-XAP21–169, GST-XAP2170–330, and MBP-XAP2170–330 were also expressed in this strain. The transformed bacteria were grown in LB broth with 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C with agitation, diluted into 500-ml cultures of the same medium (with 2 g/liter glucose for the MBP fusions), and then grown to an A 660 of 0.6 to 1.0. Isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 0.1 mm to induce expression of the protein, and the cultures were grown for an additional 3–4 h at 37 °C (or 30 °C for the MBP fusions) with agitation. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 400 × g av for 5 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of PBS containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and stored as aliquots at –20 °C. The aliquots were thawed at room temperature and then held on ice. They were sonicated in 5 × 20 s. pulses, separated by 20-s intervals, and then centrifuged at 9000 × g av for 30 min at 4 °C to remove debris. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences; for GST fusions) or amylose resin (New England BioLabs; for MBP fusions) equilibrated in PBS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor mixture (200-μl bed volume) were added to 4 ml of the supernatant and then incubated end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g av for 5 min and washed three times in 5 ml of ice-cold PBS/dithiothreitol/protease inhibitor for a total of 90 min at 4 °C. The purified protein was eluted from the beads with three incubations, each 15 min, with 200 μlof10mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (for GST fusions), or 10 mm maltose in PBS (for MBP fusions). The eluates were combined and dialyzed three times against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. The dialyzed protein was stored at –80 °C until needed. The generation, expression, and purification of the GST fusion of the LYN kinase SH3 domain (GST-LYN-SH3) were performed as we have reported previously (10O'Connell J.C. McCallum J.F. McPhee I.

Transient Expression of PDE4 Isoforms in COS7 Cells—Transfection of plasmids encoding various PDE isoforms and/or XAP2 into the COS7 SV40-transformed monkey kidney cell line was performed as described in detail previously (23McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics to 70% confluence. The DNA to be transfected (5 μg) was mixed with 250 μl of 10 mg/ml DEAE-dextran in PBS and then incubated for 15 min. The medium was removed from the cells, and the cells were incubated in 10 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1 mm chloroquine and the DNA-dextran mix. After incubation for4hat37 °C, the medium was removed, and the cells were shocked for 2 min with 10% Me2SO in PBS. After washing with PBS, the cells were grown for 2 days and then harvested. Preparation of Antibodies against XAP2—Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide of sequence NH2-CKDEEDKARFRGIFSHCOOH, corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of XAP2, conjugated to KLH. The initial immunization was performed in complete Freund's adjuvant, and monthly booster immunizations were performed in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (24Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). All animal treatment was in compliance with institutional guidelines. SDS-PAGE, PDE4A Antibodies, and Immunoblotting—Samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer (24Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) and, unless noted otherwise, were run on 8% acrylamide gels at 8 mA/gel overnight or 50 mA/gel for 4–5 h with cooling. For detection of PDE4 by immunoblotting, 2–50-μg protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then immunoblotted using specific antibodies. Detection was performed with peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG and the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The PDE4A antibody was generated to detect specifically the carboxyl-terminal region common to all rat PDE4A isoforms, as described in detail by us previously (6Bolger G.B. McPhee I. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1065-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Beard M.B. Huston E. Campbell L. Gall I. McPhee I. Yarwood S. Scotland G.

Although this antibody detects all PDE4A isoforms, the individual isoforms can in turn be distinguished by their different mobilities on SDS-PAGE. The PDE4A5-specific antibody was generated against the unique PDE4A5 amino-terminal region, as we have described previously (9Huston E. Beard M. McCallum F. Pyne N.J. Vandenabeele P. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28063-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PDE Assay—For determination of PDE activity, COS7 cells were transfected as described above and then homogenized in KHEM buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 1.92 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) containing Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture to produce final concentrations of 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 156 μg/ml benzamine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml antipain. As described previously (23McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), in the transfected cells, greater than 98% of the total PDE activity was due to the recombinant PDE4A enzyme. In some instances, the transfected COS7 cells were plated into six-well plates and then serum-starved overnight before being treated with the indicated ligands. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was assayed using 1 μm cAMP as substrate, as described previously (26Marchmont R.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 381-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Reactions (total volume of 100 μl) were initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 5 μm [3H]cAMP. All assays were conducted at 30 °C, and in all experiments a freshly prepared slurry of Dowex/H2O/ethanol (1:1:1) was used. Initial rates were taken from linear time courses of activity. Mock transfections (vector only) did not alter endogenous COS7 cell PDE activity, as described by us previously (23McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M. Bolger G. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 965-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To evaluate any effect of GST-LYN-SH3 on the ability of XAP2170–330 to inhibit PDE4A5, two different approaches were employed. In the first approach, purified GST-LYN-SH3 (20 μg) was added to the PDE assay reaction (80 μl) containing COS7-expressed PDE4A5 (0.5 μg of protein) and incubated for 10 min on ice. This treatment with GST-LYN-SH3 allows for complete interaction of PDE4A5 with GST-LYN-SH3 (10O'Connell J.C. McCallum J.F. McPhee I. Wakefield J. Houslay E.S. Wishart W. Bolger G. Frame M. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of GST-XAP2170–330 were then added and incubated for an additional 10 min, followed by the addition of the substrate (20 μlof5 μm [3H]cAMP) to the assay. In the second approach, a sample (400 μg) of purified GST-LYN-SH3 bound to glutathione-agarose beads was incubated with an aliquot of COS7-expressed PDE4A5 (24 μg of protein). The beads were washed with complete KHEM buffer, and a sample equivalent to 1 μg of PDE4A5 protein was taken for assay. Protein Concentration—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (24Harlow E. Lane D.P. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. PKA Phosphorylation—PKA-mediated phosphorylation of S140 in PDE4A5 was performed using a modification of a procedure that we have described previously (27MacKenzie S.J. Baillie G.S. McPhee I. MacKenzie C. Seamons R. McSorley T. Millen J. Beard M.B. Van Heeke G. Houslay M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In brief, COS7 cells were either transfected with plasmids encoding PDE4A5 or co-transfected with plasmids encoding both PDE4A5 and XAP2. The cells were pretreated with 100 μm IBMX for 15 min prior to the addition of 100 μm forskolin. At the indicated times, the cells were harvested in ice-cold KHEM buffer and homogenized. Cell lysates (25 μg of protein) were run on NuPAGE gradient gels (4–12% Bis-Tris; Invitrogen), blotted to nitrocellulose, and then immunoblotted with an antibody to phospho-UCR1 (as we have described) (8Beard M.B. Huston E. Campbell L. Gall I. McPhee I. Yarwood S. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 453-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) as well as with antibodies to PDE4A, XAP2, and phospho-CREB (New England Biolabs). Pull-down Assays with GST Fusion Proteins—Pull-down assays were performed using a modification of a procedure we have described previously (21Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A volume of slurry containing 400 μg of fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was centrifuged at 15,000 × g av for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was discarded. The bead pellets were resuspended in 200 enzyme units of PDE enzyme activity derived from either the crude lysate or the high speed supernatant (S2 fraction, as described under “Immunoprecipitations”) of transfected COS7 cells. The beads and the COS7 fraction were incubated end-over-end for 10 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g av for 2 min, and the supernatant was retained as the unbound fraction. The beads were washed three times over 15 min at 4 °C with 400 μl of KHEM buffer with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors, and the w"

S1P, dihydro-S1P, and sphingosylphosphorylcholine inhibited B16 cell migration and invasion with the relative potencies expected as S1P2 receptor agonists. The S1P2-selective antagonist JTE013 completely abolished the responses to these agonists. In addition, JTE013 abrogated the inhibition by sphingosine, which is the S1P precursor but not an agonist for S1P receptors, indicating that the sphingosine effects were mediated via S1P2 stimulation, most likely by S1P that was converted from sphingosine. S1P induced inhibition and activation, respectively, of Rac and RhoA in B16 cells, which were abrogated by JTE013. Adenovirus-mediated expression of N17Rac mimicked S1P inhibition of migration, whereas C3 toxin pretreatment, but not Rho kinase inhibitors, reversed the S1P inhibition. Overexpression of S1P2 sensitized, and that of either S1P1 or S1P3 desensitized, B16 cells to S1P inhibition of Rac and migration. In JTE013-pretreated, S1P3-overexpressing B16 cells, S1P stimulated cellular RhoA but failed to inhibit either Rac or migration, indicating that RhoA stimulation itself is not sufficient for inhibition of migration. These results provide compelling evidence that endogenously expressed S1P2 negatively regulates cell motility and invasion through ligand-dependent reciprocal regulation of cellular Rac and RhoA activities. In the presence of JTE013, S1P instead stimulated Rac and migration in B16 cells that overexpress either S1P1 or S1P3, unveiling counteractions between S1P2 and S1P1 or S1P3 chemotactic receptor.

It is now widely accepted that many of the actions of S1P are mediated through the Edg family G protein-coupled S1P receptors, which include ubiquitously expressed isotypes S1P1/Edg1, S1P2/Edg5/AGR16, and S1P3/Edg3, and additional members S1P4/Edg6 and S1P5/Edg8, whose expression patterns are more tissue-specific (for a review, see Refs. 1Spiegel S.

It is also demonstrated that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a classical serum-derived lysophospholipid mediator that shares a number of biological activities with S1P, acts on distinct members of the Edg family, including LPA1/Edg2, LPA2/Edg4, and LPA3/Edg7 (4Hla T.

Previous studies have demonstrated that S1P regulates cell motility in either a positive or negative direction, in a manner apparently dependent upon cell type tested. Thus, Sadahira et al. (8Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9686-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) first reported that S1P inhibits trans-well migration as well as invasion across a Matrigel layer of B16 mouse melanoma cells and other types of tumor cells. S1P also inhibits chemotaxis of human arterial smooth muscle cells (9Bornfeldt K.E. Graves L.M. Raines E.W. Igarashi Y. Wayman G. Yamamura S. Yatomi Y. Sidhu J.S. Krebs E.G. Hakomori S. J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) toward platelet-derived growth factor and neutrophil chemoattractants, respectively. On the other hand, S1P instead itself induces chemotaxis in other types of cells including human umbilical vein endothelial cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (12Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.P. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spigel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35345-35350Google Scholar, 13Liu J. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.-X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M.

We have characterized intracellular signaling and biological activities of S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3 in the mammalian expression system using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which express a trace amount of S1P2 mRNA but not that of either S1P1 or S1P3, demonstrating that S1P2 mediates S1P inhibition of migration toward a chemoattractant insulin-like growth factor I, with concomitant suppression of cellular Rac activity (14Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The results provide the first evidence for the existence of a G protein-coupled receptor-mediated negative regulation of cellular Rac activity (14Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Since adenovirus-mediated expression of a dominant negative form of Rac mimicked the S1P suppression of cell migration, we proposed that S1P2-mediated inhibition of Rac is a mechanism for suppression of cell motility. It has also been demonstrated that, unlike S1P2, S1P1 (13Liu J. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.-X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.-S. Lee M.-J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Proia R.L. J. Clin.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and S1P3 (14Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) mediate activation of Rac and chemotaxis toward S1P. In addition, the chemorepulsive receptor S1P2 and the chemotactic receptor S1P3 similarly mediate activation of RhoA (14Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that S1P-directed, cell type-dependent positive or negative regulation of cell motility reflects S1P receptor isotype-specific bimodal actions on Rac and cell motility (3Takuwa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1582: 112-120Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 15Takuwa Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. J. Biochem. 2002; 131: 767-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, the expression patterns of S1P receptor isoforms in a variety of cell types are well correlated with the direction of regulation of cell motility by S1P. For example, human umbilical vein endothelial cells express S1P1 and S1P3 much more abundantly than S1P2, whereas in vascular smooth muscle cells, S1P2 is a predominant S1P receptor isotype (10Ryu Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Usui S. Okamoto H. Matsui O. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, there is yet no conclusive evidence that an endogenously expressed S1P receptor could regulate cell motility in the same way as that overexpressed exogenously. In addition, S1P may inhibit cell motility through its intracellular action (16Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Edsall L. Nava V.E. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6185-6191PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, sphingosine, which is the metabolic precursor of S1P but not a ligand for any of the Edg S1P receptors and thus fails to induce Ca2+ mobilization or ERK activation (1Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25851-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 3Takuwa Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1582: 112-120Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar), is capable of inhibiting migration and invasion of B16 cells, although at higher concentrations than S1P (8Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9686-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have addressed these questions by adopting a recently developed S1P2-selective antagonist (17Ikeda H. Satoh H. Yanase M. Inoue Y. Tomiya T. Arai M. Tejima K. Nagashima K. Maekawa H. Yahagi N. Yatomi Y. Sakurada S. Takuwa Y. Ogata I. Kimuira S. Fujiwara K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 24: 459-469Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that endogenous S1P2 is solely responsible for mediating suppression of migration and invasion by S1P and other related sphingolipids in B16 melanoma cells. The inhibitory effects of S1P are mediated through inhibition of Rac and stimulation of RhoA. In addition, we found counteraction between endogenous S1P2 and exogenously expressed S1P1 or S1P3, in terms of regulation of Rac and cell migration. The latter two isoforms, when expressed in B16 cells, act as chemotactic receptors to stimulate these responses in the selective absence of S1P2 action. Materials—S1P, dihydro-S1P (DH-S1P) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sphingosine was purchased from Avanti (Birmingham, AL). JTE013 was donated by Japan Tobacco Inc. Research Laboratory (Takatsuki, Japan). The sphingolipids and JTE013 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 2× 10–3 and 2 × 10–2m, respectively, aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C. Final solvent concentrations did not exceed 0.1%. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Rac and RhoA were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. A mouse anti-ERK2 antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Pertussis toxin and Fura-2/AM were purchased from List Biological Laboratories and Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto, Japan), respectively. Botulinum C3 toxin was prepared as described previously (18Sugimoto N. Takuwa N. Okamoto H. Sakurada S. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1534-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel was obtained from BD Biosciences. Cells, Plasmids, and Adenoviruses—B16 (B16-F10) cells, a generous gift of Dr. T. Irimura (University of Tokyo), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Equitech-Bio, Ingram, TX) and antibiotics.

B16 cell clones that stably overexpress S1P1, S1P2, or S1P3 but otherwise have a similar biological background were obtained as follows. We first isolated a clone by limited dilution, expanded this parent clone, and then introduced into this population each of the Edg receptor expression vectors or the empty vector, together with an expression vector of neomycin resistance gene (pKM3) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Subsequent limiting dilution in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 enabled isolation of several clones that stably overexpress either one of the S1P receptor isoforms, in addition to modest and comparable expression of endogenous S1P2, as confirmed by Northern analysis. They include B16-S1P1-1 and -9; B16-S1P2-7 and -14; and B16-S1P3-10 and -19. Adenoviruses employed in the present study were described previously (10Ryu Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Usui S.

This condition conferred expression of LacZ as a marker gene in nearly 100% of transfected cells when evaluated 48 and 72 h after infection. Adenovirus-transduced cells were harvested 48 h after infection for migration and invasion assays. Viability of the cells consistently exceed 95%. Northern Blotting—Ten μg each of total cellular RNA prepared from B16 cells was analyzed for expression of mRNAs of Edg S1P receptors and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase by Northern blotting as described (22Takuwa N.

Migration and Invasion Assays—Trans-well migration of B16 cells was measured in a modified Boyden chamber as described previously (10Ryu Y. Takuwa N. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Usui S. Okamoto H. Matsui O. Takuwa Y. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell.

B16 cells (1 × 105 cells) in 200 μl of serum-free Ham's F12 media containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (migration medium) were loaded into the upper wells, whereas the lower wells were filled with the same medium containing various concentrations of S1P and/or JTE013. The cells were allowed to migrate across the porous filter for 4 h at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator. After staining of the cells, the number of the cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was determined by measuring optical densities at 595 nm using a 96-well microplate reader Model 3550 (Bio-Rad) (10Ryu Y.

In brief, monolayer cultures of B16 cells grown in fibronectin-coated dishes were “wounded” by a micropipett tip and then incubated in the presence or absence of S1P in the migration medium for 24 h in a tissue culture incubator. After staining of actin cytoskeleton by tetrarhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin, cell migration into a wounded space was evaluated under a fluorescent microscope (IX70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Invasion across Matrigel layer of B16 cells was measured in a 24-well Boyden chamber system with upper and lower sides of the porous filter (8.5 mm in diameter) (Kurabo, Tokyo, Japan) coated with 17 μg of Matrigel and 0.5 μg of fibronectin, respectively. B16 cells (1 × 105 cells) in 200 μl of the migration medium were loaded in the upper wells, which were assembled on the lower wells containing 700 μl of the same medium containing S1P and/or JTE013. The cells were allowed to invade through Matrigel layer and 8-μm pores to the lower side of the filter for 24 h at 37 °C. The number of the cells on the lower side of the filter was densitometrically quantitated as described above. Determination of the Activities of Cellular RhoA and Rac—Determinations of cellular amounts of GTP-bound, active forms of Rac and RhoA by pull-down assay techniques were described previously (10Ryu Y.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C571-C578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the 10,000 × g supernatant of the cell lysate was incubated at 4 °C with either GST-PAK (for active Rac) or GST-rhotekin (for active RhoA) immobilized on Sepharose beads for 40 min. The proteins bound to Sepharose beads, as well as total Rac or RhoA derived from a portion (1200 ) of the same cell lysate, were solubilized with Laemmli's sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and Western analysis. The corresponding bands were densitometrically quantitated by using a Quantity One image analyzing system (PDI Inc.). Data are expressed as percentage of the control value in basal unstimulated state (100%). Measurements of Intracellular Free Ca2 + Concentrations and ERK Activities—The intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was measured in Fura-2-loaded cells as described in detail previously (22Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Yanagisawa M. Yamashita K. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7856-7861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 500 nm, using a CAF-110 spectrofluorimeter (Japan Spectroscopy Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The activity of ERK2 was determined by band shift analysis as described (24Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after pretreatment with JTE013 or Me2SO (vehicle control) for 10 min and stimulation with S1P for 5 min. Statistics—The data presented are means ± S.E. of at least three determinations from a representative experiment. The same experiments were repeated three times with similar results. The statistical significance of differences between the two groups was determined by Student's t test. S1P, the S1P Receptor Agonists DH-S1P and SPC, and the S1P Precursor Sphingosine Inhibit Migration and Invasion of B16 Melanoma Cells—We first studied and compared the effects of S1P and related sphingolipids on migration and invasion of B16 melanoma cells (Fig. 1, A and B). As reported previously (8Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9686-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), S1P potently inhibited both of these cellular activities with an IC50 value of ∼10–8m. We also found that DH-S1P and SPC, which are weaker agonists for the S1P receptors (19Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Gonda K. Okazaki H. Chang K. Yatomi Y. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol.

J. 2001; 353: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), showed inhibitory effects with reduced potencies as compared with S1P, consistent with the notion that the inhibition of cell motility by S1P is mediated through either of the S1P receptors. In addition, we observed, as reported previously (8Sadahira Y. Ruan F. Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9686-9690Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), that sphingosine, which does not serve as an agonist for any of the S1P receptors, inhibited migration and invasion of B16 cells, with IC50 values between 10–7 and 10–6m. Sphingomyelin was without any inhibitory effect at up to 10–6m. JTE013 Inhibits S1P-elicited Ca2 + Mobilization and ERK Activation in CHO Cells Overexpressing S1P2 but Not S1P1 or S1P3—JTE013 is a recently developed S1P2-selective S1P receptor antagonist (17Ikeda H. Satoh H. Yanase M. Inoue Y. Tomiya T. Arai M. Tejima K. Nagashima K. Maekawa H. Yahagi N. Yatomi Y. Sakurada S. Takuwa Y. Ogata I. Kimuira S. Fujiwara K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 24: 459-469Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Indeed, JTE013 dose-dependently inhibited S1P-induced increases in [Ca2+] i in CHO cells expressing S1P2, but not S1P1 or S1P3 (Fig. 1C). The half-maximal and maximal inhibitions of S1P (10–7m)-induced [Ca2+] i rise were obtained at 3 × 10–8m and 10–6m JTE013, respectively. JTE013 at 10–6m by itself did not have any effect on [Ca2+] i .In neither cell type did JTE013 inhibit Ca2+ responses induced by other ligands such as ATP or lysophosphatidic acid. Fig. 1D shows the effects of JTE013 on S1P-stimulated ERK activation as evaluated with the band shift analysis. Consistent with the results in Fig. 1C, JTE013 at 10–6m completely abolished ERK activation in response to 10–7m S1P in CHO cells expressing S1P2, but not S1P1 or S1P3. JTE013 at 10–6m did not have any effect on ERK activity by itself. Thus, JTE013 inhibited the S1P-induced responses in an S1P2-selective manner. JTE013 Completely Reverses Inhibition of B16 Cell Migration and Invasion by S1P, DH-S1P, SPC, as Well as Sphingosine—We next examined the ability of JTE013 to antagonize the S1P suppression of migration (Fig. 2) and invasion (Fig. 3) of B16 cells. JTE013 dose-dependently and completely reversed S1P (10–7m) suppression of cell migration, with maximal inhibition obtained at 10–6m (Fig. 2A). JTE013 also completely prevented the S1P suppression of B16 cell migration in in vitro wound healing assay (Fig. 2B). We also found that JTE013 completely reversed the inhibitory effects of the weak S1P receptor agonists DH-S1P and SPC on trans-well migration (Fig. 2, C and D). As shown in Fig. 3, JTE013 abolished the inhibitory effects of S1P, DH-S1P, and SPC on invasion of B16 cells as well. JTE013 by itself, up to 10–6m, was without any effect on either migration or invasion of B16 cells. These results provide evidence that the S1P inhibition of both migration and invasion of B16 cells is mediated via S1P2 that is endogenously expressed in B16 cells (see Fig. 7). In addition, we found that JTE013 totally abrogated the inhibitory effects of sphingosine on B16 cell migration (Fig. 2E) and invasion (Fig. 3D). These latter observations strongly suggest that sphingosine is converted to S1P during prolonged incubation with the cells (4 and 24 h for migration and invasion, respectively), which then acts on S1P2 to inhibit cell motility.Fig. 3JTE013 abrogates the inhibitory effects on invasion of S1P ( A ), DH-S1P ( B ), SPC ( C ), and sphingosine ( D ) in B16 cells. As shown in A, JTE013 at 3 × 10–7m completely reversed the inhibition of B16 cell invasion by 10–7m S1P. As shown in B–D, JTE013 (10–6m) completely reversed the inhibitory effects of DH-S1P, SPC, and sphingosine (10–6m each) on invasion. The data are means ± S.E. of three determinations. ***, p < 0.001 as compared with the control in the absence of S1P.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Northern analyses of expression levels of S1P receptor isoforms in naive B16 cells, B16 cells that overexpress S1P1 (clones 1 and 9), S1P2 (clones 7 and 14), or S1P3 (clones 10 and 19), and their vector control.

Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu H. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9247-9261Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) that S1P stimulation of CHO cells that overexpress S1P2 results in suppression of cellular Rac activity and that this inhibitory regulation of Rac is involved as a mechanism for the S1P inhibition of cell migration. In the present study, we examined whether endogenously expressed S1P2 could mediate Rac inhibition in B16 cells. Fig. 4A shows the effects of various concentrations of S1P on the cellular amount of a GTP-bound active form of Rac (GTP-Rac). S1P dose-dependently inhibited cellular Rac activity in B16 cells with a half-maximal and maximal inhibition obtained at 10–9 and 10–7m, respectively (Fig. 4A). Time course studies showed that the inhibitory effect of S1P on cellular Rac activity was maximal at 1 min and then gradually declined, but inhibition was still evident 10 min after the addition of S1P. S1P inhibition of Rac activity was completely reversed by JTE013 (Fig. 4C), indicating that endogenous S1P2 mediates the negative regulation of cellular Rac activity. Consistent with previous observations in S1P2-overexpressing CHO cells (14Okamoto H. Takuwa N. Yokomizo T. Sugimoto N. Sakurada S. Shigematsu"
https://openalex.org/W2015986240,"We show that the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 are components of the mechanism by which glucose stimulates insulin gene expression. ERK1/2 activity is required for glucose-dependent transcription from both the full-length rat insulin I promoter and the glucose-sensitive isolated E2A3/4 promoter element in intact islets and β cell lines. Dominant negative ERK2 and MEK inhibitors suppress glucose stimulation of the rat insulin I promoter and the E2A3/4 element. Overexpression of ERK2 is sufficient to stimulate transcription from the E2A3/4 element. The glucose-induced response is dependent upon ERK1/2 phosphorylation of a subset of transcription factors that include Beta2 (also known as NeuroD1) and PDX-1. Phosphorylation increases their functional activity and results in a cumulative transactivation of the promoter. Thus, ERK1/2 act at multiple points to transduce a glucose signal to insulin gene transcription.

Circulating insulin is produced by the β cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans in adult mammals. Insulin regulates glucose metabolism and in turn glucose regulates synthesis and secretion of insulin by the β cells. Insulin synthesis is stimulated by glucose at several steps, including transcription of the insulin gene (1Brunstedt J. Chan S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 2Giddings S.J. Chirgwin J. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 1982; 31: 624-629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nielsen D.A. Welsh M.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, many studies have focused not on regulation of insulin gene transcription but on understanding the translation of its mRNA and its processing to insulin (6Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 7Alarcon C. Wicksteed B. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Rhodes C.J.

Nevertheless, increased initiation of insulin gene transcription occurs within 10 min of an elevation in blood glucose concentration (8Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M.

Thus, insulin gene transcription, which is obviously essential for homeostasis of mRNA stores, is also sensitive to acute stimuli. The organization of the insulin promoter is complex, allowing both tissue-restricted transcription of the insulin gene and levels of control for contextual regulation by nutrients, hormones, neurotransmitters, and other agents (9German M.

MAP kinases, also known as ERKs, are components of highly conserved kinase cascades important for transmitting extracellular information to coordinate cellular responses. MAP kinases have been implicated in many physiological events ranging from cellular proliferation and differentiation to cell survival (reviewed in Refs. 39Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv.

ERK1/2 are activated over the same glucose concentrations, from 2 to 20 mm, as those that elicit insulin secretion. Potentiators of insulin secretion potentiate ERK1/2 activation. Although ERK1/2 are not required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, glucose increased the amount and activity of ERK1/2 in the nucleus of β cells, suggesting that ERK1/2 may regulate gene transcription in these cells (36Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that dominant negative ERK2 and inhibitors of the ERK1/2 activators, the MAP/ERK kinases, MEK1/2, suppress glucose-stimulated transcription of the rat insulin I promoter in INS-1 cells, βTC3 cells, and primary islets. ERK2 stimulates transcription from reporter constructs in the absence of glucose via the glucose-responsive element. This process is activated at least in part because ERK2 phosphorylates bHLH transcription factors, E47/E12 and Beta2, and the homeodomain-containing transcription factor PDX-1. Phosphorylation of Beta2 and PDX-1 regulates their transactivation activities. In addition, phosphorylation of E47/E12 regulates its heterodimerization with Beta2 and subsequent DNA binding. These findings suggest that ERK1/2 are important components of the mechanism of glucose-responsive insulin gene transcription. Isolation of Islets—Islets from male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated as described (41Alarcon C. Leahy J.L. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), incubated in glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer for 2 h, and treated as indicated for 30 min at 37 °C. The islets were lysed in lysis buffer (36Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Northern Analysis—INS-1 cells were cultured as described in Ref. 36Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar. They were infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing either wild type or dominant negative (K52R) ERK2 at a multiplicity of infection of 20 for 48 h. Adenoviruses expressing wild type and K52R ERK2 were constructed as in Ref. 42Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: A161-A189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar. The cells were cultured without glucose for 24 h and then with 20 mm glucose for another 24 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). 10–20 μg of total RNA was separated on a denaturing formaldehyde gel of 1.4% agarose. Prehybridization was at 45 °C for 2 h, and hybridization was performed at 45 °C overnight with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe at 106 cpm/ml. The membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, once in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and twice in 0.2× SSC, 0.1%SDS for 30 min each at 55 °C. The bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Transfection Studies in INS-1 Cells—The rat insulin I promoter (–410/+1 bp) was subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) (pGL3-rINSp) containing a luciferase reporter gene. The minienhancer containing five copies of E2A3/A4 (–247/–198 bp) from the rat insulin I promoter was linked to a minimal rat insulin I promoter upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase reporter gene. INS-1 cells were cultured to a confluency of ∼60–70% and transfected using N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP) Lipofectin (Roche Applied Science). 24 h after transfection of 60-mm dishes with 10 μg of pGL3-rINSp, pCMV5-β-galactosidase, and either pCMV5 ERK2 wild type or K52R, the cells were placed in medium without glucose, or in some cases with 2 mm glucose, for 24 h before adding nothing or 15 mm glucose for 2 h. The lysates were assayed for luciferase (Promega) and β-galactosidase activities. 10 μg each of either rINSp-CAT or E2A3/4-CAT were cotransfected with 10 μg of vector alone, pCMV5 ERK2 K52R, pEF-Ras V12 or A15, or pCMV5 Raf BXB or C4B as described above. CAT assays were as described (43Swantek J.L. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6274-6282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PD98059 (New England Biolabs) and U0126 inhibitors were added to the cells after transfection for 2–24 h. U0126 was generously provided by J. Trzaskos (DuPont-Merck). All of the inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO and used at a final concentration of 10 μm for U0126 and 50 μm for PD98059. 5 μg of E2A3/4-luciferase was cotransfected with 5 μg of pCMV5myc-ERK2-MEK1 or pCMV5myc-ERK2-MEK1LA and 2 μg of CMV-PRL (Renilla luciferase; Promega) into INS-1 cells as above. In these cases, the dual luciferase system (Promega) was used to assay and normalize the luciferase activities. Transfection Studies in Primary Islets—Adult mouse islets were picked by hand from collagenase-digested adult female CD-3 mice and cultured overnight in RPMI medium 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. The islets were transfected using a modification of the adenovirus-assisted transfection technique previously described (16Sander M. Griffen S.C. Huang J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11572-11577Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 100 islets were placed in 12 × 75-mm polystyrene culture tubes and washed three times with 1 ml of OPTI-MEM 1 medium (serum-free; Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA (4 μg) in 0.1 ml of medium was mixed with 4 μg of 25-kDa polyethylenimine (Aldrich) in 50 μl of medium at room temperature for 15 min. Replication-deficient adenovirus 5 dI-342, as previously described (44Curiel D.T. Wagner E. Cotten M. Birnstiel M.L. Agarwal S. Li C.M. Loechel S. Hu P.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1992; 3: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), was adjusted to yield a final concentration of 1011 virus particles/ml. 0.1 ml of the adenovirus was added to the plasmid DNA/polyethylenimine mixture and incubated at room temperature for an additional 5 min. The mixture was added to the islets at 37 °C for 30 min, after which the islets were washed three times with 1 ml of RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C for 36 h. Protein concentration in islet extracts was determined with the NanoOrange Protein Quantification Assay (Molecular Probes). Approximately 2 μg of the protein extract were assayed for CAT activity (45Karlsson O. Edlund L. Moss J.B. Rutter W. Walker M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Expression of Bacterial His6-tagged Recombinant Proteins—The cDNAs encoding hamster E47 (the hamster protein is usually called Pan1), mouse Beta2 (also known as NeuroD1), hamster PDX-1 (PDX-1 is also known as IPF-1, IDX-1, and STF-1), and hamster Lmx1.1 (46Johnson J.D.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pRSET-His6 (Invitrogen). His6-tagged proteins were purified as described (48Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was carried out to confirm that the desired proteins were purified. Goat polyclonal antibodies recognizing Beta2 (N-19 and G-20) were from Santa Cruz. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against E47, PDX-1, and Lmx1.1 were as described (16Sander M. Griffen S.C. Huang J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11572-11577Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Kinase Assays and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—In vitro kinase assays were performed with purified active ERK2, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK) α (also called c-Jun N-terminal kinase), or p38α MAP kinases (49Khokhlatchev A. Xu S. English J. Wu P. Schaefer E. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11057-11062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) in 30 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP ([γ-32P]ATP; 5–15 cpm/fmol) with the active kinase and substrates at 30 °C for 30 min. The samples were analyzed on polyacrylamide gels in SDS that were either stained in Coomassie Blue before autoradiography or transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described (50Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Transactivation Assays—Wild type and the triple phosphorylation mutant of human E12 AD2 were subcloned into pM (SV40 promoter) to make GAL4-DNA-binding fusion proteins. Wild type and mutated forms of Beta2 (156–355) and PDX-1 (1–149) were subcloned into pGAL4 (CMV promoter) and cotransfected with GAL4-binding domains linked to a luciferase reporter gene (G5E1bLuc) with the CMV promoter-driven Renilla luciferase gene (CMV-PRL; Promega) into βTC3 cells using the SuperFect transfection system (Qiagen). The cells were harvested 48 h later. The cells were exposed to PD98059 and SB203580 for 24 h as indicated. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded probes corresponded to B247 CTTCATCAGGCCATCTGGCCCCT (Far wild type) and B247 CCTCATCAGGCCCTAGTGCCCCT (Far mutant) in the rat insulin I promoter. Single-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with a 5× excess of unlabeled antisense oligonucleotides to create double-stranded, labeled probes. The probes were purified on P6 Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad). The binding reaction contained 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% Ficoll, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml double-stranded poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 10,000 cpm of labeled probe in 20 μl. Recombinant proteins (10–20 ng) were either phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro or mock phosphorylated (no ERK2). For supershift assays, either 1 μl of rabbit polyclonal E47 antibody or 2 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz) was used. The samples were analyzed on 4% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (39:1) nondenaturing gels in 1/2× TBE. Recombinant Retroviruses—Recombinant retroviruses expressing Myc-tagged wild type and S274A Beta2 (91–355) were made as described in Ref. 51Therrien M. Chang H.C. Solomon N.M. Karim F.D. Wassarman D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar. The cDNAs were subcloned into pBabe-Puromycin and then transfected into the amphotropic packaging cell line using the CellPhect transfection kit in 100-mm dishes (Amersham Biosciences). After 48 h, media containing recombinant retroviruses were harvested and filtered through 0.45-μm filters. An infection mixture of 3 ml of recombinant retrovirus supernatant and 2 ml of INS-1 growth medium plus polybrene (Sigma) (final concentration, 4 μg/ml) was used to infect INS-1 cells. After 6 h, 5 ml of INS-1 medium was added for 72 h. 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) was added to select cells expressing recombinant retroviruses for 3–5 days. Miscellaneous Materials and Methods—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the Stratagene QuikChange kit. Unless otherwise indicated, the protein concentrations were measured using BCA reagent (Pierce) with albumin as standard. Bacterial expression vectors encoding GST-c-Jun (1–221) and GST-ATF (1–254) were kindly provided by Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego).

The glucokinase promoter (–280/+4 bp) was generously provided by Mark Magnuson (Vanderbilt University). Glucose Activates ERK1/2 in Primary Islets of Langerhans—In previous studies, we showed that glucose activated ERK1/2 in INS-1 insulinoma cells (36Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Stimulation was observed in cells preincubated without glucose and in cells preincubated in 3 mm glucose. Before examining effects of ERK1/2 on insulin gene transcription, we first examined the effect of glucose on the activity of ERK1/2 in primary islets and in another glucose-sensitive cell line βTC3. Intact islets were preincubated in the absence of glucose for 2 h. Under these conditions, small amounts of activated ERK1/2 were detected using antibodies that selectively recognize the phosphorylated forms of the kinases. This is consistent with studies in INS-1 cells; in these cells complete inactivation of ERK1/2 by removing glucose required from 1 to 4 h. In isolated islets, increasing the glucose concentration to 15 mm caused a marked activation of ERK1/2, which is potentiated by forskolin (Fig. 1A). Similar findings were observed in βTC3 cells, except that ERK1/2 were activated at the lowest glucose concentration tested, consistent with the left shift in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in these cells (Fig. 1B). ERK1/2 Regulate Proinsulin mRNA Levels in Pancreatic β Cells—To determine whether ERK1/2 regulate insulin gene transcription, we first measured the effect of blocking ERK1/2 on insulin mRNA content in INS-1 cells. Wild type or dominant negative (kinase inactive) K52R ERK2 were expressed from adenoviruses in INS-1 cells, and the insulin mRNA content was measured by Northern analysis. K52R ERK2 caused a small but significant reduction in the amount of insulin mRNA after 24 h (Fig. 1C). However, no glucose-stimulated increase in insulin mRNA was observed in these cells, which is most likely due to the high stability and low turnover rate of insulin mRNA in INS-1 cells. ERK1/2 Regulate Transcription from the Rat Insulin I Promoter in β Cells—Depression of insulin mRNA levels by K52R ERK2 could be through an effect on the stability of insulin mRNA or on the initiation of insulin gene transcription. To determine whether there were effects on transcription, we measured glucose-dependent changes in the expression of a reporter gene coupled to the rat insulin I promoter (–410/+1 bp) with and without blockade of ERK1/2 activity. K52R ERK2 blocked glucose-stimulated transcription from the promoter (Fig. 2A). Neither the CMV nor the glucokinase promoter (52Liang Y. Jetton T.L. Zimmerman E.C. Najafi H. Berner D.K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was substantially affected by K52R ERK2 (data not shown). PD98059 and U0126, two chemically distinct inhibitors of MEK1/2, blocked glucose activation of ERK1/2 in INS-1 cells and suppressed glucose-stimulated rat insulin I promoter activity (Ref. 36Khoo S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5599-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar and Fig. 2, B and C). These observations are consistent with the results obtained with K52R ERK2, suggesting that ERK1/2 regulate rat insulin I transcriptional activity in INS-1 cells. To demonstrate a regulatory role of ERK1/2 in insulin gene transcription in islets, the ability of K52R ERK2 to affect transcription from a rat insulin I promoter construct was tested in freshly isolated adult rat islets. In these experiments the unstimulated condition was 2 mm glucose. The stimulation of transcription from the rat insulin I promoter induced by 16 mm glucose was strongly inhibited by K52R ERK2 (Fig. 2, B and C). Glucose-stimulated transcription from the promoter in rat islets was also suppressed by PD98059 (Fig. 2, B and C). These results support findings in rat insulinoma INS-1 cells suggesting that ERK1/2 are important regulators of insulin gene transcription in pancreatic β cells. ERK1/2 Regulate Insulin Gene Transcription via a Glucose-responsive Element—To determine the portion of the rat insulin promoter that is regulated by ERK1/2, we first examined the effects of blocking ERK1/2 on a well described glucose-responsive element E2A3/4 (–247/–198 bp). K52R ERK2 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 each suppressed the glucose-dependent transcriptional activity of E2A3/4 in INS-1 cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that regulation of insulin promoter activity by ERK1/2 occurs at least in part through this glucose-responsive portion of the promoter. Similar results were also found in βTC3 cells (not shown). We also determined whether ERK1/2 regulate insulin gene transcription via the glucose-sensitive element in primary m"
https://openalex.org/W2122362673,"Full-length cDNA coding for dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) has been cloned and sequenced, but the corresponding complete protein has not been isolated. In searching for naturally occurring DMP1, we recently discovered that the extracellular matrix of bone contains fragments originating from DMP1. Shortened forms of DMP1, termed 37K and 57K fragments, were treated with alkaline phosphatase and then digested with trypsin. The resultant peptides were purified by a two-dimensional method: size exclusion followed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Purified peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry, and the sequences compared with the DMP1 sequence predicted from cDNA. Extensive sequencing of tryptic peptides revealed that the 37K fragments originated from the NH2-terminal region, and the 57K fragments were from the COOH-terminal part of DMP1. Phosphate analysis indicated that the 37K fragments contained 12 phosphates, and the 57K fragments had 41. From 37K fragments, two peptides lacked a COOH-terminal lysine or arginine; instead they ended at Phe173 and Ser180 and were thus COOH termini of 37K fragments. Two peptides were from the NH2 termini of 57K fragments, starting at Asp218 and Asp222. These findings indicated that DMP1 is proteolytically cleaved at four bonds, Phe173–Asp174, Ser180–Asp181, Ser217–Asp218, and Gln221–Asp222, forming eight fragments. The uniformity of cleavages at the NH2-terminal peptide bonds of aspartyl residues suggests that a single proteinase is involved. Based on its reported specificity, we hypothesize that these scissions are catalyzed by PHEX protein. We envision that the proteolytic processing of DMP1 plays a crucial role during osteogenesis and dentinogenesis.

Based on its reported specificity, we hypothesize that these scissions are catalyzed by PHEX protein. We envision that the proteolytic processing of DMP1 plays a crucial role during osteogenesis and dentinogenesis. During osteogenesis and dentinogenesis, osteoblasts and odontoblasts secrete a unique set of noncollagenous proteins into their extracellular matrices (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BSP, bone sialoprotein; OPN, osteopontin; DSPP, dentin sialophosphoprotein; DMP1, dentin matrix protein 1; DSP, dentin sialoprotein; DPP, dentin phosphoprotein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. One category of non-collagenous proteins is termed the SIBLING family and includes bone sialoprotein (BSP), osteopontin (OPN), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1), and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (1Fisher L.W. Torchia D.A. Fohr B. Young M.F. Fedarko N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). These SIBLING family members share some common features such as the presence of relatively large amounts of sialic acid, phosphate, and the RGD cell-binding sequence as well as similarities in genomic organization and chromosomal localizations (1Fisher L.W.

These proteins are very acidic and are secreted into the ECM during the formation and mineralization of these tissues; it is generally accepted that they play key biological roles in the formation of bone and dentin (3Butler W.T.

In contrast, there is a lack of information about the characteristics and functions of naturally occurring DMP1 with complete structures (primary sequence with posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation). DMP1, first identified by cDNA cloning using a rat odontoblast mRNA library, is a very acidic phosphoprotein (10George A. Sabsay B. Simonlan P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was originally postulated to be dentin-specific, but later its expression was observed in bone and brain (11MacDougall M.

Evol. 2000; 50: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The characteristic feature of DMP1 is that it contains an unusually large number of acidic domains, a property that implicates it as a possible participant in regulating matrix mineralization (10George A. Sabsay B. Simonlan P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Thotakura S.R. Karthikeyan N. Smith T. Liu K. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10272-10277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using an antibody monospecific to recombinant rat DMP1 to perform Western immunoblotting, George et al. (10George A. Sabsay B. Simonlan P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detected a band at a molecular mass of 61 kDa on SDS-PAGE of dentin extracts and concluded that this 61-kDa band was a full-length DMP1. Later, Srinivasan et al. (18Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) from the same group reported that the molecular mass of recombinant rat DMP1, determined by SDS-PAGE, was ∼90–95 kDa, higher than that of the naturally occurring 61-kDa form of DMP1. According to the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence, more than 55 of the 107 serine residues in the secreted rat DMP1 could be phosphorylated (10George A. Sabsay B. Simonlan P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, 10 threonine residues were potential phosphorylation sites for casein kinase I and II. Thus, the native form of DMP1 with posttranslational modifications would be expected to be larger than the recombinant protein. This discrepancy relative to the experimentally determined molecular masses remains unresolved. Recombinant DMP1 has been synthesized and used for functional studies (19Kulkarni G.V. Chen B. Malone J.P. Narayanan A.S. George A. Arch. Oral Biol. 2000; 45: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although the use of recombinant DMP1 produced in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells may provide significant clues about its biological functions, conclusions drawn from such studies may not fully reflect its actual role in vivo. One of the major shortcomings relative to recombinant protein is a variation in posttranslational modifications such as proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, and glycosylation. Although recombinant DMP1 can be posttranslationally modified by eukaryotic cell lines, these cells do not provide a microenvironment that exactly mimics the biosynthetic and transport environments in bone or dentin cells. Hence, there is a necessity for isolating DMP1 from bone or dentin, fully characterizing it, and performing functional studies. In searching for naturally occurring forms of DMP1 in bone and dentin, we discovered two clusters of proteins (37K and 57K fragments) that we speculated were fragments of DMP1 because we cleaved the mixture with trypsin and obtained sequences originating from DMP1 (21Safran J.B. Butler W.T. Farach-Carson M.C. Goldberg M. Boskey A. Robinson C. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissue. American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Rosemont, IL1998: 113-116Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to isolate and characterize these fragments and, in particular, to identify the cleavage site(s) at which DMP1 is proteolytically processed. Isolation of 37K and 57K Fragments—ECM proteins were extracted from rat long bone by standard procedures as described (5Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Butler W.T. Tomana M. Bhown A.S. Bhown M. Schrohenloher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Butler W.T. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 255: 290-303Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The extracts were first subjected to gel chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences) to separate the high molecular mass protein fraction from smaller-sized proteins; the latter eluted in an included volume. With DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Biosciences) ion-exchange chromatography, the high molecular mass protein fraction was next separated into seven major fractions that were named D1, D2, D3, D4a, D4b, D5a, and D5b, corresponding to the elution gradient ranging from 0 to 0.53 m NaCl (2Qin C. Brunn J.C. Jones J. George A. Ramachandran A. Gorski J.P. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Prince C.W. Oosawa T. Butler W.T. Tomana M. Bhown A.S. Bhown M. Schrohenloher R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2900-2907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In D4b, fragments of DMP1 (namely 37K and 57K) co-eluted with BSP and OPN (see Fig. 1A). Fraction D4b was further divided into five subfractions (2Qin C. Brunn J.C. Jones J. George A. Ramachandran A. Gorski J.P. Butler W.T. Eur. J. Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For purification of 37K fragments, subfractions mostly rich in this protein were passed over a Bio-Gel A15m column (Bio-Rad). This step eliminated OPN and partially removed BSP and 57K fragments. Finally, the fractions enriched in 37K fragments from Bio-Gel A15m chromatography were passed over a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Thus, a sample for 37K fragments of relatively high purity was obtained (see Fig. 1B). For the purification of 57K fragments, subfractions rich in this protein were first passed over a Bio-Gel A15m column, and then the fractions enriched in 57K fragments were passed over a Bio-Gel A50m column (Bio-Rad). By this combination, we obtained a preparation of 57K fragments (see Fig. 1C) derived exclusively from the COOH terminus of DMP1 (see below). Please note that the continual presence of either 4 m guanidium HCl or 6 m urea in each step of the preparative procedures prevented artifactual degradation of proteins. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment and Trypsin Digestion—Prior to trypsin digestion, 37K and 57K fragments were dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) attached to 150-μm oxirane-activated macroporous acrylic beads. 400 μg of 37K and 57K fragments, respectively, were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in the presence of 4 units of alkaline phosphatase in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (total volume, 0.5 ml). Following dephosphorylation, the proteins were digested overnight at 37 °C with trypsin (Roche Applied Science) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (by weight) in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (total volume, 0.5 ml). The final concentration of trypsin was 16 μg/ml. Prior to the addition of trypsin, the chymotrypsin inhibitor tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (Roche Applied Science) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml to inhibit possible chymotrypsin activity. Peptide Purification—Following trypsin digestion, direct separation of peptides by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gave rise to a large number of overlapping peptide peaks; our past experience has shown that this level of separation does not yield optimal data for structure determinations. Therefore, the peptides were separated using a two-dimensional approach to produce a series of pure peptides for unambiguous characterization. In the first phase, the peptides were separated according to size on Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated and eluted at 0.5 ml/min in 4 m guanidium HCl (SigmaUltra, pH 6.0). Using fast protein liquid chromatography, the eluant was monitored at 280 nm. The 30-ml elution volume was collected as sixty 0.5-ml fractions. Tryptic peptides from 37K and 57K fragments eluted in a volume of 10–17 ml. Fractions containing peptides ranging in size from 4 amino acids (fraction 32) to 50 amino acids (fraction 22) were selected for a second phase HPLC separation. Each selected fraction was subjected to HPLC using a 2.1 × 250 mm C18 reversed-phase column (Vydac). After applying the sample, the column was washed with water (0% acetonitrile) for 20 min before starting a 0–35% acetonitrile linear gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (100 min at a flow rate of 300 μl/min). For all HPLC separations, the eluant was monitored at 218 nm, and the peaks were collected manually. Sequence Analysis and Determination of Mass—Most purified peptides from HPLC were first sequenced by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems ABI Procise 492cLC or 477A Sequencer using standard techniques. Next, those that could not be fully sequenced by Edman degradation were further analyzed for molecular mass and sequence by mass spectrometry (MS). For MS, the samples were dried under vacuum and redissolved in aqueous solution containing ∼50% methanol and 1% formic acid. Aliquots of the solutions were deposited either in metal-coated glass nanoelectrospray capillary tubes for analysis on a PerkinElmer Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Concord, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a Protana nanoelectrospray source (Odense, Denmark) or directly to the target of the ABI Voyager-DE STR (Foster City, CA) and 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 μg/μl) laser desorption time of flight analysis. The samples were analyzed by one or more of the following procedures. For determination of peptide molecular mass, full scan mass spectra were recorded utilizing either Q1 as the resolving analyzer in positive ion mode on the triple quadrupole instrument or by time of flight in the positive ion reflectron mode of analysis. Product ion spectra were acquired utilizing Q1 to transmit the precursor ion of interest to the radio frequency-only collision cell Q2 under collisionally activated decomposition conditions. Nitrogen was the collision gas, and collision energies in the range of 20–50 eV product ions were analyzed using Q3 to determine the peptide sequence Prediction of Secondary Structure for Amino Acid Sequences of DMP 1—Using the Lasergene sequence analysis software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI), followed by molecular modeling and energy minimization (Consistent Valence Force Field) with Accelrys software (San Diego, CA) on an SGI work station (Silicon Graphics Inc.), secondary structure predictions were made on four segments of DMP1 sequences. Each sequence contained 20 amino acids from selected regions (ESSHGDGSEFDDEGMQSDDP, SEFDDEGMQSDDPGSTRSDR sequences around the two identified COOH termini of 37K fragments and DHEPTSTQDSDDSQDVEFSS, TSTQDSDDSQDVEFSSRKSF around the two identified NH2 termini of 57K, see below). Chou-Fasman, Garnier-Robson, Eisenberg, and Karplus-Shulz algorithm predictive results were used to make models that were minimized using conjugate gradient iterations until the root mean square deviation was below 0.0001. The results were displayed with Insight II (2000, Accelyrs), and the secondary structure render Kabsch-Sandler algorithm was utilized. Amino Acid and Phosphate Analysis—For amino acid analysis, aliquots from samples of 37K and 57K fragments in water were dried, hydrolyzed by HCl gas (6 m HCl), and analyzed with an ABI 420A amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems). For each sample, three amino acid analyses were performed, and the average values were calculated. For phosphate analysis, aliquots of the 37K and 57K fragment solutions used for amino acid analysis were hydrolyzed in 0.2 m NaOH at 37 °C overnight. Concentrations of inorganic phosphate were measured (23Veldhoven P.P.V. Mannaerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). For each sample, three independent values were obtained and averaged for calculating the phosphate contents of 37K and 57K fragments. Based on amino acid analysis, the molar concentrations of phosphate for each sample were determined, and these values were then used to calculate the number of phosphates/mol. The following section is organized in a systematic manner designed to help the reader to more easily comprehend our findings and the scientific implications. Thus, the presentation of the results begins with isolation and characterization of fragments, gives analytical results for all the tryptic peptides, and leads to the summation of the major conclusions about the sites of proteolytic processing. Isolation of 37K and 57K Fragments—The purity of the 37K and 57K fragments was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Stains-All staining. As shown in Fig. 1B, the 37K fragments gave rise to a cluster of bands migrating between ∼29 and ∼37 kDa on 5–15% SDS-PAGE. On 7.5% SDS-PAGE, the major band of this set migrated at 37 kDa (hence named 37K fragments). On 5–15% SDS-PAGE, the 57K fragments gave rise to a cluster of bands migrating between ∼45 and ∼60 kDa (Fig. 1C). On 7.5% SDS-PAGE, the major band of this sample migrated at 57 kDa (hence designated 57K fragments). Despite the apparent heterogeneity, we concluded that both sets of protein fragments were derived from DMP1 as evidenced by the following. Amino acid sequencing (see below) of the tryptic peptides from each showed that every peptide we obtained was solely derived from DMP1. Some minor peptides from trypsin itself were also detected, but we found no evidence for the presence of tryptic peptides from any contaminating proteins. Note that only 2% of the total protein was trypsin. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), both 37K and 57K fragments displayed relatively broad clusters of protein bands on SDS-PAGE. To examine whether the apparent heterogeneity in migration rate is due to variations in phosphorylation, we performed experiments to compare the migration rates of dephosphorylated 37K and 57K fragments with those of the non-dephosphorylated. Although the dephosphorylated 37K and 57K fragments displayed migration rates slightly slower than the nondephosphorylated (data not shown), the observed heterogeneity in migration rate remained the same before and after dephosphorylation. These results indicated that this heterogeneity in migration rate was not caused by difference in phosphorylation level. We speculate that this apparent heterogeneity in migration rate within the cluster of 37K or 57K fragments may be due to the differences in fragment length and/or glycosylation level. Separation of Tryptic Peptides Derived from 37K and 57K Fragments—When we first used trypsin to digest 37K and 57K fragments without dephosphorylation, only a few peptides were obtained in very low amounts. Realizing that a majority of trypsin cleavage sites might be blocked by protein-bound phosphate, we then used alkaline phosphatase to remove phosphates prior to trypsin digestion. This significantly increased the level of cleavage, allowing a thorough analysis of a number of pure peptides from the 37K and 57K fragments. Examples of HPLC separation of tryptic peptides derived from 37K and 57K fragments are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. For both 37K and 57K fragments, we performed HPLC separations on Superdex 75 fractions 22–32. These 11 Superdex fractions included peptides ranging in size from 4 to 50 amino acids.Fig. 3Examples of HPLC separation of tryptic peptides from 57K fragments. A, separation of fraction 29. Peak 3 was one of the NH2-terminal peptides obtained in this study, 218DDSQDVEFSSR228.A dot under Asp218 indicates the modification of Asp by a 43-Da carbamoyl group.

Fig. 2B is an HPLC chromatogram of Superdex fraction 26 from 37K fragments. Curiously, peaks 4 and 5 showed exactly the same sequence, 157VGGGSEGESSHGDGSEFDDEGMQS180 (a COOHterminal sequence from the 37K fragments). Fig. 3A shows an HPLC separation of tryptic peptides in Superdex fraction 29, in which peak 3 represents an NH2-terminal peptide of 57K fragments (residues 218–228). The peptides in both peaks 2 and 4 of Fig. 3A had sequences from residues 252–262 of DMP1, except that they differed in one residue. From peak 4, we obtained the sequence 252ETQSVSTEDFR262, in agreement with the cDNA-deduced sequence. The sequence for peak 2 was 252ETQSDSTEDFR262. This single difference of Asp256 in place of Val256 probably represents an allelic variant. We also found two 57K fragment peptides (Fig. 3B, peaks 5 and 6) that gave identical sequences: 450KLIVDAYHNKPIGDQDDNDCQDGY473 derived from the COOH terminus of DMP1. Please note that Lys450 was modified by a 43-Da carbamoyl group, a substance resulting from the reaction of the epsilon-amino group with cyanate, present in urea (24Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S.

Structures of Tryptic Peptides Derived from 37K and 57K Fragments— Fig. 4A is the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence of rat DMP1 NH2-terminal region (10George A. Sabsay B. Simonlan P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acids are numbered from the NH2 terminus of DMP1, excluding the 16-amino acid signal peptide. Fig. 4B is a summary of tryptic peptides derived from 37K fragments, sequenced in this study. Totally, we sequenced 12 peptides covering 154 amino acid residues; all originated from the NH2-terminal region of DMP1. The sequences were determined by either Edman degradation or MS or by both. Please note that in peptide 1LPVAR5, the NH2-terminal residue Leu1 was modified by a 43-Da carbamoyl group (24Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 904-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); this peptide could only be sequenced by MS because its NH2 terminus was blocked. Among the 12 peptides sequenced, two (peptides 9 and 10) represent the COOH-terminal region of 37K fragments (see below), ending at Phe173 and Ser180, respectively. Fig. 5A shows the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence of rat DMP1 COOH-terminal region (10George A. Sabsay B. Simonlan P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acids are numbered as described above. Fig. 5B is a summary of tryptic peptides derived from 57K fragments, analyzed in this study. Totally, we sequenced 15 tryptic peptides covering 146 residues; all originated from the COOH-terminal region of DMP1. Two of the 15 peptides (peptides 4 and 5) represent NH2-terminal regions of 57K fragments (see below), beginning at Asp218 and Asp222; they could not be sequenced by Edman degradation because the two NH2-terminal residues were modified by the 43-Da carbamoyl moiety (24Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 904-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Identification of COOH Termini of 37K Fragments—The identification of COOH-terminal peptides from 37K fragments, resulting from trypsin digestion, was made by searching for peptides with a COOH-terminal amino acid other than lysine or arginine. For a complete search, we sequenced all the major HPLC peaks containing peptides ranging in size from 4 to 50 amino acids (Superdex fractions 22–32). We identified two tryptic peptides from the COOH termini of 37K fragments (Fig. 4B, peptides 9 and 10): 157VGGGSEGESSHGDGSEF173 and 157VGGGSEGESSHGDGSEFDDEGMQS180. These two peptides were first partially sequenced by Edman degradation and then fully analyzed by MS. The presence of these two residues, Phe173 and Ser180 at the end of 37K fragments, along with comparison with the cDNA-deduced sequence (Fig. 4A), indicated that peptide bonds Phe173–Asp174 and Ser180–Asp181 were cleaved (discussed below). We also found one peptide that contained uncleaved Phe173–Asp174 and Ser180–Asp181 bonds; peptide 11 (Fig. 4B) was 157VGGGSEGESSHGDGSEFDDEGMQSDDPGSTR187. Another tryptic peptide (Fig. 4B, peptide 12) gave the sequence 195MSSAGIR201 that was also beyond the COOH termini of 37K fragments described above. After sequencing all the major HPLC peaks containing peptides ranging from 4 to 50 amino acids, we did not detect any additional COOH-terminal peptides. Identification of NH2 Termini of 57K Fragments—NH2-terminal tryptic peptides from 57K fragments were identified by searching for peptides with an NH2-terminal amino acid not preceded by lysine or arginine (as indicated from the cDNA-deduced amino acid sequence). We identified two peptides from the NH2 termini of 57K fragments, 218DDSQDVEFSSR228 and 222DVEFSSR228 (Fig. 5B, peptides 4 and 5). In fact, the observation that Asp218 and Asp222 were modified by the 43-Da carbamoyl groups resulting from the reaction of the amino groups with cyanates in urea (24Qin C. Cook R.G. Orkiszewski R.S.

Studies in rodents and population surveys of human apoA-V polymorphisms have noted a strong effect of apoA-V on plasma triglyceride levels. Toward the elucidation of the biologic function of apoA-V, we used spectroscopic and surface chemistry techniques to probe its structure and interfacial activity. Computer-assisted sequence analysis of apoA-V predicts that it is very hydrophobic, contains a significant amount of α-helical secondary structure, and probably is composed of discrete structural regions with varying degrees of lipid affinity. Fluorescence spectroscopy of recombinant human apoA-V provided evidence of tertiary folding, and light scattering studies indicated that apoA-V transforms dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles into discoidal complexes with an efficiency similar to that of apoA-I. Surface chemistry techniques revealed that apoA-V displays high affinity, low elasticity, and slow binding kinetics at hydrophobic interfaces, properties we propose may retard triglyceride-rich particle assembly. Metabolic labeling and immunofluorescence studies of COS-1 cells transfected with human apoA-V demonstrated that apoA-V is poorly secreted, remains associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and does not traffic to the Golgi. Given that overexpression of the apoA-V gene lowers plasma triglycerides in mice, these data together suggest that apoA-V may function intracellularly to modulate hepatic VLDL synthesis and/or secretion.

Lipoprotein metabolism is regulated by the plasma apolipoproteins, a family of surface-active lipid binding proteins. The smaller, exchangeable members of this family evolved from a single primordial gene to control various processes in intravascular lipid transport (1Luo C.C. Li W.H. Moore M.N. Chan L. J. Mol.

ApoA-V is the most recently described member of the plasma apolipoprotein family. Unlike all other apolipoproteins, which were identified in human plasma, apoA-V was discovered by comparative sequence analysis of the human and murine genomes as a gene on chromosome 11, downstream of the A-I/CIII/A-IV gene cluster, displaying homology to apoA-IV (3Pennacchio L.A.

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the apoA-V gene have been identified and shown to constitute three distinct haplotypes, two of which exhibit a very strong association with elevated fasting VLDL triglycerides in several populations (6Pennacchio L.A.

Interestingly, the apoA-V gene is expressed only the liver, and its plasma concentration is very low, less than 0.1% of that of apoA-I (4van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H.

Thus, it is possible that apoA-V affects plasma triglyceride levels by modulating hepatic VLDL assembly and secretion, rather than the intravascular metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Over the past 3 decades, structure-function studies have been instrumental in elucidating the biologic function of the plasma apolipoproteins and the mechanisms by which they control lipid metabolism (10Mahley R.W. Innerarity T.L. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1277-1294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now, in the genomics era, a new apolipoprotein, apoA-V, has been discovered by computational methods, and its physiological effects have been explored in transgenic animals and with population genetic approaches. However, the apoA-V protein itself has not been isolated, and little is known about its biochemical and biophysical properties. Given the strong association of plasma triglycerides and the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (11Hodis H.N. Mack W.J. Krauss R.M. Alaupovic P. Clin. Cardiol. 1999; 22: 15-20Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we used computational, spectroscopic, and surface chemistry techniques to investigate the structure, lipid binding, and interfacial behavior of recombinant human apoA-V. Lipids—EPC, DMPC, and triolein were purchased from Sigma. EPC was diluted to 0.1 mg/ml in high performance liquid chromatography grade CHCl3 (Aldrich) and stored under nitrogen at –20 °C. Phospholipid concentration was determined by phosphorous analysis (12Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Apolipoproteins—Recombinant human apoA-V was expressed in E. coli and purified as described. 2Beckstead, J. A., Oda, M. N., Martin, D. D. O., Forte, T. M., Bielicki, J. K., Berger, T., Luty, R., Kay, C. M., and Ryan, R. O. (2003) Biochemistry, in press. A 17-amino acid MHHHHHHGLVPRGSIDA tag was appended to the N terminus to facilitate purification by nickel affinity chromatography. Human apoA-IV was isolated from donors with the A-IV-1/1 genotype (14Weinberg R.B. Hopkins R.A. Jones J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 263: 282-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human apoA-I was isolated from high density lipoproteins (15Shore B. Shore V. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) or produced in E. coli (16Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with bicinchoninic acid (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18503) Google Scholar). All apolipoproteins were homogeneous by SDS-PAGE. Computational Analysis of Apolipoprotein A-V Structure—The amino acid sequence of mature human apoA-V (NCBI entry AAF25662) was subjected to computational analysis. Mean residue hydrophobicity, 〈H〉, and mean residue helical hydrophobic moment, 〈μ〉, were calculated using a consensus hydrophobicity scale (18Eisenberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 595-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Residue hydrophobicity plots were smoothed using a median filter (19Weinberg R.B. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2212-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secondary structure was computed using the Chou-Fasman, Garnier, NNSSP, Predator, and PHD programs available on the World Wide Web from www.expasy.org. Amphipathic structure was analyzed by Fourier transformation of mean residue helical hydrophobic moment versus reside rotation angle along the protein sequence (20Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Amino acid variability among the human, rat, and mouse apoA-V sequences was analyzed using a substitution matrix-median filter algorithm (19Weinberg R.B. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2212-2222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence studies were performed on an SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer (21Weinberg R.B. Jordan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectra of apoA-V in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.0, were recorded at 25 °C using a 1-cm cell with excitation at 280 nm, 1-s integration, and 4-nm slits for both monochromators. Quenching studies were performed by the addition of citrate-buffered 6 m KI. Stern-Volmer quenching constants, Kq, were obtained from plots of Io /I versus [KI]; fractional tryptophan exposure was calculated as Kq(apoA-V)/Kq(N-acetyltryptophanamide). The excitation wavelength dependence of tryptophan emission anisotropy was determined with the instrument in T-format, monochromator A set at 370 nm with 8-nm slits, and a Corning 370-nm bandpass filter on monochromator B (22Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Activity of ApoA-V at the Phospholipid/Water Interface—Adsorption of apoA-V to the phospholipid/water interface was examined using a KSV 5000 Langmuir film balance (KSV Instruments, Helsinki, Finland) (23Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Weinberg R.B. Anderson R.A. Cook V.R. Emmanuel F. Denefle P. Tall A.R Steinmetz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21549-21553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). EPC monolayers were spread over 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 3.0. Surface pressure (Π) was measured with a Wilhelmy plate with a precision of ± 0.1 mN/meter. Increasing amounts of apoA-V in 10 mm citrate, pH 3.0, 0.05% sodium azide, 1.5 m guanidine HCl were injected into the subphase under EPC monolayers spread at 10 mN/meter, and adsorption to the interface was followed by monitoring the change in surface pressure. Dissociation constants were calculated by sigmoidal curve fitting (Sigma Plot version 5.00, SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). The interfacial exclusion pressure of apoA-V was determined by injecting a saturating concentration of apoA-V under EPC monolayers spread at 5–30 mN/meter (Π i). Light Scattering Studies—Large unilamellar DMPC vesicles were prepared by extrusion (25Weers P.M.M. Narayanaswami V. Kay C.M. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21804-21810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Solutions of 500 μg of DMPC vesicles in 50 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, were incubated at 24 °C in the absence or presence of 200 μg of apoA-V or apoA-I, and the kinetics of apolipoprotein-induced vesicle solubilization were determined by monitoring the change in light scattering (26Pownall H.J. Massey J.B. Kusserow S.K. Gotto A.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) using a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer with both excitation and emission monochromators set at 580 nm (3.5-nm slit widths). Data presented for each apolipoprotein are the normalized means of two separate experiments. Dynamic Interfacial Behavior of ApoA-V at the Air/Water Interface— Dynamic interfacial behavior of apoA-V at the air/water interface was examined with a pulsating bubble surfactometer (Electronetics, Amherst, NY) (27Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies were conducted at 25 °C with a solution of apoA-V at 1.4 mg/ml in 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 3.0. Surface area (A)-tension (γ) loops were recorded at 5–80 cycles/min. Absolute elasticity (ϵ) was calculated as Δγ/(ΔA/A), and the viscoelastic component (ϵ v) was calculated as ϵ sin(ϕ), where ϕ is the phase angle of the γ-A loops. Dynamic Interfacial Behavior of ApoA-V at the Oil/Water Interface— The binding kinetics of apoA-V at the oil/water interface were examined using a Tracker® automatic tensiometer (IT Concepts, France) (28Labourdenne S. Gaudry-Rolland N. Letellier S. Lin M. Cagna A. Esposito G. Verger R. Riviere C. Chem. Phys. Lipid. 1994; 71: 163-173Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Drops of pure triolein were injected into a sample chamber containing 25 μg/ml apolipoproteins in buffered solution, and protein adsorption to the drop was monitored as the time-dependent decrease in interfacial tension (γ). Adsorption rate constants were calculated by fitting γ versus time data to the Langmuir adsorption equation, γ(t) = γ E exp[A exp(–kt)] (29Xu Y. Energy Fuels. 1995; 9: 148-154Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Intracellular Secretory Trafficking of ApoA-V—Human apoA-V and two control secretory proteins, HSA and apoB6.6F (amino acids 1–300 of apoB with C-terminal FLAG epitope) were transfected into COS-1 cells using FuGene 6 (30Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later, cells were trypsinized and replated into two sets of dishes. Cells in the first set of dishes were metabolically radiolabeled with 35S-labeled Met and Cys for 3 h, followed by immunoprecipitation of media and lysates with rabbit anti-HSA (Roche Applied Science), goat anti-human apoB (Academy Bioscience), or goat anti-human apoA-V.2 Immune complexes were recovered with protein G-Sepharose, fractionated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography (31Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in the second set of dishes were fixed with formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibodies at the following dilutions: goat antiapoA-V antiserum, 1:300; goat anti-human apoB, 1:400; rabbit anti-HSA, 1:400. Cells were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. Cells were postfixed, mounted in 90% glycerol, and viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a × 63 oil objective. Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiocam with a gain setting of 3. Computational Analysis of Apolipoprotein A-V Structure— The calculated molecular mass of human apoA-V was 38,905 Da. The calculated pI values of native and His-tagged recombinant apoA-V are 5.99 and 6.20, respectively. Human apoA-V has four tryptophan residues (at positions 5, 97, 147, and 325), five tyrosine residues (at positions 7, 87, 109, 171, and 270), and a single cysteine at position 204. There are no predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in human apoA-V. All structural analysis programs utilized predicted that apoA-V is a highly α-helical protein, with the following percentages of α-helical structure: Chou-Fasman, 73%; Garnier, 47%; NNSSP, 76%; Predator, 61%; PHD, 83% (Fig. 1A). All programs also predicted a break in α-helical structure between residues 10 and 13, 191 and 194, 240 and 249, and 293 and 299, and all but PHD predicted breaks between residues 54 and 62 and 158 and 162. A prominent feature of apoA-V is that most of these intervals are punctuated by multiple proline residues, including a unique tetraproline sequence at residues 293–296. Calculation of mean residue hydrophobicity indicates apoA-V is more hydrophobic than either apoA-I or apoA-IV, although it contains an equivalent amount of total amphipathic structure, as measured by mean residue helical hydrophobic moment (Table I). However, a hydrophobicity plot revealed an asymmetric distribution of hydrophobic residues along the apoA-V sequence; the amino terminus to residue 85 and the carboxyl terminal third of the molecule were relatively hydrophilic, whereas the middle region, from residue 85 to 220 was much more hydrophobic (Fig. 1B). Calculation of the product of predicted α-helicity and mean molecular helical hydrophobic moment, F(α)·〈μ〉, which correlates with interfacial exclusion pressure (32Krebs K.E. Phillips M.C. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggests that the lipid affinity of human apoA-V is similar to that of apoA-I (33Ibdah J.A. Krebs K.E. Phillips M.C. Biochim.

Open table in a new tab Fourier transformation of mean residue helical hydrophobic moment as a function of residue rotation angle along a protein sequence identifies regions of amphipathic α-helical structure as maxima between 80 and 120°, β-sheet structure as maxima between 140 and 180°, and random coil structure as maxima between 0 and 40° (20Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Analysis of apoA-V revealed that, with the exception of three discrete α-helices between residues 169 and 246 (Fig. 1C), the amphipathic α-helical structure in apoA-V is less well defined than that of other human apolipoproteins. Considered together, these analyses suggest that, unlike other members of the exchangeable apolipoprotein family, apoA-V has a multidomain structure. Residues 1–60 constitute a hydrophilic, moderately amphipathic region typical of the N-terminal globular domains of apoA-I, apoA-IV, and apoE. Residues 61–170 constitute a region that is very hydrophobic but weakly amphipathic. The interval between residues 171 and 245 contains three very hydrophobic, strongly amphipathic α-helices, which are thus predicted to have high surface activity. Finally, the intervals between residues 246 and 295 and residues 296 and 343, which are delineated by multiple prolines, constitute relatively hydrophilic regions that have no predominant secondary structural motif. Analysis of amino acid variability among the human, rat, and mouse apoA-V sequences revealed that the intervals between residues 155 and 222 and residues 254 and 290 are highly conserved (Fig. 1D). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—ApoA-V displayed a maximum tryptophan fluorescence emission at 339 nm, which is less blue-shifted than apoA-I and apoA-IV (Table II). Tryptophan fluorescence was resistant to iodide quenching, as reflected by a fractional exposure of 0.26. The tryptophan emission anisotropy ratio with excitation at 305 and 270 nm, a qualitative measure of tyrosine → tryptophan energy transfer efficiency that reflects the compactness of folding (22Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), was 2.01. As with apoA-IV, these values suggest that apoA-V adopts a tertiary conformation in which its tryptophan residues reside, on average, in a hydrophobic environment within energy transfer range of nonvicinal tyrosines (22Weinberg R.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Table IIFluorescence spectroscopy parametersλmaxaλmax, maximum fluorescence emission, excitation at 280 nm.A 305/A 270bA 305/A 270, ratio of emission anisotropy with excitation at 305 and 270 nm.Kq/K NATAcKq/K NATA, Stern-Volmer iodide tryptophan quenching constant, normalized to the quenching of N-acetyltryptophanamide.nmApoA-V3392.010.26ApoA-I333dWeinberg and Spector (13).NDeNot determined.0.29dWeinberg and Spector (13).ApoA-IV332fWeinberg et al.

Open table in a new tab Binding of ApoA-V to Phospholipid Multilamellar Vesicles— The addition of apoA-V to DMPC vesicles induced a time-dependent decrease in light scattering intensity (Fig. 2); the time required for a 50% decrease (T) was 209 s. Human apoA-I induced a similar decrease in light scattering, with a slightly longer T value of 380 s. These data indicate that the kinetics of apoA-V-dependent transformation of DMPC vesicles into discoidal complexes are roughly equivalent to that of apoA-I. When apoA-V-DMPC discoidal complexes generated at pH 3.0 were brought to pH 7.4, apoA-V remained tightly bound on their surface. Moreover, in contrast to the behavior of lipid-free apoA-V, apoA-V complexed with DMPC remained soluble across a broad pH range, suggesting that under physiological conditions in vivo, apoA-V exists in a lipid-associated state, both in the intracellular and intravascular compartments. Activity of ApoA-V at the Phospholipid/Water Interface—Adsorption of apoA-V to EPC monolayers, measured as the change in surface pressure, increased as a function of subphase concentration and reached a maximum at concentrations of 5.0 × 10–5 g/dl and above. Analysis of the binding curve yielded a KD of 1.9 × 10–5 g/dl, a value similar to KD values observed for apoA-I and apoA-IV (23Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of apoA-V to the EPC/water interface decreased linearly with increasing initial pressure (Fig. 3); extrapolation of the Π i -ΔΠ curve yielded an exclusion pressure of 32.3 mN/meter. Exclusion pressures of other apolipoproteins are as follows: apoA-IV, 29.1 mN/meter (23Weinberg R.B. Ibdah J.A. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8977-8983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); apoA-I, 33.2 mN/meter (33Ibdah J.A. Krebs K.E. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1004: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); apoA-II, 34 mN/meter (33Ibdah J.A. Krebs K.E. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1983; 751: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Dynamic Behavior of ApoA-V at the Air/Water Interface— Surface area-tension loops of human apoA-V at the air/water interface displayed an increase in surface tension with an expansion of bubble surface area (Fig. 4), indicating that apoA-V undergoes changes in surface conformation in response to changes in interfacial geometry, albeit with a much lower elastic modulus than human apoA-IV (Table III). The surface viscosity of apoA-V, however, was similar to apoA-IV. Areatension loops recorded at 5–80 cycles/min (Fig. 5) revealed that, unlike apoA-I or apoA-IV, which display rate-dependent increases in elasticity, the elasticity of apoA-V was rate-insensitive, which implies a more rigid and less adaptable interfacial conformation.Table IIIProperties at the air/water and lipid/water interfacesAir/water interfaceLipid/water interfaceϵaϵ, interfacial elasticity.φbφ, γ-area loop phase angle.ϵVcϵV, viscoelastic component.K DdK D, equilibrium dissociation constant for interaction with phospholipid monolayers.IIEXeIIEX, exclusion pressure for phospholipid monolayers.KAfK A, rate constant for binding to a triolein/buffer interface.mN/meterdegreesmN/meternmmN/meterms-1Apo A-V12.924.49.71.3132.33.5Apo A-IgAir/water interface values from Weinberg et al.

These data are consonant with the prediction that apoA-V possesses high affinity for hydrophobic interfaces. Interestingly, in contrast to its interaction with phospholipid vesicles, apoA-V bound to the oil/water interface at a rate more than 10-fold slower than apoA-I. Analysis of the apoA-V time-tension curve yielded a binding rate constant of 3.5 × 10–3 s–1, whereas the corresponding rate constants for apoA-I and apoA-IV were 50.4 × 10–3 and 45.9 × 10–3 s–1, respectively (Table III).

https://openalex.org/W1965506696,"The cholesterol trafficking defect in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease leads to impaired regulation of cholesterol esterification, cholesterol synthesis, and low density lipoprotein receptor activity. The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the rate-limiting step in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle formation, is also regulated by cell cholesterol content. To determine whether the Niemann-Pick C1 protein alters the expression and activity of ABCA1, we determined the ability of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to deplete pools of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids in human fibroblasts derived from NPC1 +/+ , NPC1 +/–, and NPC1 –/– subjects. Efflux of low density lipoprotein-derived, non-lipoprotein, plasma membrane, and newly synthesized pools of cell cholesterol by apoA-I was diminished in NPC1 –/– cells, as was efflux of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. NPC1 +/– cells showed intermediate levels of lipid efflux compared with NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 –/– cells. Binding of apoA-I to cholesterol-loaded and non-cholesterol-loaded cells was highest for NPC1 +/– cells, with NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 –/– cells showing similar levels of binding. ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels increased in response to cholesterol loading in NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 +/– cells but showed low levels at base line and in response to cholesterol loading in NPC1 –/– cells. Consistent with impaired ABCA1-dependent lipid mobilization to apoA-I for HDL particle formation, we demonstrate for the first time decreased plasma HDL-cholesterol levels in 17 of 21 (81%) NPC1 –/– subjects studied. These results indicate that the cholesterol trafficking defect in NPC disease results in reduced activity of ABCA1, which we suggest is responsible for the low HDL-cholesterol in the majority of NPC subjects and partially responsible for the overaccumulation of cellular lipids in this disorder. The cholesterol trafficking defect in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease leads to impaired regulation of cholesterol esterification, cholesterol synthesis, and low density lipoprotein receptor activity. The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which mediates the rate-limiting step in high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle formation, is also regulated by cell cholesterol content.

Efflux of low density lipoprotein-derived, non-lipoprotein, plasma membrane, and newly synthesized pools of cell cholesterol by apoA-I was diminished in NPC1 –/– cells, as was efflux of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. NPC1 +/– cells showed intermediate levels of lipid efflux compared with NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 –/– cells. Binding of apoA-I to cholesterol-loaded and non-cholesterol-loaded cells was highest for NPC1 +/– cells, with NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 –/– cells showing similar levels of binding. ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels increased in response to cholesterol loading in NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 +/– cells but showed low levels at base line and in response to cholesterol loading in NPC1 –/– cells. Consistent with impaired ABCA1-dependent lipid mobilization to apoA-I for HDL particle formation, we demonstrate for the first time decreased plasma HDL-cholesterol levels in 17 of 21 (81%) NPC1 –/– subjects studied. These results indicate that the cholesterol trafficking defect in NPC disease results in reduced activity of ABCA1, which we suggest is responsible for the low HDL-cholesterol in the majority of NPC subjects and partially responsible for the overaccumulation of cellular lipids in this disorder.

Although the exact function of the NPC1 protein remains unknown, it is believed to facilitate the transport of lipids, particularly cholesterol, from late/endosomes lysosomes to the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane (6Liscum L.

Impaired cholesterol trafficking in NPC1-deficient cells results in blunted regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and LDL receptor activity, and a defect in the delivery of unesterified cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum for esterification by acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (9Pentchev P.G.

The membrane protein required for lipidation of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), is also up-regulated in response to increased cell cholesterol, leading to high density lipoprotein (HDL) particle formation and assisting with the maintenance of cell cholesterol homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 12Oram J.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ABCA1 mediates the rate-limiting step critical for the formation of HDL particles and is thought to function by transferring cellular phospholipids and/or cholesterol to lipid-free or lipid-poor apoA-I (12Oram J.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Mutations in ABCA1 result in a failure of lipidation of apoA-I, increased intracellular cholesterol, and extremely low HDL levels in the hypoalphalipoproteinemic syndrome Tangier disease (13Assmann G.

Increasing cell cholesterol and oxysterol content, as seen in arterial wall macrophages in atherosclerosis, up-regulates ABCA1 expression through activation of the nuclear transcription factor liver X receptor (LXR) (14Venkateswaran A.

Although HDL levels in human subjects with NPC disease have not been reported, the failure to regulate appropriately other cholesterol metabolic genes in NPC disease predicts ABCA1 function would also be impaired in this disorder, resulting in decreased HDL particle formation. Previous studies using macrophages from NPC1-deficient mice reported a selective defect in cholesterol, but not phospholipid delivery, to apoA-I and normal regulation of ABCA1 activity by LXR and retinoid X-receptor agonists (16Chen W.

In addition, HDL-cholesterol levels in NPC1-deficient mice have been reported to be normal (17Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the current studies we characterized apoA-I-mediated efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol from distinct cellular pools, binding of apoA-I, and regulation of ABCA1 expression in normal (NPC), NPC1 +/–, and NPC1 –/– human fibroblasts, and we correlated our findings with the plasma lipid profiles of NPC patients. Our results suggest mutations in NPC1 impair the regulation and activity of ABCA1, resulting in decreased efflux of cell phospholipids and cholesterol and formation of HDL particles in vitro, and low plasma HDL levels in the majority of NPC patients. Materials—Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM), and essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma. [1,2-3H]Cholesterol (48 Ci/mmol), [methyl-3H]choline chloride (75 Ci/mmol), and [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]cholesteryl linoleate (84 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and (RS)-[2-14C]mevalonic acid lactone (55 mCi/mmol) and 125I (106 mCi/ml) were from Amersham Biosciences. Tissue culture medium was purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD), and lipoprotein-deficient serum and fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Preparation of Lipoproteins and ApoA-I—HDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) and LDL (d = 1.019–1.063) were isolated by standard ultracentrifugation techniques from the pooled plasma of healthy male volunteers (19Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Greer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HDL fractions were subjected to heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography to remove apoE- and apoB-containing particles (20Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 316-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The whole protein fraction of HDL was obtained by delipidating HDL and purified apoA-I obtained using DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described (21Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem.

For apoA-I binding assays, apoA-I was iodinated with 125I by IODO-GEN (Pierce) to a specific activity of ∼860 cpm/ng apoA-I. Cell Culture—Normal human fibroblasts (NPC1 +/+, CRL-2076) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Cells were plated at 15,000–20,000 cells/16-mm well or 60,000–100,000 cells/35-mm well and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS. To load cells with non-lipoprotein cholesterol, confluent monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mg/ml BSA (PBS/BSA) and incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 2 mg/ml BSA with 30 μg/ml cholesterol added from a 10 mg/ml stock in ethanol. To allow equilibration of added cholesterol, cell layers were rinsed twice with PBS/BSA and incubated for an additional 24 h in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA (DMEM/BSA). Labeling of Cellular Cholesterol Pools and Phospholipids—To radiolabel LDL-derived cellular cholesterol pools, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum during the last 40% of growth to confluence to up-regulate LDL receptor expression and then incubated for 24 h with 50 μg/ml [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL. Cells were then rinsed 3 times with PBS/BSA prior to addition of apoA-I. To radiolabel non-LDL-derived cellular cholesterol pools, rapidly growing cells were labeled during the last 40% of growth to confluence by addition of 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol prior to loading with non-lipoprotein cholesterol (26Francis G.A.

Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), cholesterol-loaded cells were incubated for 2 h with DMEM/BSA containing 0.2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol after the 24-h equilibration step (27Mendez A.J.

To label newly synthesized cholesterol, rapidly growing cells were incubated with 0.5 μCi/ml [14C]mevalonic acid lactone during the last 40% of growth to confluence. Cells were then rinsed 3 times with PBS/BSA, equilibrated 24 h in DMEM/BSA, and rinsed 3 times with PBS/BSA prior to addition of apoA-I. Choline-containing phospholipids were labeled in cholesterol-loaded cells by addition of 3 μCi/ml [3H]choline chloride to the DMEM/BSA medium during the 24-h equilibration period. Cells were rinsed 5 times with PBS/BSA prior to addition of apoA-I (28Mendez A.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and Phospholipid Efflux—After the desired labeling protocol, cells were incubated for 1–48 h in DMEM/BSA containing 10 μg/ml apoA-I. At the end of the indicated incubation periods, cell layers were rinsed twice with iced PBS/BSA and twice with iced PBS. Cells were stored at –20 °C until lipid extraction. Efflux media were collected and centrifuged (3,000 rpm for 10 min) to remove cell debris. Radioactivity in the medium was then either measured directly (for cells labeled with [3H]cholesterol) or the medium was extracted for determination of radiolabeled phospholipids (29Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular lipids were extracted, separated by thin layer chromatography, and assayed for radioactivity as described previously (26Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell proteins were determined using BSA as standard (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13011-13020Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Non-cholesterol-loaded cells or cells loaded with non-lipoprotein cholesterol in 35-mm wells were incubated for 2 h at 0 °C in DMEM/BSA containing 25 mm HEPES and increasing concentrations of 125I-apoA-I. Cells were rinsed 5 times with iced PBS/BSA and twice with iced PBS. Cell layers were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, and aliquots were taken for quantitation of radioactivity and protein. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of ABCAI mRNA—Total RNA was isolated from cells by guanidine isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). The concentration of RNA was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 260 nm, and 2 μg of RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's guidelines. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 500 nm of oligo(dT) primer and Superscript™ RNase H (Invitrogen). Each reaction mixture contained 100 units of Superscript™ enzyme, 1× first strand buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 0.5 μm dNTP mix, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 0.05 μg/μl BSA, and 2 units of RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen). The mixtures were incubated at 45 °C for 90 min followed by incubation at 95 °C for 3 min (Whatman Biometra T-gradient thermocycler) and then put promptly on ice. Amplification of ABCA1 and cyclophilin mRNAs was performed in tandem to ensure equal amounts of starting cDNA for each sample. Diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, 1× PCR buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 50 mm KCl), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dNTPs, and cDNA were added to 200 μl of thin walled PCR tubes and mixed, and one-half volume was transferred to another PCR tube. Then 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and 2 μl of 10 μm forward and reverse primers (ABCA1 or cyclophilin) were added to complete the reaction mixture. ABCA1 amplification was performed by initially denaturing DNA at 95 °C for 3 min. Thereafter, denaturing was at 95 °C for 75 s, annealing at 54.6 °C for 75 s, and extension at 72 °C for 55 s for a total of 31 cycles with a final extension period of 5 min. Human cyclophilin amplification was performed using similar conditions except the annealing temperature was 48 °C with a total of 33 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. The primers used are as follows: human ABCA1, 5′-GAC ATC CTG AAG CCA ATC CTG (forward), 5′-CCT TGT GGC TGG AGT GTC AGG T (reverse); human cyclophilin, 5′-ACC CAA AGG GAA CTG CAG CGA GAG C (forward), 5′-CCG CGT CTC CTT TGA GCT GTT TGC AG (reverse). Northern Blot Analysis of ABCA1—Total RNA was isolated from cells as described (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Seven micrograms of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 5% formaldehyde in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.0, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary transfer. The probe for ABCA1 was obtained by purifying PCR products using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and then radiolabeled by the random priming method with [α-32P]dCTP (Invitrogen). After cross-linking with UV light (Stratalinker model 1800, Stratagene), the membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. The hybridization signal was detected by autoradiography. Western Blot Analysis of ABCA1—Crude cellular membranes were prepared by homogenizing cells on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors and 2 mm EGTA. The nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 700 rpm, and the supernatant was subsequently centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 rpm. The pellet was then resuspended in 0.45 m urea containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.05% dithiothreitol and protein concentrations were determined. Thirty micrograms of membrane proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was performed according to standard protocols using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human ABCA1 antibody (1:500 dilution) (a kind gift of Dr. Shinji Yokoyama, Nagoya City University (33Kojima K. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Murakami I. Suzumori K. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys.

Chemiluminescence was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences). Lipid Profiles of NPC Patients—Fasting lipid profiles for 21 NPC1-deficient subjects (10 male and 11 female, age ranges 3–42) and 31 NPC heterozygous parents (15 males and 16 females) were obtained from routine clinical laboratory analyses with the assistance of the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation (Tucson, AZ). Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as the means ± S.D. Significant differences between experimental groups and in the levels of HDL in NPC patients compared with population norms were determined using the Student's t test (34Sokal R.R. Rohlf J.F. Biometry: The Principals and Practice of Statistics in Biological Research. 3rd ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1995: 207-271Google Scholar). ApoA-I-mediated Efflux of LDL-derived Cholesterol Is Impaired in Human NPC1 –/– Fibroblasts—Impaired trafficking of LDL-derived cholesterol in fibroblasts or lymphocytes is a biochemical hallmark of NPC disease (1Patterson M.C.

The Metabolic & Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3611-3633Google Scholar). To assess the removal of LDL-derived cholesterol by apoA-I in human NPC1-deficient cells, fibroblasts from a normal subject (NPC1 +/+) and individuals heterozygous (NPC1 +/–) or compound heterozygous (NPC1 –/–) for mutations in NPC1 were grown to confluence in lipoprotein-deficient serum. The cells were then labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL for 24 h prior to incubation with apoA-I. Incorporation of LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol was approximately 3 times higher in NPC1 –/– than in NPC1 +/+ or NPC1 +/– cells (see Fig. 1, legend), consistent with accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes and a failure to down-regulate LDL receptor activity in NPC1 –/– cells (10Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Tokoro T. Butler J. Sokol J. Filling-Katz M. Quirk J.M. Marshall D.C. Patel S. Vanier M.T. Brady R.O.

Incubation of cells with 10 μg/ml apoA-I for 48 h resulted in efflux of 13–14% of LDL-derived [3H]cholesterol to the medium from NPC1 +/+ cells (Fig. 1A). NPC1 +/– cells showed a slightly decreased ability to release LDL-derived cholesterol to apoA-I, whereas NPC1 –/– cells showed markedly diminished efflux (only 2% above basal levels of efflux to albumin alone) to apoA-I compared with both these other cell lines. Removal of radiolabeled cellular cholesterol to the medium was accompanied by a marked decrease in radiolabeled cellular cholesteryl ester (CE) in NPC +/+ and NPC +/– cells (Fig. 1B). NPC –/– cells showed a sharper decline in cellular CE levels and a simultaneous accumulation of [3H]cholesterol (Fig. 1, B and C), consistent with normal rates of CE hydrolysis but failure to re-esterify cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum in NPC –/– cells (1Patterson M.C.

ApoA-I-mediated Efflux of Total Cell, Plasma Membrane, and Newly Synthesized Cholesterol Is Impaired in NPC1 –/– Human Fibroblasts—Accumulation of LDL-derived cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes in NPC1-deficient fibroblasts suggests that these compartments are the main site of NPC1 protein function (5Garver W.S. Heidenreich R.A. Erickson R.P. Thomas M.A. Wilson J.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Higgins M.E. Davies J.P. Chen F.W. Ioannou Y.A. Mol. Genet. Metab. 1999; 68: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To investigate whether apoA-I-mediated efflux of cholesterol derived from non-lipoprotein sources is also impaired in human NPC1-deficient fibroblasts, cells were incubated with [3H]cholesterol during the last 40% of growth to label all cellular cholesterol pools. In other experiments, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]cholesterol briefly after confluence to label more specifically plasma membrane cholesterol (26Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have previously found that a 2-h pulse of cholesterol-loaded normal human fibroblasts with [3H]cholesterol results in less than 2% of labeled cholesterol being incorporated into cholesteryl esters (26Francis G.A. Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Bierman E.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15188-15197Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Although cholesterol may be internalized without being esterified, we used this method to label more specifically the plasma membrane cholesterol pool. Cells were also incubated with [14C]mevalonate lactone to label newly synthesized cholesterol. Consistent with the known defect in esterification of non-lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as LDL-derived cholesterol, in NPC1 –/– cells (9Pentchev P.G. Comly M.E. Kruth H.S. Vanier M.T. Wenger D.A. Patel S. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), these cells esterified only 7.5 ± 1.8% of total cell [3H]cholesterol delivered to cells during growth, compared with 31.4 ± 2.2 and 31.1 ± 1.3% in NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 +/– cells, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, efflux of cholesterol to apoA-I from cells labeled by each of these methods was diminished from NPC1 –/– fibroblasts compared with NPC1 +/+ cells. Diminished efflux from NPC1 –/– cells occurred despite increased levels of [3H]cholesterol and [14C]mevalonate lactone incorporation by these cells during growth (see Fig. 2 legend). Despite higher incorporation of [3H]cholesterol during the pulse-labeling protocol, NPC1 +/– cells showed intermediate levels of efflux of this pool of cholesterol to apoA-I compared with NPC1 +/+ and NPC1 –/– cells (Fig. 2B) and similarly intermediate levels of efflux of total cell (Fig. 2A) and newly synthesized cholesterol (Fig. 2C). ApoA-I-mediated Removal of Choline-containing Phospholipids Is Defective in Human NPC1-deficient Fibroblasts—The ability of apoA-I to act as a cholesterol acceptor is thought to be dependent upon apoA-I being first or simultaneously phospholipidated in a process that requires ABCA1 (12Oram J.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). [3H]Choline-labeled NPC1 –/– cells showed a diminished ability to mobilize both PC and SM to apoA-I (Fig. 3). NPC1 +/– cells showed intermediate levels of PC efflux; SM efflux from NPC1 +/– cells was similar to NPC1 +/+ cells at early time points (≤8 h) but fell to levels similar to those from NPC1 –/– cells at later time points. Impaired efflux of choline-containing phospholipids by NPC1-deficient cells parallels the decreased ability of apoA-I to mobilize cholesterol from all of the cellular cholesterol pools examined (Figs. 1 and 2). ABCA1 Expression Is Diminished in NPC1 –/– Human Fibroblasts—Impaired efflux of phospholipids and various pools of cellular cholesterol to apoA-I from NPC1 –/– fibroblasts suggests ABCA1 regulation and activity is also impaired in these cells. Levels of ABCA1 mRNA and protein were determined under non-cholesterol-loaded and cholesterol-loaded conditions. Semi-quantitative determination of ABCA1 mRNA using reverse transcriptase-PCR was consistent with results obtained by Northern blotting (Fig. 4A). ABCA1 mRNA and protein levels increased in NPC1 +/+ fibroblasts in response to non-lipoprotein cholesterol loading. NPC1 +/– cells showed somewhat lower ABCA1 mRNA levels by Northern blot and lower AB"

Among the four described p38 isoforms, p38α, β, and δ are expressed in keratinocytes (Dashti, S. R., Efimova, T., and Eckert, R. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 8059–8063). However, very little is known about how individual p38 isoforms regulate keratinocyte function. In the present study, we use okadaic acid (OA) as a tool to study the role of p38 MAPKs as regulators of keratinocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that OA activates p38δ but not other p38 isoforms. p38δ activation is increased as early as 0.5 h after OA addition, and activity is maximal at 8 and 24 h. ERK1 and ERK2 activity are reduced on an identical time course. We show that p38δ forms a complex with ERK1/2, and overexpression of p38δ inhibits ERK1/2 activity without reducing ERK1/2 level. Thus, p38δ may directly suppress ERK1/2 activity. Additional studies show that p38δ is expressed in the epidermis, suggesting a role for p38δ in regulating differentiation. To evaluate its function, we show that increased p38δ activity is associated with increased levels of AP1 and CAATT enhancer binding protein factors, increased binding of these factors to the involucrin (hINV) promoter, and increased expression. Moreover, these responses are maintained in the presence of SB203580, an agent that inhibits p38α and β, further suggesting a central role for the p38δ isoform. Dominant-negative p38 also inhibits these responses. These unique observations suggest that p38δ is the major p38 isoform driving suprabasal hINV gene expression and that p38δ directly regulates ERK1/2 activity via formation of a p38δ-ERK1/2 complex. p38 MAPK isoforms are important in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes. Among the four described p38 isoforms, p38α, β, and δ are expressed in keratinocytes (Dashti, S. R., Efimova, T., and Eckert, R. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 8059–8063).

The p38 MAPK family includes the p38α, β, δ, and γ isoforms (3Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). p38α, β, and δ are expressed in keratinocytes (4Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but only limited information is available regarding the function of each individual isoform. p38δ is a recently discovered p38 isoform that has not been extensively studied, and very few physiological functions have been identified. Thus, although p38δ is abundant in keratinocytes (4Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the physiological function of p38δ in keratinocytes has not been defined. In the present study, we provide new information regarding the role of p38δ in keratinocytes. We use okadaic acid (OA), a potent inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases 2A, 1, and 3 (5Schonthal A.H. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1262-D1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as a tool to stimulate p38 activation. By binding to the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 2A, OA suppresses enzyme activity (6Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase 2A is a predominant serine/threonine phosphatase present in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes (7Kam E. Nirunsuksiri W. Hager B. Fleckman P. Dale B.A. Br. J. Dermatol. 1997; 137: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and inhibition of phosphatase activity shifts the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in favor of the former, which leads to an accumulation of hyperphosphorylated proteins and ultimately results in signaling cascade activation and altered gene expression (8Schonthal A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G.

Commun. 1989; 159: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our studies show that OA treatment of keratinocytes increases p38 MAPK activity because of a selective activation of p38δ. This activation coincides with a simultaneous decrease in ERK1/2 activity. A recent study suggests that p38α and ERK1/2 kinases can associate in HeLa cells (11Zhang H. Shi X. Hampong M. Blanis L. Pelech S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6905-6908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, this interaction has not been noted in other systems. Our study provides a first example that p38δ is co-precipitated with another MAPK, ERK1/2. This suggests that p38δ may directly interact with ERK1/2 or interact via other proteins to influence ERK1/2 activity and vice versa. Our studies also suggest that p38δ activation is physiologically important, because differentiation-associated downstream responses are activated following p38δ activation. These findings point to a unique interaction of p38δ with ERK1/2 and also suggest that p38δ is an important mediator of differentiation-associated gene activation.

Empty control adenovirus, Ad5-EV, was previously described (4Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were propagated in 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride centrifugation. Green fluorescent protein-encoding adenovirus, Ad5-GFP, was utilized to determine the optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI). Adenoviruses were administered at 15 MOI in the presence of polybrene. Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell extracts or nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured human epidermal keratinocytes as described (18Agarwal C. Efimova T. Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6190-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of the samples was determined using Bradford Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal quantities of protein were electrophoresed on a 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were blocked and then incubated with an indicated primary antibody, washed, and exposed to an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Secondary antibody binding was detected using a chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assays—The activities of MAP kinases were measured using nonisotopic p44/42 (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and JNK/SAPK assay systems (New England BioLabs) (4Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27214-27220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, keratinocyte total cell lysates were prepared under nondenaturing conditions. Protein concentration was determined, and equal amounts of total protein were used per each in vitro kinase assay sample. Active (phosphorylated) ERK1/2 and p38 kinases were selectively immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using immobilized, dual phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies. JNK/SAPK activity was selectively precipitated from cell lysates using c-Jun fusion protein glutathione-Sepharose beads. Precipitated kinases were then allowed to phosphorylate their major substrate proteins (Elk-1 for ERK1/2, ATF-2 for p38, and c-Jun for JNK/SAPK) in a kinase reaction performed in the presence of ATP. Phosphorylation of the substrate proteins was measured by immunoblot using the corresponding phospho-specific antibody. The activity of adenovirus transduced FLAG epitope-tagged p38 MAPK isoforms was assessed in the similar fashion using anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma; F3165) to immunoprecipitate specific p38 isoforms. The expression of individual p38 MAPK isoforms at a comparable level was confirmed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibody. To measure the activity of the endogenous p38δ isoform, p38δ-specific antibody (SC-7585) was used to selectively immunoprecipitate this kinase followed by a kinase assay performed as described above. Tissue Culture, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—Third passage normal human foreskin keratinocytes were transfected when ∼50% confluent with 2 μg of involucrin promoter-luciferase reporter construct, pINV-241, in the presence of 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent/dish (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, the keratinocytes were treated with keratinocyte serum-free medium in the presence or absence of TPA (50 ng/ml), OA (10 nm), or the two reagents combined. For co-transfection experiments, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of hINV promoter reporter plasmids and 2 μg of empty control vector or vector encoding dominant-negative p38 in the presence of 12 μl of FuGENE 6/dish. After 24 h, the keratinocytes were treated with 10 nm OA. After an additional 24 h of incubation, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was measured as previously described, using Promega luciferase assay kit and a Berthold luminometer (13Welter J.F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). All of the assays were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated three times. The luciferase activity was normalized per μg of protein. The transfection efficiency was monitored using a green fluorescent protein expression plasmid (Clontech) (21Banks E.B. Crish J.F. Eckert R.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Analysis—The gel mobility shift assay was carried out as previously published (13Welter J.F.

Oligonucleotides encoding mutated AP1–1 (5′-TGTGGCTCGAGAGGAAGGGGTT; AP1–1m) and C/EBP (5′-GGTTTGCTGAGATCTA TGCCTG; C/EBPm) were used in competition experiments. The altered nucleotides are underlined. The Sp1 oligonucleotide sequence is 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGCGAGC with the Sp1 site in bold type. For gel mobility supershift experiments, 2 μg of nuclear extract was treated with antibody for 10 min prior to gel electrophoresis. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis of hINV mRNA Level—Total RNA was prepared from cultured keratinocytes and treated for 24 h with 0 or 100 nm OA, using RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen; 75142). RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry prior to PCR analysis. Ribosomal 18 S RNA levels were monitored as an internal control using specific primers. The hINV upstream and downstream PCR primers are 5′-CTCCACCAAAGCCTCTGC and 5′-CTGCTTAAGCTGCTGCTC. The expected size of the results PCR product is 380 bp. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using Titan One Tube reverse transcription-PCR system (Roche Applied Science; 1855476). Briefly, each PCR reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 1.5 mm MgCl2,20 μm of each primer, 1 μg of RNA, 1 μl of the enzyme blend, which consisted of reverse transcriptase avian myeloblastosis virus, Taq DNA polymerase, proofreading polymerase, and optimized reaction buffer. The reaction buffer contained 0.2 mm of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The reverse transcription step was performed at 55 °C for 30 min. The complex was denatured at 94 C for 1 cycle and amplified for 35 cycles (denaturation, 94 °C for 10 s; annealing, 55 °C for 30 s; and elongation, 68 °C for 4 min). OA Regulation of MAPK Activity—We treated keratinocytes with 100 nm OA for 24 h and then monitored the effects on MAPK activity. To monitor p38 MAPK activity, active (phosphorylated) p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated using an antibody that reacts with the phosphorylated form of all p38 MAPK isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ). The ability of the precipitated activated p38 MAPK to phosphorylate its substrate protein, ATF-2, was then examined by kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, OA treatment markedly increases p38 MAPK activity. Assay of JNK1/2 activity, based on ability of to JNK1/2 to phosphorylate c-Jun, revealed a slight increase. ERK1/2 activity is detected in cultured keratinocytes in the absence of OA stimulation. However, in contrast to p38 MAPK and JNK1/2 activities, ERK1/2 activity (P-Elk1 formation) is suppressed by OA treatment. To confirm that these changes are due to altered kinase activity and not to changes in kinase level, we prepared extracts and directly measured p38, JNK1/2, and ERK1/2 levels by immunoblot. Fig. 1B demonstrates that the levels of these enzymes are not changed by OA treatment. Because the extent and rate of MAPK activation is thought to influence subsequent downstream events, we monitored the time course of kinase activity following OA treatment. Keratinocytes were treated with 100 nm OA for times ranging from 0 min to 24 h. To measure p38 activity, keratinocytes were harvested at each time point, and phospho-p38 was precipitated. We then monitored the ability of the precipitated kinase to phosphorylate ATF-2. As shown in Fig. 1C (top panel), p38 activity is detected by 4 h and is maximally increased by 8 h. To differentiate the effects of OA on ERK1 versus ERK2 activity, we prepared cell extracts and assayed for the presence of phosphorylated (active) ERK1/2. The upper ERK1/2 panel in Fig. 1C shows that P-ERK levels decrease beginning at 4 h and that both ERK1 and ERK2 are inhibited. The lower panel shows that there are no changes in total ERK1 or ERK2 concentrations during the time course. The JNK1/2 panel in Fig. 1C shows that JNK1/2 activity is transiently increased at 4 h and then returns to a level that is slightly elevated over untreated cells. Differential Regulation of p38 Isoforms by OA—The above study indicates that p38 activity is increased by OA treatment. However, p38 is expressed as four isozymes, p38α, β, δ, and γ (22Goedert M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), that can produce different responses in cells. To identify the responsive p38 isoform, the cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding FLAG-tagged p38α, β, δ, or γ and equilibrated for 24 h prior to the start of treatment with 100 nm OA. The cell extracts were prepared at time points from 0 min to 24 h after the start of OA treatment, and each adenovirus-delivered p38 isoform was immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody. The precipitated kinase was then assayed for the ability to phosphorylate ATF-2. As shown in Fig. 2A, p38α activity is modestly increased at 0.5–24 h, and p38γ activity is elevated at 24 h. In contrast, p38β activity is not regulated. The p38δ isoform exhibits the most dramatic increase in activity. Activity begins to increase at 30 min and is maximal at 8–24 h. This result suggests that p38δ is the major OA-responsive p38 isoform. Fig. 2B confirms that expression of each FLAG-tagged p38 isoform is stable over the 24-h OA treatment time course. This was monitored by isolating FLAG-p38α-, β-, δ-, or γ-expressing cells at the beginning of OA treatment (t = 0) and at t = 24 h and measuring the level by anti-FLAG immunoblot. β-Actin levels were monitored to assure equal loading. The above results suggest that p38δ is the major OA-responsive p38 isoform. To confirm that the endogenous p38δ isoform is activated, keratinocytes were treated with 100 nm OA for 0, 6, 16, and 24 h. Endogenous p38δ was precipitated using a p38δ-specific antibody, and the precipitated kinase was evaluated for the ability to phosphorylate ATF-2. Fig. 2C (top panel) shows that endogenous p38δ is activated by OA treatment. The middle panel displays an immunoblot showing that the increased activity is not due to an increase on p38δ levels. A β-actin blot is included to normalize for differences in sample loading. SB203580 is an inhibitor of the p38α and p38β isoforms but does not inhibit p38δ (25Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 27Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). As an additional method of confirming that p38δ is the isoform that transmits the OA signal downstream, we treated keratinocytes with OA in the presence or absence of 2 μm SB203580. After 24 h, the extracts were prepared, total activated p38 (phosphorylated p38α, β, δ, and γ) was precipitated using anti-phospho-p38, and the ability of the precipitated p38 kinase to phosphorylate ATF-2 was determined. As shown in Fig. 2D, OA increases p38 activity, but this increase is not inhibited by SB203580, further confirming that the responsive isoform is p38δ. Although p38γ is activated at 24 h (Fig. 2A), our previous studies show that p38γ is not expressed in cultured keratinocytes (4Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The above results suggest that increased p38δ activity is associated with reduced ERK1/2 activity. Because overexpression of p38δ is known to increase the amount of active p38δ (4Dashti S.R. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8059-8063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we tested whether p38δ expression, in the absence of OA treatment, reduces ERK1/2 activity. As shown in Fig. 2E, p38δ expression causes a marked reduction in both ERK1 and ERK2 (P-ERK1 and P-ERK2) activity, as compared withy cells infected with empty vector (EV). p38δ Associates with ERK1/2 Kinase—One possible explanation for the p38δ-dependent reduction in ERK1/2 activity is an interaction of p38δ with ERK1/2. A recent study using HeLa cells identified an ERK1/2-p38α complex and suggested that the complex may be physiologically important (11Zhang H. Shi X. Hampong M. Blanis L. Pelech S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6905-6908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, no interaction of this kind has been identified in other systems or with other p38 MAPK members. We therefore assessed whether ERK1/2 and p38δ form a complex in keratinocytes. Keratinocytes were infected with p38δ-encoding adenovirus and then treated with OA for 0–4 h. The extracts were prepared, and ERK1/2 was immunoprecipitated. The ERK1/2 immunoblot in Fig. 3A confirms ERK1/2 immunoprecipitation. The p38δ immunoblot demonstrates that p38δ is co-immunoprecipitated with ERK1/2. To confirm the specificity of the ERK1/2 precipitation, we performed a parallel precipitation with anti-IgG. As expected, no ERK1/2 or p38δ precipitation was observed (Fig. 3B). We also performed the inverse precipitation experiment. FLAG-tagged p38δ (FLAG-p38δ) was expressed in keratinocytes and then immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG. The left panel in Fig. 3C shows that the anti-FLAG reagent precipitates FLAG-p38δ. The right panel shows that endogenous ERK1/2 is co-precipitated with p38δ. The above results were obtained using expressed MAPK proteins. We next confirmed that the endogenous kinases also associate. We prepared cell extracts and precipitated with an ERK1/2-specific antibody. The results (Fig. 3D) show that endogenous ERK1/2 is precipitated (lower panels) and confirm that p38δ is co-immunoprecipitated with ERK1/2 (upper panels). As a control, we show that nonspecific IgG did not precipitate these kinases (right panels). The asterisk in each panel indicates antibody interaction with the IgG derived from the immunoprecipitation. p38δ Expression in Human Epidermis—The above results suggest that p38δ is functionally important in cultured keratinocytes. However, although p38δ has been detected in developing mouse epidermis (28Hu M.C. Wang Y.P. Mikhail A. Qiu W.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7095-7102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), evidence demonstrating that p38δ is expressed in human epidermis has not been presented. We therefore prepared extracts of adult human epidermis for detection of p38δ by immunoblot. Fig. 4A compares p38δ obtained from epidermal extracts with authentic p38δ obtained from cultured keratinocytes infected with adenovirus producing authentic p38δ. This experiment clearly shows that p38δ is expressed in epidermis. Fig. 4B confirms expression in all epidermal layers. OA Regulation of AP1 and C/EBP Transcription Factor Expression—The above studies suggest that p38δ is activated by OA and also suggests that it may have a physiologic role, because it is expressed in human epidermis. Our next effort was to identify downstream responses associated with p38δ activation. C/EBP and AP1 transcription factors are known to be important in regulation of keratinocyte differentiation (13Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2089139552,"Glucuronidation, a major metabolic pathway for a large variety of endobiotics and xenobiotics, is catalyzed by enzymes belonging to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family. Among UGT enzymes, UGT2B4 conjugates a large variety of endogenous and exogenous molecules and is considered to be the major bile acid conjugating UGT enzyme in human liver. In the present study, we identify UGT2B4 as a novel target gene of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), which mediates the hypolipidemic action of fibrates. Incubation of human hepatocytes or hepatoblastoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells with synthetic PPARα agonists, fenofibric acid, or Wy 14643 resulted in an increase of UGT2B4 mRNA levels. Furthermore, treatment of HepG2 cells with Wy 14643 induced the glucuronidation of hyodeoxycholic acid, a specific bile acid UGT2B4 substrate. Analysis of UGT2B mRNA and protein levels in PPARα wild type and null mice revealed that PPARα regulates both basal and fibrate-induced expression of these enzymes in rodents also. Finally, a PPAR response element was identified in the UGT2B4 promoter by site-directed mutagenesis and electromobility shift assays. These results demonstrate that PPARα agonists may control the catabolism of cytotoxic bile acids and reinforce recent data indicating that PPARα, which has been largely implicated in the control of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, is also an important modulator of the metabolism of endobiotics and xenobiotics in human hepatocytes.

Glucuronide conjugation is a major metabolic pathway for numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds, including bile acids (BA), 1The abbreviations used are: BA, bile acids; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; HDCA, hyodeoxycholic acid; FXR, farnesoid X-receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; LCA, lithocholic acid; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; RXR, retinoid X-receptor; PPRE, PPAR response elements; RT, reverse transcription; UDPGA, UDP-glucuronic acid; TLC, thin layer chromatography; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PXR, pregnane X-receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CYP, cytochrome P450.1The abbreviations used are: BA, bile acids; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; HDCA, hyodeoxycholic acid; FXR, farnesoid X-receptor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; CDCA, chenodeoxycholic acid; LCA, lithocholic acid; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; RXR, retinoid X-receptor; PPRE, PPAR response elements; RT, reverse transcription; UDPGA, UDP-glucuronic acid; TLC, thin layer chromatography; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PXR, pregnane X-receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; CYP, cytochrome P450. bilirubin, steroids, drugs, and environmental pollutants (1Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). This reaction consists in the transfer of the glucuronosyl group from UDP-glucuronic acid to the acceptor molecule (1Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). The addition of the glucuronosyl group on a compound results in a more water-soluble molecule, which can be excreted into bile or urine. Glucuronidation is catalyzed by enzymes belonging to the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, and based on primary structure homology, UGT proteins have been divided into two major subfamilies, UGT1A and UGT2B (2Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Bélanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Louisot P. Magdalou J. Chowdhury J.R. Ritter J.K. Schachter H. Tephly T.R. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). In humans, seven members of the UGT2B subfamily have been characterized: UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B10, UGT2B11, UGT2B15, UGT2B17, and UGT2B28 (3Lévesque E. Turgeon D. Carrier J.S. Montminy V. Beaulieu M.

Drug Metab. 2000; 1: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar).Among the UGT2B enzymes, UGT2B4 catalyzes the glucuronide conjugation of various molecules, including BAs, 5α-reduced androgens, catecholesterogens, and phenolic and monoterpenoid compounds (4King C.D. Rios G.R. Green M.D. Tephly T.R. Curr. Drug Metab. 2000; 1: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 5Lévesque E. Beaulieu M. Hum D.W. Bélanger A.

A certain degree of overlapping substrate specificity exists among the UGT2Bs, and these compounds are also conjugated by other UGT2B isoforms. However, various studies established the crucial role that UGT2B4 plays in hepatic BA glucuronide conjugation. Pillot et al. (7Pillot T. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Lafaurie C. Radominska A.

Furthermore, no or low glucuronidation activity of HDCA was observed in colon where UGT2B4 is not expressed (8Radominska-Pandya A. Little J.M. Pandya J.T. Tephly T.R. King C.D. Barone G.W.

Finally, a recent study revealed that UGT2B4 expression is positively regulated by the BA sensor farnesoid X-receptor (FXR) and suggested that UGT2B4 induction by BAs may be part of a negative feedback mechanism by which BAs limit their biological activity and control their intracellular levels to avoid a pathophysiological accumulation (10Barbier O. Pineda Torra I. Sirvent A. Claudel T. Blanquart C. Duran-Sandoval D. Kuipers F. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1926-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).An important consequence of BA glucuronidation is the introduction of an additional negative charge in the molecule that allows their transport by conjugate transporters such as the multidrug-resistance related proteins, MRP2 (ABCC2) and MRP3 (ABCC3), which are present in liver (11Kuipers F.

Whereas BAs are biological detergents with numerous important functions, these compounds are inherently cytotoxic and perturbations in their normal synthesis, transport, or secretion can result in a variety of pathophysiological conditions including intrahepatic cholestasis (13Hofmann A.F. Arch. Intern. Med. 1999; 159: 2647-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). During their enterohepatic circulation, BAs undergo several metabolic alterations, including glucuronide conjugation at ring hydroxyl groups (7Pillot T. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Lafaurie C.

Steroids. 2002; 67: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The most abundant glucuronide conjugate reported in human plasma is the primary BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) glucuronide followed by the secondary lithocholic acid (LCA) glucuronide (7Pillot T. Ouzzine M. Fournel-Gigleux S. Lafaurie C. Radominska A. Burchell B. Siest G. Magdalou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25636-25642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Back P. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1976; 357: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the urine of cholestatic patients, the proportion of BA glucuronide metabolites increases to up to 35% of total BAs (16Alme B. Sjovall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1980; 13: 907-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 17Takikawa H. Otsuka H. Beppu T. Seyama Y. Yamakawa T. Digestion. 1983; 27: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and HDCA is exclusively found as a glucuronide derivative (18Marschall H.U. Matern H. Wietholtz H. Egestad B. Matern S. Sjovall J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the family of nuclear receptors that are ligand-activated transcription factors. Three distinct types of PPARs have been identified as PPARα, PPARδ (or PPARβ), and PPARγ. Each isotype is encoded by a distinct gene and shows different distribution patterns (19Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocrine Rev. 1999; 20: 648-688Google Scholar, 20Barbier O. Pineda Torra I. Duguay Y. Blanquart C. Fruchart J.C. Glineur C. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Upon ligand activation, PPARs regulate gene transcription by dimerizing with the retinoid X-receptor (RXR) and binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs) within the regulatory regions of target genes (19Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocrine Rev. 1999; 20: 648-688Google Scholar). These PPREs usually consist of a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide AGGTCA sequence separated by one or two nucleotides (DR1 or DR2) (19Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocrine Rev. 1999; 20: 648-688Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARs can also negatively interfere with pro-inflammatory transcription factor pathways by a mechanism termed transrepression (21Delerive P. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 169: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). PPARα is highly expressed in various tissues such as liver, muscle, kidney, and heart where it stimulates the β-oxidative degradation of fatty acids (22Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Duval C. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Natural eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway, such as 8-hydroxytetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxytetraenoic acid, and leukotriene B4 as well as oxidized phospholipids, activate PPARα (23Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 24Kozak K.R. Gupta R.A. Moody J.S. Ji C. Boeglin W.E. DuBois R.N. Brash A.R.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The hypolipidemic fibrates (gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and fenofibrate) are synthetic PPARα ligands used in the treatment of dyslipidemia (23Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar).Recent findings indicate that PPARα also regulates BA synthesis and transport. In cultured rat hepatocytes, PPARα agonists decrease bile acid synthesis and suppress the expression of two key BA-synthesizing enzymes, the cytochrome P450 cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP)7A1 and the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27), which is paralleled by a similar reduction of their respective activities (26Post S.M. Duez H. Gervois P.P. Staels B. Kuipers F. Princen H.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1840-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). By contrast, ligand-activated PPARα stimulates the expression and activity of the murine sterol 12α-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP8B1), a hepatic microsomal enzyme that acts as a branch point in the bile acid synthetic pathway, determining the ratio of cholic acid/CDCA (27Hunt M.C. Yang Y.Z. Eggertsen G. Carneheim C.M. Gafvels M. Einarsson C. Alexson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28947-28953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In human hepatoma HepG2 cells, the PPARα ligand Wy 14643 suppresses CYP7A1 gene promoter activity (28Marrapodi M. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mouse liver, treatment with the PPARα agonist, ciprofibrate, results in a decreased expression of the bile salt transporters, such as Na+-taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide 1, Na+-independent organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp1), and the bile salt export pump (29Kok T. Bloks V.W. Wolters H. Havinga R. Jansen P.L. Staels B. Kuipers F. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). By contrast, ciprofibrate activation of PPARα induces the promoter activity of human apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT) gene in human colon carcinoma Caco2 cells (30Jung D. Fried M. Kullak-Ublick G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30559-30566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest that PPARα activation may result in a decreased BAs synthesis and secretion into bile. Furthermore, several studies in both humans and animals reported that treatment with PPARα activators results in enhanced glucuronidation activity and UGT expression (31Hautanen A. Manttari M. Manninen V. Frick M.H. Adlercreutz H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 32Jemnitz K. Veres Z. Monostory K. Vereczkey L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 34-37PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, clofibrate induces the bilirubin-conjugating UGT1A1 protein in microsomes from rat liver (32Jemnitz K. Veres Z. Monostory K. Vereczkey L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 34-37PubMed Google Scholar).Since PPARα is an important regulator of BAs synthesis and transport and considering the major role that UGT2B4 plays in hepatic glucuronidation of BAs, we investigated in the present study whether hepatic UGT2B4 expression and activity are regulated by PPARα. Our results demonstrate that PPARα activation results in the induction of UGT2B4 gene expression in human primary hepatocytes and human hepatoblastoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells. The induction of UGT2B4 gene expression is accompanied by an increased glucuronidation activity of HDCA. This positive regulation occurs at the transcriptional level via binding of PPARα to a DR1 response element located at –1193 bp in the promoter region of the UGT2B4 gene.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Studies—Animal studies were performed in compliance with European Union specifications regarding the use of laboratory animals.

For quantitative RT-PCR analyses of UGT2B4 gene expression, RNA was reverse-transcribed using random hexamer primers and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Reverse-transcribed UGT2B4 and 28 S cDNAs were quantified by real-time PCR on a MX4000 apparatus (Stratagene) using specific primers for UGT2B4 and 28 S as described previously (36Claudel T. Sturm E. Duez H. Torra I.P. Sirvent A. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Hum D.W. Kuipers F. Staels B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 39Congiu M. Mashford M.L. Slavin J.L. Desmond P.V. Drug Metab Dispos. 2002; 30: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). PCR amplifications were performed in a volume of 25 μl containing 100 nm of each primer, 4 mm MgCl2, the Brilliant Quantitative PCR Core reagent kit mixture (Stratagene), and SYBR Green 0.33X (Sigma). The conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. UGT2B4 mRNA levels were normalized to 28 S mRNA (36Claudel T. Sturm E. Duez H.

Pineda Torra I. Sirvent A. Claudel T. Blanquart C. Duran-Sandoval D. Kuipers F. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1926-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The B4p-2084, B4p-1214, B4p-1149, and B4p-524 reporter constructs were generated by PCR amplification with Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) and 100 pmol of the sense oligonucleotides: B4-2084, 5′-CATCAGAGTAGTGACTGCTAGTAGTTG-3′; B4-1214, 5′-TTTAAGTTATTATCTATAGAACAG-3′; B4-1149, 5′-TATTAGGAAGCGAGTCAGAGAG-3′; and B4-524, 5′-CATTTCTGAAATATATTACATGAG-3′, respectively. The reverse primer was pGL3-512, (5′-TATGCAGTTGCTCTCCAGCGGTTCCATCTTCC-3′) from the pGL3 basic plasmid. PCR products were subsequently digested with NcoI, gel-purified, and cloned into a SmaI plus NcoI-digested pGL3 basic plasmid. Mutations were introduced in the PPRE using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotide B4-PPREmt (5′-AGTTAAGATAAAATTTAATCTGTA-3′) (nucleotide in boldface indicate the mutated bases). The B4-PPREwtx6-TKpGL3 plasmid was obtained by cloning six copies of the corresponding dimerized oligonucleotides in the thymidine kinase promoter-driven luciferase reporter (TKpGL3) vector.Transient Transfection Assays—60 × 103 HepG2 or Huh7 cells were transfected with 100 ng of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmids, 50 ng of the pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector, and with or without 30 ng of the pSG5-PPARα plasmid. All of the samples were complemented with pBS-SK+ plasmid (Stratagene) to an identical amount of 500 ng/well. Cells were transfected with ExGen reagent (Euromedex) for 6 h at 37 °C and subsequently incubated overnight with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% fetal bovine serum and then treated for 24 h with either Me2SO (vehicle) or Wy 14643 (50 μm) as indicated.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—EMSA using in vitro produced PPARα and RXR were performed as described previously (40Pineda Torra I. Jamshidi Y. Flavell D.M. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1013-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) using the radiolabeled probes B4-PPREwt, 5′-TAAGATGAACTTTAATCTTGTAAC-3′; B4-PPREmt5′, 5′-TAAGATAAAATTTAATCTTGTAAC-3′; and B4-PPREmt3′, 5′-TAAGATGAACTTTAAAATTGTAAC-3′ (where underlined nucleotides represent response element half-sites and bases in boldface are mutated). For supershift experiments, 0.2 μg of the anti-PPARα antibody (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology) was preincubated for 20 min in the binding buffer before the addition of PPARα and RXR proteins. For competition experiments, the unlabeled oligonucleotides were included in the binding reaction at the indicated excess concentrations over the probe just before adding the labeled oligonucleotide.Microsome Purification and Western Blot Analysis—Microsomal proteins were purified from wild type or PPARα-null mouse livers as previously described (41Albert C. Vallée M. Beaudry G. Bélanger A. Hum D.W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3292-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Microsome pellets were resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer, and the protein content was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin for standard curves. Samples were aliquoted and kept at –80 °C until Western blot analysis or glucuronidation assays. For Western blot, 25 μg of microsomal proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then hybridized with the anti-UGT2B antibody (dilution, 1/2000). An anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with peroxidase was used as secondary antibody (dilution, 1/10000), and the resulting immunocomplexes were visualized using the Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus as specified by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Glucuronidation Assay—HepG2 cells were resuspended in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and homogenized using a Brinkman Polytron. Enzyme assays were performed as described previously (5Lévesque E. Beaulieu M. Hum D.W. Bélanger A. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μg of cell homogenate were incubated with 25 μm [14C]UDP-glucuronic acid, 2 mm unlabeled UDPGA, and 200 μm HDCA in a final volume of 100 μl of glucuronidation assay buffer for 8 h (5Lévesque E. Beaulieu M. Hum D.W. Bélanger A. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 207-216PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were terminated by adding 100 μl of methanol, and the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min to remove the precipitated proteins. 100 μl of glucuronidation assays were applied onto a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate (Merck) and migrated using a toluene: methanol:acetic acid (7:3:1) mixture. The extent of HDCA glucuronidation was analyzed and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis.Statistical Analyses—A nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to analyze for significant difference between the experimental groups. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post-hoc tests were used for analysis of the effects of simultaneous treatment with FXR and PPARα agonists.RESULTSPPARα Activators Induce UGT2B4 Expression in Human HepatocytesPrimary human hepatocytes were treated with fenofibric acid (250 μm) for 24 h, and UGT2B mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. A significant increase in UGT2B mRNA was observed in fenofibric acid-treated cells compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1a). With the cDNA sequences of the different human UGT2B isoforms being >85% homologous, a UGT2B4-specific real time RT-PCR method was used to specifically quantify UGT2B4 mRNA levels in hepatocytes treated for 6, 12, 24, or 48 h with fenofibric acid (250 μm) (Fig. 1b). Fenofibric acid rapidly induced UGT2B4 expression, because a maximal 10-fold increase in the concentration of UGT2B4 transcripts was observed within 12 h (Fig. 1b).To further characterize the PPARα-dependent regulation of UGT2B4 expression, human hepatoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the PPARα ligand Wy 14643 (Fig. 2, a and b). UGT2B4 mRNA levels were induced in a dose-dependent manner to a maximum of 2.7- and 2.3-fold activation in HepG2 and Huh7 cells, respectively (Fig. 2, a and b).Fig. 2PPARα agonists dose-dependently induce the UGT2B4 gene expression in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells. HepG2 (a) or Huh7 (b) cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of Wy 14643 (25, 50, 75, and 100 μm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 24 h. UGT2B4 mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR and expressed relative to control set as 1. Values are means ± S.D. (n = 6).

Treatment with Wy 14643 provoked a 3-fold increase in HDCA glucuronidation (Fig. 3b), thus demonstrating that PPARα agonists induce UGT2B4 activity.Fig. 3PPARα activation increases bile acid glucuronidation activity in HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or Wy 14643 (75 μm) for 36 h.

PML recruits Chk2 and p53 into the PML nuclear bodies and enhances p53/Chk2 interaction. Our results provide a novel mechanistic explanation for the cooperation between PML and p53 in response to DNA damage. The p53 tumor suppressor is important for the control of cell growth arrest, senescence, and cell death. These functions of p53 are pivotal for cellular response to stress signals, such as DNA damage (reviewed in Refs. 1Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar and 2Vogt Sionov R. Hayon L.I. Haupt Y. Blagosklonny M.V. Cell cycle Checkpoints and Cancer. Austin Landes Bioscience, 2001: 106-125Google Scholar). During tumorigenesis these cellular responses are abrogated by a loss of p53 function, either directly by mutations or indirectly by modifications of p53 inhibitors, such as Mdm2 (Hdm2 in human). The p53 protein is tightly regulated. Under normal conditions it is kept labile, but upon exposure to stress, p53 is transiently accumulated in an active form within the nucleus. This rapid activation occurs at multiple levels including protein stabilization, nuclear accumulation, and post-translational modifications. The regulation of p53 involves several auto-regulatory loops in which Mdm2 performs a pivotal role. In the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop, activated p53 induces mdm2 transcription, which in turn binds p53, blocks its functions, and promotes p53 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (3Michael D. Oren M. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It is imperative that p53 be relieved from inhibition by Mdm2 to be efficiently and properly activated in response to stress. Several mechanisms have been shown to interrupt this loop, including post-translational modifications of p53 and Mdm2, subcellular transportation, and interaction with specific modulators (reviewed in Ref. 4Louria-Hayon I. Haupt Y. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 111-116PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory influence of Mdm2 on p53 is affected by phosphorylation of both proteins. Phosphorylation of Mdm2 by Akt enhances Mdm2-mediated inhibition of p53 (reviewed in Ref. 3Michael D. Oren M. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Curr. Opin.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) impairs this inhibition. Likewise, the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20, which resides within the Mdm2-binding site, reduces the binding affinity between Mdm2 and p53, hence leading to the accumulation and activation of p53 (7Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is mediated by checkpoint kinase (Chk) 2 in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and by Chk1 or JNK in response to UV light (7Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9She Q.B. Ma W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, specific phosphorylation of p53 and Mdm2 modulates their interplay. The subcellular distribution of p53 and Mdm2 is also critical for their regulation (reviewed in Ref. 10Liang S.H. Clarke M.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The nuclear/cytoplasmic translocation of p53 provides a broad level of control; however, shuttling within the nucleus achieves the fine-tuning in p53 activation. This nuclear transportation is mediated by PML, a protein that is fused to the retinoic acid receptor α in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (11Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2002; 108: 165-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). PML is essential for the formation of subnuclear structures called PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which contain a variety of proteins including Daxx, pRb, and p53. The latter is recruited into the PML-NBs in response to Ras activation, IR, or UV light and As2O3 (12Carbone R. Pearson M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G.

PML is critical for the proper activation of p53 transcriptional activity and for its apoptotic activity (12Carbone R. Pearson M. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G.

Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism for this activation has attracted much interest. To this end, several p53 regulators have been found to be associated with the PML-NBs. The CREB-binding protein (CBP) is recruited into the PML-NBs where it acetylates p53 at lysine 382 (Lys-382), thereby enhancing its transcriptional activity (16Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). This acetylation is facilitated by the prior phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-46 by the human serine/threonine kinase homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2), which is also localized to the PML-NBs (17D'orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Cohen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2001; 4: 1-10Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar). More recently, these modifications were also proposed to contribute to p53 stabilization (19Bischof O. Kirsh O. Pearson M. Itahana K. Pelicci P.G. Dejean A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3358-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the substitution of Lys-382 to arginine reduced, but did not abolish, the induction of p53 transcriptional activation by PML (16Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Further, Ser-46 is not conserved between human to mouse p53, and Ser-46 phosphorylation is not triggered in response to IR (18Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Scmitz L.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 4: 1-10Crossref Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Thus, although these modifications are important for the regulation of p53, they may not be sufficient to explain the severe impairment of p53 transcriptional activity in the PML null mice and the high resistance of these mice to IR-induced apoptosis (15Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 20Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that an additional mechanism(s) exists to explain this cooperation. Because Mdm2 is the major player in p53 regulation, and PML is a positive regulator of p53, we investigated the possibility that PML may activate p53 by antagonizing the inhibitory effects of Mdm2. Here we demonstrate that PML is essential for the accumulation of p53 in response to DNA damage. This action of PML involves the neutralization of Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of p53 and the inhibition of p53-mediated apoptosis. PML impairs Hdm2 effects, at least in part, by prolonging the phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20. This process is facilitated by the recruitment of Chk2 into the PML-NBs. Overall our results demonstrate a new mechanistic explanation for the activation of p53 by PML in response to DNA damage. Cell Culture and Transfection Assays—H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells, Saos2 osteosarcoma cells, and NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (21Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Balerini P.

Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), 293 kidney epithelial cells, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum. As2O3 was kept as 1 mm stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated with 0.1–1 μm As2O3 (4 h for NB4), and where indicated, cells were also exposed to IR (5 Gy). DNA damage was induced by incubation of cells with mitomycin C (3 μg/ml, Sigma) or IR (5–10 Gy).

Immunoprecipitation assay was carried out essentially as described previously (6Goldberg Z. Vogt Sionov R. Berger M. Zwang Y. Perets R. Van Etten R.A. Oren M. Taya Y. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3715-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For the in vivo ubiquitination assay, H1299 cells were transfected with a combination of expression plasmids for p53 (1 μg), Hdm2 (1 μg), and PML-IV (3 μg). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN, 150 μm, Calbiochem) for 4 h and with As2O3 (1 μm; Sigma) for 4 h where indicated. Cells were harvested and cell extracts resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting with anti-p53 antibodies (DO1 and PAb1801). The p53 ubiquitin conjugates were detected by the smear and high molecular weight bands of p53 as described previously (26Vogt Sionov R. Coen S. Goldberg Z. Berger M. Bercovich B. Ben Neriah Y. Ciechanover A. Haupt Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 5869-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in this study were: anti-human p53 monoclonal antibodies PAb1801 and DO1, anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies CM5 (NovoCastra), anti-PML monoclonal antibody PG-M3 (DAKO), antiphospho-p53 Ser-20 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-Chk2 (DCS-273, Sigma; H-300, Santa Cruz); anti-actin (Ac-40 Sigma), anti-Bax (Ab-5, Oncogene Research Products), anti-α-tubulin DM1A (Sigma), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), anti-GFP (Roche Applied Science), and Envision peroxidase anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG anti-mouse (Dako Corp.). Immunofluorescent Staining Analysis—For immunofluorescent staining, H1299 and Saos-2 cells were plated on glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were fixed in cold methanol and stained with anti-FLAG or anti-PML (PGM3) followed by Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. GFP-p53 and GFP-PML-IV were detected by GFP fluorescence. DNA was stained with DAPI (4′, 6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The stained cells were observed with a fluorescent microscope (Nikon). Apoptotic Assay—The apoptotic assay was carried out essentially as described previously (24Unger T. Juven-Gershon T. Moallem E. Berger M. Vogt Sionov R. Lozano G. Oren M. Haupt Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by a cell sorter (FACSCalibur) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). PML Is Critical for p53 Accumulation in Response to DNA Damage—p53 protein is accumulated in response to DNA damage or constitutive Ras activation (1Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). These stress conditions also trigger the activation of p53 by PML (13Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 15Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 16Pearson M. Carbone R. Sebastiani C. Cioce M. Fagioli M. Saito S. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Minucci S. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 2000; 406: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). It was therefore tempting to suggest that PML activates p53 by enhancing its accumulation. To address this question under physiological conditions, the accumulation of endogenous p53 in response to DNA damage was measured. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from normal mice (PML+) or from PML null mice (PML–) were exposed to mitomycin C (3 μg/ml). At different times (3–12 h) after exposure the steady state levels of p53 was measured by Western blot analysis using anti-p53 polyclonal antibodies (CM5). In normal cells, p53 levels were elevated by 7 h and continued to accumulate at 12 h after treatment (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 5, and 7). By contrast, the accumulation of p53 in PML null cells was dramatically impaired even after 12 h (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 6, and 8). Similar results were obtained when cells were exposed to a different DNA damage agent, IR (5 Gy). In normal MEFs, the accumulation of p53 was seen clearly by 1 h after irradiation and was further increased by 2 h (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5). On the other hand in PML-deficient MEFs the accumulation of p53 was severely impaired (Fig. 1B, lanes 8 and 9). The maximal levels of p53 in these cells were significantly lower than in normal cells (Fig. 1B). To strengthen this finding, the PML-deficient MEFs were reconstituted with PML. For this purpose, cells were infected with retrovirus expressing either GFP-PML or GFP alone. Forty-eight hours after infection cells were exposed to IR (5 Gy), and p53 protein levels were monitored. Consistent with the results in Fig. 1B, efficient accumulation of p53 in response to IR was seen in the PML-reconstituted cells but not in the GFP-expressing control cells (Fig. 1C). Further, we examined the transcriptional activity of p53 in these cells in response to IR. To this end, the induction of the p53 target gene, Bax, was compared between MEFs lacking PML and the PML-reconstituted cells. The induction of Bax was measured in the cell extract from the experiment described in Fig. 1C. Elevation of the Bax protein was seen in response to IR only in PML-reconstituted cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 5–8) but not in the control cells (lanes 1–4). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate a critical role for PML in the rapid and efficient accumulation of active p53 in response to DNA damage. PML Protects p53 from Inhibition by Hdm2—How does PML promote p53 accumulation in response to DNA damage? Because Hdm2 is the major determinant in the degradation of p53 (27Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar, 28Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar), we asked whether PML activates p53 and enhances its accumulation by antagonizing the inhibitory effects of Hdm2 on p53. This notion was addressed at the levels of p53 protein stability and p53 activity. PML Impairs Hdm2-dependent p53 Degradation—To test whether PML protects p53 from Hdm2-mediated degradation, H1299 cells were transfected with low amounts of p53 expression plasmid alone (Fig. 2A, lane 1), together with Hdm2 (lanes 2–5), or together with Hdm2 and increasing amounts of PML-IV (lanes 3–5). The PML-IV isoform (according to the new nomenclature for PML (29Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont S.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar)) was used throughout this study. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, and the expression level of the p53 protein was determined by Western blot analysis. Co-expression of Hdm2 markedly reduced the expression level of p53 (Fig. 2A, lane 2); however, the addition of PML-IV protected p53, at least partially (lanes 3–5). Thus, co-expression of PML-IV protects p53 from the rapid and efficient degradation by Hdm2. Because PML interacts with p53 (14Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneider C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 15Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), the requirement for this interaction for the protection of p53 from Hdm2 was determined. To this end, two PML mutants, PML-RARα and PML-RBCC, which are deficient in p53 binding (15Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), were compared with wt PML for their ability to protect p53 from Hdm2-mediated degradation. The degradation assay described in Fig. 2A was used for this purpose. Although wt PML protected p53 from degradation by Hdm2, neither PML-RARα nor PML-RBCC was able to protect p53 from degradation (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that interaction between p53 and PML is essential for its protection from Hdm2. Mdm2 promotes p53 degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (27Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3705) Google Scholar, 28Kubbutat M.H.G. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2839) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) of Mdm2, mediated by the RING-finger domain, is crucial for this function (30Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The partial protection of p53 from Hdm2-mediated degradation raised the question whether PML-IV interferes with the ubiquitination of p53 by Hdm2. To address this question in vivo, H1299 cells were transfected with p53 alone, p53 and Hdm2, or both together with PML-IV. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with ALLN for4hto prevent p53 degradation. To measure the effect of endogenous PML on this activity of Hdm2, cells were treated with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) for 4 h, which activates PML by promoting its SUMO (small ubiquitin modifier) modification (31Muller S. Matunis M.J. Dejean A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Following these treatments, cells were harvested and p53 ubiquitin conjugates were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-p53 antibodies. Co-transfection of Hdm2 together with p53 enhanced the ubiquitination of p53 as judged by the high molecular weight bands and smear (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). The treatment of cells with As2O3 impaired the in vivo ubiquitination of p53 by Hdm2 (lane 3). The addition of exogenous PML-IV strongly reduced the extent of p53 ubiquitination (Fig. 2C, lane 4) and, when combined with As2O3 treatment (lane 5), totally blocked this effect of Hdm2. These results show that PML protects p53 by preventing its in vivo ubiquitination by Hdm2. PML Relieves the Inhibitory Effect of Hdm2 on p53-dependent Apoptosis—Our finding that PML-IV protects p53 from Hdm2-mediated degradation prompted us to evaluate the biological consequences of this protection. Because PML plays an important role in p53-dependent apoptosis (15Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and Hdm2 inhibits this activity of p53 (22Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Chen J. Wu X. Lin J. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2445-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we chose to examine whether PML relieves p53-dependent apoptosis from inhibition by Hdm2. For this purpose we employed a transient transfection apoptotic assay for p53 (22Haupt Y. Barak Y. Oren M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1596-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Initially, the cooperation between p53 and PML-IV in the induction of apoptosis was measured in H1299 cells transfected with p53 or PML-IV alone or with both together. Sixty hours post-transfection, cells were harvested, stained for p53 or PML-IV, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis induced by the transfection conditions or by GFP was determined by transfecting H1299 cells with expression plasmid for GFP alone. The GFP-positive subpopulation exhibited an average of 3 ± 1.2% apoptosis (data not shown). Expression of wt p53 induced 10% apoptosis (Fig. 3A, I), whereas PML-IV induced only 3% (Fig. 3A, II). However, co-expression of p53 and PML-IV induced 26% apoptosis, indicating a synergistic effect (Fig. 3A, III and IV). These results are in accordance with the role of PML-IV in p53-dependent apoptosis (15Guo A. Salomoni P. Luo J. Shih A. Zhong S. Gu W. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The effect of PML-IV on the inhibitory effect of Hdm2 on p53-dependent apoptosis was next determined by introducing Hdm2 into this apoptotic assay. In this case, H1299 cells were transfected with larger amounts of p53 expression plasmid (3 μg) to induce at least 20% apoptosis (Fig. 3B, I). The addition of Hdm2 expression plasmid (5 μg) reduced the level of apoptosis by 50% (Fig. 3B, II), but this inhibition was relieved, to a large extent, by co-transfection with PML-IV expression plasmid (3 μg). These results (summarized in Fig. 3B, IV) demonstrate that PML-IV protects p53 apoptotic activity from the inhibitory effect of Hdm2. Taken together these data support the notion that the accumulation and activation of p53 by PML-IV involves the neutralization of Hdm2. PML Promotes the Phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 —Next we searched for a mechanism to explain the neutralization of Hdm2 by PML. We and others have previously shown that phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-20 plays a critical role in the modulation of the p53-Hdm2 feedback loop (reviewed in Ref. 33Bartek J. Falck J. Lukas J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It was tempting to suggest that PML protects p53 from Hdm2 by facilitating this phosphorylation. To test this notion we employed different experimental systems. First, H1299 cells lacking p53 expression were transfected with expression plasmids for p53 alone or together with increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged PML expression plasmid (1 and 3 μg). Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were exposed to IR (10 Gy), and 30 min later they were harvested for Western blot analysis. As a control, cells transfected with p53 alone were kept untreated. The extent of p53 phosphorylation on Ser-20 was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-p53 phospho-Ser-20 antibody. The transfection of p53 alone induced significant levels of phosphorylation, presumably because of the effective DNA damage signal generated by the transient transfection of DNA (34Huang L.C. Clarkin K.C. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4827-4832Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 35Renzing J. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1865-1868PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, lane 1). This relatively high level of phosphorylation was not increased further after exposure to IR, at least not at this time point. However, the addition of PML increased the extent of phosphorylation (by 2-fold as measured by densitometry; Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). Higher levels of PML did not cause a further"

However, the mechanism leading to the production of sCD40 has never been investigated. Here, we show that the engagement of mCD40 on the surface of B lymphocytes by anti-CD40 antibody led to enhanced sCD40 release associated with decreased amounts of mCD40. This sCD40 production was not affected by vesicular traffic inhibitors but was completely blocked by a broad-spectrum synthetic metalloproteinase (MP) inhibitor (GM6001) or a membrane-anchored MP-specific inhibitor (dec-RVKR-cmk). Recombinant MP disintegrin tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE) cleaved the purified CD40 ectodomain/Fc chimeric protein in vitro, giving rise to an sCD40 form similar to that shed from B cell cultures. Moreover, spontaneous production of sCD40 by mCD40-transfected human embryonic kidney cells (constitutively expressing TACE) was enhanced by the overexpression of TACE and abrogated by co-transfection with a dominant-negative TACE mutant. These results provide strong evidence that sCD40 production is an active process regulated by the engagement of mCD40 and its proteolytic cleavage by TACE or a related MP disintegrin. Given the antagonistic activity of sCD40 on the CD40/CD154 interaction, this shedding mechanism might represent an important negative feedback control of CD40 functions.

It has been reported that upon ligation with CD40, CD154 is endocytosed and its mRNA expression is down-regulated (22van Kooten C. Gaillard C. Galizzi J.P. Hermann P. Fossiez F. Banchereau J. Blanchard D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Although this mechanism is considered to be the major way the CD40/CD154 interaction is down-regulated, the production of a soluble form of CD40 (sCD40) could also be involved, because this molecule has been found in the supernatant of B lymphocytes co-cultured with activated T lymphocytes (22van Kooten C.

Many cell-membrane proteins are subjected to limited proteolysis (called shedding) that gives rise to soluble forms consisting of the extracellular domain of the protein (for review see Refs. 23Hooper N.M.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism leading to sCD40 production by B lymphocytes. We provide evidence that the triggering of CD40 is sufficient to induce the rapid release of significant amounts of sCD40 and an associated decrease in the amount of membrane-anchored CD40 (mCD40) expression by either Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines or purified tonsil B cells. Finally, we demonstrated that the ADAM family member TACE cleaved a CD40-Fc chimeric molecule in vitro or mCD40 on the cell surface, leading to the production of its soluble counterpart. This processing might represent a way to both regulate the CD40 density at the cell membrane and generate a CD40 antagonist, ultimately achieving efficient negative feedback control of the CD40/CD154 interaction. Total B cells were isolated from tonsils by T-cell rosetting as described previously (43Defrance T. Vanbervliet B. Aubry J.P. Takebe Y. Arai N. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Lee F. Arai K. de Vries J.E. Banchereau J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1135-1141PubMed Google Scholar). B cells were always >95% pure as assessed by flow cytometry with anti-CD19 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and anti-CD3 phycoerythrin (all from BD Biosciences, Marseille, France). The human B lymphoblastoid cell line JY and the Jurkat T cell line were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 mm l-glutamine. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% FCS and 2 mm l-glutamine. The agonistic MAB89 anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (44Valle A. Zuber C.E. Defrance T. Djossou O. De Rie M. Banchereau J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Schering Plough Laboratory (Dardilly, France). Anti-CD40 3B2 and 10C6 mAbs, and anti-leukemia inhibitory factor 1F10 mAb (used as an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody) were produced in our laboratory. The non-blocking anti-CD40 FITC-conjugated mAb (clone EA-5) used to reveal mCD40 expression and the anti-TACE polyclonal antibody were both purchased from France Biochem (Meudon, France). The anti-actin polyclonal antibody was from Sigma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, brefeldin A, chloroquin, and monensin were from Sigma. The MP inhibitor GM6001 was purchased from France Biochem and the active recombinant tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) was a generous gift from Dr. A. Noël (Liège, Belgium). The inhibitor of furin convertase dec-RVKR-cmk was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Coger S.A, Paris, France) and the TACE peptide substrate (NH2-LAQAVRSSSR-CONH2) was produced by Cybergene (Evry, France). Twenty four-well culture plates were coated with 10 μg/ml (unless otherwise stated) of anti-CD40 MAB89 or isotype-matched irrelevant control mAb overnight at room temperature in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (0.2 m NaHCO3, 0.8 m Na2CO3, pH 9.6). The wells were then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then in RPMI 1640 without FCS. The JY cell line or tonsil B cells were washed in RPMI 1640 without FCS (to avoid inhibition of MP activity by the inhibitors present in the FCS), and plated (0.5 × 106 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 without FCS and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 IU/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). The cells were then cultured for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell viability at the end of the culture period was always controlled by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. Cell culture supernatants were spun for 10 min at 15,000 rpm to avoid contamination with the mCD40 that was associated with cell membrane fragments. The sCD40 level in samples was measured with an ELISA set up in our laboratory as follows. Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Merck, Strasbourg, France) were coated with the anti-CD40 MAB89 (1 μg/ml) in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer. The standards for the calibration curves were determined with recombinant sCD40 (consisting of the extracellular domain of CD40, amino acids 1–193 (22van Kooten C. Gaillard C. Galizzi J.P. Hermann P. Fossiez F. Banchereau J. Blanchard D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), produced in transfected COS cells and purified on a MAB89 affinity column). The binding of sCD40 was then revealed with the biotinylated 3B2 anti-CD40 mAb (0.5 μg/ml). Steptavidin peroxidase (Amersham, 1:1000) was used to develop the reaction with tetramethyl benzidine in phosphatecitrate buffer. Each sample was measured in duplicate and the mean concentration was calculated. The detection limit of the ELISA was around 3 pg/ml. Cells were harvested, washed in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and stained for surface CD40 expression with a non-blocking FITC-conjugated anti-CD40 (clone EA-5) antibody able to recognize CD40 even in the presence of CD40-bound MAB89 (data not shown). The relative mean fluorescence intensity (relative MFI) was calculated with the following formula: (MFI (anti-CD40 FITC) – MFI (isotypic control Ab))/MFI (isotypic control Ab). For the detection of total TACE expression, 106 tonsil B cells, JY, or HEK cells were fixed in 150 μl of fluorescence-activated cell sorter lysing solution (BD Biosciences), washed with PBS, and permeabilized with permeabilizing solution following the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Cells were then stained for both membrane and intracytoplasmic TACE with an anti-TACE phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody (R&D systems, Abingdon, United Kingdom). JY cells or tonsil B cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and subjected to cell-surface protein biotinylation with sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After extensive washes, the cells were resuspended in culture plates coated with MAB89 or control Ab. sCD40 was allowed to accumulate for 24 h in the culture supernatant that was then harvested and spun down for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and resuspended in lysate buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin (all from Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Total cell lysate or culture supernatant were equally split for subsequent immunoprecipitation with Sepharose beads covalently coupled either with anti-CD40 10C6 mAb or control mAb. Immunoprecipitated materials were then run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and the biotinylated proteins were revealed with streptavidin peroxidase (1:2000 final dilution). The positive bands were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates were prepared from 10 × 106 cells (JY, tonsil B cells, or Jurkat cells) as described above. When mentioned, MP inhibitor GM6001 was added to the lysis buffer at 20 μm to enable the detection of either the pro- or the mature form of TACE, as previously described by Schlöndorff and colleagues (62Schlondorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The insoluble material was then pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Normalized amounts of total protein (5 μg per lane) were loaded in SDS buffer under non-reducing conditions onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, as required for TACE to be recognized by the antibody. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween supplemented with 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with 5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-TACE or anti-actin antibody as indicated. After extensive washes in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween, the blots were probed with goat anti-rabbit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, then washed to remove unbound material. The bands were visualized with an ECL chemiluminescence kit. The CD40-Fc chimeric protein (100 ng) comprising the extracellular domain of CD40, amino acids 1–193, fused to the Fc fragment of a human IgG1 (22van Kooten C. Gaillard C. Galizzi J.P. Hermann P. Fossiez F. Banchereau J. Blanchard D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), was incubated with 1 μg/ml recombinant TACE (R & D) with or without 100 μm GM6001 or TACE-specific substrate peptide for 5 h at 37 °C in 25 μl of total reaction mixture. The mixture was then fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Recombinant sCD40 was also loaded as a control. After semi-dry transfer, the labeling was revealed with anti-CD40 H-10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody followed by sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and ECL. Plasmid Constructs—The cDNA for CD40 has already been described elsewhere (22van Kooten C. Gaillard C. Galizzi J.P. Hermann P. Fossiez F. Banchereau J. Blanchard D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged TACE and TACEΔM cDNA, respectively, encoding the full-length and a dominant-negative form of TACE lacking the metalloprotease catalytic domain, have also been previously described (45Itai T. Tanaka M. Nagata S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2074-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transfection Experiments—Transfections were set up using the calcium-phosphate precipitation technique. Briefly, 4 × 105 HEK cells were seeded in plates with 6 flat-bottom wells, 24 h before transfection. Fresh medium was then added and the cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with the transfection mixture: 0.5 or 0.25 μg of CD40 cDNA with or without 0.1–9 μg of TACE or TACEΔM cDNA in transfection medium (Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.05, with 1 m CaCl2). After 18 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS and sCD40 was allowed to accumulate in the culture medium for 48 h. The culture supernatant was then harvested and spun 15 min at 15,000 rpm. CD40 Engagement on B Lymphocytes Induces sCD40 Release and Decreases the Amount of mCD40 —The production of sCD40 was first reported in co-cultures of B lymphocytes with activated T cells (22van Kooten C. Gaillard C. Galizzi J.P. Hermann P. Fossiez F. Banchereau J. Blanchard D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of this secretion was not investigated. To assess the possible role of CD40 engagement in sCD40 production by B cells, we activated Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells (JY cell line) or freshly isolated human tonsil B cells with an anti-CD40 mAb by culturing the cells in plastic plates that were coated with the mAb. After 24 h, the level of sCD40 in the supernatants was determined by a specific ELISA, and the expression of mCD40 was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 1, the activation of JY cells and tonsil B cells by the anti-CD40 mAb (clone MAB89) induced sCD40 production in a dose-dependent manner, whereas an irrelevant isotype-matched mAb had no effect. As noted in previous studies (22van Kooten C. Gaillard C. Galizzi J.P. Hermann P. Fossiez F. Banchereau J. Blanchard D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 46Bjorck P. Braesch-Andersen S. Paulie S. Immunology. 1994; 83: 430-437PubMed Google Scholar), we observed a minimal basal production of sCD40 (around 200 pg/ml) by non-activated JY cells, and much higher sCD40 levels secreted upon CD40 triggering by these cells than by tonsil B cells. In parallel, mCD40 staining was diminished on the surface of tonsil B cells and to a lesser extent on JY cells, when activated with coated anti-CD40 (middle panels). This was because of a decrease in the amount of mCD40 rather than to the masking of mCD40 detection by putative residual anti-CD40 mAb from the coating (MAB89), because the antibody used for cell labeling (clone EA5) recognized mCD40 even in the presence of MAB89 (data not shown). As shown in the right panels of Fig. 1, sCD40 production was induced within the first 3 h following activation with the coated anti-CD40 antibody in both B cell types. sCD40 release was associated with a prompt down-regulation of mCD40 staining (data not shown). Soluble CD40 Is Generated through Proteolytic Cleavage of mCD40 by a Membrane-anchored MP—The mechanism of the production of the sCD40 form has not been known. A recent study suggested the CD40 mRNA might be alternatively spliced, leading to the expression of a truncated CD40 missing the intracellular and transmembrane domains (47Tone M. Tone Y. Fairchild P.J. Wykes M. Waldmann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1751-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, our results showing a rapid production of sCD40 upon activation and the concomitant disappearance of mCD40 pledged in favor of a direct shedding of CD40 from the cell surface. This latter process, unlike the de novo synthesis and secretion of a soluble truncated form of CD40, should not involve the intracellular transport of the soluble molecule and should thus be resistant to inhibitors of the Golgi and vesicular traffic. Accordingly, the addition for 6 h of brefeldin A, the weak amine chloroquin, or monensin to B lymphocytes activated by the anti-CD40 mAb did not affect sCD40 production (Fig. 2A). This result suggested that sCD40 production was the result of the direct shedding of CD40 from the cell surface. To formally demonstrate this hypothesis, JY cells were surface-labeled using sulfosuccinimidobiotin. As depicted in Fig. 2B, the engagement of cell-surface CD40 by MAB89 led to the specific recovery of a 28-kDa molecular species corresponding to the CD40 ectodomain, after the anti-CD40 was immunoprecipitated from the cell culture supernatant. The proteolytic cleavage of numerous surface receptors is the result of the MP activity of the MMP or ADAMs family. We therefore next investigated the involvement of these enzymes in sCD40 regulation by testing the effect of two MP inhibitors in our culture model: GM6001, a broad spectrum synthetic inhibitor of MP, and recombinant TIMP-2, a natural inhibitor of MMP-2, which has also been shown to inhibit other MMPs, such as collagenase and gelatinase (48Kolkenbrock H. Hecker-Kia A. Orgel D. Ulbrich N. Will H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 71-76Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 3A, increasing doses of GM6001 inhibited the sCD40 production induced by CD40 ligation in both JY and tonsil B cells. Furthermore, the addition of GM6001 enabled the mCD40 expression to return to basal levels in both cell types (Fig. 3B). The decrease in mCD40 expression after CD40 ligation and its inhibition by GM6001 was confirmed using cell-surface biotinylation experiments followed by a specific CD40 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3C). In sharp contrast, TIMP-2 did not have any effect, either on sCD40 shedding or on mCD40 expression (Fig. 3, A and B), even at 200 μm, a concentration fully preventing the gelatinase activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in gelatin zymography assays (data not shown). Accordingly, stimulation of tonsil B or JY cells with anti-CD40 mAb coated on plastic never increased the levels of the MMP-2 or MMP-9 gelatinase activities found in culture supernatant, which is in contrast to their strong up-regulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which did not affect sCD40 production (data not shown). These results supported the idea that CD40 was cleaved proteolytically by an MP that was different from gelatinases and collagenases (data not shown). Transmembrane MPs of both the membrane-type MMP (MTMMP) and the ADAM family are converted to their active forms by an intracellular furin convertase of the paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme family (for review see Ref. 49Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Peptidylchloromethyl"

The function of the transcriptional activator, Clock, is necessary in both Drosophila and mammals for the expression of many core clock components. We demonstrate in Drosophila that Clock misexpression in nai;ve brain regions induces circadian gene expression. This includes major components of the pacemaker program, as Clock also activates the rhythmic expression of cryptochrome, a gene that CLOCK normally represses. Moreover, this ectopic clock expression has potent effects on behavior, radically altering locomotor activity patterns. We propose that Clock is uniquely able to induce and organize the core elements of interdependent feedback loops necessary for circadian rhythms."

The N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) is contained within a SOX consensus calmodulin (CaM) binding region, thereby implicating CaM in nuclear import of SOX9. By fluorescence spectroscopy and glutaraldehyde cross-linking, we show that the SOX9 HMG domain and CaM interact in vitro. The formation of a SOX9·CaM binary complex is calcium-dependent and is accompanied by a conformational change in SOX9. A CaM antagonist, calmidazolium chloride (CDZ), was observed to block CaM recognition of SOX9 in vitro and inhibit both nuclear import and consequent transcriptional activity of SOX9 in treated cells. The significance of the SOX9-CaM interaction was highlighted by analysis of a missense SOX9 mutation, A158T, identified from a XY female with campomelic dysplasia/autosomal sex reversal (CD/SRA). This mutant binds importin β normally despite defective nuclear import. Fluorescence and quenching studies indicate that in the unbound state, the A158T mutant shows a similar conformation to that of the WT SOX9, but in the presence of CaM, the mutant undergoes unusual conformational changes. Furthermore, SOX9-mediated transcriptional activation by cells expressing the A158T mutant is more sensitive to CDZ than cells expressing WT SOX9. These results suggest first that CaM is involved in the nuclear transport of SOX9 in a process likely to involve direct interaction and second, that CD/SRA can arise, at least in part, from a defect in CaM recognition, ultimately leading to reduced ability of SOX9 to activate transcription of cartilage and testes-forming genes.

During early human and mouse embryogenesis, SOX9 is expressed in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells in both sexes, but by gestational week 7, at the onset of SRY expression in male embryos, SOX9 moves into the nucleus (10Shen J.H. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Here, SOX9 activates the gene for mullerian inhibitory substance, which is required for the regression of the female reproductive system (10Shen J.H. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). SOX9 also activates the testis determining gene, SF1 (10Shen J.H. Ingraham H.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of nuclear import of SOX9 in particular and SOX transcription factors generally is likely to play a critical role in their regulation of gene expression given their shared HMG box. SOX proteins contain two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) located at the N and C termini of the HMG box (Fig. 1). The N-terminal NLS resembles the bipartite NLS identified in nucleoplasmin, a small nuclear protein that consists of two highly basic regions separated by 9–12 residues (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK) (12Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The C-terminal NLS of SOX proteins resembles the NLS of the simian virus (SV) 40 large T antigen, which consists of a short stretch of basic residues (PKKKRK) (13Makkerh J.P.S. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1025-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The fact that both the N- and C-terminal NLS are highly conserved throughout the whole SOX family suggests that the mechanism of nuclear import of SOX proteins is likely to be conserved. Nuclear import of NLS-containing proteins occurs in two steps. The first step requires recognition of the NLS-containing protein by the transport receptor and docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The second step is an energy-dependent translocation of the NLS-containing protein through the NPC, which requires GTP (14Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Moroianu J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 89-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conventional nuclear import pathways, the transport receptor importin α binds to the NLS in the protein. Docking of the protein to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC requires importin β, which binds to the importin α–NLS-protein complex. Importin β interacts with multiple nuclear pore proteins (known as nucleoporins) at the NPC, which then facilitates translocation of the importin/NLS-containing protein complex through the NPC (14Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Moroianu J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 89-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC requires multiple docking and undocking reactions involving importin β and nucleoporins, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Ran, and several modifying proteins (16Paschal B.M. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 925-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Once the complex is translocated to the nuclear side of the NPC, binding of Ran GTP to importin β causes dissociation and release of the importin α/β·NLS·protein complex. Whereas most protein NLSs bind to importin α, several bind directly to importin β (17Chan C.K. Hubner S. Hu W. Jans D.A. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 1204-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Palacios I. Hetzer M. Adam S.A. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including the C-terminal NLS of the SRY HMG box and the SOX9 HMG box (19Preiss S. Argentaro A. Clayton A. John A. Jans D.A. Ogata T. Nagai T. Barroso I. Schafer A.J. Harley V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27864-27872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Forwood J.K. Harley V. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46575-46582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This indicates that the importin/Ran GTP-dependent pathway may mediate the nuclear import of SOX proteins by direct binding of the transport receptor, importin β, to the C-terminal NLS located in the HMG box. The N-terminal NLS is also a functional NLS, but this NLS is not recognized by importins α or β (20Forwood J.K. Harley V. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46575-46582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21Harley V.R. Layfield S. Mitchell C.L. Forwood J.K. Briggs L.J. McDowall S.G. Jans D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7045-7050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms of nuclear protein import have been described (14Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 231-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Moroianu J. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1999; 9: 89-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium plays an important role in protein nuclear import. When cytosolic calcium is depleted from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (by treatment of cells with thapsigargin or ionophores), both signal-mediated and passive diffusion of proteins across the nuclear pore complex is inhibited. Sweitzer and Hanover (23Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), using a digitininpermeabilized HeLa cell assay system observed a similar effect on nuclear accumulation of the intrinsically fluorescent algal protein, B-phycoerythrin (to which the NLS of the SV 40 large T antigen is linked) (22Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 13: 5-14Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). After treatment with thapsigargin, nuclear accumulation of proteins occurred only in the presence of GTP, indicative of a Ran GTP-dependent nuclear import pathway (22Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 13: 5-14Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, at high cytosolic calcium levels, nuclear import occurs in the absence of GTP, suggesting an alternative Ran GTP-independent nuclear import pathway (23Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). One of the major cytosolic Ca2+-binding proteins is calmodulin (CaM), an intracellular calcium receptor, which is located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (24Bachs O. Agell N. Carafoli E. Cell Calcium. 1994; 16: 39-96Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). CaM antagonists, such as calmidazolium (CDZ), W7, and W12, block GTP-independent nuclear import of the SV40 large T antigen NLS at elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels in permeabilized HeLa cells (23Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The addition of recombinant CaM and ATP to cells restored nuclear import (23Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, Sweitzer and Hanover (23Sweitzer T.D. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14574-14579Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) proposed a model where, in the presence of cytoplasmic calcium, CaM stimulates nuclear import of proteins in a GTP-independent manner. CaM itself has unusual nuclear import properties (25Pruschy M. Ju Y. Spitz L. Carafoli E. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CaM import is inhibited by the addition of wheat germ agglutinin and chilling (which inhibits nucleopore complex-mediated transport and passive diffusion respectively) in a permeabilized assay system suggesting that CaM import is facilitated. However, ATP depletion was found to not affect CaM import indicating that it is not an active process (25Pruschy M. Ju Y. Spitz L. Carafoli E. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hence the actual mechanism of CaM nuclear import is not clearly understood but may involve associations with CaM-binding proteins. Studies have shown that CaM interacts directly with the C-terminal domain of p21Cip1, an inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk4 (26Taules M. Rius E. Talaya D. Lopez-Girona A. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Taules M. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Rius E. Estanyol J.M. Casanovas O. Sacks D.B.

This domain of interaction has a highly basic amphiphilic region, which is characteristic of CaM binding domains, and also contains several putative NLSs (27Taules M. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Rius E.

Treatment of normal rat kidney cells with the CaM antagonist, W7, resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation of p21Cip1 (26Taules M. Rius E. Talaya D. Lopez-Girona A. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33279-33286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Taules M. Rodriguez-Vilarrupla A. Rius E. Estanyol J.M. Casanovas O. Sacks D.B. Perez-Paya E. Bachs O. Agell N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24445-24448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), indicating that CaM may be able to mediate nuclear import of proteins that contain classical NLS signals. The SRY HMG box interacts with CaM in a calcium-dependent manner in vitro (28Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Hextall P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The interaction of SRY with CaM was mapped to a 25-amino acid sequence, located in helix 1 of the SRY HMG box (Fig. 1) (28Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Hextall P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The residues within this domain consist mainly of hydrophobic and basic amino acids that overlap the bipartite N-terminal NLS region, which along with the SV40-like NLS is required for maximal nuclear import of SRY and SOX9 (29Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This domain is highly conserved in the SOX family at both the amino acid sequence and structural levels forming a basic amphiphilic α-helix (Fig. 1). In this present study, we report that SOX9 can directly bind Ca2+-CaM in a 1:1 complex and that this interaction results in a conformational change in the structure of the SOX9 HMG box. Treatment of cultured cells that express SOX9 with CaM antagonists reveal that CaM is involved in mediating SOX9 nuclear import and consequent transcriptional activation activity. This suggests that CaM, along with the transport receptor, importin β, regulate the nuclear localization of SOX9 and other SRY/SOX proteins. SOX9 HMG Protein Production and Purification—Recombinant SOX9 HMG protein (amino acids 101–184) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described (30Mertin S. McDowall S.G. Harley V.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) with a modification to the protocol as follows. SOX9 HMG protein was extracted from cell pellets that were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by sonication in 100 ml of HEDA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The sample was then brought to a final concentration of 450 mm NaCl and mixed with a 0.1 volume of 50% DEAE-Sephadex equilibrated in HEDA, 450 mm NaCl for 10 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation (Sorvall RC5B GS3 rotor; 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C) the salt concentration of the supernatant was reduced to <0.2 m by diluting the sample volume 2.5-fold with HEDA buffer and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. The sample was injected onto a 10-ml SP-Sepharose FPLC column pre-equilibrated in HEDA buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted over 40 min with a salt gradient of HEDA buffer containing 200–1000 mm NaCl and 5-ml fractions were collected. SOX9 HMG protein elutes in fractions at about 0.7 m NaCl. SOX9 HMG protein was desalted and concentrated using Amicon Centricon 3 columns. Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford assay reagent kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Gel and buffer composition were essentially as for SDS-PAGE in standard Tris glycine buffers but lacking SDS, and consisting of a 12.5% separating gel and a 5% stacking gel (28Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Hextall P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were made to a final volume of 20 μl, typically containing 1 μg(3 μm) of CaM (Calbiochem) and 3–4 μg (43 μm) of purified SOX9 HMG box protein or 1 μg of protein kinase II (PKII) peptide (Calbiochem). Reactions were incubated for 1 h on ice prior to electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels were stained overnight with Neuhoff stain (31Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Pardowitz I. Arold N. Ehrhardt W. Taube D. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking of CaM and Full-length SOX9 —SOX9 was synthesized in vitro with incorporation of [35S]methionine ([35S]Met) using a TnT T7/T3 transcription and translation kit (Promega). Cross-linking reagent, 0.01% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) was added to 0.025 μg of SOX9 protein translate in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and increasing amounts of CaM (0.025–2.5 μm). The reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature followed by inactivation with SDS sample buffer at 95 °C. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5%) and detected by autoradiography. For experiments analyzing the amount of CaCl2 required for CaM-SOX9 interaction, calcium was removed from the SOX9 translate by passing the protein through a CentriSep gel filtration column (Princeton Separations). To reactions containing 1 nm SOX9, CaM was added to 5 μm, and increasing amounts of CaCl2 (2–50 μm) were added to replica tubes and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min. Crosslinking reagent, glutaraldehyde (Sigma Aldrich), was then added to a final concentration of 0.01% and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was inactivated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 2 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and detected by autoradiography. Measurement of Fluorescence Spectra—Fluorescence spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a SPEX Fluorolog-τ2 frequency domain spectrofluorometer using 0.5 ml of cells. The solutions contained 0.58 μm purified SOX9 HMG protein, 0.94 μm annealed oligonucleotides, or 0.7 μm CaM. The double-stranded WT DNA (S9CONwtF (GGGTTAACAGAACAATGGAATCTGGTAGA) and its complement, S9CONwtR) used contained the high affinity SOX9 DNA binding site (underlined) (29Sudbeck P. Scherer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27848-27852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Double-stranded mutant DNA consisted of AllMuTF (GGGGTTAACGTCCGCGGTAATCTGGTAGA) and its complement, AllMuTR. SOX9 was incubated with CaM on ice for 30 min in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm CaCl2 and fluorescence measurements were taken. DNA was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for a further 30 min before measurements were taken. Excitation of tryptophan residues was accomplished using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm from a 450 W xenon lamp. Emission spectra were measured in the wavelength range of 300–500 nm, and through a polarizer oriented at the magic angle (54.7°). The spectral band pass of excitation and emission was 5 nm. Spectra were fully corrected for the wavelength response of the detection system. The cell block was maintained at 20 °C with a circulating water bath. Acrylamide quenching was performed using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm to avoid tyrosine excitation and distortion by acrylamide. 10-μl aliquots of 4 m acrylamide were added successively to 400 μlofa2 μm protein sample, and the fluorescence intensity was recorded at 350 nm with a PerkinElmer LS-5 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence was corrected for dilution and inner filtering by acrylamide. The quenching profiles were analyzed in terms of a two-site quenching model using the following equation: I/Io = α + (1 – α)/(1 + K[Q]), where I = fluorescence in the presence of quencher, Io = fluorescence in the absence of quencher, [Q] = concentration of quencher, α = fraction of fluorescence not accessible to quenching, and K = Stern-Volmer accessibility to quencher. Transient Transfection—COS7 cells were transfected by FuGENE 6 as recommended by the manufacturers (Roche Diagnostics). The antagonists W7, W12, and CDZ (Sigma) were added 24 h after transfection and incubated for a further 24 h prior to cell harvesting. To measure SOX9 transcriptional activity, CAT-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed as described previously (32McDowall S. Argentaro A. Ranganathan S. Weller P. Mertin S. Mansour S. Tolmie J. Harley V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24023-24030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Linear regression (Microsoft Excel) was used to calculate the slope of transcriptional activation and its projection was used to determine the 50% inhibition constant (IC50) of the drug on transfected cells. Immunohistochemistry—COS7 cells were transiently transfected with 500 ng of pcDNA3-SOX9 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antagonists W7, W12, and CDZ at concentrations ranging from 3 to 300 μm were added 24 h after transfection and the transfected COS7 cells were incubated for a further 24 h prior to protein detection. SOX9 protein was detected as described previously (32McDowall S. Argentaro A. Ranganathan S. Weller P. Mertin S. Mansour S. Tolmie J. Harley V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24023-24030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, EGTA was added 24 h after transfection, and the transfected cells were incubated for a further 20 min before immunohistochemistry. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Bio-Rad MRC-500) was used for quantitation of nuclear accumulation of SOX9 protein and was performed as described (33Hubner S. Xiao C.Y. Jans D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17191-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Measurements were taken of the density of fluorescence from the cytoplasm and the nucleus with the background fluorescence subtracted from the equation: Fn/c = (n – bkgdn)/(cp – bkgdncp), where n = nucleus and bkgdn = background in the nucleus, cp = cytoplasm, and bkgdncp = background in the cytoplasm. We showed previously that the SRY HMG box can interact with CaM in a calcium-dependent manner through a 25-amino acid sequence, located in helix 1 of the SRY HMG box, which includes the N-terminal NLS (Fig. 1) (28Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Hextall P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 24-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This domain is highly conserved among members of the SOX family suggesting that CaM is likely to bind to other SOX proteins (Fig. 1). E. coli recombinant SOX9 HMG box was purified to about 95% homogeneity as observed by a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Next, SOX9 HMG box protein was electrophoresed on a native PAGE gel in the presence or absence of CaM, and the calcium dependence of the interaction between SOX9 and CaM was assessed. In this gel system SOX9 HMG box alone is too basic to migrate into the gel (Fig. 2B, lane 1). For mixtures of SOX9 and CaM in the presence of the chelating agent, EGTA, only CaM was observed (Fig. 2B, lane 3), In the presence of calcium, migration of CaM was retarded relative to that in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 5). In the presence of calcium and SOX9, the migration of CaM was further retarded because of the formation of a Ca2+·CaM·SOX9 complex (Fig. 2B, lane 6). A CaM-binding peptide of PKII, which binds with high affinity to CaM, was added to the assay to assess the specificity and strength of interaction between CaM and SOX9. At equimolar concentrations of PKII and CaM, the Ca2+·CaM·SOX9 complex was abolished (Fig. 2B, lane 7). Hence, the HMG box of SOX9, like SRY, binds to CaM, in a calcium-dependent manner. Binding is competed by PKII peptide, which suggests that SOX9, like PKII, binds to CaM in a conventional way, with the two globular domains of CaM engulfing the α helix of the target. To determine the stoichiometry of the binding, CaM and radiolabeled SOX9 were incubated with a cross-linking agent. [35S]Met-labeled SOX9 migrates as a single band at about 65,000, slightly higher than its predicted molecular weight of 61,000 (Fig. 2C, lane 6). SOX9, in the presence of glutaraldehyde, still migrated as a 65-kDa band suggesting that free SOX9 is a monomer and does not homodimerize (Fig. 2C, lane 1). In the presence of calcium and CaM, a complex migrating at about 85 kDa was observed (Fig. 2C, lane 3), consistent with a 1:1 SOX9·CaM complex, the molecular weight of bovine brain CaM used being 17,000. No higher order complexes were evident when 10-fold more CaM was added because the 1:1 complex did not increase in size (Fig. 2C, lane 4). In the presence of EGTA, no SOX9·CaM complex forms (Fig. 2C, lane 5). To determine the limiting calcium concentration, SOX9 and CaM were cross-linked in CaCl2 at concentrations between 2 and 50 μm. The SOX9·CaM complex was detected at CaCl2 concentrations at 3 μm CaCl2 or greater (Fig. 2D). Because reported intracellular levels of CaCl2 are between 1 and 10 μm (34Carafoli E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1115-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 35James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), our result suggests that the CaM-SOX9 interaction occurs within the physiological range of intracellular calcium. We tested, by fluorescence spectroscopy, if binding of CaM to SOX9 was accompanied by conformational changes in SOX9."
https://openalex.org/W2072963303,"Glucocorticoids are secreted from the adrenal glands and act as a peripheral effector of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, playing an essential role in stress response and homeostatic regulation. In target cells, however, it remains unknown how glucocorticoids finetune the cellular pathways mediating tissue and systemic adaptation. Recently, considerable evidence indicates that adaptation to hypoxic environments is influenced by glucocorticoids and there is cross-talk between hypoxia-dependent signals and glucocorticoid-mediated regulation of gene expression. We therefore investigated the interaction between these important stress-responsive pathways, focusing on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Here we show that, under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1-dependent gene expression is further up-regulated by glucocorticoids via the GR. This up-regulation cannot be substituted by the other steroid receptors and is suggested to result from the interaction between the GR and the transactivation domain of HIF-1α. Moreover, our results also indicate that the ligand binding domain of the GR is essential for this interaction, and the critical requirement for GR agonists suggests the importance of the ligand-mediated conformational change of the GR. Because these proteins are shown to colocalize in the distinct compartments of the nucleus, we suggest that these stress-responsive transcription factors have intimate communication in close proximity to each other, thereby enabling the fine-tuning of cellular responses for adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1969352719,"Endothelial lipase (EL) is a new member of the triglyceride lipase gene family, which includes lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and hepatic lipase (HL). Enzymatic activity of EL has been studied before. Here we characterized the ability of EL to bridge lipoproteins to the cell surface. Expression of EL in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 but not in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-deficient CHO-677 cells resulted in 3–4.4-fold increases of 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) and 125I-high density lipoprotein 3 binding (HDL3). Inhibition of proteoglycan sulfation by sodium chlorate or incubation of cells with labeled lipoproteins in the presence of heparin (100 μg/ml) abolished bridging effects of EL. An enzymatically inactive EL, EL-S149A, was equally effective in facilitating lipoprotein bridging as native EL. Processing of LDL and HDL differed notably after initial binding via EL to the cell surface. More than 90% of the surface-bound 125I-LDL was destined for internalization and degradation, whereas about 70% of the surface-bound 125I-HDL3 was released back into the medium. These differences were significantly attenuated after HDL clustering was promoted using antibody against apolipoprotein A-I. At equal protein concentration of added lipoproteins the ratio of HDL3 to VLDL bridging via EL was 0.092 compared with 0.174 via HL and 0.002 via LpL. In summary, EL mediates binding and uptake of plasma lipoproteins via a process that is independent of its enzymatic activity, requires cellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and is regulated by ligand clustering. Endothelial lipase (EL) is a new member of the triglyceride lipase gene family, which includes lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and hepatic lipase (HL). Enzymatic activity of EL has been studied before. Here we characterized the ability of EL to bridge lipoproteins to the cell surface. Expression of EL in wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 but not in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-deficient CHO-677 cells resulted in 3–4.4-fold increases of 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) and 125I-high density lipoprotein 3 binding (HDL3). Inhibition of proteoglycan sulfation by sodium chlorate or incubation of cells with labeled lipoproteins in the presence of heparin (100 μg/ml) abolished bridging effects of EL. An enzymatically inactive EL, EL-S149A, was equally effective in facilitating lipoprotein bridging as native EL. Processing of LDL and HDL differed notably after initial binding via EL to the cell surface. More than 90% of the surface-bound 125I-LDL was destined for internalization and degradation, whereas about 70% of the surface-bound 125I-HDL3 was released back into the medium. These differences were significantly attenuated after HDL clustering was promoted using antibody against apolipoprotein A-I. At equal protein concentration of added lipoproteins the ratio of HDL3 to VLDL bridging via EL was 0.092 compared with 0.174 via HL and 0.002 via LpL. In summary, EL mediates binding and uptake of plasma lipoproteins via a process that is independent of its enzymatic activity, requires cellular heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and is regulated by ligand clustering.

LpL is synthesized primarily in adipose and skeletal muscle and is transported to the endothelial surface, where it is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). LpL is predominantly a triacylglycerol hydrolase, and its enzymatic action is mainly related to hydrolysis of triglycerides (TG) in TG-rich apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (reviewed in Ref. 4Goldberg I.J.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1002-1013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like LpL, HL has substantial TG lipase activity, but unlike LpL, HL also has significant phospholipase activity (8Deckelbaum R.J. Ramakrishnan R. Eisenberg S. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8544-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This increased phospholipase activity may play an important role in the ability of HL, as opposed to LpL, to directly modulate HDL metabolism (2Santamarina-Fojo S. Haudenschild C. Amar M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).In addition to their lipolytic activities, LpL and HL have been shown to mediate “bridging” between lipoproteins and HSPGs on the cell surface, which results in increased cellular uptake and degradation of lipoproteins (9Robinson D.S.

These bridging effects of LpL and HL require HSPGs and heparin-binding domains of the lipases but do not depend on their catalytical activities.

Many typical features of this gene family are conserved in EL: the catalytic triad residues, the lid that controls access of substrate to the hydrolytic pocket, and the cysteine residues that form intramolecular disulfide bonds. EL is unique in the triglyceride lipase family in that it is synthesized by endothelial cells, however, a number of other cell types also express EL (33Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D.

EL has detectable triglyceride lipase activity, but this activity is significantly less relative to its phospholipase activity compared with HL and especially LpL (33Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J.

In vitro, conditioned medium containing EL had the ability to substantially hydrolyze HDL phospholipids but had little activity toward LDL phospholipids, suggesting relative selectivity for HDL (37McCoy M.G.

In vivo, even low levels of EL overexpression in the livers of wild-type and human apoA-I transgenic mice dramatically reduced HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels and increased HDL catabolism (33Jaye M.

As a result of EL overexpression, plasma levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins were also reduced, although to a lesser extent (33Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D. Perrone M. Rader D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Recent studies in EL knockout mice (38Ishida T. Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and in mice injected with specific antibody against EL (39Jin W. Millar J.S. Broedl U. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) provided additional evidence for a physiological importance of EL for lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in vivo.The clusters of positively charged residues in LpL and HL have been implicated in binding of these molecules to heparin and HSPGs. Because the putative heparin-binding and lipoprotein-binding sites present in LpL and HL are highly conserved in EL, we hypothesized that EL may also serve as a bridging molecule between lipoproteins and cell surface and matrix HSPGs. Therefore, the primary focus of this study was to examine the ability of EL to mediate binding and holoparticle uptake of plasma lipoproteins and to compare EL-dependent metabolism of apoB-versus apoA-I-containing lipoproteins in vitro. We also compared EL with HL and LpL in their abilities to facilitate bridging of different major classes of plasma lipoproteins with cells. In this study, we demonstrated that EL can function as an efficient bridging molecule between plasma lipoproteins and cells in a process that requires intact cell surface HSPGs, but does not depend on EL enzymatic activity. Moreover, we found that compared with LpL and HL, EL has distinct preferences in bridging individual classes of lipoproteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Reagents—Unless otherwise indicated, chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma. VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml), LDL (1.019 < d < 1.063 g/ml), and HDL3 (1.125 < d < 1.21 g/ml) were isolated from fresh human plasma by ultracentrifugation as described previously (40Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M.

COS-7 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Both CHO cell lines were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. These three cell lines were chosen because they are readily infected with recombinant adenoviral constructs and were successfully used in the past to characterize effects of LpL and HL on lipoprotein metabolism (16Komaromy M.

Recombinant adenoviruses encoding human EL (AdEL), human EL-S149A (adEL-S149A), human HL (AdHL), or GFP (AdGFP), used as a negative control in all experiments, were constructed as previously described (37McCoy M.G.

A recombinant adenovirus encoding human LpL (AdLpL) was a generous gift from Dr. Nicolas Duverger (Aventis Pharmaceuticals).Adenoviral infections of cells were performed as described (37McCoy M.G. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, prior to infection cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 12-well plates (22 mm/well). Cells were then incubated with recombinant adenoviruses encoding EL, EL-S149A, LpL, HL, or GFP (control virus) in 0.3 ml of serum-free medium at a multiplicity of infection of 3000 particles/cell. Two hours later, 0.7 ml of fresh growth medium containing serum was added to each well and incubations were continued for 2 days. At 48 h post-infection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and used for ligand binding experiments with 125I-labeled lipoproteins.Expression of lipases by infected cells was confirmed by Western blotting and by assay of triglyceride lipase activity of conditioned medium according to the protocols described previously (37McCoy M.G.

Antibody against human EL was generated to a peptide in the N-terminal region of EL, as previously described (33Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D.

Laboda H.M. Glick J.M. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5333-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody to human LpL was a generous gift from Dr. Mark H. Doolittle.Cellular Metabolism of 125I-VLDL, 125I-LDL, and 125I-HDL3—For binding studies, cells grown in 12-well plates were incubated with 0.5 ml of the serum-free medium supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma number A-8806) and 125I-labeled lipoproteins (5 μg of protein/ml) unless otherwise stated. To assess the effects of endogenous expression of lipases on surface binding of lipoproteins, cells were incubated with labeled lipoproteins for 1 h at 4 °C. To measure cellular uptake and degradation of lipoproteins, cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of labeled lipoproteins, then surface-bound (heparin-releasable), intracellular (heparin-resistant), and degraded (assessed by trichloroacetic acid-soluble, CHCl3-insoluble radioactivity in medium) ligand was measured as described (40Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 41Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar).To examine the time course of cellular processing of 125I-LDL versus 125I-HDL3, labeled lipoproteins were incubated with cells in serum-free medium for 1 h at 4 °C to allow surface binding without further catabolism. Cells were washed at 4 °C to remove unbound material. Fresh medium at 37 °C with no ligands was then added, and incubations were continued at 37 °C for the indicated times. Assays for surface-bound, intracellular, and degraded ligands were then performed as above. Additionally, trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the medium was quantified as an indication of lipoproteins released into the medium via retroendocytosis or desorption from the cell surface during the incubation at 37 °C.To test potential effects of ligand clustering on cellular metabolism of 125I-HDL3, cells were incubated with 125I-HDL3 at 4 °C for 1 h, to allow cell-surface binding. Cells were rinsed at 4 °C to remove unbound ligand and incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 °C with or without antibody against human apoA-I (10 μg/ml final concentration). Cells were then washed briefly and incubated with pre-warmed media at 37 °C for the indicated times followed by measurements of surface-bound, intracellular, degraded and medium released radioactivity.All results for 125I-lipoprotein metabolism were normalized to cellular protein. Lipase-dependent catabolism was calculated by subtracting the values obtained in control cells infected with adGFP from those obtained in cells expressing lipases (total catabolism). HSPG-mediated catabolism was calculated by subtracting the values obtained in the presence of heparin (100 μg/ml) from those obtained in its absence.Assay of EL Protein—In parallel with ligand binding experiments, a separate set of cells was used to measure EL or EL-S149A protein available for bridging of labeled lipoproteins. For this purpose, cells were not exposed to radiolabeled lipoproteins, but instead were incubated in the presence of heparin (100 μg/ml) to release surface-bound lipases into the medium. EL protein concentration was evaluated by densitometric analysis of Western blots of the conditioned medium using a Bio-Rad imager (model GS-700) and Quantity One program (Bio-Rad). Protein concentration was defined in arbitrary units as determined by densitometric analysis. Several dilutions of conditioned medium were used to make sure the intensity of the bands was proportional to the amount of protein applied on the gel.Role of HSPGs in Lipoprotein Metabolism—We used three approaches to test the contribution of HSPGs in EL-mediated processing of lipoproteins. First, we blocked sulfation of cellular proteoglycans by preincubating cells for 18 h at 37 °C in sodium chlorate (50 mm), an inhibitor of sulfate adenyltransferase (47Hoogewerf A.J. Cisar L.A. Evans D.C. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16564-16571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus preventing sulfation of glycosaminoglycan side chains of HSPGs. Control cells were exposed to 50 mm sodium chloride. Second, we compared lipoprotein metabolism in wild-type versus HSPG-deficient CHO cells. Third, we incubated cells with labeled lipoproteins in the presence or absence of heparin at 100 μg/ml, a concentration that specifically blocks interactions with HSPGs (40Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L. Fisher E.A. Williams K.J. J. Clin.

Error bars that appear absent indicate S.E. values smaller than the drawn symbols.RESULTSEffects of EL Expression on Binding of 125I-LDL and 125I-HDL3—We examined the effects of EL on the binding of 125I-LDL and 125I-HDL3 in CHO-K1 cells. For these experiments CHO-K1 cells were infected with control (GFP) or EL-encoding adenoviral constructs. 48 h after infection, cells were incubated with radiolabeled 125I-LDL or 125I-HDL3 for1hat4 °C, and cell binding of labeled lipoproteins was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression of EL was assayed in parallel wells by Western blotting with anti-EL antibody and by measuring triglyceride lipase activity in the conditioned medium. Infection with the control virus (adGFP) did not affect binding of either 125I-LDL or 125I-HDL3 compared with uninfected cells (91.3 ± 4.8 and 95.6 ± 7.4% of values for uninfected cells, respectively). In contrast, cells infected with adEL demonstrated 4.4-fold increase in binding of 125I-LDL (Fig. 1A) and 3.0-fold increase in binding of 125I-HDL3 (Fig. 1B) compared with control, adGFP-infected cells. Of interest, although 125I-LDL or 125I-HDL3 were added to the cells at equal protein concentrations, about 2.3 times more 125I-LDL protein was bound to the cells compared with 125I-HDL3 via the EL-mediated process (114.3 ± 7.6 versus 49.4 ± 2.3 ng/mg of cell protein, respectively) indicating that a higher percentage of LDL particles was bound to the cells compared with HDL.Role of Cell Surface HSPGs in EL-mediated Increase of 125I-LDL and 125I-HDL3 Metabolism—We next tested if cell surface HSPGs are responsible for the observed effects of EL on binding of lipoproteins by incubating cells with labeled lipoproteins in the presence of 100 μg of heparin/ml. At this concentration heparin selectively blocks ligand binding to heparan sulfate side chains of HSPGs (40Fuki I.V. Kuhn K.M. Lomazov I.R. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Iozzo R.V. Swenson T.L.

https://openalex.org/W2112153902,"Netrins are secreted proteins that elicit both attractive and repulsive responses in migrating cells in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Netrins interact with members of two distinct families of transmembrane receptors, represented by DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC5. A human netrin fragment (soluble netrin; sNetrin) was purified from an engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line and used in a pull-down assay to map the interactions between netrin and its receptors. We find that sNetrin binds exclusively to the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC and to each immunoglobulin repeat of UNC5. Both DCC and UNC5 bind to sNetrin with 1:1 stoichiometry in solution, and the minimal receptor fragments behave similarly to larger fragments in cross-linking experiments with purified sNetrin. We find no evidence for formation of a ternary complex between sNetrin and soluble forms of DCC and UNC5. We also find no evidence for an interaction between DCC and heparin and instead demonstrate that a loop on the fifth fibronectin type III repeat of DCC previously implicated in mediating interactions with heparin is important for sNetrin binding. Since netrin binds heparin, our results suggest that interactions between DCC and heparin are probably mediated by netrin.

Members of two distinct protein families, represented by DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) and UNC5, bind netrin with nanomolar affinity and transmit netrin-dependent signals across the membranes of migrating neural cells (8Keino-Masu K.

In addition, both netrin and DCC have been reported to bind heparin (8Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Hinck L. Leonardo E.D. Chan S.S. Culotti J.G. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Netrin, DCC, and UNC5 are all composed of multiple domains that are homologous to those found in other extracellular proteins (12Lim Y.S. Wadsworth W.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7080-7087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Netrin family members share an N-terminal Type VI laminin repeat (domain VI), followed by three cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor modules (domains V1, V2, and V3, respectively), and a positively charged C-terminal domain. DCC family members are type I glycoproteins with extracellular regions containing four Ig repeats followed by six type III fibronectin repeats (Fn). 1The abbreviations used are: Fn, type III fibronectin; hGH, human growth hormone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PNGase F, peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F; TEV, tobacco etch virus protease. Members of the UNC5 family are also single-pass transmembrane proteins with extracellular regions consisting of two Ig repeats followed by two thrombospondin type-I modules. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that in general DCC mediates attractive responses to netrin, whereas UNC5 is required for netrin-mediated repulsion (8Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Hinck L.

Cell. 1996; 87: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). DCC mediates attractive responses in the absence of UNC5, but the presence of UNC5 is sufficient to convert DCC-mediated attraction to repulsion (16Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In some cases, UNC5-mediated repulsion requires the presence of DCC (16Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), but other studies suggest that UNC5 alone is capable of mediating repulsion (17Keleman K. Dickson B.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Netrin signaling requires the cytoplasmic regions of DCC and UNC5, both of which appear to function by recruiting signaling/adaptor proteins (16Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37788-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Attractive responses require netrin-induced dimerization of the cytoplasmic region of DCC, whereas repulsion arises from netrin-induced association of the DCC and UNC5 cytoplasmic regions (16Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 20Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the absence of the extracellular domains of the receptors, the cytoplasmic region of DCC interacts constitutively with itself and with the UNC5 cytoplasmic region (16Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 20Stein E. Zou Y. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Science. 2001; 291: 1976-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These interactions, however, are repressed by the presence of the receptor extracellular domains (16Hong K. Hinck L. Nishiyama M. Poo M.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Stein E. Cell. 1999; 97: 927-941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), and netrin binding to either the DCC or UNC5 extracellular domains appears to initiate signaling by relieving this repression. To better understand the nature of netrin-mediated signaling, we have undertaken a biochemical characterization of the interactions between netrin and its receptors. Using a recombinant form of human soluble netrin-1 (sNetrin) (8Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Hinck L. Leonardo E.D. Chan S.S. Culotti J.G. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1996; 87: 175-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar), we have mapped the regions of DCC and UNC5 that interact with sNetrin and find that discrete domains of DCC and UNC5 are both necessary and sufficient for sNetrin binding. These domains recapitulate the behavior of the receptors' ectodomains in both pull-down and cross-linking experiments. sNetrin binds to DCC and UNC5 fragments with 1:1 stoichiometry, and interactions of the receptors with sNetrin appear to be mutually exclusive. We also find that netrin binding is mediated by the same 11-amino acid loop on DCC previously identified as a heparin binding site (11Bennett K.L. Bradshaw J. Youngman T. Rodgers J. Greenfield B. Aruffo A. Linsley P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26940-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Since heparin does not compete with netrin for DCC binding and we are unable to detect direct interactions between heparin and DCC, interactions between DCC and heparin observed in earlier studies appear to have been mediated by netrin. We used the SMART algorithm (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool; available on the World Wide Web at smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) to make preliminary assignments of domain boundaries for human netrin-1, DCC, and UNC5C (Table I). These boundaries were cross-validated with secondary structure predictions using the PsiPred algorithm (available on the World Wide Web at bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/). Predicted sites of signal peptide cleavage were identified using the SignalP server (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/).Table INetrin, DCC, and UNC5 protein fragments used in this studyProtein fragment (encoded residues)5′ Oligonucleotide3′ OligonucleotidesNetrin-(1-429) (GPGLS...

Fearon (University of Michigan), and the UNC5H2 cDNA was provided by S. Ackerman (Jackson Laboratory). These were used as templates for all PCRs. A complete list of all receptor/cDNA fragments generated and the corresponding oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) used in this study is presented in Table I. All PCRs were performed using the Expand High Fidelity system (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's suggestions. Following separation by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent purification, each PCR product was digested with either BamHI and NotI (for DCC fragments), XbaI and NotI (for both UNC5 and netrin fragments), or SalI and NotI (DCC-Fn(5) for prokaryotic expression), subcloned into the corresponding sites of the appropriate expression vector, and then completely sequenced. For eukaryotic expression, the vector pSGHV0 was used (21Leahy D.J. Dann 3rd, C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); this vector allows for expression and secretion from mammalian cells of proteins fused to the C terminus of an octahistidine-tagged variant of human growth hormone (21Leahy D.J. Dann 3rd, C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The vector pT7 was used for protein overexpression in Escherichia coli (22Geisbrecht B.V. Zhang D. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alanine or “loop-swap” mutations in either DCC-Fn(1) or DCC-Fn(5) were identical to those described by Bennett et al. (11Bennett K.L. Bradshaw J. Youngman T. Rodgers J. Greenfield B. Aruffo A. Linsley P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26940-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and were generated in two rounds of PCR. In the first reaction, two partially overlapping oligonucleotides encoding the multiple mutations needed were annealed and amplified according to standard protocols. The product of this PCR was purified and used in conjunction with the necessary upstream primer to generate the desired full-length mutant cDNA for subcloning into the pSGHV0 expression vector. DNA used for transfection was purified by equilibrium CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation and dissolved in deionized water to a concentration greater than 1.0 mg/ml. Transient transfections were performed in six-well clusters using the Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, both dhfr–/–CHO and HEK293 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, hypoxanthine/thymidine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) for 72 h (as described in Ref. 21Leahy D.J. Dann 3rd, C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The conditioned medium was then harvested and clarified by centrifugation (10 min at 13,000 × g) prior to analysis. All stable transfections and methotrexate selections of mutant CHO cells were performed essentially as described (21Leahy D.J. Dann 3rd, C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). High expressing cell lines were expanded for culture in roller bottles, and the cells were maintained in serum-free medium (Excell 301, JRH Biosciences) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (21Leahy D.J. Dann 3rd, C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). NMUT1 cells were a gift from A. Klingelhutz (University of Iowa) and were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with recombinant human epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Invitrogen). To prepare whole-cell lysates, NMUT1 cells were grown to confluence in a 75-cm2 flask and were lysed by scraping in 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete tablets, according to the manufacturer's instructions; Roche Applied Science). The cell extract was incubated on ice for 30 min, and a soluble extract was prepared by centrifugation at 4 °C (10 min at 13,000 × g). For Western analysis, 20 μl each of conditioned medium and whole-cell lysate were analyzed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to detect human growth hormone (hGH) were carried out as described (21Leahy D.J. Dann 3rd, C.E. Longo P. Perman B. Ramyar K.X. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to the manufacturer's suggestions (Millipore Corp.). All procedures were performed at 25 °C. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked by a 1-h incubation in 1% gelatin (Sigma) dissolved in PBST (10 mm sodium-Pi, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, with 0.1% Tween 20). hGH was detected by incubating for 1 h with a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes hGH (Research Diagnostics; 1:104 dilution in block solution). The membrane was washed five times with PBST, and the rabbit antibody was detected by a 1-h incubation with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody that recognizes rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; 1:2 × 104 dilution in block solution). Following another series of washes, membrane-bound horseradish peroxidase was detected using the SuperSignal Pico system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. During the course of experimentation, it was necessary to change production lots of anti-hGH; this resulted in increased nonspecific binding of the antibody during routine immunoblotting. For detection of endogenous netrin-1, an affinity-purified goat anti-human netrin-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:50 dilution in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBST) was used. In this case, membrane-bound goat IgG was detected with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:5000 dilution in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBST). All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Conditioned medium was harvested every third day, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (30 min at 9,000 × g). In a typical preparation, 4–8 liters of medium were concentrated ∼20-fold in a Pellicon tangential flow filtration apparatus equipped with 30-kDa nominal molecular mass cut-off membranes (Millipore). The concentrate was exchanged into binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was sterile-filtered, and glycerol was added to 10% (v/v). The sample was applied to a 10-ml column of Ni2+-Sepharose Fast-Flow (Amersham Biosciences), the column was washed in binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in binding buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and prepared for TEV digestion by adding EDTA and aprotinin to concentrations of 2 mm and 1 μg/ml, respectively; recombinant TEV protease (Invitrogen) was added as described (21Leahy D.J.

Following proteolysis, samples were dialyzed into binding buffer and reapplied to Ni2+-Sepharose, and the unbound proteins were collected for further purification. Below, we describe the subsequent purifications of individual proteins, which in all cases led to preparations greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. sNetrin (M r ∼48,000)—The sample was applied to a 6-ml Resource S column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium-Pi (pH 6.0) and eluted with a gradient to 500 mm NaCl. At this point, sNetrin was essentially pure, but an additional gel filtration step was typically performed (Superdex 75 (26/60) gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences)). DCC-Fn(1–6) (M r ∼75,000)—The sample was chromatographed on a 6-ml Resource S column equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) buffer and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl. The DCC-Fn(1–6)-containing fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm potassium-Pi (pH 6.8) and applied to a 5-ml EconoPak CHT-II hydroxylapatite cartridge (Bio-Rad). Pure DCC-Fn(1–6) was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 400 mm potassium-Pi (pH 6.8). UNC5-Ecto (M r ∼38,000)—The sample was applied to a 6-ml Resource Q column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl. The UNC5-containing fractions were further chromatographed on CHT-II hydroxylapatite (as described above). UNC5-Ig (M r ∼25,500)—The sample was chromatographed on a 6-ml Resource Q column as described above followed by chromatography on a Superdex 75 (26/60) gel filtration column. The plasmid pT7-DCC-Fn(5) was transformed into E. coli strain B834(DE3). Fresh transformants were cultured, induced, and harvested as previously described (22Geisbrecht B.V. Zhang D. Schulz H. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21797-21803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Induced cells from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 25 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and lysed by two passes through a French pressure cell (30,000 p.s.i.) at 4 °C. DNase I (Sigma) was added to a concentration of 20 μg/ml, and the cell homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C (30 min at 25,000 × g). The supernatant was sterile-filtered, diluted to 100 ml, and applied to a 25-ml column of Q Sepharose Fast-Flow at pH 7.5. The unbound fraction was dialyzed against a buffer of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and applied to a 6-ml Resource S column. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl, and the DCC-Fn(5)-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated. This protein mixture was chromatographed on a Superdex 75 (26/60) column, after which the DCC-Fn(5) was greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (M r ∼11,200). All in vitro binding assays made use of netrin coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose Fast-Flow (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare this resin, purified netrin was dissolved in a coupling buffer (100 mm sodium-Pi, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) and mixed with resuspended CNBr-activated Sepharose Fast-Flow so that the protein coupling density was 1 mg of netrin/ml of resin. The coupling reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 16 h and quenched with 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The netrin-Sepharose was stored as a 50% slurry in PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA. All binding assays were performed in 1 ml of total volume of PBS supplemented with 1% Tween 20 (PBST). Each reaction contained a 10-μl bed volume of netrin-Sepharose (effective netrin concentration of 200 nm) and a 1 nm total concentration of hGH-tagged ligand. Binding reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 1 h, and the affinity resin was captured by centrifugation (2 min at 5,000 × g). After the resin was washed three times in PBST, it was resuspended in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Netrin complexes were detected by processing 10 μl of each sample for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against hGH. Netrin receptor complexes were covalently coupled through the water-soluble, amine-reactive cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl-)suberate) (BS3; Pierce). Proteins were dialyzed into PBS prior to cross-linking to avoid inappropriate aminolysis of BS3. All reactions were carried out in 20 μl with 5 μm final concentration of each reactant protein. In conditions where both DCC and UNC5 fragments were present, a stock solution containing both proteins was prepared so that the receptors could be added simultaneously. For each reaction, the protein mixture was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 25 °C before cross-linking was initiated by the addition of BS3 to a final concentration of 300 μm. The reactions were allowed to proceed for an additional 20 min at 25 °C. Excess BS3 was quenched by adding Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) to 100 mm final concentration and incubating for an additional 15 min. The samples were prepared for analysis by adding 6× Laemmli sample buffer and heating to 100 °C for 5 min. Complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. All separations were performed at 4 °C using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on a Superdex 200 (10/30) column equilibrated in PBS. 1-ml fractions were collected, and elution of protein from the column was monitored by UV spectrophotometry at 280 nm. 250 μg of purified protein (concentration 1 mg/ml) were injected for control separations, and complexes were prepared by combining 250 μg of each protein in a final volume of 250 μl. The approximate molecular masses of eluted species were determined by comparison with a calibration curve generated from a mixture of globular protein standards (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions of interest were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Purified proteins (5 μg) were incubated with 10 μl of heparin-Sepharose in a total volume of 1 ml of PBST. Binding reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 1 h, and the heparin resin was captured by centrifugation (2 min at 5,000 × g). The resin was washed three times in PBST and then resuspended in 10 μlof2× Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. sNetrin binding to DCC-expressing HEK293 cells was measured essentially as described by Keino-Masu et al. (8Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Hinck L. Leonardo E.D. Chan S.S. Culotti J.G. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1996; 87: 175-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either pCMV-DCC (a plasmid for expression of full-length human DCC; E. Fearon, University of Michigan) or pCMV alone as described above. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and plated on sterile, gelatin-coated coverslips. After another 24 h, the cells were incubated with conditioned culture medium (see above) containing either hGH-sNetrin, hGH-sNetrin with 500 μg/ml heparin, or hGH (each protein at a final concentration of 40 nm). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h further, at which time the unbound proteins were removed by washing three times in sterile PBS. The samples were fixed 10 min in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS and washed twice with sterile PBS. Each sample was incubated in 5% (w/v) normal goat serum/PBST (block solution) followed by a 1-h incubation with a mixture of rabbit antibodies specific for hGH (Research Diagnostics; 1:1000 in block solution), mouse antibodies specific for DCC (Oncogene Sciences; 1 μg/ml monoclonal AF5 in block solution), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The cells were washed three times with PBST, and the following secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h: Alexa-Texas Red-anti-rabbit (1:400 in block) and Alexa-fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse (1:400 in block) (Molecular Probes). Excess fluorescent antibodies were removed by washing in PBST, and the coverslips were m"

The mazEF system is known as an addiction module located on the Escherichia coli chromosome. MazF is a stable toxin, and MazE is a labile antitoxin interacting with MazF to form a complex. MazE and the MazE-MazF complex can bind to the mazEF promoter region to regulate the mazEF expression. Here we show that the binding of purified (His)6MazE to the mazEF promoter DNA was enhanced by MazF. The site-directed mutations at the conserved amino acid residues in MazE N-terminal region (K7A, R8A, S12A, and R16A) disrupted the DNA binding ability of both (His)6MazE and the MazE-MazF-(His)6 complex, suggesting that MazE binds to the mazEF promoter DNA through the N-terminal domain. The ratio of MazE to MazF(His)6 in the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex is about 1:2. Because both MazE and MazF-(His)6 exist as dimers by themselves, the MazE-MazF-(His)6 complex (76.9 kDa) is predicted to consist of one MazE dimer and two MazF(His)6 dimers. The interaction between MazE and MazF was also characterized with the yeast two-hybrid system. It was found that the region from residues 38 to 75 of MazE was required for its binding to MazF. Site-directed mutagenesis at this region revealed that Leu55 and Leu58 play an important role in the MazE-MazF complex formation but not in MazE binding to the mazEF promoter DNA. The present results demonstrate that MazE is composed of two domains, the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal domain interacting with MazF.

In Escherichia coli, programmed cell death is proposed to be mediated through the system called “addiction module” (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), which consists of a pair of genes encoding a stable toxin and an unstable antitoxin that are coexpressed. Their expression is autoregulated either by a complex formed by toxin and antitoxin or by antitoxin alone. When the coexpression is inhibited, the antitoxin is rapidly degraded by protease, enabling the toxin to act on its target. In E. coli, extrachromosomal elements are the main genetic system for bacterial programmed cell death. The most studied extrachromosomal addiction modules are the phd-doc on bacteriophage P1 (2Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol.

A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The mazEF system, which consists of two adjacent genes, mazE and mazF, is located downstream from the relA gene on the E. coli chromosome. Sequence analysis revealed that they are partly homologous to the pemI and pemK genes on plasmid pR100 (23Masuda Y. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6850-6856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mazEF system has the properties required for an addiction module. MazF is toxic and MazE is antitoxic; MazF is stable, whereas MazE is a labile protein degraded in vivo by the ATP-dependent ClpPA serine protease (22Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar); MazE and MazF are coexpressed and interact with each other to form a complex; and the expression of mazEF is negatively autoregulated by MazE and the MazE-MazF complex (24Marianovsky I. Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5975-5984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The expression of mazEF is also inhibited by guanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp), 1The abbreviations used are: ppGpp, guanosine 3′,5′-bispyrophosphate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. which is synthesized by the RelA protein under extreme amino acid starvation (22Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The mazEF-mediated cell death can be triggered by extreme amino acid starvation and thymine starvation (25Sat B. Reches M. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1803-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), by toxic protein Doc (26Hazan R. Sat B. Reches M. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and by some antibiotics that are general inhibitors of transcription and/or translation, such as rifampicin, choramphenicol, and spectinomycin (27Sat B. Hazan R. Fisher T. Khaner H. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Some crucial aspects of the mazEF system have remained elusive. It is still unknown how MazE or the MazE-MazF complex binds to the mazEF promoter DNA and how MazE and MazF interact with each other to form a complex. In the present paper, we have investigated the interactions between MazE, MazF, and the mazEF promoter DNA to identify the functional domains in MazE responsible for binding to the mazEF promoter DNA and for interacting with MazF. It is demonstrated that MazE has a DNA-binding domain in its N-terminal region and that the region from residues 38 to 75 in MazE is required for its binding to MazF, in which Leu55 and Leu58 are essential. The data in the present paper also suggest that the MazE-MazF complex consists of one MazE dimer and two MazF dimers. Reagents and Enzymes—Nucleotides, ampicillin, and kanamycin were from Sigma. The restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes used for cloning were from New England Biolabs. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. The radioactive nucleotides were from Amersham Biosciences. Constructions of Plasmid—The mazEF gene (including its Shine-Dalgarno sequence region) was amplified by PCR using E. coli genomic DNA as template and cloned into the XbaI-NheI sites of pET11a, creating the plasmid pET11a-EF. The mazEF gene (including its Shine-Dalgarno sequence region) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the XbaI-XhoI sites of pET21cc to create an in-frame translation with a (His)6 tag at the MazF C terminus. The plasmid was designated as pET21cc-EF(His)6. The mazE gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NdeI-HindIII sites of pET28a. This plasmid was designated as pET28a-(His)6E. MazE was expressed as a fusion with an N-terminal (His)6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site, named (His)6MazE. The full-length mazE gene and various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs of the mazE gene as indicated in Fig. 7 were generated by PCR and cloned into EcoRI-PstI sites of pGAD-C1 vector to create in-frame translation fusions with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain. These plasmids were designated pGAD-MazE, pGAD-MazEΔ(1–13), pGAD-MazEΔ(1–24), pGAD-MazEΔ(1–37), pGAD-MazEΔ(1–46), pGAD-MazEΔ(68–82), and pGAD-MazEΔ(76–82). The full-length mazF gene and various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs of the mazF gene were generated by PCR and cloned into EcoRI-BglII sites of pGBD-C1 vector to create in-frame translation fusions with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. These plasmids were designated as pGBD-MazF, pGBD-MazFΔ(1–14), pGBD-MazFΔ(1–25), pGBD-MazFΔ(72–111), and pGBD-MazFΔ(97–111). Protein Purification—pET11a-EF was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The coexpression of MazE and MazF was induced for 4 h in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using French press. The cell lysis was kept at 37 °C for 30 min to degrade MazE as much as possible, and cell debris and unbroken cells were then removed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min followed by ultracentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h to remove membrane and insoluble fractions. MazF was subsequently purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 column, DEAE-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The fractions containing MazF protein were pooled and concentrated. MazF was further purified by gel filtration with a Superdux™ 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). For purification of (His)6MazE, pET28a-(His)6E was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain, and (His)6MazE expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. (His)6MazE protein was immediately purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity chromatography. pET21cc-EF(His)6 was also introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The coexpression of MazE and MazF(His)6 was induced in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The MazE-MazF(His)6 complex was immediately purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity chromatography and further purified by gel filtration. To purify MazF(His)6 from the purified MazE-MazF(His)6 complex, MazE in the purified MazE-MazF(His)6 complex was dissociated from MazF(His)6 in 5 m guanidine HCl. MazF(His)6 was retrapped by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and refolded by stepwise dialysis. The yield of refolding is ∼80%. The biochemical activity of MazF(His)6 was determined with E. coli T7 S30 extract system (Promega) for the protein synthesis inhibition. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Two single-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-GCTCGTATCTACAATGTAGATTGATATATACTGTATCTACATATGATAGC-3′ and 3′-CGAGCATAGATGTTACATCTAACTATATATGACATAGATGTATACTATCG-5′) were synthesized and annealed to get the 50-bp double-stranded DNA containing the mazEF promoter sequence. The 50-bp DNA fragment was end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP and used to detect the protein-DNA binding by EMSA. The binding reactions (20 μl) were carried out at 4 °C for 30 min with purified proteins, 2 μl of 100 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) and 2 μl of labeled DNA fragment in the binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol). Electrophoresis was performed in TAE buffer at 100 V in 6% native polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and then exposed to x-ray film. Native PAGE—Different amounts of (His)6MazE and MazF were mixed in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) at 4 °C for 30 min, and then 2× loading solution (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.08% bromphenol blue, and 8% glycerol) was added to the mixtures before loading on a native gel. The composition of the stacking gel was 5% acrylamide-bis (29:1) in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and the composition of the separation gel was 10% acrylamide-bis (29:1) in 187.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.9. The running buffer contains 82.6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4) and 33 mm glycine. Electrophoresis was performed at constant voltage (150 V) at 4 °C. The protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Resolution of Low Molecular Mass Proteins by Tricine SDS-PAGE— Tricine SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method described previously (28Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) with some modifications as follows: stacking gel, 5% acrylamide-bis (48:1.5) in 0.75 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.45, and 0.075% SDS; spacer gel, 10% acrylamide-bis (48:1.5) in 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.45, and 0.1% SDS; resolving gel: 16.5% acrylamide-bis (48:1.5) in 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.45, and 0.1% SDS. The anode running buffer was 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, and the cathode running buffer was 0.1 m Tris base, 0.1 m Tricine, and 0.1% SDS. After running the gel at constant current (20 mAmp) at room temperature, the protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Assays of MazE-MazF Interaction in the Yeast Two-hybrid System— The yeast two-hybrid reporter strain PJ69–4A (MATa trp1-901 leu23,112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4 gal80LYS2:GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met: GAL7-lacZ) and vectors pGAD-C1 and pGBD-C1 were used for two-hybrid assays (29James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To localize the MazF-binding region in MazE, a series of N- and C-terminal deletions of the mazE gene were constructed in pGAD-C1, and cotransformed with the pGBD-MazF plasmid into the PJ69–4A cells, as shown in Fig. 7. To localize the MazE-binding region in MazF proteins, a series of N- and C-terminal deletions of the mazF gene were constructed in pGBD-C1 and cotransformed with the pGAD-MazE plasmid into the PJ69–4A cells. Assays of the interactions were performed by monitoring growth of cotransformants on synthetic dropout minimal medium (Clontech) lacking Trp, Leu, His, and adenine (Ade). The medium was supplemented with 1 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days. MazE and MazF Form a Complex in a 1:2 Ratio—Tricine SDS-PAGE patterns of purified MazE-MazF(His)6, MazF, and (His)6MazE are shown in lanes 2, 3, and 4 of Fig. 1, respectively. The sizes of MazF and (His)6MazE agree with theoretical molecular weights 12,041 and 11,519, respectively (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). The MazE-MazF(His)6 complex was separated into 9.3-kDa MazE and 13.2-kDa MazF(His)6 (Fig. 1, lane 2), and the ratio of MazF(His)6 to MazE is ∼2 as determined by densitometer. When (His)6MazE and MazF were mixed together and the mixture was subjected to native PAGE, a new band appeared at position a near the top of the gel (arrowhead a in Fig. 2). The gel corresponding to the new band was cut out and incubated in a reducing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at room temperature, and then the gel was placed on the top of SDS-PAGE gel to run a second dimensional electrophoresis to analyze the protein components. After staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, two bands corresponding to (His)6MazE and MazF were observed, whereas (His)6MazE moved slower than MazF on the SDS-PAGE. These results demonstrated that the new band was the complex consisting of (His)6MazE and MazF. If the gel cut from the native PAGE was not treated in the reducing buffer, three protein bands were observed after it was subjected to the SDS-PAGE, (His)6MazE, MazF, and the MazF dimer (data not shown). Three bands appeared for the purified MazF on the native PAGE, but only one peak was observed when the purified MazF protein was assayed by HPLC (data not shown). The reason for the multi-band formation of MazF is not known at present. Next, we attempted to determine whether the ratio of (His)6MazE to MazF is stable in the complex. As shown in Fig. 2A, different amounts of (His)6MazE were added into the solution containing a constant concentration of MazF (2 μm) to make the (His)6MazE:MazF ratios as 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 6:1, and 8:1, whereas in Fig. 2B, different amounts of MazF were added into the solution containing a constant concentration of (His)6MazE (2 μm) to make the (His)6MazE:MazF ratios as 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, and 1:8. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then analyzed by native PAGE. The gel corresponding to the new band (at position a) was cut out and incubated in the reducing buffer for 30 min at room temperature and then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. The second dimensional gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to detect protein bands. Relative protein amounts in each lane were determined by densitometer using purified (His)6MazE and MazF as controls. The ratios of MazF to (His)6MazE in the complex were maintained almost constant at 1.8 whenever (His)6MazE or MazF was added in excess in the mixtures (Fig. 2). As mentioned above, the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex was separated to MazE and MazF(His)6 on a Tricine SDS-PAGE, and the ratio of MazF(His)6 to MazE is ∼2 (Fig. 1, lane 2). The molecular mass of the purified MazE-MazF(His)6 complex and MazF were determined as 76.9 and 27.1 kDa by gel filtration with a Superdux™ 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) (Fig. 3). MazF-(His)6 was purified from the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex. MazF(His)6 was able to inhibit the protein synthesis in an E. coli cell-free system (E. coli T7 S30 extract system; Promega), and the protein synthesis was rescued by the coaddition of (His)6MazE (data not shown). The molecular mass of MazF-(His)6 was determined to be 28.3 kDa with light scattering, suggesting that MazF(His)6 exists as dimer. The structure of MazE has been demonstrated as a dimer (30Lah J. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. Kinne J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14101-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex (76.9 kDa) may consist of one MazE dimer (predicted to be approximately 18.6 kDa because the MazE molecular mass is 9.3 kDa) and two MazF(His)6 dimers (predicted to be 56.6 kDa). MazF Enhances MazE Binding to the mazEF Promoter—The 50-bp mazEF promoter fragment prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” was end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP. Using EMSA, (His)6MazE, MazF, and the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex were tested separately for their binding abilities to the mazEF promoter DNA fragment. (His)6MazE was able to shift the mazEF promoter fragment at 2 μm or higher concentrations (Fig. 4A, lanes 7–12). At 0.4–1.0 μm (His)6MazE, no discrete mobility-shifted bands were observed, although the signals of the DNA fragment started to smear upward (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–6), indicating that some unstable (His)6MazE-DNA complexes were formed at these concentrations. At 2–20 μm (His)6MazE, we observed discrete mobility-shifted complexes, which move slower at the higher concentrations of (His)6MazE (Fig. 4A, lanes 7–12), suggesting that the number of (His)6MazE molecules bound to the DNA fragment increased at higher (His)6MazE concentrations. It is possible that there is more than one (His)6MazE-binding site in the 50-bp mazEF promoter fragment. On the other hand, MazF protein could not bind to the 50-bp mazEF promoter DNA even at 20 μm concentration (Fig. 4B). Increasing amounts of both (His)6MazE and MazF proteins were added with a constant (His)6MazE/MazF (1:2) ratio. Compared with (His)6MazE alone, MazF significantly enhanced (His)6MazE binding to the mazEF promoter. Under these conditions, the 50-bp mazEF promoter fragment was shifted at a (His)6MazE concentration of as low as 0.2 μm (Fig. 4C), and supershifting was observed at higher concentrations of the (His)6MazE-MazF complex, which indicates that more (His)6MazE-MazF complexes bind to the DNA fragment at higher concentrations, suggesting there are multiple binding sites for the (His)6MazE-MazF complex in the mazEF promoter. Conserved Amino Acid Sequence in MazE Homologs—The MazE homologs were identified by the BLAST search, and their amino acid sequence alignments are shown in Fig. 5. Although generally MazE is not highly conserved in bacteria, there are still some conserved boxes in MazE. First, the N-terminal region of MazE is more conserved than other regions in MazE. MazE is an acidic protein with a pI of 4.7, but there are a few conserved basic residues (Lys7, Arg8, and Arg16) in its N-terminal region, named the N box (Fig. 5). Because MazE is able to bind the mazEF promoter DNA, the N box may be responsible for DNA binding. Secondly, there is a conserved C-terminal region, named the Hp box (Fig. 5), which contains several conserved hydrophobic residues. The N Box of MazE Is Responsible for the DNA Binding of Both MazE and the MazE-MazF Complex—Various site-directed mutations were constructed in the mazE gene on pET21cc-EF(His)6 plasmid, converting the conserved amino acid residues in the N box to Ala. The complexes formed by MazE mutant proteins and MazF(His)6 were purified. These complexes were tested for their binding ability to the mazEF promoter DNA by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 6A, the complexes formed by MazE mutants with mutation in the N box (K7A, R8A, S12A, and R16A) and MazF(His)6 were unable to bind to the mazEF promoter DNA (Fig. 6A, lanes 3–6). However, the substitution mutations on the conserved amino acids outside the N box, such as MazE I43N and E57Q, did not affect the DNA binding of the complex (Fig. 6A, lanes 7 and 8, respectively). Various substitution mutations were also constructed in the mazE gene on pET28a-(His)6E plasmid. All of the (His)6MazE mutants with the substitution mutation in the N box (K7A, R8A, S12A, and R16A) lost their DNA binding ability (Fig. 6B, lanes 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively), whereas the wild-type (His)6MazE was able to bind to the mazEF promoter (Fig. 6B, lane 2). The (His)6MazE mutants with the substitution mutation outside the N box (R48A, F53A, L55A/L58A, and E57Q) were able to bind the mazEF promoter DNA (data not shown). These results indicate that the DNA binding ability of the MazE-MazF complex is due to MazE protein in the complex and that the N box is responsible for the DNA binding of MazE. Interaction between MazE and MazF—Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed to examine the interaction between MazE and MazF. To demonstrate which region of MazE is required for its interaction with MazF, the full-length mazE gene and various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs of the mazE gene, as indicated in Fig. 7, were generated by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI-PstI sites of pGAD-C1 vector to create in-frame translation fusions with the Gal4 transcriptional activation domain, and then each of these plasmids was cotransformed with the pGBD-MazF plasmid into PJ69–4A yeast cells, respectively. The cotransformants harboring pGAD-MazE, pGAD-MazEΔ(1–13), pGAD-MazEΔ(1–24), pGAD-MazEΔ(1–37), or pGAD-MazEΔ(76–82) with pGBD-MazF were able to grow on the on synthetic dropout medium (Clontech) lacking Trp, Leu, His, and Ade, whereas the cotransformants harboring pGAD-MazEΔ(1–46) or pGAD-MazEΔ(68–82) with pGBD-MazF were not. These data demonstrate that the full-length MazE, MazEΔ(1–13), MazEΔ (1–24), MazEΔ(1–37), and MazEΔ(76–82) are able to interact with MazF, whereas the further N-terminal deletion mutant MazEΔ(1–46) and the further C-terminal deletion mutant MazEΔ(68–82) are unable to do so. These results indicate that the region from residues 38 to 75 of MazE is responsible for the interaction with MazF. A series of truncation mutations from the N- and C-terminal ends of MazF were constructed in pGBD-C1 and cotransformed with pGAD-MazE into PJ69–4A cells. All of these cotransformed yeast cells were unable to grow on complete synthetic medium in the absence of Trp, Leu, His, and Ade, indicating that all of these MazF mutants were unable to interact with MazE. Therefore both N- and C-terminal regions of MazF may be involved in the interaction with MazE or the deletion mutations disrupt the MazF structure responsible for interaction with MazE. However, it is possible that the negative results of the yeast two-hybrid assays may be due to degradation of the fusion proteins. Site-directed mutations were also performed on plasmid pET28a-(His)6E to construct (His)6MazE R48A, F53A, L55A/L58A, and E57Q mutants. The complex formations with these (His)6MazE mutants and MazF were examined by native PAGE. As shown in Fig. 8A, (His)6MazE mutants R48A, F53A, and E57Q were able to form the complex with MazF (Fig. 8A, lanes 5, 6, and 7, respectively), whereas the (His)6MazE L55A/L58A mutant was not (Fig. 8A, lane 4). By EMSA, it was found that both the wild-type (His)6MazE and the (His)6MazE L55A/L58A mutant were able to bind to the mazEF promoter DNA (Fig. 8B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). When MazF was added, the wild-type (His)6MazE was able to interact with MazF to form the complex, resulting in a supershifted band near the top of the gel (Fig. 8B, lane 4) compared with the lane with wild-type (His)6MazE alone (Fig. 8B, lane 2). However, the addition of MazF to (His)6MazE L55A/L58A did not cause the supershifting of the DNA fragment, confirming that the (His)6MazE L55A/L58A mutant cannot interact with MazF to form a complex. The mazEF addiction system in E. coli consists of two genes, mazE and mazF, encoding liable antitoxin MazE and stable toxin MazF, respectively (22Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The toxic effect of MazF is activated by ppGpp, the signal produced by RelA protein because of amino acid starvation (22Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar); by certain antibiotics (27Sat B. Hazan R. Fisher T. Khaner H. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); and by the toxic protein Doc (26Hazan R. Sat B. Reches M. Engelberg-Kulka H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In each case, the degradation of labile MazE results in free stable MazF that exerts toxic effect to the cell. The regulation of the MazE cellular concentration is a major determinant of cell death. MazE forms a complex with MazF to inhibit its toxic effect and is also involved in the autoregulation of the mazEF expression by binding to the mazEF promoter (24Marianovsky I. Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5975-5984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, MazE is considered to consist of at least two functional domains: the DNA-binding domain and the MazF-binding domain. (His)6MazE is able to interact with MazF and bind to the mazEF promoter. MazF(His)6, like MazF, forms a dimer and inhibits the in vitro protein synthesis, and the protein synthesis is rescued by coaddition of (His)6MazE (data not shown). Therefore the His tags appear to have no effects on the function of MazE and MazF in vitro. Using highly purified (His)6MazE and MazF, we demonstrated that (His)6MazE can bind to the mazEF promoter by itself and that the addition of MazF enhances (His)6MazE binding to the mazEF promoter DNA by more than 10-fold. At the higher concentrations of (His)6MazE or the (His)6MazE-MazF complex, supershifting is observed in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the mazEF promoter DNA, indicating that both (His)6MazE and the (His)6MazE-MazF complex have more than one binding site on the mazEF promoter DNA. A previous fluorescent study suggests that there may be three MazE-binding sides in the mazEF promoter region (30Lah J. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. Kinne J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14101-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the bands are not shifted in a stepwise manner. The reason for such shifting patterns is unknown at present. The site-directed mutations in the conserved N box of MazE (K7A, R8A, S12A, and R16A) disrupted the DNA binding ability of both (His)6MazE and the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex (Fig. 6), suggesting that MazE is responsible for the DNA binding ability of the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex and that the highly conserved N-terminal region in MazE is the DNA-binding domain. So far, the precise targets in the promoter sequence for the binding of MazE and the MazE-MazF complex have not been identified. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed to identify the region responsible for the MazE-binding to MazF. It was found that the region from residues 38 to 75 in MazE was required for its binding to MazF. There is a conserved C-terminal region in MazE named the Hp box, which is rich in hydrophobic residues. The Hp box mutations at the conserved Leu55 and Leu58 (L55A/L58A) disrupted the interaction between (His)6MazE and MazF. The yeast two-hybrid experiments also indicated that the entire structure of MazF protein may be required for its interaction with MazE, because deletions from either the N- or C-terminal end of MazF disrupted the interaction between MazE and MazF. The molecular mass of the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex was determined to be 76.9 kDa by gel filtration. When the purified MazE-MazF(His)6 complex was subjected to Tricine SDS-PAGE, the ratio of MazE to MazF(His)6 was found to be ∼1:2 (Fig. 1, lane 2). Even in the presence of excess amounts of (His)6MazE or MazF, the ratio of (His)6MazE to MazF in the (His)6MazE-MazF complex was stably maintained at approximately 1:1.8 (Fig. 2). Because both MazE (30Lah J. Marianovsky I. Glaser G. Engelberg-Kulka H. Kinne J. Wyns L. Loris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14101-14111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and MazF(His)6 exist as dimers, the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex (76.9 kDa) may consist of one MazE dimer (predicted to be approximately 18.6 kDa because the molecular mass of MazE is 9.3 kDa) and two MazF(His)6 dimers (predicted to be approximately 56.6 kDa because the molecular mass of MazF(His)6 dimer is 28.3 kDa). While preparing this manuscript, the crystal structure of the MazE-MazF complex was determined by Kamada et al. (31Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the MazE-MazF complex confirmed our results in its following aspects: 1) In the crystal structure, MazE and MazF form a 2:4 heterohexamer, consisting of alternating MazF and MazE homodimers (MazF2-MazE2-MazF2). It is important to note that the 2:4 stoichiometric complex formation between MazE and MazF appears to be very stable, because the ratio between (His)6MazE and MazF in the (His)6MazE-MazF complex was found irrespective of which protein was added in large excess (Fig. 2). 2) The C-terminal region of MazE interacts with the MazF homodimer in the structure of MazE-MazF complex. The Hp box region identified in this study is involved in the seemingly most stable interface between MazE and MazF (Fig. 9). The side chains of hydrophobic amino acid residues (Leu55, Leu58, Val59, and Ile62) in the Hp box contact a cluster of hydrophobic residues in the MazF homodimer. Indeed (His)6MazE L55A/L58A mutant was not able to form a complex with MazF (Fig. 8), suggesting that these hydrophobic interactions are essential for the MazE-MazF complex formation. 3) Based on the similarity between MazE and other addiction module antidotes and the distribution of the basic regions on the electrostatic surfaces of MazE and MazF, Kamada et al. (31Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) proposed that Lys7 and Arg8 in MazE serve as the primary DNA anchoring sites in the MazE-MazF complex. In the present paper, we showed that the DNA binding abilities of (His)6MazE and the MazE-MazF(His)6 complex were disrupted not only by the site-directed mutations at Lys7 and Arg8 but also by mutations at other conserved amino acid residues (Ser12 and Arg16) in the N box (Fig. 9). It is possible that, because MazE exists as a dimer, the two N boxes in the MazE dimer may be involved together in DNA binding. The coexpression of MazE and MazF is not only negatively autoregulated by MazE and MazE-MazF complex but also inhibited by ppGpp. It has been demonstrated that the global regulatory nucleotide ppGpp affects the activity of RNA polymerase on specific promoters. A conserved GC-rich consensus sequence localized immediately downstream of the –10 promoter element has been recognized as an important cis-element for negative stringent control (32Wagner R. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 331-340PubMed Google Scholar). A GC-rich sequence (GCGG) exists immediately downstream of the –10 box of the major mazEF promoter P2 (24Marianovsky I. Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5975-5984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is possible that the inhibition of mazEF expression by ppGpp is due to its effect on RNA polymerase, whereas the autoregulation of the mazEF operon by MazE and the MazE-MazF complex may be due to their binding to the mazEF promoter region to block RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter. At present, there is no evidence suggesting that ppGpp has any effects on the protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction within the mazEF addiction module. The cellular effects of the toxins in the addiction modules have been studied quite extensively. CcdB, the toxin in the ccdA-ccdB system, interacts with DNA gyrase to induce DNA cleavage and block DNA replication (9Bahassi E.M. O'Dea M.H. Allali N. Messens J. Gellert M. Couturier M. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2002; 291: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and RelE, the toxin in the relBE system, has a ribosome-dependent codon-specific mRNA cleavage activity at the ribosome A site (21Pedersen K.

MazF has been shown to block translation as well as DNA replication (20Pedersen K. Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).

Disorders of mucosal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, are associated with destruction of the mucosal barrier, which results in increasing susceptibility to luminal pathogen and penetration of normal flora. The interaction between luminal microorganisms and intestinal epithelial cells has been considered a critical point for initiation and perpetuation of mucosal inflammation in murine colitis models and human inflammatory bowel disease (15Blumberg R.S. Saubermann L.J. Strober W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 16Podolsky D.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigate the expression of the cytosolic bacterial pathogen recognition molecule, CARD4/NOD1 in IECs, and the regulation by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFNγ, which has been implicated as a key regulatory cytokine in inflammatory bowel disease. Cell Culture—HT-29, Caco2, T84, Colo205, SW480, WiDr, SW48.5, LS174, and SW620 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and used for experiments after they had reached 90–100% confluence. HT-29 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with l-glutamine (Cellgro Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals Inc., Norcross, GA) in 6-well tissue culture plate (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Caco2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum. T84, SW480, and SW620 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Cellgro Mediatech Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cytokines for cell stimulation (IFNγ, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-β) were obtained from R & D System, (McKinley, NE). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from each IEC line was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. For reverse transcription, 2 μg of total RNA was transcribed by SuperScript II transcriptase according to protocols of SuperScript first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). The PCR mixture contained 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP mix, each 5′ and 3′ primer at 0.2 μm, 2 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), and 2 μl (10% of total volume) of reverse transcription products from RNA in a total volume of 50 μl. Amplification was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Thermal Cycler with 40 cycles at adequate conditions. The primers for polymerase chain reaction encoding CARD4/NOD1, CD45, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are: forward, 5′-AAAGCAATCGGGAACTTCTGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCATAGCACAGCACGAACT-3′ (CARD4/NOD1, 374bp); forward, 5′-AGCCCTGCTTGTTGTTCTCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ACCCTGCATCTCCGTTTATC-3′ (CD45, 338bp); and forward, 5′-TCATCTCTGCCCCCTCTGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGACGCCTGCTTCACCACCT-3′ (GAPDH, 440bp). Annealing temperature was 55 °C for CARD4/NOD1 and 58 °C for GAPDH and CD45. PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using a ABI 3700 PRISM automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequences were confirmed using NCBI BLAST software. Northern Blot Analysis—For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg/lane of total RNA was loaded on a formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The cDNA probe for CARD4/NOD1 was obtained by EcoRI and SmaI (Promega, Madison, WI) digestion (1.5 kb) of the pCl CARD4-HA plasmid kindly provided by Dr. John Bertin (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, MA). cDNA fragment for IRF-1 (439 bp) was obtained by RT-PCR in SW480 treated with IFNγ using forward primer (5′-GAC CCT GGC TAG AGA TGC AG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GAG CTG CTG AGT CCA TCA G-3′). PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. cDNA probe for IRF-1 was obtained by EcoRI digestion. Labeling of probes with [α-32P]dCTP was performed using Ready To Go DNA Labeling Beads (Amersham Biosciences). Prehybridization and hybridization were performed in QuikHyb Hybridization Solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primary Intestinal Epithelial Cell Isolation—Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from freshly obtained colonic mucosal biopsies by modifications of a technique previously described (17Reinecker H.C. Podolsky D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8353-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, colonic mucosal biopsies from patients were immediately placed into cold RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro Mediatech Inc.) and then washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. The samples were then washed with 1 mm dithiothreitol in PBS and then washed with PBS. The samples were immediately placed into 1 mm EDTA in PBS and incubated at 37 °C. When crypts were obtained from the biopsy samples, they were placed into 0.3 mm sodium tetraphenylborate (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 37 °C. The epithelial cells were collected and centrifuged at 400 × g. RPMI 1640 was added, and the cells were isolated individually by micropipetting under the microscope. Medium containing epithelial cells was placed in 0.5 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen) with 50 μg of Escherichia coli transfer RNA (Roche Applied Science) as carrier for RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was extracted by Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA obtained from 10–20 primary epithelial cells was eluted in 10 μl of nuclease free water. RNA was reverse-transcribed using 1 μl (50 units) of SuperScript II transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 2 μl (10% of total volume) of reverse transcription products from RNA of primary intestinal epithelial cells were used for PCR. Expression Plasmid and Transfection—pCl CARD4/NOD1-HA expression plasmid vector was kindly provided by Dr. John Bertin (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Protein expression of HA-tagged CARD4 was confirmed by Western blot using anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance Inc., Princeton, NJ) in COS7 cells transiently transfected with pCl CARD4-HA plasmid. The ability of the pCl CARD4-HA plasmid to activate NF-κB was confirmed by NF-κB reporter assay in transiently transfected HEK293 cells using PathDetect in Vivo Signal Transduction Pathway cis-Reporting Systems (Stratagene). pCDNA IRF-1 expression plasmid vector and pCDNA3.1 empty vector was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Perrella (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibody—Anti-CARD4/NOD1 was raised in rabbits immunized with either the synthetic polypeptide PVSRYTQQLRHHLGRDSKFVLC (ND1.1:125–146,22 (amino acids (aa))), SLVQRNTRSPVETLHAGRDTLC (ND1.2:440–461,22 aa), or GNLIKPEEAKVYEDEKRIIC (ND1.3:933–952,20 aa) conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin using Imject sulfhydryl reactive antibody production and purification kits (Pierce) (see Fig. 4A). Anti-sera (HM3851, ND1.1; HM3849, ND1.2; and HM3847, ND1.3) were purified using HyTrap protein A HP (Amersham Biosciences). Biotinylation of the anti-CARD4/NOD1 sera was performed using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Anti-CARD4/NOD1 sera were affinity-purified by peptides before use. Anti-IRF-1 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The cells were grown in 6-well plates and stimulated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ for 18 h and washed, and then 300 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor, EDTA, Tris/HCl, NaCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with protease-inhibitor mixture, Complete Mini (Roche Applied Science)) was added. After 10 min of incubation, cell-free lysates were obtained and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. For immunoprecipitation, a total 2 mg of protein was mixed with 2 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-CARD4/NOD1 antiserum (HM3851) and 10 μl of Hitrap protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer and solubilized in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (1.25% SDS, 2.5% glycerol, 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 4–20% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), and the proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with biotinylated rabbit anti-CARD4/NOD1 antiserum (HM3847) (100 ng/ml) followed by 1 h of incubation at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-biotin antibody (1:1000) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Staining was detected using the Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and radiographic film. Lysates from COS7 and COS7 cells transfected with pCl-CARD4-HA were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Construction of CARD4 Luciferase Reporter Constructs—The genomic sequence adjacent to the human CARD4/NOD1 exon 1 and promoter sequences were found in a GenBank™ working draft sequence of chromosome 7 (see Fig. 5A). The primers were designed corresponding to sequences overlapping the CARD4 exon1 at +21 and also a sequence –2,128 bp upstream. This putative promoter region was amplified from human genomic DNA (Promega) by PCR using Expand high Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science). The 2,128-bp PCR fragment was cloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega). This construct was confirmed by sequencing and named pGL-2128. The CARD4 promoter deletions (see Fig. 5B) were generated by restriction enzyme digestion using a blunting kit (Takara Biochemical, Berkeley, CA) or by PCR. Luciferase Reporter Assay—1 × 105/well of SW480 cells were seeded on 12-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). After 24 h, the cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmids, together with the indicated expression vectors. After 10 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of IFNγ for 16 h. The luciferase activity of total cell lysates was measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The Renilla luciferase reporter gene (10 ng/well) (Promega) was used as an internal control. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear proteins were prepared as previously described (18Awane M. Andres P.G. Li D.J. Reinecker H.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5337-5344PubMed Google Scholar). Both double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to –807 to –768 bp and mutated oligonucleotides were used as probes or cold competitors to analyze the interaction between IRF-1 protein and DNA (see Fig. 6, A and B). The probes were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) with [γ-32P]ATP. The binding reaction was performed as previously described (19Traber P.G. Wu G.D. Wang W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3614-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For a competition assay, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction. To perform supershift assay, the binding mixture were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 μl of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-IRF-1 antibody (C-20X, Santa Cruz). The samples were fractionated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (0.045 m Tris-borate, 1 mm Na2 EDTA). The resultant DNA-protein complexes were detected by autoradiography. Although intestinal epithelial cells are exposed to numerous bacteria and their components, they appear functionally to be hyporesponsive to normal flora or their components in vivo, an adaptation that seems appropriate to protect host from constant immune and inflammatory activation. However, previous studies have indicated that intestinal epithelial cells can respond to enteroinvasive bacteria to stimulate the recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils to an affected site in vivo and in vitro. Enteroinvasive bacteria, but not noninvasive bacteria, activate NF-κB in intestinal epithelial cell lines and induce expression of several genes encoding inflammatory mediators including IL-8, ICAM-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, or inducible nitric-oxide synthase in vitro (1Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Fierer J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Elewaut D. DiDonato J.A. Kim J.M. Truong F. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. J.

These results suggest that intracellular presentation of bacteria may lead to initial responses of intestinal epithelial cells that do not occur when bacteria are only encountered in the extracellular environment. Thus, intestinal epithelial cells have mechanisms for the recognition of intracellular bacterial pathogenic components that are presented by invasive bacteria. Recently, Philpott et al. (3Philpott D.J. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) reported that bacterial lipopolysaccharide can induce NF-κB activation in microinjected HeLa or Caco2 cells. Girardin et al. (21Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) demonstrated that invasive Shigella flexneri, but not noninvasive S. flexneri, lead to activation of c-Jun in HeLa cells. Activation of NF-κB and JNK by invasive S. flexneri is independent of the IL-1/TLR pathway in HEK293 cells. After infection with invasive S. flexneri, JNK activation is significantly increased in CARD4/NOD1 overexpressing HEK293 cells. CARD4/NOD1 oligomerization and RICK-IKKα complex are found in CARD4/NOD1-overexpressing HEK293 cells following invasive S. flexneri infection, and these effects are inhibited by a dominant negative CARD4/NOD1 (21Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that CARD4/NOD1 is a candidate to serve as a pivotal receptor for intracellular bacteria. However, CARD4/NOD1 expression and its regulation have not been previously demonstrated in IEC lines. Therefore, we investigated CARD4/NOD1 mRNA expression in IEC lines. mRNA Expression of CARD4/NOD1 in IEC Lines and Primary Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Expression of CARD4/NOD1 was assessed by RT-PCR in several independent derived IEC lines: HT-29, T84, Caco2, SW480, SW620, Colo205, WiDr, SW48.5, and LS174. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, CARD4/NOD1 mRNA (product size, 374 bp, confirmed by sequencing) was constitutively expressed in all IEC lines examined. Following demonstration of mRNA expression of CARD4/NOD1 by IEC lines, we investigated its expression in primary isolated intestinal epithelial cells to assess the relevance of the observations using the in vitro models. Isolated whole crypts were obtained from colonic biopsies after treatment with EDTA. Following treatment with sodium tetraphenylborate, single epithelial cells were isolated from whole crypts (Fig. 2A). To avoid contamination by nonepithelial origin cells, isolated epithelial cells were picked by micropipetting. Markers for lymphocytes and monocytic cells (CD45 and CD68) were not detected in these isolated intestinal epithelial cells by highly sensitive RT-PCR (data not shown). Total RNA from a single Jurkat cell and THP-1 cell served as positive controls for CD45 and CD68, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, CARD4/NOD1 (374 bp) was expressed in all isolated primary intestinal epithelial cells examined. Effect of IFNγ on the Expression of CARD4/NOD1—Regulation of CARD4/NOD1 expression has not been described previously. As shown in Fig. 3A, IFNγ augmented CARD4/NOD1 mRNA expression in SW480 cells. Other cytokines examined (tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, IL-4, and transforming growth factor-β) did not affect CARD4/NOD1 mRNA expression. The effect of IFNγ on CARD4/NOD1 mRNA expression is time- and concentration-dependent as assessed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). Although CARD4/NOD1 is considered important for recognition for intracellular pathogen, previous studies have not demonstrated active CARD4/NOD1 protein in vitro or in vivo. To investigate the expression of CARD4/NOD1 protein, we generated anti-CARD4/NOD1 sera. The specificity and the sensitivity were confirmed using lysates from COS7 cells transiently transfected with the HA-tagged CARD4 expression plasmid, pCl CARD4-HA (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the regulation of mRNA expression, CARD4/NOD1 protein was also augmented in SW480 cells by IFNγ stimulation (Fig. 4B). IRF-1 Is Essential for Up-regulation of CARD4/NOD1 Transcription by IFNγ—To identify the transcriptional regulation of CARD4/NOD1, we constructed a series of luciferase reporter vectors containing up to 2,128 bp corresponding to the DNA sequence upstream of base 1 and extending 21 bp into the first exon of CARD4/NOD1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Luciferase activity in SW480 cells transfected with a vector containing the entire 2,128-bp upstream DNA (pGL-2128) was 125 ± 16-fold higher than that obtained with the empty pGL3 basic vector. This promoter lacks a TATA box but has several GC-rich motifs including several SP-1-binding sites, near the transcription start site based on results of computer analysis using TRANSFAC data base of the University of Pennsylvania. Promoter activity was significantly decreased in pGL-26 (4.2 ± 1.4) compared with in pGL-367 (34.4 ± 1.1), indicating that –26 to –367 upstream of exon1 is essential for basal CARD4/NOD1 expression. As shown in Fig. 5 (C and D), IFNγ increased 80% luciferase activity in SW480 cells transfected with pGL-2128. Luciferase activity of cells transfected with deletion constructs pGLΔ-837–546, pGL-837, and pGL-546 demonstrated that sequences within –837 to –546 promoter are essential for activation by IFNγ. Three IRF-1-binding motifs (IRF-1A, –791 to –782; IRF-1B, –787 to –778; and IRF-1B, –694 to –689) (Figs. 5B and 6A) are clustered in this region. Luciferase activity of cells transfected with pGL-837, pGL-773, and pGL-729 suggested that the most distal IRF-1-binding motif (IRF-1A, –791 to –782) is essential for the IFNγ effect (Fig. 5, C and D). To determine whether IRF-1 binds to this IRF-1-binding motif in the CARD4/NOD1 promoter sequences, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from SW480 cells with IFNγ treatment. Consistent with the promoter analysis, oligonucleotides corresponding to IRF-1 binding sequences (IRF-1A) in CARD4/NOD1 promoter bound nuclear IRF-1 protein in SW480 cells treated with 100 ng/ml of IFNγ time-dependently (Fig. 6C, lanes 1–4). The binding of IRF-1 was inhibited by unlabeled oligonucleotides competitor but not by oligonucleotides with mutations at IRF-1-binding motifs (lanes 5 and 6). The band reflecting the complex with IRF-1 oligonucleotides was supershifted by anti-IRF-1 antibody (lanes 4 and 7). Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1-binding motifs, IFNγ activation site, and interferon-stimulated response element were not present as far as 5 kb upstream of the promoter region of CARD4/NOD1, as determined by computer analysis using TRANSFAC data base of University of Pennsylvania. We hypothesized that the effect of IFNγ on CARD4/NOD1 expression depends on IRF-1, which has an interferon-γ activation site motif in the promoter region. Transcription of IRF-1 is regulated by IFNγ through Janus tyrosine kinase/STAT pathway (22Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that IRF-1 mRNA and nuclear protein expression were rapidly up-regulated by IFNγ treatment in SW480 cells (Fig. 7). To confirm that overexpressed IRF-1 can activate CARD4/NOD1 promoter, we next performed promoter analysis using SW480 cells co-transfected with IRF-1 expression plasmid. Promoter activity of pGL-2128 was activated 2.0-fold (71.8 ± 0.6 versus 35.9 ± 0.9) in SW480 cells co-transfected with pCDNA IRF-1 expression vector. The effect of IRF-1 was completely abrogated in pGLΔ-837–546, which lacks the IRF-1 cluster region (Fig. 8). Collectively, these results suggest that rapid augmentation of nuclear IRF-1 protein by IFNγ treatment results in activation of CARD4/NOD1 transcription.Fig. 8IRF-1 activates CARD4/NOD1 transcription in SW480 cells. Luciferase activity in SW480 cells co-transfected with 500 ng/well of pGL –2128 or pGLΔ-837–546 and the indicated amount of IRF-1 expression plasmid. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h of transfection. The experiments were performed in triplicate. The data are presented as the relative fold (means ± S.D.) compared with SW480 cells transfected with pGL3 basic empty. The results were confirmed in three independent experiments. The experiments were performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) IFNγ is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokines in acute and chronic mucosal inflammation in the intestine (23Fiocchi C.

In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis as well as murine models of colitis, the Janus tyrosine kinase/STAT pathway is activated in inflamed mucosa (24Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. Yoshida T.

These findings provide evidence that pathogen recognition molecules are modulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and suggest that the latter promote host defenses to pathogens in inflammatory conditions. In acute and chronic intestinal inflammation, luminal pathogens or their components can invade more easily, because intestinal mucosal barrier function is impaired. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, it has been suggested that luminal bacteria contribute to the perpetuation of chronic inflammation (31Schultsz C. Van Den Berg F.M. Ten Kate F.W.

In this context, the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IFNγ, may readily lead to CARD4/NOD1 augmentation in IECs. Here, we first demonstrate that IECs express CARD4/NOD1 mRNA and protein and that IFNγ activates transcription of CARD4/NOD1 mRNA through IRF-1 in IECs. These data suggest that intestinal epithelial cells provide a functional as well as structural barrier to the entry of luminal bacteria or their components into the underlying lamina propria via the cytosolic protein CARD4/NOD1.

https://openalex.org/W2145971732,"In our previous studies, we found that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in HN33 cells induced sensitization of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Sun, Y., Savinainen, A., and Liu, Y. F. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 24713–24718). Following this study, we investigated whether tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors might contribute to the altered property of the receptors. Expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced elevation of phosphorylated or activated Src and increased targeting of PSD-95 (post-synaptic density 95) and activated Src to cell surface membrane. Expression of the mutated huntingtin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B (NMDA receptor 2B) subunits, and co-expression of PSD-95 enhanced the phosphorylation. Treatment of SU6656 (a specific Src inhibitor) or co-expression of a mutated NR2B subunit with mutations of all three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity induced by the mutated huntingtin. Addition of AP-5 did not further inhibit the neuronal toxicity. Taken together, our studies show that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin increases tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors via PSD-95 and Src, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation may contribute to the sensitization of the receptors mediated by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. In our previous studies, we found that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in HN33 cells induced sensitization of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Sun, Y., Savinainen, A., and Liu, Y. F. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 24713–24718). Following this study, we investigated whether tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors might contribute to the altered property of the receptors. Expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced elevation of phosphorylated or activated Src and increased targeting of PSD-95 (post-synaptic density 95) and activated Src to cell surface membrane. Expression of the mutated huntingtin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B (NMDA receptor 2B) subunits, and co-expression of PSD-95 enhanced the phosphorylation. Treatment of SU6656 (a specific Src inhibitor) or co-expression of a mutated NR2B subunit with mutations of all three major tyrosine phosphorylation sites significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity induced by the mutated huntingtin. Addition of AP-5 did not further inhibit the neuronal toxicity. Taken together, our studies show that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin increases tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors via PSD-95 and Src, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation may contribute to the sensitization of the receptors mediated by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin.

The HD gene, encoding an ∼350-kDa protein designated as huntingtin, is ubiquitously expressed (3DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K. Schwarz C. Meloni A. Young C. Martin A. Vonsattel J.P. Carraway R.

The genetic defect in the HD gene involves an expansion of a polyglutamine stretch near the 5′-end of the gene (5The Huntington's disease collaborative research groupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7118) Google Scholar). The length of the polyglutamine repeat is correlated with the age of onset and the severity of the disease (6Snell R.G. MacMillan J.C. Cheadle J.P. Fenton I. Lazarou L.P. Davies P. MacDonald M.E.

PSD-95, a scaffold protein, anchors many signaling proteins to the NMDA receptor complex and regulates biological function of the receptors (8Sheng M. Pak D.T.S. Annu. Rev.

Src tyrosine kinases are anchored by PSD-95 to the proximity of NMDA receptors where they induce tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B subunits and enhance the receptor-mediated current (10Ali D.W.

These studies indicate that PSD-95 and tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors may be involved in excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate. Many studies have shown that increased glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HD. Intrastriatal injection of glutamate or kainic acid in rat causes selective loss of medium spiny neurons that are also selectively affected in HD (15Beal M.F. Kowall N.W. Ellison D.W. Mazurek M.F. Swartz K.J. Martin J.B. Nature. 1986; 321: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). In the brains of HD patients, NMDA receptor-binding sites were disproportionately reduced even at the pre-symptomatic stage (16Young A.B. Greenamyre J.T. Hollingsworth Z. Albin R. D'Amato S.

In neuronal cells expressing the mutated huntingtin or mice transgenic for HD, NMDA receptors are highly responsive to the receptor agonists, and the receptor-mediated current is also significantly increased (18Cepeda C.

In our previous studies, we observed that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced sensitization of NMDA receptor via PSD-95 (1Sun Y. Savinainen A. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24713-24718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors may contribute to the sensitization of the receptors in HN33 cells. We found that expression of the mutated huntingtin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors, and inhibition of the phosphorylation attenuated the neuronal toxicity mediated by the mutated huntingtin in HN33 cells. Cell Culture, Plasmids, Transfection, and Kinase Assays—Wild-type NR1 or NR2B expression vectors were provided by Dr. J. Marshall, and triply mutated NR2B and fyn vectors were provided by Dr. M. Greenberg (21Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). HN33 and 293T cells were maintained in F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. We performed transient transfection using Lipofectin per instruction by the manufacturer. For detecting pSrc, HN33 or 293T cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 buffer (22Song C. Perides G. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) 24 h following the transfection. These cell lysates (30 μg of protein) were resolved in a 10% SDS gel and then transferred. The blots were analyzed by an anti-pSrc antibody, which mainly recognizes activated 60-kDa Src (Cell Signaling). Fold increase of the kinase activity was quantified using a computer program associated with Kodak image station 440, and the level in each control was designated as 1. Generation of Anti-phospho-NR2B Antibody—Tyr-1472 is a major tyrosine phosphorylation site for the NR2B subunit (23Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Phosphospecific peptide NH2-CSNGHV(pY)EKLSSI-COOH was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used as an immunogen to raise rabbit polyclonal antibody. The antibody 438 was purified from sera by successive affinity chromatography. This was done using a column of N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4B resin conjugated to each non-phosphorylated peptide to remove IgGs against non-phosphorylated NR2B subunits and was followed by a column conjugated to each immunogen to obtain the antibody specific for the tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B subunit. Membrane Fraction—Membrane fraction was conducted as described by Cho et al. (24Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. 36 h following transfection, transfected or non-transfected HN33 cells were homogenized with a Teflon-glass homogenizer (0.25 mm of clearance) in solution A (0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaVO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture). The resulting homogenates were diluted with solution A and centrifuged at 1,400 × g for 10 min. The pellets were homogenated again with solution A and centrifuged at 710 × g for 10 min. The supernatants from both centrifugations were combined and centrifuged at 13,800 × g for 10 min. Co-immunoprecipitations—48 h following transfection, 293T cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (22Song C. Perides G. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6703-6707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were incubated with an antibody as indicated in the figure legends for 3 h at 4 °C, and a mixture of proteins A- and G-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added. Incubation was continued for another hour. Precipitated proteins were resolved in a SDS gel, and the resulting blots were probed with antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Immunocytochemistry—A yellow fluorescence expression vector was included for localizing transfected cells. 24 h after transfection, HN33 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice. Cells were incubated with the first antibody as indicated in the figure legends followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody. After washing, the cells were incubated with another antibody followed by incubation with rhodamine-conjugated anti-sheep or anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The distribution of huntingtin and activated Src or PSD-95 was visualized under a Zeiss LSM-5 confocal microscope. TUNEL Staining—36 h post-transfection, HN33 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min on ice, and TUNEL staining was performed as described previously (1Sun Y. Savinainen A. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24713-24718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Most apoptotic HN33 cells were detached from the slides, and TUNEL staining was performed on the remaining attached cells. TUNEL-stained negative cells (living cells) were counted in the 20× field in four different locations on the slides, and ∼600–800 cells were counted in the control. First, we investigated whether expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced activation of Src tyrosine kinase in HN33 cells. Full-length huntingtin expression vector containing 16 or 48 CAG repeats or vector alone (pcDNA1, control) was separately transfected into HN33 cells. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and the resulting blot was analyzed with an anti-phospho-Src antibody, which only recognizes activated Src. As shown in Fig. 1A, Src was activated in HN33 cells, and expression of normal huntingtin with 16 CAG repeats did not cause further elevation of pSrc. Expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin with 48 CAG repeats, however, caused an ∼5-fold increase of pSrc. To further investigate Src activation mediated by the mutated huntingtin, we conducted immunocytochemistry studies. 24 h following transfection, HN33 cells were fixed and stained with an anti-phospho-Src antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, activated Src is diffusedly localized in HN33 cells. Expression of normal huntingtin with 16 CAG repeats did not alter the localization of the activated kinase, whereas expression of the mutated huntingtin with 48 CAG repeats induced translocation of activated Src from cytoplasm to cell periphery. These data suggest that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin may increase targeting of activated Src to cell surface membrane. Src is anchored by PSD-95 to cell surface membrane (10Ali D.W. Salter M.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we found that normal huntingtin binds to PSD-95, and polyglutamine expansion impairs the ability of huntingtin to interact with the scaffold protein (1Sun Y. Savinainen A. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24713-24718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether expression of normal or polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin altered the localization of PSD-95. As shown in Fig. 2A, PSD-95 is present in the cytoplasm, and most were co-localized with normal huntingtin. Expression of normal huntingtin with 16 CAG repeats did not alter the co-localization, whereas expression of the mutated huntingtin with 48 CAG repeats caused translocation of PSD-95 to cell surface membrane, and the co-localization of the scaffold protein with huntingtin was mostly disrupted (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the mutated huntingtin also increases the targeting of PSD-95 to the cell surface membrane. To further validate these results, we performed the membrane fraction and examined the amount of PSD-95 and activated Src in the membrane fraction with or without transfection of normal or mutated huntingtin. As shown in Fig. 2B, expression of the mutated huntingtin with 48 CAG repeats clearly increased the amount of PSD-95 and activated Src in the membrane fraction. We then examined whether expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. Because expression of the mutated huntingtin induced rapid apoptotic cell death in HN33 cells, we first conducted these experiments using 293T cells. A huntingtin construct containing 16 or 48 CAG repeats was co-transfected with NR1 and NR2B with or without PSD-95 into 239T cells. 48 h following transfection, cells were lysed, and co-immunoprecipitation was conducted using an anti-NR2B antibody. The resulting blot was analyzed by PY20 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B subunits, and then the blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-NR2B antibody (Fig. 3A). 50 μl of cell lysates from the same preparation was resolved in a SDS gel, the blot was probed with an anti-phospho-Src antibody, and the blot was stripped and reprobed with an anti-Src antibody (Fig. 3A). Changes of tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B subunits or pSrc were quantified according to the density of each band. Expression of normal huntingtin neither elevated the levels of pSrc nor mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits (Fig. 3A). Co-transfection of PSD-95 with normal huntingtin induced an ∼6-fold increase of tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B subunits suggesting that PSD-95 recruited endogenous activated Src to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits (Fig. 3A). Expression of the mutated huntingtin elevated the levels of pSrc and induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of PSD-95 did not cause further elevation of pSrc but further increased the number of tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B receptors (Fig. 3A). In comparison to the ∼7-fold increase of tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B receptors with expression of the mutated huntingtin, addition of PSD-95 induced an ∼14-fold increase of these phosphorylated receptors. These data suggest that the mutated huntingtin may induce tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits via other members of the PSD-95 family endogenously expressed in 293T cells, which also anchor Src to NMDA receptors, and expression of PSD-95 recruits more Src to these receptors thereby further increasing the number of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors. Src induces phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit on Tyr-1252, -1336, and -1472, and mutations of these three tyrosines block the phosphorylation by Src significantly attenuating Src-mediated increased calcium influx via NMDA receptors (21Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To further investigate whether expression of the mutated huntingtin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Tyr-1472-phosphorylated NR2B, 438. To determine the specificity of the antibody, we co-transfected NR1 with wild-type NR2B and mutated NR2B with substitutions of Tyr-1252, -1336, and -1472 to phenylalanine (NR2BTM) or NR2A expression vectors in the presence or absence of Fyn (a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family that has been shown to bind to PSD-95 and induce tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits) (21Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B. Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, co-expression of fyn induced tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type NR2A and NR2B subunits, which, except for the mutated NR2B subunit, were detected by PY20. 438 recognized the wild-type tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B subunit but not the non-phosphorylated NR2B (the mutated NR2B) and the tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2A subunits. The data indicate that the antibody 438 specifically recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B subunit. Thus, 438 was utilized to determine whether the mutated huntingtin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits in HN33 cells. 24 h following transfection of normal or mutated huntingtin, HN33 cells were lysed, and the resulting blot was analyzed with 438. As shown in Fig. 3C, expression of the mutated huntingtin with 48 CAG repeats (but not normal huntingtin with 16 CAG repeats) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits in HN33 cells. To evaluate whether tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B receptors is involved in the neuronal toxicity mediated by the mutated huntingtin, we added SU6656, a specific Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to the transfection medium. 36 h following transfection, HN33 cells were fixed, and TUNEL staining, which detects the late stage of apoptotic cells, was conducted (25Portera-Cailliau C. Hedreen J.C. Price D.L. Koliatsos V.E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3775-3787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As we reported previously, expression of the mutated huntingtin with 48 CAG repeats induced rapid apoptosis in HN33 cells, and ∼70% of the cells were apoptotic 36 h following transfection (1Sun Y. Savinainen A. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24713-24718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Addition of the Src inhibitor significantly attenuated apoptotic cell death mediated by the mutated huntingtin (Fig. 4A). We have shown that addition of AP-5, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to the transfection medium significantly attenuated apoptotic death induced by the mutated huntingtin (1Sun Y. Savinainen A. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24713-24718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Co-addition of AP-5 with SU6656 did not further inhibit neuronal apoptosis induced by the mutated huntingtin, suggesting that the Src inhibitor may inhibit the neuronal toxicity via the inhibition of NMDA receptors. To further investigate the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors in the induction of neuronal toxicity mediated by the mutated huntingtin, we co-transfected normal or mutated huntingtin construct with a vector alone or an NR2B mutant with triple substitutions of all three tyrosine phosphorylation sites (NR2BTM). As shown in Fig. 4B, expression of vector alone failed to influence the neuronal toxicity mediated by the mutated huntingtin, whereas co-expression of triply mutated NR2B subunit significantly attenuated the neuronal toxicity induced by the mutated huntingtin. Addition of AP-5 in the transfection medium did not further inhibit the neuronal toxicity. These data further support that tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors may be involved in the neuronal toxicity mediated by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in HN33 cells. In the present studies, we investigated a role of tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors in the induction of neuronal toxicity mediated by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. We found that expression of the mutated huntingtin with 48 CAG repeats caused an elevation of activated Src in both HN33 and 293T cells, whereas expression of normal huntingtin failed to do so. Expression of the mutated huntingtin also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B subunits in both cell lines. We also performed these studies using full-length huntingtin vector containing 89 CAG repeats and obtained similar results. These results indicate that huntingtin mediates Src activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors in a polyglutamine expansion-dependent manner. Addition of SU6656 or co-expression of an NR2B mutant with substitutions of all three tyrosine phosphorylation sites significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity mediated by the mutated huntingtin, and addition of an NMDA receptor antagonist did not further inhibit the neuronal toxicity. These data support that tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors may be involved in sensitization of the receptors and neuronal toxicity mediated by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Many studies have shown that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced sensitization of NMDA receptors (1Sun Y. Savinainen A. Liu Y.F. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1890-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Our studies support this notion. Normal huntingtin is a cytoplasm protein (4Gutekunst C.-A. Levey A.J. Hellman C.J. Whsley W.L. Yi H. Nash N.R. Rees H.D. Madden J.J. Hersch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An intriguing question is why polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin alters the property of NMDA receptors at the cell surface. In our previous studies, we have shown that normal huntingtin binds to PSD-95, and polyglutamine expansion inhibits the ability of huntingtin to interact with the scaffold protein. In the present studies, we showed that normal huntingtin is co-localized with PSD-95, and expression of the mutated huntingtin causes translocation of the scaffold protein and inhibits the co-localization of these two proteins in the cytoplasm. These data demonstrate that polyglutamine expansion impairs the ability of huntingtin to retain PSD-95 in the cytoplasm and promotes the targeting of the scaffold protein to cell surface membrane (1Sun Y. Savinainen A. Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24713-24718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). PSD-95 anchors Src to NMDA receptors (10Ali D.W. Salter M.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar); therefore, it is not surprising that expression of the mutated huntingtin also increased the targeting of Src to the cell surface membrane. In the brain, normal huntingtin and PSD-95 are mostly associated with microtubules (4Gutekunst C.-A. Levey A.J. Hellman C.J. Whsley W.L. Yi H. Nash N.R. Rees H.D. Madden J.J. Hersch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 27Hunt C.A. Schenker L.J. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the possibilities is that normal huntingtin regulates the amount of PSD-95 at PSD by retaining the scaffold protein in the microtubule complex, and polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin loses such a function leading the increase of targeting of PSD-95 and PSD-95-associated proteins, such as Src, to PSD. In parallel with this study, we also examined changes of PSD-95, Src, and tyrosine-phosphorylated NMDA receptors in the PSD fraction from brain tissues of R6/2, a HD transgenic mouse model (28Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lahrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). We found that PSD-95, activated Src, and tyrosine-phosphorylated NR2B subunits were significantly increased in the PSD fraction. 2Y. F. Liu, unpublished observations. These results further support our hypothesis. Understanding of the pathogenesis of HD is critical for developing effective treatment to this devastating neurodegenerative disease. Many NMDA receptor antagonists have been developed. Although they are neuroprotective in many animal models, the clinical application of these NMDA receptor antagonists is limited because of their toxicity. Our studies demonstrate that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. Perhaps, an NMDA receptor antagonist that selectively inhibits tyrosine-phosphorylated NMDA receptors may eliminate unwanted side effects and effectively treat this otherwise untreatable disease.

https://openalex.org/W2159641975,"Polyubiquitination is required for retrotranslocation of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum back into the cytosol, where they are degraded by the proteasome. We have tested whether the release of a polypeptide chain into the cytosol is caused by a ratcheting mechanism in which the attachment of polyubiquitin prevents the chain from moving back into the endoplasmic reticulum. Using a permeabilized cell system in which major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains are retrotranslocated under the influence of the human cytomegalovirus protein US11, we demonstrate that polyubiquitination alone is insufficient to provide the driving force for retrotranslocation. Substrate release into the cytosol requires an additional ATP-dependent step. Release requires a lysine 48 linkage of ubiquitin chains. It does not occur when polyubiquitination of the substrate is carried out with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ubiquitin, and this correlates with poly-GST-ubiquitin not being recognized by a ubiquitin-binding domain in the Ufd1-Npl4 cofactor of the ATPase p97. These data suggest that polyubiquitin does not serve as a ratcheting molecule. Rather, it may serve as a recognition signal for the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, a component implicated in the movement of substrate into the cytosol. Polyubiquitination is required for retrotranslocation of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum back into the cytosol, where they are degraded by the proteasome. We have tested whether the release of a polypeptide chain into the cytosol is caused by a ratcheting mechanism in which the attachment of polyubiquitin prevents the chain from moving back into the endoplasmic reticulum. Using a permeabilized cell system in which major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chains are retrotranslocated under the influence of the human cytomegalovirus protein US11, we demonstrate that polyubiquitination alone is insufficient to provide the driving force for retrotranslocation. Substrate release into the cytosol requires an additional ATP-dependent step. Release requires a lysine 48 linkage of ubiquitin chains. It does not occur when polyubiquitination of the substrate is carried out with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-ubiquitin, and this correlates with poly-GST-ubiquitin not being recognized by a ubiquitin-binding domain in the Ufd1-Npl4 cofactor of the ATPase p97. These data suggest that polyubiquitin does not serve as a ratcheting molecule. Rather, it may serve as a recognition signal for the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex, a component implicated in the movement of substrate into the cytosol. In eukaryotic cells, a quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; αHC, heavy chain antibodies; αUb, ubiquitin antibodies; αHA, HA antibodies. ensures that only proteins with a native, folded conformation leave the organelle for other destinations, such as the plasma membrane. Misfolded proteins that cannot reach their native state are retrotranslocated from the ER into the cytosol, where they are subsequently degraded by the proteasome (1Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 3Tsai B.

Two human cytomegalovirus proteins, US2 and US11, are able to direct newly synthesized major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I heavy chains into the ER degradation pathway (4Jones T.R.

Human MHC class I heavy chain is a 43-kDa type I transmembrane protein with a large luminal/extracellular domain and a short cytosolic tail. The protein is initially inserted into the ER membrane and glycosylated, but under the influence of either US2 or US11, it is rapidly moved into the cytosol, where its N-glycan is cleaved off and the polypeptide chain is degraded by the proteasome (5Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The absence of MHC class I molecules at the cell surface allows the virus to propagate without the infected cell being detected by cytotoxic T cells. Most substrates destined to be degraded are polyubiquitinated while undergoing retrotranslocation. Our previous results showed that polyubiquitination is not only required for degradation by the proteasome but also for retrotranslocation per se (8Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin chains are required for protein degradation by the proteasome (9Chau V.

Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar), it would be important to know which kind of polyubiquitin chains are involved in retrotranslocation. The role of polyubiquitination in retrotranslocation also remained unclear. In one model, polyubiquitin provides the driving force for moving the substrate into the cytosol by acting as a ratcheting molecule (for discussion, see Ref. 3Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The attachment of the bulky polyubiquitin moiety to a polypeptide segment on the cytosolic side of the membrane would bias random movements of the substrate across the ER membrane by preventing it from sliding back into the ER lumen. This model would be analogous to the one describing posttranslational translocation in the forward direction. In this case, the binding of the luminal chaperone BiP prevents the translocating polypeptide chain from moving back into the cytosol, eventually resulting in its complete transport into the ER lumen (16Matlack K.E. Misselwitz B. Plath K. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). If a polyubiquitin-mediated ratcheting mechanism functioned in a similar way in retrotranslocation, polyubiquitination alone should be sufficient to move a substrate into the cytosol. Alternatively, it is possible that the polyubiquitin chain serves as a recognition signal for a downstream component. One candidate for this downstream component is the ATPase p97 (called Cdc48 in yeast), which together with its cofactor Ufd1-Npl4 has been implicated in moving polypeptides from the ER membrane into the cytosol (17Bays N.W.

We show that polyubiquitination is not sufficient to move a substrate into the cytosol. Rather, a subsequent ATP-dependent step is required, during which polyubiquitin in a lysine 48 linkage serves as a recognition signal. Our in vitro experiments suggest that the downstream component may be the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex. Pulse-Chase Analysis with Permeabilized Cells—Control and US11-expressing U373-MG astrocytoma cells (4Jones T.R. Hanson L.K. Sun L. Slater J.S. Stenberg R.M. Campbell A.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4830-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously (5Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The cells were detached from tissue culture flasks with trypsin and incubated in suspension in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium for1hat37 °C. Where indicated, 50 μm of proteasome inhibitor MG-115 (Calbiochem) was present during incubation. The cells resuspended at 1 × 107/ml were pulse-labeled for 3–5 min at 37 °C in 290 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (35S-Protein Express Labeling Mix; New England Nuclear). They were then placed on ice and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.9 mm CaCl2 and resuspended at 1.6 × 107 cells/ml in PB (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 115 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA) containing 0.04% digitonin (Merck; purified as described in Ref. 22Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and protease inhibitor mix (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 3 μg/ml elastatinal, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The samples were centrifuged, and the pellets were washed in PB without digitonin and resuspended in cow liver cytosol. Where indicated 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, an inhibitor of deubiquitinating enzymes, was added. The samples were then chase-incubated at 37 °C for different time periods. After centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant of the samples was removed and saved, whereas the pellet fraction was resuspended in PB. The lysates were made from the samples, and the immunoprecipitations were carried out as described below. Cow liver cytosol was prepared as described previously (8Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Lysate Preparation and Immunoprecipitations—The lysates were made from samples corresponding to 1–2 × 106 cells in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Igepal; CA-630; Sigma), 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. The buffer also contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the previously mentioned protease inhibitor mix. The samples were agitated for 20 min at 4 °C and then clarified by centrifuging in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation after SDS and dithiothreitol were added to final concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2 mm, respectively. Denaturing SDS lysates were made by resuspending cell pellets or cell fractions in 100 μl of 2% SDS and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, cooled to room temperature, agitated vigorously, and diluted into Nonidet P-40 buffer so that the final concentrations in the lysate used for immunoprecipitation were ∼0.2% SDS, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Igepal, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. All of the immune complexes were recovered by precipitation with fixed Staphylococcus aureus bacteria (Staph A). Anti-heavy chain serum and antibodies against bovine ubiquitin were described previously (7Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody 12CA5, which recognizes the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, was purified from tissue culture cell supernatants by standard methods (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 421-466Google Scholar) or purchased from Sigma. Immunoprecipitation with heavy chain antibodies and reprecipitation with ubiquitin antibodies were done as described (7Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin Depletion—Ubiquitin was depleted from cow liver cytosol as described, using a recombinant GST-tagged Ubc2 that carries a serine instead of a cysteine in the active site (8Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The depletion reaction mixture contained 16 μm GST-tagged Ubc2Ser and an ATP-regenerating system (24Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was subsequently transferred to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and incubated at 4 °C for 15–30 min. The non-bound material was frozen at –80 °C. Ubiquitin Reagents—Bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma. For the experiment in Fig. 2, ubiquitin was labeled using the following procedure. Bovine ubiquitin was iodinated using Iodogen Iodination Reagent (Pierce). Each 90-μl iodination reaction mixture contained 8.9 mg/ml ubiquitin and 22.2 mCi/ml Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 44.4 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6. The reaction tube was coated with 100 μl of 1 mg/ml Iodogen in chloroform. The reaction was carried out on ice for 30 min, after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.4 mg/ml tyrosine and 16 μl of 0.1 m nonradioactive NaI. Iodinated ubiquitin was purified by passing it through a Sephadex G-25 spin column equilibrated with PB. The final concentration was estimated at 300 μm, labeled to 16,500 cpm/pmol. 125I-Ubiquitin was added to the cow liver cytosol at a concentration of 20 μm. The pGEX-Ubiquitin plasmids coding for GST-ubiquitin and GST-K48R were provided by T. Sommer. All GST-ubiquitin proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli. The cells were grown to an A value of ∼1.0 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h. They were lysed and centrifuged at 42,000 rpm in an ultracentrifuge to remove nonsoluble material. The fusion protein was purified from the supernatant by glutathione affinity chromatography. Binding of p97 to Heavy Chains in Permeabilized Cells—The experiments were performed essentially as described (18Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The cell fractions were solubilized in 1% Deoxy Big CHAP ([N,N′-bis(3-d-gluconamidopropyl)deoxycholamide]), 30 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm ATP, and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with His antibodies followed by a second precipitation with HA antibodies. Binding of Polyubiquitin and Poly-GST-ubiquitin to Ufd1-Npl4 — Plasmids encoding mammalian C-terminally His-tagged Ufd1, Npl4, and Npl4ΔZF, lacking the zinc finger domain, were described previously (25Meyer H.H. Wang Y. Warren G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5645-5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The plasmids pGEX-gp78c and pGEX-MmUBC7 were provided by A. Weissman. p97, GST-gp78c, and GST-Ubc7 were purified as described (18Ye Y. Meyer H.H. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2001; 414: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). 2Ye, Y., Meyer, H. H., and Rapoport, T. A. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 162, 71–84. Polyubiquitin chains were synthesized at 37 °C with 4 μm Ubc7, 1 μm GST-gp78c in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium/ATP, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 110 nm E1, and 20 μm ubiquitin. The binding experiments were carried out at 4 °C in 0.3 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 150 mm potassium chloride, 2.5 mm magnesium chloride, 5% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. 20-μl samples of polyubiquitination reactions were incubated with 1 μg of the various purified recombinant proteins. The proteins were then precipitated with specific antibodies, and bound ubiquitin chains were detected by immunoblotting with ubiquitin antibodies. Miscellaneous Methods—For ATP depletion, the cytosol was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.1 unit/μl hexokinase and 20 mm glucose. Where indicated, 3 mm AMP-PNP and 3 mm MgOAc were added during the chase period. Wild-type HA/A2 and K-R HA/A2 constructs and cell lines were described previously (7Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Retrotranslocation Requires Polyubiquitination and a Subsequent ATP-dependent Step—To study the mechanism of retrotranslocation we used a permeabilized cell system in which native cytosol can be replaced with cow liver cytosol (8Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), allowing for convenient manipulation of cytosol. Human astrocytoma cells, stably expressing the human cytomegalovirus protein US11, were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. The cells were permeabilized by addition of a low concentration of digitonin, pelleted, and resuspended in cytosol from cow liver in the presence of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system. After chase incubation at 37 °C, one portion of the samples was analyzed directly, and the other was separated into membrane pellet and supernatant fractions. The samples were solubilized in detergent, subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to MHC class I heavy chains (αHC), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1A, lanes 9–12). As reported previously (5Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 7Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the heavy chains were degraded during the chase period (lane 10 versus lane 9). In addition, the characteristic deglycosylated, faster migrating heavy chain species, which fractionated with the cytosol, appeared (lane 11 versus lane 12). To detect polyubiquitinated heavy chains, a portion of the samples was subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitation with ubiquitin antibodies (lanes 29–32). Polyubiquitinated heavy chains, appearing as a smear of high molecular mass species, accumulated over time (lane 30 versus lane 29). Most of the polyubiquitinated heavy chains were found in the cytosolic fraction (lane 31 versus lane 32), indicating that they had been released from the ER membrane. In control cells not expressing US11, the heavy chains were stable (lanes 1–8), and no polyubiquitination was observed (lanes 21–28). It should be noted that previous experiments showed that polyubiquitination is required for retrotranslocation (8Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), implying that the majority of the retrotranslocated heavy chains, visible in the cytosolic fraction as the deglycosylated species, must have undergone deubiquitination, even in the presence of 1 μm ubiquitin-aldehyde. When permeabilized cells expressing US11 were incubated with ATP-depleted cow liver cytosol (ΔATP), the degradation of the heavy chains was greatly reduced, and the majority of the material stayed on the membrane (lane 16 versus lane 15). As expected from the ATP requirement of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme, no polyubiquitination was observed (lanes 33–36). The addition of AMP-PNP to the ATP-depleted sample did not increase the degradation of heavy chains (lanes 17–20), but it partially restored polyubiquitination (lane 38), in agreement with the expectation that the ubiquitin-activating enzyme can utilize the ATP analog because it hydrolyzes ATP into AMP and PPi (27Johnston N.L. Cohen R.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7514-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Pickart C.M. Kasperek E.M. Beal R. Kim A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7115-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polyubiquitinated chains that were formed fractionated with the membrane rather than with the cytosol (lane 40 versus lane 39). The apparent incomplete restoration of polyubiquitination by AMP-PNP may in part be due to deubiquitination occurring during sample preparation (a band at the approximate size of unmodified heavy chains (indicated by an asterisk) was consistently generated even in the presence of protease inhibitors). To show that this polyubiquitination occurs in a domain of the heavy chain that was originally in the ER lumen, we employed a mutant (K-R) heavy chain, in which the lysines in the C-terminal tail were mutated to arginines. Because ubiquitination can only take place on free amino groups (internal lysine residues or the extreme N terminus), the cytoplasmic domain of this mutant heavy chain cannot be ubiquitinated. For these experiments, we used stable cell lines that express HA-tagged MHC class I heavy chains in addition to US11. In the presence of ATP, a fraction of both the wild-type and the mutant (K-R) heavy chains were deglycosylated during the chase period (Fig. 1B, lane 2 versus lane 1 and lane 10 versus lane 9) and appeared in the cytosolic fraction (lanes 3 and 11). Polyubiquitinated heavy chains accumulated during the chase period (lane 18 versus lane 17 and lane 26 versus lane 25) and were mostly released into the cytosol (lanes 19 and 27). In the presence of AMP-PNP, however, retrotranslocation was blocked (lane 7 versus lane 8 and lane 15 versus lane 16). Polyubiquitinated heavy chains were generated (lanes 22 and 30) but remained in the membrane fraction (lanes 24 and 32). To detect polyubiquitin chains directly, 125I-ubiquitin was added to cow liver cytosol and incubated with permeabilized astrocytoma cells expressing US11. The samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with heavy chain antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2A). Polyubiquitinated heavy chains accumulated over time (lane 2 versus lane 1), and the majority was found in the cytosolic fraction (lane 3 versus lane 4). When ATP was depleted (ΔATP), polyubiquitination was significantly reduced (lanes 5–8). The residual modified chains were found in the membrane rather than in the cytosolic fraction (lane 8 versus lane 7). When AMP-PNP was added to the ATP-depleted sample, polyubiquitination was restored (lane 10), and essentially all modified chains fractionated with the membranes (lane 12 versus lane 11). When similar experiments were performed with US11 cells expressing the HA-tagged wild-type or K-R mutant heavy chains, we observed that in the presence of ATP polyubiquitination occurred on both the wild-type and mutant heavy chains, with most modified chains appearing in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 4 versus lane 3 and lane 12 versus lane 11). When polyubiquitination was performed with AMP-PNP, the chains failed to be moved into the cytosol and remained associated with the membrane (lane 8 versus lane 7 and lane 16 versus lane 15). These chains appear to have a higher molecular mass than in the presence of ATP and ATP-regenerating system (lanes 5–8 versus lanes 1–4 and lanes 13–16 versus lanes 9–12), which may reflect the existence of an ATP-dependent deubiquitinating step. Taken together, these results indicate that polyubiquitination occurs on a segment that was originally in the ER lumen and that modification of these residues alone is insufficient to move the substrate into the cytosol. An additional ATP-dependent step that requires hydrolysis of the γ-phosphate of ATP appears to be involved. To provide further evidence that an additional ATP-dependent step is required for the release of heavy chains into the cytosol, we performed experiments in the absence of AMP-PNP, thus excluding the possibility that the ATP analog blocked a step following polyubiquitination. Permeabilized cells labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine were resuspended in cow liver cytosol in the absence of ATP and chase-incubated for 20 min. Then either buffer or 0.1 mm ATP was added, and the incubation was continued for another 10 min (30 min total). The polyubiquitinated heavy chains formed during the labeling period stayed on the membrane in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3, lanes 1–7, P). However, when ATP was added, about half of the polyubiquitinated chains were released into the cytosol (lane 13 versus lane 14). In the presence of ATP, some shorter polyubiquitinated species appeared in the membrane fraction, either because existing chains were deubiquitinated or because new polyubiquitin chains were formed. These results confirm that polyubiquitination alone is insufficient and that ATP is required for the release of modified substrate from the ER membrane into the cytosol. Lysine 48 Linkage of Polyubiquitin Chains Is Required for Retrotranslocation—Different lysines in the ubiquitin molecule can serve for chain elongation, resulting in polyubiquitin chains with distinct roles in the cell. For example, polyubiquitin chains with lysine 48 linkages are required for proteasomal degradation (9Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), whereas chains with lysine 63 linkages are implicated in nonproteolytic events (11Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar, 14Spence J.

Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine whether a specific linkage is required for retrotranslocation. US11 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine, permeabilized, and resuspended in ubiquitin-depleted cytosol replenished with buffer, wild-type ubiquitin, or ubiquitin mutants lacking specific attachment sites (K48R or K63R ubiquitin). The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then a portion of the samples was analyzed directly, whereas the other was separated into a membrane pellet and a cytosolic supernatant fraction. After solubilization in detergent, the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation with αHC and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In the absence of ubiquitin (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4), MHC class I heavy chains were retained in the membrane (lane 4). In the presence of wild-type ubiquitin (lanes 5–8), the deglycosylated heavy chain species appeared in the cytosolic fraction (lane 7 versus lane 8). When the K48R mutant was present (lanes 9–12), however, hardly any deglycosylated species was observed in the cytosolic fraction (lane 11). The K63R mutant behaved like wild-type ubiquitin (lanes 13–16 versus lane 5–8). These results indicate that polyubiquitin chains with lysine 48 linkages are required for retrotranslocation. Poly-GST-Ubiquitination of MHC Class I Heavy Chain Prevents Its Retrotranslocation—Because polyubiquitination with a specific linkage is required for retrotranslocation but on its own is insufficient, we tested whether polyubiquitin chains may function as a recognition signal. Specifically, we investigated whether modification of polyubiquitin chains by the addition of a GST moiety to the N-terminal part of ubiquitin would influence retrotranslocation. We reasoned that GST-ubiquitin molecules may still be linked with one another to form poly-GST-ubiquitinated heavy chains but that these chains may no longer be recognized by a downstream component. We incubated 35S-labeled permeabilized cells with cow liver cytosol supplemented with GST-ubiquitin. Compared with control cow liver cytosol, the appearance of deglycosylated heavy chains in the cytosol was reduced (Fig. 5A, lanes 16–20 versus lanes 11–15). In addition, a high molecular mass species appeared during the chase period, which was not seen in the absence of GST-ubiquitin. The high molecular mass species were GST-ubiquitinated heavy chains as demonstrated by reimmunoprecipitation with either"

DGKη (η1, 128 kDa) is a type II isozyme containing a pleckstrin homology domain at the amino terminus. Here we identified another DGKη isoform (η2, 135 kDa) that shared the same sequence with DGKη1 except for a sterile α motif (SAM) domain added at the carboxyl terminus. The DGKη1 mRNA was ubiquitously distributed in various tissues, whereas the DGKη2 mRNA was detected only in testis, kidney, and colon. The expression of DGKη2 was suppressed by glucocorticoid in contrast to the marked induction of DGKη1. DGKη2 was shown to form through its SAM domain homo-oligomers as well as hetero-oligomers with other SAM-containing DGKs (δ1 and δ2). Interestingly, DGKη1 and DGKη2 were rapidly translocated from the cytoplasm to endosomes in response to stress stimuli. In this case, DGKη1 was rapidly relocated back to the cytoplasm upon removal of stress stimuli, whereas DGKη2 exhibited sustained endosomal association. The experiments using DGKη mutants suggested that the oligomerization of DGKη2 mediated by its SAM domain was largely responsible for its sustained endosomal localization. Similarly, the oligomerization of DGKη2 was suggested to result in negative regulation of its catalytic activity. Taken together, alternative splicing of the human DGKη gene generates at least two isoforms with distinct biochemical and cell biological properties responding to different cellular metabolic requirements.

Taken together, alternative splicing of the human DGKη gene generates at least two isoforms with distinct biochemical and cell biological properties responding to different cellular metabolic requirements. Upon cell stimulation by various hormones, growth factors, and other agonists, a variety of signaling lipids that regulate a wide range of biological output are liberated or synthesized. The cellular concentrations of such bioactive lipids must be strictly regulated by the action of metabolic enzymes. Diacylglycerol (DG) 1The abbreviations used are: DG, diacylglycerol; DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; MBP, maltose-binding protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PA, phosphatidic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SAM, sterile α motif; TAA, triamcinolone acetonide; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) (1Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 47-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). By numerous studies, DG and PA have been well recognized as lipid second messengers. DG is known to be an activator of conventional and novel protein kinase Cs (PKCs), chimaerins, Unc-13, and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar, 3Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), and PA has been reported to modulate the activities of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate kinase, Ras GTPase-activating protein, Raf-1 kinase, atypical PKC, and many other important enzymes (5Exton J.H.

DGK thus appears to participate in various physiological events through modulating the balance between two bioactive lipids, DG and PA, in micro-environments within the cells. It is now recognized that DGK represents a large enzyme family. The isoforms differ remarkably from each other with respect to their structures, the modes of tissue expression, and enzymological properties (7Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

To date, nine mammalian DGK isozymes (α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, ζ, η, θ, and ι), containing in common two or three characteristic zinc finger structures and the catalytic region, are subdivided into five groups according to their structural features (7Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the occurrence of alternative splicing was recently identified for four mammalian DGK genes (γ (11Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ζ (12Ding L. Bunting M. Topham M.K. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43519-43526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) isoforms). Thus, the list of DGK isoform members is still growing. The occurrence of alternative splicing in multiple DGK genes further adds to the complexity of the DGK gene family members and is probably essential for the action of DGKs regulating a wide range of cellular functions. DGKδ and DGKη are closely related to each other and are thus classified together into the type II DGK subfamily (7Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

However, DGKδ has a sterile α motif (SAM) at the carboxyl terminus (15Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), whereas DGKη contains no SAM domain (16Klauck T.M. Xu X. Mousseau B. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19781-19788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The SAM domain, which is ∼70 amino acids long, was first described as a module that is present in a small group of yeast sexual differentiation and Drosophila polyhomeotic proteins (17Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1928-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The SAM domain was subsequently found to occur in a wide range of proteins. Proteins containing SAM domains include the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases (18Hirai H. Maru Y. Hagiwara K. Nishida J. Takaku F. Science. 1987; 238: 1717-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1995; 82: 345-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), serine/threonine kinases (20Tu H. Barr M. Dong D.L. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5876-5887Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor proteins (21Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), ETS transcription factors (22Kyba M. Brock H.W. Dev. Genet. 1998; 22: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), p53 (21Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and many other proteins. Such an extended occurrence suggests that SAM is an evolutionally conserved protein-protein interaction domain that is involved in the regulation of numerous developmental processes among diverse eukaryotes. We recently demonstrated by gel filtration and co-immunoprecipitation analyses that DGKδ formed homo-oligomeric structures in intact cells and that the SAM domain was critically involved in the oligomerization (23Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Moreover, the alternative splicing products of DGKδ (DGKδ1 and DGKδ2) were shown to form hetero-oligomers via their SAM domains (14Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Murakami T. Tsushima S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43519-43526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the course of genome data base search for the human DGKη gene, we identified in silico a potential splice variant of DGKη with a SAM domain at the carboxyl terminus. Here we cloned the novel DGKη isoform generated through the alternative splicing. The two splice products of DGKη were revealed to possess biochemical and cell biological properties distinct from each other. Moreover, we found that the new DGKη2 isoform formed hetero-oligomers with other type II members, DGKδ1 and DGKδ2. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, and HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs using Effectene transfection reagent according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). 24 or 48 h after transfection, cells were used for further analysis. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 or HEK293 cells using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Reverse transcription into cDNA was achieved using the SuperScript preamplification system (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. cDNAs from human normal tissues and tumor-derived cells were purchased from BD Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan. PCR amplification was performed with Takara Ex Taq (Takara Biomedicals, Tokyo, Japan) using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers as follows: a DGKη common forward primer (nucleotide positions 3092–3116, 5′-TGAATAAAGCCAACCCAAGGTGCCC-3′), and a common reverse primer (nucleotide positions 3601–3627, 5′-TTTAATTCCCTGGAGAATTCGCTTCAC-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min; 37 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 2 min; and 68 °C for 5 min. For normalization, human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was simultaneously amplified (25 cycles). PCR products amplified were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Plasmid Constructs—cDNAs coding for DGKη-ΔS1,2 (amino acid residues 1–1147), DGKη2-ΔPDZ (amino acid residues 1–1217) and DGKη2-SAM (amino acid residues 1144–1220) were generated by PCR from a human DGKη2 cDNA clone. DGKη2-W1151G cDNA clone was generated by replacing the Trp-1151 in the SAM domain with Gly using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For subsequent subcloning into expression vectors, primers were designed such that the resulting DGKη2 cDNA fragments contained a 5′-BamHI restriction site and a 3′-stop codon followed by a 3′-SalI site. The resulting DGKη2 fragments were fused in frame (the BglII/SalI site) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the pEGFP-C3 vector (BD Biosciences) and with 3×FLAG tag in the p3×FLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). Plasmids encoding the SAM domain of DGKη2 fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP, 43 kDa) were obtained by inserting the SAM cDNA fragments into the pMAL-c2X vector (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). Determination of DGK Activity—One μg each of p3×FLAG-CMV-DGKη1, p3×FLAG-CMV-DGKη2, or p3×FLAG-CMV vector alone was transfected into COS-7 cells (60-mm dish). After 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in buffer A (0.5 ml/60-mm dish) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma). After a low-speed centrifugation (550 × g for 5 min), the resultant supernatant was used as enzyme source. The octyl glucoside mixed micellar assay using diolein as substrate was done as described (15Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of MBP Fusion Proteins—XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene) were transfected with pMAL-c2X constructs, and MBP fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (New England BioLabs). In this case, expression of fusion proteins was induced by 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed by freeze-thaw cycles in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Fusion proteins were purified using an amylose resin affinity column. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration was performed on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and run with the fast protein liquid chromatography system equipped with a UV monitor (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. The column was calibrated with gel filtration molecular mass standards (Sigma) as previously described (23Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For analysis of the MBP fusion proteins, aliquots (100 μl) of the purified samples (40 μm) were loaded onto the column. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—COS-7 cells (∼1 × 107 cells/60-mm dish) co-expressing 3×FLAG-tagged DGKη2 with GFP·DGKη1 or GFP·DGKη2 were harvested in buffer A supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to give cell lysates. Cell lysates (400 μl) were precleared with protein A/G PLUS-agarose (10 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-GFP (2 μl, Living Colors full-length A.v. polyclonal antibody, BD Biosciences) was added to the precleared lysates to immunoprecipitate GFP fusion proteins. After 1 h at 4 °C, protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (5 μl) were added and further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After the agarose beads were washed five times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.6 m KCl), immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein Phosphorylation Analysis in Vivo—COS-7 cells (35-mm dish) expressing 3×FLAG-tagged DGKη isoforms were used 48 h post-transfection. Transfected COS-7 cells were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline, incubated for 1 h in DMEM without sodium phosphate and sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and then labeled for 2 h with [32P]orthophosphate (0.3 mCi/ml, Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-free DMEM/0.1% bovine serum albumin. The labeled cells were subsequently incubated in phosphate-free DMEM/0.1% bovine serum albumin containing 1 μm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) or 0.1% Me2SO for 1 h. Cells were harvested in Buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to give the cell lysates. Cell lysates (300 μl) were precleared with protein A/G PLUS-agarose (10 μl). Anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma) antibody (2 μg) was added to precleared lysates to immunoprecipitate 3×FLAG-tagged DGKη isoform proteins. After 1 h, protein A/G PLUS-agarose (5 μl) was added followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. After washing the agarose beads five times with buffer A containing 1% Nonidet P-40, immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The radioactive signal was visualized using a BAS1800 bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE (7.5 or 15%). The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody or anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (B-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in Block Ace for 1 h. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence microscopy, COS-7 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with expression plasmids containing DGKη cDNAs amino-terminal fused with GFP. After 24 h, cells were serum-starved for 3 h and then incubated in DMEM with or without 500 mm sorbitol for 30 min. The cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. When non-GFP fusion proteins were needed to be detected, cells were permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were incubated successively with the primary antibodies and the appropriate rhodamine-coupled anti-species antibodies. The coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For living cell imaging, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids containing DGKη cDNAs and were observed in glass-bottom chambers (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo, Japan). When fluorescence microscopy was carried out, the medium was changed to a mixture of DMEM and F-12 (1:1) containing 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) without phenol red supplement (Invitrogen). After 24 h of the transfection, cells were serum-starved for 3 h and then incubated in DMEM with or without 1 μm TPA, 500 mm sorbitol, or 0.5 mm H2O2. Cells were examined using inverted confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Identification and Characterization of a Novel DGKη Isoform—In the course of performing a genome data base search (accession numbers of human genomic clones: AL157932, AL139328, and AC018379) using as a probe the nucleotide sequence encoding the human DGKδ SAM domain (15Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we found a potential splice variant of human DGKη (Fig. 1A). We tentatively designated the human homolog of hamster DGKη cloned previously by Klauck et al. (16Klauck T.M. Xu X. Mousseau B. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19781-19788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the newly identified clone as DGKη1 and DGKη2, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, DGKη2 utilizes all of the 30 exons, whereas DGKη1 skips exon 29. The open reading frames of DGKη1 and DGKη2 encode 1164- and 1220-amino acid proteins with calculated molecular masses of 128 and 135 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, DGKη2 has a SAM domain encoded by exons 29 and 30 at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1, A–C). Because the phase of open reading frame used in the exon 30 of DGKη1 is different from that used by DGKη2 (Fig. 1A), the carboxyl-terminal portions (amino acids 1148–1164 for DGKη1 and 1148–1220 for DGKη2) have no similarity with each other. The sequence of DGKη2 SAM domain (amino acids 1148–1220) shows high homology (78.1% identity and 87.7% similarity) to that of DGKδ (15Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Moreover, we noted that the last three residues (Ser-Glu-Val) of DGKη2 are a potential target sequence, S/TXΦ (Φ, a hydrophobic amino acid, usually Val, Ile, or Leu; X, unspecified amino acid), for class I PDZ domains (24Bezprozvanny I. Maximov A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). To confirm that the two DGKη clones encode active enzymes, we subcloned each of the cDNAs into an expression vector, p3×FLAG-CMV-7.1, which was subsequently transfected into COS-7 cells. We detected in the transfected cells proteins corresponding to the predicted molecular masses of 128 kDa (DGKη1) and 135 kDa (DGKη2) upon Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody (not shown). Both enzymes were confirmed to possess DGK catalytic activities when the cell homogenates were assayed in vitro (not shown). Interestingly, DGKη1 showed an apparently 4-fold higher activity than that of DGKη2, suggesting the possibility that the SAM domain exerts inhibitory effects on the catalytic activity (see Fig. 7). Differential Modes of Expression and Induction of DGKη Isoforms—To investigate the expression patterns of DGKη isoforms, panels of cDNAs synthesized from human normal and tumor tissues were analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2, the DGKη1 transcript was detectable in most of the normal tissues and all of tumor-derived cells examined, with exceptionally low expression in the lung and skeletal muscle. On the other hand, the DGKη2 transcript was detected only in testis, kidney, and colon. Compared with DGKη1, the expression of DGKη2 in tumor-derived cells appeared to be relatively low, although the lack of antibody against human DGKη hindered us from confirming the protein levels of isoforms in the tissues. Differential tissue distribution patterns of DGKη1 and DGKη2 mRNAs led us to hypothesize that the expressions of these isoforms are regulated under distinct mechanisms. Because Klauck et al. (16Klauck T.M. Xu X. Mousseau B. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19781-19788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reported that glucocorticoid, triamcinolone acetonide (TAA), increased the expression level of the hamster DGKη (a counterpart of human DGKη1), we first tested the effect of TAA. When HepG2 cells, which are known to express glucocorticoid receptors (27Raddatz D. Henneken M. Armbrust T. Ramadori G. Hepatology. 1996; 24: 928-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were treated with 10 nm TAA for 72 h, the level of DGKη1 mRNA was markedly increased (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the DGKη2 mRNA was moderately decreased. We recently found that expression of DGKδ2, another type II DGK isoform, was induced by treating cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TPA, whereas the levels of mRNA and protein of DGKδ1 were suppressed by phorbol ester treatment (14Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Murakami T. Tsushima S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43519-43526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined effects of TPA (100 nm, 24 h) and EGF (10 ng/ml, 48 h) on the expression levels of DGKη isoforms. As shown in Fig. 3B, the mRNA level of DGKη2 was not much affected by TPA whereas that of DGKη1 was significantly increased. We next examined the effect of EGF on the expression of cellular DGKη enzymes. For this purpose, we used HEK293 cells because HepG2 cells failed to respond to EGF. EGF had no detectable effects on the mRNA levels of DGKη1 and DGKη2 (Fig. 3C). The results collectively demonstrated that the induction patterns of mRNA levels of DGKη1 and DGKη2 were clearly different from each other. Moreover, the expression patterns of DGKη are distinct from those of the closely related isoforms (DGKδ1 and DGKδ2). Homo- and Hetero-oligomer Formation of DGKη Isoforms—We next examined biochemical and cell biological properties of DGKη1 and DGKη2. We have recently found that DGKδ1 and DGKδ2 form oligomeric (at least tetrameric) structures in vitro and in vivo and that the SAM domain plays a critical role in the oligomer formation (14Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Murakami T. Tsushima S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43519-43526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To study the multimeric nature of the DGKη2 SAM domain in vitro, MBP·DGKη2-SAM purified was analyzed using a Superose 12 HR column. As already observed for DGKδ (23Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), MBP·DGKη2-SAM (40 μm) was eluted at the tetramer position (∼240 kDa) (Fig. 4A). In the case of EphB2 receptor (28Thanos C.D. Goodwill K.E. Bowie J.U. Science. 1999; 283: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), an aromatic residue, Tyr-912, at 8th position in the SAM domain (corresponding to Trp-1151 in DGKη2) was reported to be critical for dimer formation. On the other hand, the SAM domain of the EphA2 receptor, in which the critical Tyr is replaced with Gly, did not form dimer structure (29Thanos C.D. Faham S. Goodwill K.E. Cascio D. Phillips M. Bowie J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37301-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, when the corresponding residue (Trp-1101) of DGKδ1 was mutated to Gly, the mutant did not form the multimeric structures (23Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Trp-1151 in the DGKη2 SAM domain was thus substituted by Gly to see whether this Trp is critical for the interaction. In contrast to the wild-type SAM, MBP·DGKη2-SAM-W1151G (40 μm) was eluted at the monomer position (∼60 kDa) (Fig. 4A). These data, essentially consistent with those obtained for the DGKδ SAM domain (23Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), indicate that the DGKη SAM domain is capable of forming at least tetrameric structure and that Trp-1151 in the SAM domain is essential for the oligomer formation. To address homo-oligomer formation of DGKη2 in vivo, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation analysis using the lysates of COS-7 cells co-expressing GFP-tagged and 3×FLAG-tagged DGKη2 proteins. When GFP-tagged DGKη2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, 3×FLAG-tagged DGKη2 was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4B). Reciprocally, when GFP-tagged DGKη2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, 3×FLAG-tagged DGKη2 was co-immunoprecipitated. On the other hand, apparently due to lack of the SAM domain, homo-oligomer formation of DGKη1 was not observed (Fig. 4C). To assess further the contribution of the SAM domain to the oligomer formation, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using DGKη mutants DGKη2-W1151G and DGKη-ΔS1,2 lacking the SAM domain. As shown in Fig. 4D, in comparison with wild-type DGKη, significantly less 3×FLAG-DGKη-ΔS1,2 and 3×FLAG-DGKη2-W1151G were found in the anti-GFP immunoprecipitated complexes. These results indicate that the SAM domain contributes critically to the oligomer formation of DGKη2. We noted, however, that a faint but detectable band of 3×FLAG-tagged DGKη2-W1151G was still co-immunoprecipitated with the GFP-tagged counterpart (Fig. 4D), suggesting that, in addition to Trp-1151, the other residues of the domain weakly contribute to the formation of oligomer. It was previously reported that DGKδ1-oligomer was dissociated to a monomer by TPA stimulation. However, such disassembly of DGKη2-oligomer was not detected (Fig. 4E). To examine"

Animal models show that the receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAF) is responsible for many of the deleterious effects of endotoxin, where regulated, localized PAF production localizes the inflammatory response. In contrast, biologically active analogs of PAF (PAF-like lipids) are generated by oxidative attack on phospholipids by chemical reactions that are unregulated and unlocalized. The identity and distribution of the PAF receptor ligand in endotoxemia is unknown. We found human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were a significant source of PAF receptor agonists after stimulation by either class of endotoxin. Production of PAF receptor agonists required that the PMN adhere to a surface, and adhesion (and therefore accumulation of PAF-like bioactivity) in response to endotoxic stimulation was delayed for several minutes. PAF-like oxidized phospholipids were found by mass spectroscopy, but biosynthetic PAF accounted for most of the phospholipid agonists arising from endotoxic stimulation. A significant portion of the PAF made by PMNs was secreted, in contrast to its near complete retention by other inflammatory cells. Endotoxic stimulation induced a respiratory burst with the production of superoxide and the formation and shedding of microparticles. Free and microparticle-bound PAF appeared in the media, and blocking microvesiculation with calpeptin blocked PAF release. The released material activated platelets, and platelets co-aggregated with endotoxin-stimulated PMNs. Adherent PMNs therefore behave differently than suspended cells and are a significant source of free PAF after endotoxin exposure.

Neutrophils (PMNs) 1The abbreviations used are: PMNs, polymorphonuclear leukocytes; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAF, platelet-activating factor; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; HBSS/A, 0.5% human serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Pam3Cys, N-Palmitoyl-S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2RS)-propyl]-(R)-cysteine; MS, mass spectrometry. play a critical role in endotoxic shock and death, because rendering animals neutropenic prior to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge reduces mortality (1Yoshikawa D. Goto F. Circ. Shock. 1992; 38: 29-33PubMed Google Scholar, 2Matsumoto T. Yoshida S. Shiga Y. Kikuchi M. Sata T. Shigematsu A. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1997; 17: 171-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this behavior of PMNs is not observed ex vivo. LPS by itself is only a poor agonist for isolated PMNs but instead primes isolated PMNs to a state responsive to subsequent exposure to other, more complete agents (3Wilson M.E. Munkenbeck P. Morrison D.C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1981; 62: 157-172PubMed Google Scholar). PAF was initially described as a platelet agonist (4Benveniste J. Henson P.M. Cochrane C. J. Exp. Med. 1972; 136: 1356-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) but is now recognized as an agonist for all elements of the inflammatory or innate immune system. Elucidation of the molecular structure of this lipid agonist (5Demopoulos C.A. Pinckard R.N. Hanahan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9355-9358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Blank M.L. Snyder F. Byers L.W. Brooks B. Muirhead E.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 90: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) showed PAF to be 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a modified ether phospholipid. PAF receptor ligands have a critical role in the response to endotoxin, because increasing sensitivity to PAF by overexpressing its receptor worsens the effects of endotoxin (7Ishii S. Nagase T. Tashiro F. Ikuta K. Sato S. Waga I. Kume K. Miyazaki J. Shimizu T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Nagase T. Ishii S. Kume K. Uozumi N. Izumi T. Ouchi Y. Shimizu T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1071-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Conversely, suppressing this inflammatory axis by pharmacologic blockade of the PAF receptor reduces endotoxic inflammation (9Montrucchio G. Alloatti G. Camussi G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1669-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 10Miotla J.M. Jeffery P.K. Hellewell P.G. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 18: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Activation of inflammatory cascades by PAF is a central component of host response to LPS endotoxemia (11Mathiak G. Szewczyk D. Abdullah F. Ovadia P. Rabinovici R. Shock. 1997; 7: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and this observation extends to Gram-positive organisms (12De Kimpe S.J. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 3191-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) even though they do not contain LPS. LPS is not the only endotoxin that affects mammals, and both Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria contain large numbers and large amounts of endotoxic lipoproteins. These proteins contain an N-terminal cysteine residue that is modified by the addition of an ether-linked diacylglyceride and, typically, an N-terminal fatty acyl amide. Proteins and peptides with this N-terminal lipid modification are highly potent inflammatory agonists (13Wooten R.M. Modur V.R. McIntyre T.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar, 14Neilsen P.O. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5231-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The identity of cells that make and secrete PAF in response to endotoxins is not established. Neutrophils (PMNs) are a prolific source of PAF but only when treated with a pharmacologic Ca2+ ionophore such as A23187 (15Sisson J.H. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3918-3926PubMed Google Scholar). Biologic agonists such as fMLP or opsonized zymosan stimulate the formation of just a few percent of this amount of PAF, and LPS is even less effective than this (15Sisson J.H. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3918-3926PubMed Google Scholar, 16Worthen G.S. Seccombe J.F. Clay K.L. Guthrie L.A. Johnston Jr., R.B. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 3553-3559PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells, monocytes, and even platelets synthesize PAF when appropriately stimulated, but, again, LPS is ineffective as an agonist for this response. The PAF receptor responds to ligands other than PAF. Some of the fragmented phospholipids formed by an uncontrolled oxidative attack on polyunsaturated alkyl phospholipids (17Mueller H.W. O'Flaherty J.T. Wykle R.L. Lipids. 1982; 17: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Chilton F.H. Ellis J.M. Olson S.C. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12014-12019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) activate the PAF receptor (19Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28395-28405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These precursor polyunsaturated alkyl phospholipids are abundant in leukocytes, and LPS primes the oxidative burst of leukocytes that generates oxidizing free radicals. The enzymatic pathway that produces PAF is tightly controlled, whereas, in contrast, the formation of PAF-like lipids proceeds from uncontrolled oxidative chemical reactions. There is a second important distinction between PAF and the PAF-like lipids that arise from oxidizing chemical reactions. PAF synthesized by endothelial cells in response to physiologic mediators remains cell-associated, but is translocated and displayed on the extracellular membrane surface; it is this focal expression that localizes the inflammatory response to areas of activated endothelium (20Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Mehra M. Prescott S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Weyrich A.S. Zimmerman G.A. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). PAF produced by A23187-stimulated PMNs also remains cell-associated (15Sisson J.H. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3918-3926PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lynch J.M. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2653-2661PubMed Google Scholar), and in fact only monocytes are known to release the PAF they synthesize (23Elstad M.R. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 1618-1624PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, oxidatively fragmented phospholipids with PAF-like activity generated by endothelial cells exposed to lipid-soluble hydroperoxides are released into the surrounding medium (24Patel K.D. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15168-15175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells exposed to this oxidative insult show severe membrane disruption with the formation and release of membranous blebs or microvesicles (24Patel K.D. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15168-15175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of PAF or PAF-like lipids disrupts spatially localized physiologic signaling and has the potential to produce a disseminated systemic inflammatory response (21McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Weyrich A.S. Zimmerman G.A. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here we show that PAF is produced by human neutrophils in response to endotoxic stimulation, either LPS or endotoxic lipoproteins, but only after a delay, and only after the leukocytes become adherent. Adherent, endotoxin-challenged PMNs synthesized PAF but also released a significant portion of this PAF in association with microparticles shed from the cells. PAF synthesized and released from endotoxin-stimulated PMNs activated surrounding platelets, providing a molecular link between acute inflammation and thrombosis. Activated PMNs may therefore propagate and amplify the response to endotoxin through PAF-related mechanisms.

All PAF species, the PAF receptor antagonist BN52021, and all other chemicals, unless otherwise noted, were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). N-Palmitoyl-S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-(2RS)-propyl]-(R)-cysteine (Pam3Cys) was from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). Pam3CysSK4 was synthesized by conjugating Ser-(Lys)4 to Pam3Cys at the Peptide Synthesis facility of University of Utah (Salt Lake City, UT). PMN Isolation and Adhesion Assays—Human serum was isolated from healthy human volunteers, pooled, and frozen until required. PMNs were isolated from healthy human donors by dextran sedimentation and centrifugation over Ficoll as described previously (25Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For adhesion assays, PMNs were labeled with 111Indium-oxine (25Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) generated at the University of Utah. PMNs (2.5–5.5 × 106 cells/ml as stated) were incubated with an agonist for the specified period of time at 37 °C on tissue culture plates previously coated with 0.2% gelatin for 1 h. Adherent unlabeled PMNs were quantified with a custom video microscopy imaging system yielding data as adherent PMNs per field, whereas 111In-labeled PMNs were detected by gamma counting to calculate the percentage of adherent cells expressed as a fraction of the total recovered cells. Lipid Extraction from Stimulated PMNs—PMNs were incubated with the stated agonist in microcentrifuge tubes for suspended cells or over gelatin-coated tissue culture plates, an assay that measures β2 integrin-dependent adhesion. Adherent cells were scraped from their substrate in methanol and transferred to Teflon-capped tissue culture glass tubes and mixed with chloroform to extract lipids by the method of Bligh and Dyer (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). The resulting total lipid extract was dried under N2 and reconstituted with HBSS/A (0.5% human serum albumin in HBSS). The reconstituted lipid extracts were sonicated and vortexed just before use. In some experiments the lipid extracts were treated with 1 μg/ml PAF-acetylhydrolase for 3 h at 37 °C before analysis with 111In-labeled PMNs. Incorporation of [3H]acetate (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) into PAF was analyzed as described previously (15Sisson J.H. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3918-3926PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular Ca2 + Measurements—PAF-like activity was detected by monitoring rapid changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels as described previously (19Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R.

Briefly, PMNs (5.5 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated in the dark with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye FURA-2AM (1 μm) at 37 °C for 45 min. PMNs were recovered by centrifugation, washed with fresh HBSS/A three times, and resuspended in fresh HBSS/A at 2.75 × 106 cells/ml. The presence of PAF receptor ligands was tested with HEK293 cells stably transfected with a cDNA encoding the human PAF receptor. For this, subconfluent hPAFR293 cells were treated with Versene (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and resuspended in fresh culture media at 1.1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were incubated with 1 μm FURA-2AM for 45 min at 37 °C before being recovered and washed with HBSS/A by centrifugation as before. These cells were resuspended in HBSS/A at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were detected in a spectrofluorophotometer with dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These data are presented with 340/380 nm ratios on the y axis and a 5-min time period for the x axis. Separation of PAF-like Lipids and Mass Spectrometric Analysis— Separation of PAF-like lipids by high-performance liquid chromatography was described previously (19Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28395-28405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, PMNs (5 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with PBS, A23187 (1 μm), LPS (5 μg/ml) with or without 2% pooled human serum, or 5 μg/ml Pam3CysSK4 for 90 min before total lipids were extracted (26Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) from a total of 5 × 109 PMNs. The total lipid extracts were condensed by Rotavapor (Buchi Labortechnik, Flawil, Switzerland), dried under a stream of N2 gas, and then reconstituted in CHCl3. Phospholipids were separated from neutral lipids and fatty acids by aminopropyl extraction columns (28Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and then fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously (19Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28395-28405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fractions eluting from the reversed-phase column were assayed after drying and resuspending an aliquot in HBSS/A by analyzing their effect on FURA2-loaded PMNs as detailed above. Fractions containing PAF-like activity were pooled, dried under a flow of N2 gas, reconstituted in HBSS/A, and then treated with 50 kilounits of phospholipase A1 from R. arrhizus in HBSS/A at 37 °C overnight to remove diacyl lipids (29Benveniste J. Le Couedic J.P. Polonsky J. Tence M. Nature. 1977; 269: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Polar alkyl phospholipids were resolved from free fatty acids with aminopropyl extraction columns, and the recovered PAF-like lipids were reconstituted in methanol for analysis by electrospray ionization/MS/MS (19Marathe G.K.

Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 330-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after introduction of a constant amount of [2H]PAF. PMN Morphology by Confocal Microscopy—PMNs at 2.5 × 106/ml in a volume of 200 μl were incubated with an agonist for the stated time in gelatin-coated 8-well borosilicate chambered coverslips. The adherent PMNs were washed three times with endotoxin-free PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Polymerized actin in the fixed cells was stained at 4 °C with 2 μg/ml Alexa 488-phalloidin in PBS for at least 4 h. After incubation, nuclei were stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS just before confocal microscopy. For three-color staining, actin polymerization was visualized with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin, plasma membranes were stained with Alexa 594-wheat germ agglutinin at 10 μg/ml, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI at 5 μg/ml just before fluorescence microscopy. Isolation of Microvesicles from Endotoxin-stimulated PMNs—Microvesicles were collected as described (31Huber J. Vales A. Mitulovic G. Blumer M. Schmid R. Witztum J.L. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. PMNs (5 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with the stated agonist for 90 min at 37 °C in gelatin-coated P100 tissue culture plates (Falcon Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ). After incubation, media from each sample were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g at 4 °C to clear cells and debris. The supernatant from this low speed centrifugation was collected and sealed into Quick-Seal centrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA) for centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to collect microvesicles (32Combes V.

The resulting supernatant and cellular microvesicles were separately recovered, and their lipids were extracted and assayed as described above. LPS and Bacterial Lipopeptides Stimulate PMN Adhesion— PAF causes PMNs to immediately begin to adhere to surfaces, in this case a gelatin-coated tissue culture well by a β2-integrin-dependent process (33Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), with the maximal amount of adhesion being achieved by 30 min of stimulation (Fig. 1). LPS stimulation did not cause PMNs to immediately adhere to the surface, as shown by the near absence of adherent cells after 5 min of exposure, but after this delay PMNs exposed to LPS presented in serum began to adhere in a time-dependent fashion. In the absence of serum, and the LPS-binding protein and soluble CD14 it contains, the delay in the response to LPS was prolonged and the number of PMNs that eventually adhered to the surface was significantly reduced. The major lipid-modified endotoxic protein of E. coli (14Neilsen P.O. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5231-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the Braun lipoprotein, and a synthetic peptide based on its lipid-modified N terminus, Pam3CysSK4, stimulated PMN adhesion to the proteinized surface. The lipopeptide Pam3CysSK4 and the Braun lipoprotein induced the same delay before the PMNs began to adhere as found with LPS presented in serum, but we found (not shown) that both of these N-terminal lipid-modified molecules elicited the same response in the presence or absence of serum. Endotoxins Stimulate PMN Spreading and Actin Filament Re-arrangement—PAF caused PMNs to rapidly spread onto the protein-coated surface and develop a polarized morphology (Fig. 2). Visualization of polymerized F-actin with phalloidin showed that nearly all of the spread PMNs have large amounts of bundled actin that was absent in suspended cells (shown on the upper right panel of Fig. 2). Initially the polymerized actin was distributed around the periphery of the cell but over time coalesced into a structure at the leading edge of lamellipodia. There were very few adherent PMNs after 5 min of treatment with LPS or Pam3CysSK4, and the few adherent cells present at this time contained little polymerized actin. However, as more cells began to adhere and spread, their content of polymerized actin increased and the distribution of this bundled actin after stimulation with either LPS or Pam3CysSK4 for 15 min was similar to PMNs treated with PAF for 5 min. PMNs Generate a Ligand for the PAF Receptor after Endotoxic Stimulation—We considered the possibility that the delay in adhesion when PMNs were stimulated by either endotoxin resulted from the need to synthesize a secondary, adhesion-promoting agonist. PAF rapidly stimulates PMN adhesion, so we investigated the effect of blocking the PAF receptor on the adhesion induced by each endotoxin. We found (Fig. 3A) that adhesion induced by LPS or Pam3CysSK4 was modestly reduced by competitive inhibition of the PAF receptor with BN52021, whereas nearly half of the adhesion induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was suppressed by interfering with PAF receptor signaling. PAF was synthesized by PMNs in response to LPS or Pam3CysSK4 only after they had already adhered and spread (vide infra). Therefore, even the modest effect of PAF receptor antagonist on adhesion indicates that a portion of this adhesion-promoting phospholipid mediator must have been released from adherent cells to affect other cells in the incubation. This outcome would differ from the normal intracellular retention of PAF by suspended PMNs (15Sisson J.H. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3918-3926PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lynch J.M. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2653-2661PubMed Google Scholar), so we treated PMNs with the ionophore A23187, LPS, or Pam3CysSK4 and then recovered the media and extracted the lipids it contained. The lipids released from PMNs treated with each agonist, but not those of buffer-treated cells, stimulated fresh, quiescent PMNs to rapidly adhere to gelatinized wells (Fig. 3B). The adhesion-promoting effect of the material released from activated cells was completely lost by blocking the PAF receptor of the test cells with BN52021, and so the released lipid agonist(s) likely acted through the PAF receptor. Additionally, we found that treating the recovered lipids with recombinant PAF acetylhydrolase, a phospholipase A2 that specifically hydrolyzes PAF and oxidatively fragmented phospholipids (34Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11095-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also completely suppressed the pro-adhesive effect of the lipids released from endotoxin-treated PMNs. We directly determined whether the PMN agonists generated by endotoxin-treated PMNs stimulated the PAF receptor by testing these lipid extracts on cells stably transfected with cDNA encoding the human PAF receptor (hPAFR293 cells). Untransfected 293 cells did not respond to PAF (Fig. 3C) but did show a Ca2+ flux after treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. hPAFR293 cells stably expressing the PAF receptor responded to PAF as expected but did not do so when directly challenged with LPS or Pam3CysSK4, showing that, in contrast to a previous report (35Nakamura M. Honda Z.-i. Waga I. Matsumoto T. Noma M. Shimizu T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), these two endotoxins do not directly stimulate the PAF receptor. The hPAFR293 cells, however, did respond to the lipids extracted from PMNs exposed to LPS or Pam3CysSK4 for 60 min. The PAF receptor antagonist BN52021 blocked the response of hPAFR293 cells to the lipid agonists made by PMNs in response to each endotoxin, so the one or more activating lipids were not endotoxin carried over from the first incubation. PAF Is the Primary PAF Receptor Ligand Made by Adherent PMNs in Response to Endotoxin—Endotoxins stimulate an oxidative burst in leukocytes and oxidative fragmentation of polyunsaturated alkyl phosphatidylcholines, and PMNs are a rich source of this class of phospholipids (17Mueller H.W. O'Flaherty J.T. Wykle R.L. Lipids. 1982; 17: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), creating reaction products that stimulate the PAF receptor (36McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25189-25192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We analyzed the structure of the active lipid fraction of endotoxin-treated PMNs by tandem mass spectrometry after inclusion of a deuterated PAF internal standard. We identified hexadecyl (C16:0), octadecyl (C18:0), and octadecenyl (C18:1) PAFs in the extracts of PMNs treated with LPS, Pam3CysSK4, and A23187, and the amount of these isoforms (Table I) was increased over that of unstimulated cells by 6.5-, 12-, and 195-fold, respectively. The total amount of the three molecular species of PAF generated in response to LPS or Pam3CysSK4 stimulation compared with A23187 was 3 and 6%, respectively. We also found there was a small increase in butanoyl and butenoyl PAF analogs, produced by oxidative fragmentation of alkyl phosphatidylcholines (19Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R.

Stimulation of the PMNs with A23187 did not result in formation of these oxidized phospholipids. The presence of these PAF homologs after endotoxic stimulation indicates an enhanced level of cellular oxidative stress, but because these PAF analogs are 10-fold less active than PAF (19Marathe G.K.

This conjugation is dependent on the integrity of the extreme N terminus of C/EBPβ-1 and requires lysine 173 in the human protein. Furthermore, mutation of this lysine relieves the repression of the cyclin D1 promoter by C/EBPβ-1 without altering the subnuclear localization of C/EBPβ-1. The sumoylation of C/EBPβ-1 is likely to be important in the functional differences observed between C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2.

The small ubiquitin-like modifier, or SUMO, 1The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; HA, hemagglutinin; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; LAP, liver-enriched activator protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. proteins are a group of polypeptides that are conjugated to lysine residues in target proteins in much the same manner as ubiquitin (for a review, see Ref. 1Wilson V.G. Rangasamy D. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To date, three family members have been identified in higher eukaryotes: SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3. In humans and mice, the three isoforms appear to be ubiquitously expressed. SUMO-1 has been the most extensively characterized; homologues have been found in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Glycine 97 in this 101-amino-acid protein is conjugated to a lysine in target proteins (2Mahajan R. Gerace L. Melchior F. J.

Targets of SUMO-1 include the GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 (10Lee G.W. Melchior F. Matunis M.J. Mahajan R. Tian Q. Anderson P. J. Biol.

Modification of IκBα by SUMO antagonizes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of this inhibitor of the transcription factor NFκB (7Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Recently, the repression domain I of C/EBPϵ has been demonstrated to be modified by SUMO-1 (9Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar); this modification is proposed to be important for the inhibitory function of this domain. These authors also show that conserved SUMO target sequences are present in C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ and that these isoforms can be conjugated to SUMO-1 (9Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are 66% homologous to SUMO-1; SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are 97% identical to each other (11Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the SUMO family members are very closely related, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 have the ability to form poly(SUMO) chains owing to the fact that their amino acid sequence contains a SUMO target consensus (4Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A. Desterro J.M. Botting C.H. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Because SUMO-1 does not contain a target lysine for sumoylation, it appears to be conjugated to proteins as a monomer (12Bayer P. Arndt A. Metzger S. Mahajan R. Melchior F. Jaenicke R. Becker J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Antibodies currently available cannot distinguish between SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 (4Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35368-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), but it is assumed that since SUMO-2 and -3 have such a high degree of sequence similarity, the two proteins have overlapping functions. Elucidation of their differences awaits further study. Little is known about the function of SUMO-2/-3 within cells. Saitoh and Hinchey (13Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) described that oxidative stress, heat shock, or UV irradiation caused a dramatic increase in the amount of SUMO-2/-3 incorporated in high molecular weight complexes within Cos-7 cells. At the current time, the identities of the proteins modified by SUMO-2/-3 in response to stress are unknown. C/EBPβ is a member of the basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors. The protein is transcribed from an intronless gene but gives rise to three protein isoforms due to alternative translation initiation at three in-frame ATG initiator codons (14Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). In the human, the full-length C/EBPβ begins at the first in-frame methionine and consists of the entire 346 amino acids (this is 297 in the rat and mouse). The second isoform begins at the second in-frame methionine, which is 23 amino acids (or in rat/mouse, 21 amino acids) downstream from the first. The third isoform begins at the final in-frame methionine that is at position 198 in humans. The structure of C/EBPβ is such that the transactivation domain resides in the N-terminal region. The DNA binding and protein dimerization domains, the basic region and leucine zipper, reside in the C-terminal end. The first two isoforms consist of both the activation and DNA binding/dimerization domains and differ only by a 23-amino-acid N-terminal truncation. The third isoform, however, lacks the N-terminal activation domain while retaining the DNA binding/dimerization domain. This protein acts as a transcriptional repressor due to the fact that it can homodimerize or heterodimerize with the larger C/EBPβ isoforms and/or occupy the same C/EBPβ DNA elements within promoters of target genes. We have previously observed that C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 are differentially expressed between non-dividing, normal breast cells and dividing breast cells, either normal or neoplastic (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of C/EBPβ-2 into the normal, immortal mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, causes anchorage-independent growth, acquisition of invasive potential, and transition from an epithelial to mesenchymal state (16Bundy L. Sealy L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 869-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This phenotype is not observed with the introduction of C/EBPβ-1. Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz (17Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that C/EBPβ-1 (in their work, the rat protein termed LAP*) could recruit the chromatin remodeling complex Swi-Snf to the promoters of genes important in the differentiation of myeloid cells. The second isoform, C/EBPβ-2 or LAP, was unable to perform this function (17Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Our results, along with results from other laboratories, support the theory that these two activator isoforms, despite differing by only 21–23 amino acids, behave very differently within cells. Here, we demonstrate that C/EBPβ is modified by the SUMO family members SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. Furthermore, this modification is specific to the first isoform of C/EBPβ, or C/EBPβ-1, as the second activator isoform, or C/EBPβ-2, is not sumoylated. We show that lysine 173 in the human protein is the target of sumoylation by SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. Mutation of this lysine does not affect the punctate nuclear localization of C/EBPβ-1; however, this lysine is critical for the failure of C/EBPβ-1 to activate the cyclin D1 promoter. In addition, we demonstrate that the modification of C/EBPβ-1 by SUMO is dependent on the integrity of the N-terminal amino acids present in C/EBPβ-1, absent in C/EBPβ-2. Expression Vectors—Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SUMO-2 and HA-tagged SUMO-3 expression vectors were a kind gift of Dr. Ron Hay (University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK). The expression vectors for T7-tagged C/EBPβ-1 and T7-tagged C/EBPβ-2 have been described previously as has the pGL3-cyclin D1 reporter construct and the empty CMV4 vector (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 16Bundy L. Sealy L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 869-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The C/EBPβ-1 lysine 173 to alanine mutant was constructed as follows: an expression vector encoding a T7-tagged, 541-base pair C terminus mutant of C/EBPβ beginning at the first methionine (pRSETB LAP541, described previously in Ref. 18Sears R.C. Sealy L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4855-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with EagI and HindII to release an 80-nucleotide fragment encompassing lysine 173. The vector was purified from the nucleotide fragment using gel electrophoresis. An oligonucleotide identical to the wild-type fragment except for an aag (Lys) to gcg (Ala) substitution was ligated into the pRSETB LAP541 vector. The sequence of the oligonucleotide, which was synthesized by Sigma-Genosys Corp., is as follows: 5′-ggc cgc gcg ggc gcc aag gcc gca ccg ccc gcc tgc ttc ccg ccg ccg cct ccc gcc gca ctc GCG gcc gag ccg ggc ttc ga-3′. Confirmation of the clone was obtained by sequencing. The full-length pRSETB LAP Lys173 → Ala mutant was constructed by digesting wild-type pRSETB LAP (described in Ref. 18Sears R.C. Sealy L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4855-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with BstBI to release the ∼900-base pair fragment absent in pRSETB LAP541. The fragment was isolated from the vector using gel electrophoresis and then ligated into the linearized, BstBI-digested pRSETB LAP541 Lys173 → Ala mutant. Orientation of the insert was determined using a diagnostic PstI digest (an 810-base pair fragment released if correct orientation, a 540-base pair fragment released if incorrect orientation). The LAP Lys173 → Ala mutant was placed into the pcDNA3.1hisB mammalian expression vector in the following manner. The pRSETB LAP Lys173 → Ala was first digested with HindIII to linearize; following heat inactivation of the enzyme, DNA polymerase I was used (at 4 °C) to fill in the 5′ overhang and create a blunt end. The construct was next digested with BamHI to liberate a ∼1.5-kb fragment. This fragment was purified via gel electrophoresis and ligated into the pcDNA3.1hisB expression vector that had been digested with BamHI and EcoRV. Confirmation of the correct clone was obtained by sequencing. The N-terminal mutant of C/EBPβ-1 was obtained as follows. The pRSETC NFIL-6 vector (which has been described in Ref. 18Sears R.C. Sealy L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4855-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with BglII and MscI to release a 75-base pair fragment encompassing the N-terminal 23 amino acids of C/EBPβ-1. A replacement oligonucleotide was synthesized (Sigma-Genosys) that encoded for four amino acid mutations within the N terminus. The sequence of the oligonucleotide (with mutations in capitals) is: 5′-cc atg caa cgc ctg gtg gcc tgg AAA ggt gca GGT CGT ccc ctg ccg ccg ccg ccg cct gcc ttt aaa tcc GGA gaa gtg g-3′. After isolating the vector away from the wild-type fragment by gel electrophoresis, the mutant oligo was ligated into the vector. Confirmation of the clone, pRSETC-N-terminal mutant-NF-IL6, was obtained by sequencing. The N-terminal mutant C/EBPβ-1 was placed into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1hisA as follows. The pRSETC-N-terminal mutant-NF-IL6 was digested with HinDIII, the restriction enzyme was heat-inactivated, and the overhang was blunt-ended with DNA polymerase I at 4 °C. The linearized vector was next digested with BamHI to release the fragment encoding the N-terminal mutant of C/EBPβ-1. This fragment was ligated into pcDNA3.1hisA digested with BamHI and EcoRV. Cells and Culturing Conditions—Cos-7 cells were a gift from Dr Steve Hann, Vanderbilt University. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% calf serum (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO). Human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in mammary epithelial cell growth medium from the same company. NIH3T3 cells were purchased from the ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% Colorado calf serum. All cells were kept in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Immunofluorescence—HMECs were transfected with 5 ng of expression vectors of C/EBPβ-1 or C/EBPβ-1 Lys to Ala mutant using Geneporter (GeneTherapy Systems, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were plated onto polylysine-coated coverslips. Cells were allowed to sit down onto the coverslips and then fixed using 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with T7 tag antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) at a 1:10,000 dilution in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed extensively with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) at a 2 μg/ml dilution in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Coverslips were again washed extensively with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then rinsed with deionized water before staining with Hoechst dye at a 1 μg/ml in PBS concentration for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed with PBS and then mounted onto slides using Poly-Aquamount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss axiophot upright fluorescence microscope equipped with a low light CCD camera. Transfections and immunoprecipitations—NIH3T3 cells were transfected with either 2 μg of expression vector only (CMV4) or 2 μg of C/EBPβ-1, C/EBPβ-2, or C/EBPβ-1 Lys to Ala mutant expression vectors plus 2 μg of pGL3-cyclin D1 reporter vector using Novafector liposomes (VennNova, Pompano Beach, Fl). Luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A portion of the lysates was combined with 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Western analysis was performed as described previously (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L.

Cos-7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of indicated expression vectors using NovaFector liposomes as per the manufacturer's instructions. After 30–36 h, cells were harvested at 4 °C in PBS plus 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, spun at 840 × g, and resuspended, on ice in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) plus protease and phosphotase inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm β-glycerol-phosphate). Cell extracts were sonicated and added to T7 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Covance, Berkley, CA) that were washed previously with radioimmune precipitation buffer plus protease/phosphatase inhibitors. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were collected, extensively washed, and subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4855-4871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, was utilized. SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 Are Conjugated to C/EBPβ-1, but Not C/EBPβ-2—Given the fact that we observed a consensus SUMO-targeting sequence in C/EBPβ (this observation was confirmed while this work was in progress (9Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)), we decided to investigate whether the two activator isoforms could be modified by SUMO-2/3. We utilized Cos-7 cells to perform co-transfection experiments with expression vectors for HA-tagged SUMO-2 or HA-SUMO-3 together with T7-tagged C/EBPβ-1 or C/EBPβ-2. Following the transfection, proteins were immunoprecipitated using the T7 monoclonal antibody conjugated to agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblotting with an HA tag antibody. As seen in Fig. 1A, HA-tagged SUMO-2 and HA-SUMO-3 were incorporated into C/EBPβ-1 (lanes 1 and 2) but not into C/EBPβ-2 (lanes 3 and 4). This disparity in incorporation occurs despite the fact that equivalent amounts of the C/EBPβ-1 and -2 proteins are expressed and immunoprecipitated in our system as shown when the blot in Fig. 1A was stripped and reprobed with anti-C/EBPβ antibody (Fig. 1B). The anti-C/EBPβ antibody also detects larger molecular weight bands when C/EBPβ-1 and SUMO-2 or -3 are expressed but not when C/EBPβ-2 and SUMO-2 or -3 are expressed (Fig. 1B), consistent with sumoylation of C/EBPβ-1 Interestingly, the apparent molecular mass of the sumoylated C/EBPβ-1 is ∼82 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). This indicates that there are likely at least three of the ∼10–11-kDa SUMO proteins incorporated in C/EBPβ-1 (the apparent molecular mass of C/EBPβ-1 in our SDS-PAGE system is 55 kDa). Disruption of the N-terminal Extension of C/EBPβ-1 Reduces SUMO Incorporation—As stated earlier, the two activator isoforms of human C/EBPβ differ only by a 23-amino-acid truncation of the extreme N terminus of C/EBPβ-1. We next wanted to ascertain whether these amino acids were important for the striking difference we observed between the sumoylation of C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2. To address this question, we made mutations in three amino acids, conserved between species, of the N-terminal extension of C/EBPβ-1 (Table I). We next performed immunoprecipitation experiments utilizing this mutant together with the wild-type construct. As seen in Fig. 2, mutation of these amino acids greatly reduced conjugation of SUMO-2/-3 to C/EBPβ-1. In Fig. 2, A and C, lanes 3 and 4 depict tagged C/EBPβ-1 and the tagged C/EBPβ-1 N-terminal mutant transfected into Cos-7 cells together with SUMO-2 (A) and SUMO-3 (C), immunoprecipitated with T7 antibody, and immunoblotted with an HA tag antibody. In this particular experiment, poly-sumoylated wild-type C/EBPβ-1 containing even more than three chains (Fig. 2, C, lane 3, higher molecular mass species of ∼116 kDa) is observed. However, mutation of the N-terminal amino acids markedly reduces the ability of both SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 to be incorporated into C/EBPβ-1 despite the fact that equivalent amounts of the C/EBPβ proteins are expressed and immunoprecipitated (as seen in the same blots (Fig. 2, B and D), stripped, and reprobed with T7 tag antibody). These data indicate that the integrity of the N terminus of C/EBPβ-1 is crucial for sumoylation.Table ISequence comparison of the N terminus of C/EBPβ-1SpeciesN-terminal sequenceHumanMQRLVAWDPACLPLPPPPPAFKSMMouseMHRLLAWDAACLPPPPAAFRPMRatMHRLLAWDAACLPPPPAAFRPMChickenMQRLVAWDAACLPIQPPAFKSMXenopusMHRLPQWDQAAACLPPPPGIRSMN-terminal mutant (human)MQRLVAWKPAGRPLPPPPPAFKSM Open table in a new tab Lysine 173 Is a Target of SUMO-2/-3—With the evidence that C/EBPβ-1 is being modified by SUMO-2/-3, we next wanted to ascertain whether the consensus lysine, at position 173 in the human protein, was the primary target. We developed a mutant form of C/EBPβ-1, in which the lysine 173 was changed into an alanine. Utilizing this construct in co-transfection experiments, we observed an ablation of incorporation of SUMO-2/-3 into the C/EBPβ-1 protein. As seen in Fig. 2, A and C, lanes 5, there is no incorporation of SUMO-3 and very little incorporation of SUMO-2 into the lysine 173 to alanine mutant despite the fact that the proteins are synthesized and immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2, B and D). This slight amount of SUMO-2 incorporated into the C/EBPβ-1 Lys to Ala mutant may represent sumoylation at a cryptic site within the protein. These results serve to indicate that lysine 173 is the critical residue being modified by SUMO-2/-3. Antibody Directed to C/EBPβ Immunoprecipitates a 97-kDa Protein from HMECs—Work from our laboratory has demonstrated previously that normal HMECs placed in culture from reduction mammaplasty express both activator isoforms of C/EBPβ (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Antibody directed to the entire C/EBPβ protein immunoprecipitates proteins consistent with the molecular weight of C/EBPβ-1 (p55) and C/EBPβ-2 (p42) from [35S]methionine radiolabeled HMECs (Fig. 3). This antibody also immunoprecipitates a 97-kDa form of C/EBPβ from these cells. Because this isoform is larger than the sumoylated C/EBPβ-1 observed in Fig. 1 (in which both C/EBPβ-1 and the SUMO proteins carry epitope tags), it is likely that the C/EBPβ we observe in these cells is conjugated to more SUMO chains than the exogenously expressed C/EBPβ in Fig. 1 but could correspond to the higher molecular weight SUMO-3-conjugated species seen in Fig. 2C, lane 3 (which likely carries 1 T7 and 4 HA epitope tags). Lysine 173 Does Not Affect Nuclear Localization of C/EBPβ-1—SUMO proteins are known to affect cellular localization of target proteins. We have observed that C/EBPβ-1 has a specific, punctate nuclear staining pattern. 2E. M. Eaton and L. Sealy, unpublished observations. We hypothesized that the sumoylation of C/EBPβ-1 may be responsible for targeting the transcription factor to these areas. To address this question, we transfected HMECs with expression vectors for either wild-type C/EBPβ-1 or the C/EBPβ-1 lysine 173 to alanine mutant. Very small quantities (5 ng) of DNA were used to ensure that exogenous protein did not overwhelm the SUMO conjugation capacity of the cells. Transfected protein expression levels reflected those seen with endogenous C/EBPβ-1 protein (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 4, the staining pattern of the wild-type protein (C) mirrored that of the lysine 173 to alanine mutant (A). Hoechst staining demonstrates that the expression of C/EBPβ-1 is nuclear (Fig. 4, B and D). Thus, it appears that mutation of the sumoylation target does not affect subnuclear localization of C/EBPβ-1. Lysine 173 Is Critical for the Failure of C/EBPβ-1 to Activate the Cyclin D1 Promoter—Previously, we demonstrated that C/EBPβ-2, but not C/EBPβ-1, can activate the cyclin D1 promoter (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, Kim et al. (9Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the lysine targeted by SUMO-1 (lysine 134 in the rat protein) was necessary for proper function of the repression domain I in a C/EBPβ-Gal4 fusion protein reporter assay. We wanted to investigate whether the conserved human lysine 173 was necessary for the failure of C/EBPβ-1 to activate this promoter. Using transient transfections in NIH-3T3 murine fibroblasts, we observed that mutation of this lysine caused C/EBPβ-1 to behave similarly to C/EBPβ-2 using the cyclin D1 promoter/luciferase reporter construct. Whereas C/EBPβ-2 activates this construct above basal levels (CMV4), C/EBPβ-1 does not (Fig. 5). Mutation of lysine 173 in C/EBPβ-1 results in activation of the cyclin D1 construct. All transactivator proteins were expressed at equivalent levels as shown in Fig. 5B. These results indicate that lysine 173 is critical for the function of the repression domain of C/EBPβ-1 using this promoter construct. C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 differ by only 21–23 amino acids, yet evidence continues to accumulate that they are functionally distinct. In 1999, Kowenz-Leutz and Leutz (17Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the largest form of C/EBPβ, in their work termed LAP*, was capable of recruiting the Swi-Snf chromatin remodeling complex to the promoters of differentiation-specific genes in myeloid cells. The second isoform, LAP or C/EBPβ-2, was unable to recruit this complex to activate genes within the chromatin context. Furthermore, these authors demonstrated that the extreme N terminus of full-length C/EBPβ was necessary, but not sufficient, to recruit the Swi-Snf complex (17Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has found differences in the expression and function of C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 in mammary epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that C/EBPβ-2 is associated with dividing cells, either normal or cancerous, and that overexpression of this isoform causes transformation of normal mammary epithelial cells in culture (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This transformation is not observed with introduction of C/EBPβ-1; moreover, we have demonstrated that this isoform is lost from breast cancer cell lines. The work presented here expands on the observation that C/EBPβ-1 and C/EBPβ-2 are functionally distinct by demonstrating that C/EBPβ-1, but not C/EBPβ-2, can be conjugated to the SUMO family members, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. The intact N terminus of C/EBPβ-1 is needed, at least in part, for this conjugation, as evidenced by the reduction of SUMO-2/-3 incorporation when conserved amino acids within the N-terminal tail are mutated. We are, at the present time, unsure as to the mechanism by which these amino acids are important for conjugation of SUMO-2/-3. Given the observation that this tail is necessary, but not sufficient, for the interaction of C/EBPβ-1 with the large, multisubunit Swi-Snf complex (17Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), it is possible that the amino acids are involved in creating a structural change of the entire transcription factor, which distinguishes C/EBPβ-1 from C/EBPβ-2. Alternatively, the N terminus could be bound by a “bridging” factor necessary for interaction with components of the Swi-Snf complex and for interaction with the SUMO conjugation machinery. Unfortunately, there are currently no structural studies of the entirety of C/EBPβ; studies examining the differences in the structure of these two activator proteins will prove interesting. Mutation of lysine 173 mostly ablates the incorporation of SUMO-2/-3 into C/EBPβ-1. This sequence matches the SUMO target consensus and is likely the major site of conjugation of SUMO-2/-3 as well as SUMO-1 (9Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ-2, but not C/EBPβ-1, is able to activate the cyclin D1 promoter despite the fact that both proteins are able to bind a consensus C/EBP site within the promoter (15Eaton E.M. Hanlon M. Bundy L. Sealy L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We extend this observation by demonstrating that lysine 173 is critical for the inability of C/EBPβ-1 to activate this promoter. Furthermore, we extend the observation made by Kim et al. (9Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), who used a Gal4-C/EBPβ activation domain fusion protein to show that the conserved lysine 134 in the rat was necessary for function of the repression domain. When the authors mutated the lysine to an alanine, they observed an increase in transactivation potential at a Gal4 binding site reporter construct (9Kim J. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Pfarr C.M. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38037-38044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This is an expansion of earlier works, describing an increase in activation potential of a C/EBPβ-Gal4 fusion protein when certain domains (termed repression domains or conserved regions) were deleted (19Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Here, we show that mutation of this conserved lysine in the context of the entire protein disrupts the repression functions of C/EBPβ-1 at the cyclin D1 promoter. The apparent sumoylation of this lysine does not appear to influence subnuclear localization of C/EBPβ-1. Likely, sumoylation is affecting protein-protein interactions, such as with co-activators, co-repressors, or chromatin remodeling machinery, or blocking the transactivation potential via an intramolecular interaction. Recently, SUMO-dependent repression of the coactivator p300 function was shown to be mediated by recruitment of HDAC6 (21Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1043-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Whether histone deacetylases are involved in C/EBPβ-1 repression and whether their recruitment is SUMO-dependent will be interesting to determine in future studies. Although non-sumoylated C/EBPβ-1 (the lysine 173 mutant) behaves similarly to C/EBPβ-2 at the cyclin D1 promoter in a transient transfection assay, further studies will be necessary to determine whether non-sumoylated C/EBPβ-1 is functionally equivalent to C/EBPβ-2 at the entire set of genes that may be subject to C/EBPβ regulation."

The second large loop (between TMs 6 and 7) contains ∼66 amino acid residues and is cytoplasmic (5Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr.

From amino acid sequence comparisons, it has been suggested that ENTs from other organisms (including insects, nematodes, protozoa, yeasts, and higher plants) may adopt a topology similar to that of hENT1 (16Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Berry Z.A. Abidi F. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45270-45275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of several ENTs have been investigated extensively. In general, ENTs are broadly selective in substrate specificity (5Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cabrita M.A. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, their transport processes are differentially inhibited by nucleoside analogues (such as nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR)) or vasodilator drugs (e.g. dipyridamole, dilazep, and draflazine). For example, the es type ENTs are sensitive to inhibition by NBMPR, whereas the ei type ENTs are not (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy.

Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New, York1999: 313-352Google Scholar). Whereas the es type transporter from humans is potently inhibited by vasodilator drugs, the corresponding transporters from rodents and the ei type transporters from both humans and rodents are much less sensitive to such drugs (6Cabrita M.A. Baldwin S.A.

Through molecular studies on mammalian ENTs, a region encompassing TMs 1–6 has been deduced to be involved in substrate/inhibitor binding (23Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Griffiths M. Cass C.E.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8146-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been found that the replacement of a glycine residue (residue 154) in TM 4 of hENT1 by serine results in reduced NBMPR binding and that residue 33 in TM 1 of hENTs 1 and 2 is an important determinant of vasodilator drug sensitivity (25Hyde R.J.

The mutation of a single glycine residue (residue 179) in TM 5 alters both nucleoside transport activity and sensitivity to NBMPR in hENT1 (27SenGupta D.J. Lum P.Y. Lai Y. Shubochkina E. Bakken A.H. Schneider G. Unadkat J.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1512-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to playing a key role in the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis, mammalian ENTs have been found to affect many physiological processes including neurotransmission and cardiovascular activity through the regulation of adenosine concentrations (1Cass C.E. Georgopapadakou N.H. Drug Transport in Antimicrobial and Anticancer Chemotherapy. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 403-451Google Scholar, 2Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Clinically, ENTs are targets of vasodilator drugs as well as routes for uptake of nucleoside drugs used in treating cancers and viral infections (3Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 216-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Mammalian ENTs are found in a variety of tissues and cells, and evidence for the presence of more than one type of ENTs in the same tissue has been obtained (28Barros L.F. Yudilevich D.L. Jarvis S.M. Beaumont N. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 429: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Jennings L.L. Hao C. Cabrita M.A. Vickers M.F. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Compared with mammals and parasites, progress in understanding the expression, structure, and function of higher plant ENTs has been slow. Although nucleoside transport processes were first recorded in plants more than 20 years ago and have since been discovered in several cell types (30Kombrink E. Beevers H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 370-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kamboj R.K. Jackson J.F. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 801-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kamboj R.K. Jackson J.F. Plant Physiol. 1987; 84: 688-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the corresponding nucleoside transporters have not been identified. By taking advantage of the genetic information from the genome sequencing project, researchers have recently started molecular and biochemical studies of the ENTs encoded by the model plant A. thaliana (13Möhlmann T. Mezher Z. Schwerdtfeger G. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Li J. Wang D. Plant Sci. 2000; 157: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A total of eight genes encoding potential ENTs have been predicted in Arabidopsis (5Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their putative products (designated as AtENT1 to -8) form an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree constructed using ENTs from mammals, insects, nematodes, protozoa, yeasts, and plants (5Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene encoding AtENT1 is expressed constitutively and in multiple tissues (33Li J. Wang D. Plant Sci. 2000; 157: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Functional expression of AtENT1 in yeast cells has also been achieved (13Möhlmann T. Mezher Z. Schwerdtfeger G. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was shown that, in intact yeast cells, AtENT1 catalyzed a proton-linked, high affinity adenosine transport and that the transport mediated by AtENT1 was resistant to inhibition by the nucleoside analog NBMPR and by the vasodilator drugs dilazep and dipyridamole (13Möhlmann T. Mezher Z. Schwerdtfeger G. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that uridine, which is commonly transported by various types of mammalian ENTs, might not be significantly transported by AtENT1 (13Möhlmann T. Mezher Z. Schwerdtfeger G. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These results suggest that at least some (if not all) of the AtENTs predicted by genome sequencing are likely to be functional proteins. In this context, it would be important to study all members of the Arabidopsis ENT family in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the function of higher plant ENTs. In protozoan parasites and some mammalian cell types, the importance of ENTs in the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis is indicated by the lack of the de novo pathway of nucleotide synthesis (4Young J.D. Cheeseman C.I. Mackey J.R. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Donowitz M. Gastrointestinal Transport: Molecular Physiology. Vol. 50. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2001: 329-378Google Scholar, 34Murray A.W.

American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1998: 177-184Google Scholar). In higher plants, evidence for the participation of ENTs in the salvage pathway has mainly come from observations that exogenously supplied nucleosides (such as [3H]thymidine) and analogs (for example, bromodeoxyuridine) can be taken up and incorporated into DNA synthesis (37Van't Hof J. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 773-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 38Lin B.L. Raghavan V. Am. J. Bot. 1991; 78: 740-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lopez M.E. Giordano O.S. Lopez L.A.

So far there have been no investigations on whether the transcription of ENT genes or the activities of ENT proteins would change in response to inhibition of the de novo pathway of nucleotide synthesis in plant cells. Experiments of this kind are essential for not only providing molecular evidence on the function of ENTs in the salvage pathway of nucleotide synthesis but also yielding insights into the relationship between the two pathways of nucleotide synthesis in plant cells. Based on the above discussions, we decided to conduct a more comprehensive study of the ENTs of A. thaliana predicted by genome sequencing. Below, we report the cloning of the cDNAs for AtENTs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8, comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of AtENTs with those from other organisms, regulation of AtENT transcription by alterations in the de novo pathway of nucleotide synthesis, transcription patterns of seven AtENTs in various Arabidopsis organs, and functional expression of AtENT3 in yeast cells. The potential role of ENTs in A. thaliana is discussed in light of our results and those published previously. Cloning of AtENT cDNAs and Comparative Analysis of Amino Acid Sequences of AtENTs—The Col-1 ecotype of A. thaliana was used throughout this study. To amplify cDNAs for the complete coding regions of AtENTs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 using RT-PCR, oligonucleotide primers (Table I) were synthesized according to genomic sequence information generated by the Arabidopsis genome initiative (AGI). Total RNA samples were prepared from suspension cells, leaves, stems, roots, flowers, or immature siliques of A. thaliana as described previously (41Li D. Zhu H. Liu K. Liu X. Leggewie G. Udvardi M. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27772-27781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). RT-PCR experiments using appropriate primers and enzymes were conducted following published protocols (41Li D. Zhu H. Liu K. Liu X. Leggewie G. Udvardi M. Wang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27772-27781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The expected cDNA fragments were cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy plasmid vector (Promega). The inserts in the resultant positive clones were sequenced commercially (TaKaRa) from both strands.

Open table in a new tab For calculating amino acid sequence identities using the software DNAstar (DNAstar Inc), the amino acid sequences of AtENTs 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 were deduced from cloned cDNAs and compared with those of AtENT1 and ENTs from other sources for which nucleoside transport activities have been demonstrated (Table II) (6Cabrita M.A. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate phylogenetic relationships of AtENTs to ENTs from other sources, the amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program at the EBI Web site (www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/index.html). The aligned sequences were converted into MEGA format, which was subsequently employed for constructing phylogenetic trees at the MEGA 2 Web site (www.megasoftware.net) (42Nei N. Kumar S. Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). The putative transmembrane domains of AtENTs were predicted using the HMMTOP program (available on the World Wide Web at www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/server/hmmtop.cgi) (43Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol.

By use of site-directed mutagenesis and sequence comparisons, we have identified Cys-235, Asp-328, and His-362 as constituting a catalytic triad in human BACAT (hBACAT) and identifying BACAT as a member of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterase gene family. We therefore hypothesized that hBACAT may also hydrolyze fatty acyl-CoAs and/or conjugate fatty acids to glycine. We show here that recombinant hBACAT also can hydrolyze long- and very long-chain saturated acyl-CoAs (mainly C16:0–C26:0) and by mass spectrometry verified that hBACAT also conjugates fatty acids to glycine. Tissue expression studies showed strong expression of BACAT in liver, gallbladder, and the proximal and distal intestine. However, BACAT is also expressed in a variety of tissues unrelated to bile acid formation and transport, suggesting important functions also in the regulation of intracellular levels of very long-chain fatty acids. Green fluorescent protein localization experiments in human skin fibroblasts showed that the hBACAT enzyme is mainly cytosolic. Therefore, the cytosolic BACAT enzyme may play important roles in protection against toxicity by accumulation of unconjugated bile acids and non-esterified very long-chain fatty acids.

Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 176-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). BAs are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and are conjugated to either glycine or taurine before secretion into the bile. This conjugation (or amidation) plays several important biological roles in that it promotes the secretion of BAs and cholesterol into bile and increases the detergent properties of BAs in the intestine, which facilitates lipid and vitamin absorption. BAs are deconjugated by bacteria in the intestine and recycled back to the liver for reconjugation. The initial steps in the biosynthesis of BAs involve oxidative modifications of the cholesterol backbone and side chain to form dihydroxycholestanoic acid and trihydroxycholestanoic acid (THCA). Dihydroxycholestanoic acid and THCA are activated to their corresponding CoA-esters followed by β-oxidative cleavage in peroxisomes to form chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA (CDCA-CoA) and choloyl-CoA (CA-CoA), respectively, which are substrates for conjugation to glycine or taurine (2Kase F.

Söreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conjugation is catalyzed by the enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BACAT), an enzyme recently implicated in the inheritance of familial hypercholanemia (6Carlton V.E.H. Harris B.Z. Puffenberger E.G. Batta A.K. Knisely A.S. Robinson D.I. Strauss K.A. Shneider B.L. Lim W.A. Salen G. Holmes Morton D. Bull L.N. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Recent data show that BACAT activity is present both in peroxisomes and in the cytosol (5Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Söreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of two BACAT enzymes. It has been proposed that whereas the peroxisomal enzyme conjugates de novo synthesized BAs, the cytosolic enzyme has a function in conjugating BAs recycled from the intestine to the liver. Further support for the existence of two pathways for conjugation of BAs comes from a recent study by Mihalik et al. (7Mihalik S.J. Steinberg S.J. Pei Z. Park J. Kim D.G. Heinzer A.K. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J.A. Cuebas D.A. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24771-24779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). They show that human very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS), present in peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, primarily activates THCA, which is a precursor for de novo synthesis of bile acids. In contrast, a homologue of this enzyme, VLCS-H2, located in the endoplasmic reticulum and referred to as bile acid-CoA synthetase (BACS), activates mainly BAs (7Mihalik S.J. Steinberg S.J. Pei Z. Park J. Kim D.G. Heinzer A.K. Dacremont G. Wanders R.J.A. Cuebas D.A. Smith K.D. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24771-24779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was therefore suggested that BACS activates recycled BAs for conjugation by BACAT in the cytosol. However, to date only one BACAT enzyme has been identified and characterized. The enzyme has been purified from several species such as rat (8Killenberg P.G. Jordan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 10005-11010Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), bovine (9Vessey D.A. J. Biol.

Molecular cloning of the human BACAT showed that the enzyme conjugates bile acids to both glycine and taurine (16Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have recently identified and characterized a family of highly homologous acyl-CoA thioesterases, referred to as type I acyl-CoA thioesterases, with putative localizations in peroxisomes (PTE-Ia and PTE-Ib), mitochondria (MTE-I), and cytosol (CTE-I) (17Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.E. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Data base searches and subsequent sequence alignments revealed that these acyl-CoA thioesterases show sequence homology only to BACAT from rat (18Furutani M. Arii S. Higashitsuji H. Mise M. Fukumoto M. Takano S. Nakayama H. Imamura M. Fujita J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), mouse (19Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E.H. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and human (16Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with a sequence identity of 40–45% to the type I acyl-CoA thioesterases. Acyl-CoA thioesterases hydrolyze acyl-CoAs to non-esterified fatty acids and CoASH. By preserving a balance of acyl-CoA, free fatty acids, and CoASH in the cell, acyl-CoA thioesterases directly and indirectly, via gene regulation, influence numerous cellular processes involved in lipid metabolism, for example β-oxidation and esterification of fatty acids (for review, see Ref. 20Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 99-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). All members of this acyl-CoA thioesterase family contain a conserved serine-histidine-aspartic acid catalytic triad (21Huhtinen K. O'Byrne J. Lindquist P.J.G. Contreras J.A. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3424-3432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments showed that BACAT also contains an almost identical catalytic triad, with one notable difference, the presence of a cysteine in place of the acyl-CoA thioesterase nucleophilic serine. Therefore it is likely that the cysteine is the nucleophilic residue in the BACAT enzyme and, possibly, that BACAT also amidates fatty acids.In this study we have characterized the human BACAT enzyme, showing that in addition to catalyzing the conjugation of BAs, BACAT also conjugates fatty acids to glycine in vitro and that it can also act as a very long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase. From transfection experiments of BACAT as a fusion protein with green fluorescent protein (GFP) we also show that BACAT is mainly cytosolic. As BACAT also shows a wider tissue distribution than anticipated previously, we propose that BACAT may also have functions other than conjugating bile acids to glycine.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Expression of Human BACAT cDNA—The hBACAT cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame was amplified using the following primers: 5′-CATATGATCCAGTTGACAGCT-3′ and 5′-CATATGGAGACATTCCGCCATG-3′ with the addition of NdeI sites (indicated in bold). The full-length cDNA was amplified with One Step RNA PCR kit (AMV, Takara Biomedicals) using a template of human liver total RNA. RT-PCR was performed at 58 °C for 30 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 4 min. The resultant PCR product was cloned into the pET16b vector (Novagen Inc.) and expressed as described elsewhere (21Huhtinen K. O'Byrne J. Lindquist P.J.G. Contreras J.A. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3424-3432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), except that the bacteria were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 5 h.Purification of Wild-type and Mutant hBACAT Protein—For initial studies on hBACAT, the bacterial pellets were thawed in phosphate buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 50 mm imidazole and solubilized by sonication with 10 × 5-s pulses at 5-s intervals (XL2020 from Heat Systems). The bacterial suspension was centrifuged for 60 min at 35,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified using HiTrap™ chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant protein was eluted stepwise with increasing concentrations of imidazole. For some experiments, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in Bugbuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The supernatant was filtered as described above and the protein purified using HiTrap™ chelating columns. Because of precipitation of the protein when using 0.5 m NaCl, the columns were equilibrated with phosphate buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The supernatant was mixed with the same buffer in a 1:1 ratio and loaded onto the column, and the protein was eluted stepwise with increasing imidazole concentrations.Gel Electrophoresis and Protein Determination—Purified recombinant proteins or bacterial protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar).Determination of hBACAT Activity—Bile acid-CoA thioesterase and conjugation activity of hBACAT was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm using 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The medium contained 200 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.05 mm DTNB (pH 7.4). For conjugation measurements, 50 mm glycine or taurine was added to the cuvette. Medium and substrate were premixed, and the reaction was started with the addition of protein, which allowed for the testing of non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the CoA esters. An ϵ412 nm = 13,600 m–1 cm–1 was used to calculate the activity. Kinetic analysis was carried out using the Sigma Plot Enzyme Kinetics program. Activity measurements on CA-CoA and N-acylglycines were carried out in duplicate on three different hBACAT protein preparations, and measurements for CDCA-CoA and THCA-CoA were carried out in duplicate on two hBACAT protein preparations. Data are shown as means ± S.E. or range (n = 2–3).Electrospray Mass Spectrometry (ESMS) Analysis—Incubation mixtures were set up containing chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA (50 μm) or arachidoyl-CoA (40 μm), hBACAT enzyme (2–5 μg), and glycine (50 mm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8. The mixtures were incubated for 48 h at room temperature after which they were purified using Sepac C18 columns. The Sepac C18 columns were equilibrated with 5-ml volumes of chloroform:methanol (2:1), followed by 95% methanol in water, and finally by water. The incubation mixtures were then loaded onto the column followed by a further washing step with 5 ml of water. The column was then eluted using 5 ml of methanol, and the eluate was dried under nitrogen. The samples containing products from reactions with chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and arachidoyl-CoA were reconstituted in ∼50 μl of methanol or tetrahydrofurane-water (1:1 v/v), respectively, of which 4–5 μl was loaded into gold-coated glass capillaries. Mass spectrometry was performed on a Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Wythenshawe, Manchester, UK) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. Mass spectra were acquired in the negative ion mode over a mass scan range of m/z 50–1200 for 2 min at a scan rate of 4 s/scan.Identification of Putative Candidates for the Catalytic Triad of Human BACAT—Fasta3 (23Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9345) Google Scholar) (European Bioinformatics Institute server, www.ebi.ac.uk/fasta33) was used to generate a multiple sequence alignment between hBACAT and its homologous sequences in the GenBank™. Examination of the sequence alignment identified a possible cysteine-aspartic acid-histidine catalytic triad.Generation and Expression of Human BACAT Mutants—Point mutations were introduced by PCR using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic sense oligonucleotides used are shown in Table I. PCR reactions for single amino acid mutations were run for 16 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 55 °C followed by 15 min at 68 °C. The mutant plasmids were sequenced using the ABI Prism Dye Terminator Ready-reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at Cybergene AB (Huddinge, Sweden). The mutants were expressed and purified, and activity was determined on bile acid-CoA substrates as described above for the wild-type hBACAT.Table ISummary of the oligonucleotide primers used to create human BACAT mutantsAmino acid substitutionPrimer positionCodon change5′-3′-Primer sequenceaThe mutated codon is underlined.Cys-235 → Ala688-722TGT to GCTGGG GTA GTC TCT GTA GCT CAA GGA GTA CAG ATT GGAsp-328 → Ala959-1004GAT to GCTCCT CTT CAT TGT AGG AGA AGG TGC TAA GAC TAT CAA CAG CAA AGCHis-362 → Gln1074-1101CAC to CAGGGG GCA GGC CAG CTG ATA GAA CCT CCCa The mutated codon is underlined.

Permissions for the use of human and mouse samples are held from local ethics committees.Localization of Human BACAT Using Green Fluorescent Fusion Protein—The human BACAT open reading frame was cloned into the pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen), in-frame with the GFP at the N-terminal end. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, using the primer 5′-TCCAGATGTGACCAGTA AACTCTAAGAAGACTAGATATTCC-3′ and its reverse complement primer to mutate the C-terminal -SQL to -SKL. The mutated nucleotide (C to A) is underlined in the primer sequence, and the nucleotide change was verified by sequencing. Human skin fibroblasts were grown as described (26Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were transfected with 10 μg of hBACAT/NT-GFP plasmid and the hBACAT/NT-GFP -SKL mutant plasmid using the calcium phosphate method as described (26Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but without staining of the nucleus with Hoechst 33342.RESULTSRecombinant Expression and Characterization of hBACAT— For recombinant expression of hBACAT, we cloned the corresponding cDNA by PCR. Sequencing of the cDNA identified four nucleotide differences compared with the published sequence (16Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of which two result in the following changes: Pro-8 → Arg and Arg-20 → Gln. The bile acid conjugation and thioesterase activities of the expressed hBACAT enzyme were tested using choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA as substrates in the presence or absence of glycine and taurine. Non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the CoA esters did not occur (data not shown), whereas the thioesterase activity, measured in the absence of glycine, was about 164 nmol/min/mg protein with 50 μm CA-CoA and about 160 nmol/min/mg with 50 μm CDCA-CoA (Fig. 1A). The addition of glycine to the reaction increased the activity to about 762 nmol/min/mg with CA-CoA and to about 733 nmol/min/mg with CDCA-CoA. Thus, CA-CoA appears to be a slightly better substrate than CDCA-CoA for both the thioesterase and conjugation activities of hBACAT. Also, glycine is a slightly better substrate than taurine, at least when measured at saturating concentrations. In contrast, the hBACAT enzyme showed very low activity with THCA-CoA, both in the presence and absence of glycine. It is noteworthy that the thioesterase activity is ∼20% of the conjugation activity with both CA-CoA and CDCA-CoA. Both the thioesterase and conjugation activities of hBACAT were confirmed by ESMS (Fig. 1B).Identification of the Putative Catalytic Triad in hBACAT— From an examination of the sequence alignment of hBACAT and its homologues in the GenBank™ data base, a putative catalytic triad consisting of residues Cys-235, Asp-328, and His-362 was identified in this enzyme (Fig. 2). Following identification of the amino acids in the catalytic triad, the Cys-235 → Ala, Asp-328 → Ala, and His-362 → Glu mutants were generated to test the effects of these amino acid substitutions. The corresponding proteins were expressed and purified to near homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-PAGE (data not shown) and were characterized enzymatically. In an experiment to measure the activity of the generated mutants, choloyl-CoA conjugation activity (measured in the presence of 50 mm glycine) of wild-type hBACAT was about 1041 nmol/min/mg protein (Table II). However, the activities of the mutated proteins Cys-235 → Ala, Asp-328 → Ala, and His-362 → Gln were all less than 0.4% of the wild-type activity, strongly suggesting that Cys-235, Asp-328, and His-362 indeed constitute the active site amino acids of hBACAT. We also generated a Cys-235 → Ser mutant, which converted the BACAT into an efficient bile acid-CoA thioesterase (data not shown).Fig. 2Alignment of the putative catalytic triad amino acids of BACAT and the type I acyl-CoA thioesterases. The mouse acyl-CoA thioesterases (mCTE-I, cytosolic acyl-CoA thioesterase I; mMTE-I, mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase I; mPTE-Ia and -Ib, peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase Ia and Ib, respectively) contain a serine (S) residue in a GXSXG motif, whereas a cysteine (C) residue is found in the BACAT enzymes from human (h), mouse (m), and rat (r) in an SXCXG motif. The aspartic acid (D) and histidine (H) residues are conserved between all enzymes. The numbers indicates the amino acid positions in the protein sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIComparison of activity of recombinantly expressed hBACAT and mutant proteinshBACAT enzymeSpecific activityActivitynmol/min/mg% of wild typeWild type1041100Cys-235 → Ala1.60.15Asp-326 → Ala0.70.07His-362 → Gln40.38 Open table in a new tab hBACAT Has Both acyl-CoA Thioesterase and Glycine Conjugation Activities with Long- and Very Long-chain Saturated Acyl-CoAs in Vitro—Because the BACAT enzymes show a high degree of homology to the type I acyl-CoA thioesterases, we hypothesized that the BACAT enzyme may also be active on acyl-CoAs. Bile acids are much more bulky substrates than straight long-chain acyl-CoAs, and acyl-CoAs are therefore likely to be accommodated in the active site of the BACAT enzyme. The expressed hBACAT enzyme was therefore incubated with fatty acyl-CoAs (each at 10 μm) in both the absence and presence of 50 mm glycine (Fig. 3). Indeed, the hBACAT enzyme showed thioesterase activity with saturated long-chain acyl-CoAs, with the highest activity seen with saturated C16–C20 acyl-CoAs. Incubation of these acyl-CoAs with 50 mm glycine inconsistently stimulated the activity to some degree. However, a consistent and larger glycine-dependent stimulation of hBACAT activity was observed with the very long-chain acyl-CoA substrates (C22:0–C26:0). Introduction of double bonds resulted in a strikingly lower activity (compare C18:1-CoA, C18.2-CoA, and C20:4-CoA and the corresponding saturated acyl-CoAs). To identify the reaction products in more detail, we incubated hBACAT with arachidoyl-CoA (C20:0-CoA) as a model substrate and analyzed the reaction products by ESMS. As shown in Fig. 4a, incubation of hBACAT with arachidoyl-CoA and glycine produced both arachidic acid and N-arachidoylglycine, the glycine conjugate of arachidic acid. Incubation of hBACAT with arachidoyl-CoA in the absence of glycine produced only arachidic acid (Fig. 4b). We also confirmed the formation of N-stearoylglycine by BACAT using ESMS (data not shown). A more detailed kinetic analysis of hBACAT activity with arachidoyl-CoA resulted in a V max of 223 nmol/min/mg and a Km of 19.3 μm when measured in the presence of glycine (Fig. 5). These results show that hBACAT, in addition to its bile acid conjugating activity, also possesses thioesterase and glycine conjugating activities with long- and very long-chain acyl-CoAs, at least in vitro. Although the activity is much lower with acyl-CoAs as compared with the activity with bile acids, it is possible that both the thioesterase and glycine conjugating activities could serve important functions in vivo.Fig. 3Acyl-CoA chain length specificity of hBACAT thioesterase and conjugating activities. Wild-type hBACAT was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thioesterase and glycine conjugating activity was measured at a substrate concentration of 10 μm in the absence and presence of 50 mm glycine. Filled bars, thioesterase activity (in the absence of glycine). Stippled bars, activity in the presence of glycine. Activity was not detectable with acyl-CoAs of 10 carbons or less.

We therefore set out to re-investigate the tissue expression of both the BACS and BACAT enzymes by RT-PCR in human and mouse tissues. Because of restricted access to human tissues, expression of BACAT and BACS was investigated only in human liver, gallbladder mucosa, and pancreas (Fig. 6). Interestingly, both BACAT and BACS were expressed in these tissues, showing a reasonably co-ordinate expression. In addition, data base searches revealed a number of expressed sequence tag (EST) clones encoding BACAT expressed mainly in human liver, as expected, but also in skin, heart, lung, a"

Currently, diagnosis of and vaccination strategies against this pathogen are exclusively based on proteinaceous structures. Here we report on a novel class of immunogenic glycolipids purified from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31. Employing a butanol/water extraction procedure with subsequent Bligh/Dyer extraction of the organic phase, thin layer chromatography analysis revealed the presence of three distinct glycolipids, which were chemically analyzed employing combined gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and NMR. We identified acylated cholesteryl galactoside (ACG) next to cholesteryl galactoside and α-monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol. After extensive purification, the glycolipids investigated failed to cause proinflammatory responses in human cells transfected with human toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 or -4. However, we observed a marked recognition of ACG by sera derived from patients suffering from Lyme disease. These data indicate that newly described ACG is involved in developing host immunity during Lyme disease and thus may be useful for diagnosis and vaccination.

Currently, diagnosis of and vaccination strategies against this pathogen are exclusively based on proteinaceous structures. Here we report on a novel class of immunogenic glycolipids purified from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31. Employing a butanol/water extraction procedure with subsequent Bligh/Dyer extraction of the organic phase, thin layer chromatography analysis revealed the presence of three distinct glycolipids, which were chemically analyzed employing combined gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and NMR. We identified acylated cholesteryl galactoside (ACG) next to cholesteryl galactoside and α-monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol. After extensive purification, the glycolipids investigated failed to cause proinflammatory responses in human cells transfected with human toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 or -4. However, we observed a marked recognition of ACG by sera derived from patients suffering from Lyme disease. These data indicate that newly described ACG is involved in developing host immunity during Lyme disease and thus may be useful for diagnosis and vaccination.

It is characterized by different clinical stages, including localized, early disseminated, and late disseminated disease. Erythema chronicum migrans is the characteristic localized early manifestation, whereas early disseminated disease includes facial palsy and meningo-encephalitis, the latter being more frequent in Europe than in the United States (4Weber K. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2001; 20: 6-13PubMed Google Scholar). B. burgdorferi sensu lato is subdivided into three subspecies, including B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia afzelii. In the United States, LD is exclusively caused by B. burgdorferi, whereas in Europe all three subspecies are found (4Weber K. Eur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 2001; 20: 6-13PubMed Google Scholar). Borrelia are commonly referred to as being Gram-negative; however, their cell membrane architecture differs greatly from other bacteria. Like other members of the order of Spirochaetales, such as Treponema, Borrelia exhibit an inner and an outer membrane, which span the so-called periplasmic space, containing the flagellum (5Johnson R.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 89-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In 1978, Livermore et al. (6Livermore B.P. Bey R.F. Johnson R.C. Infect. Immun. 1978; 20: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the presence of α-monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol (MGalD) as well as acylated and nonacylated cholesteryl glucosides in the outer membrane of Borrelia hermsi. However, most of the following studies investigating potential immunostimulatory and/or immunogenic partial structures in Borrelia focused on lipoproteins, referred to as outer surface proteins (Osps). These compounds have been repeatedly described as provoking the induction of proinflammatory cytokines via a pathway involving a receptor complex containing CD14 and toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 as well as subsequent translocation of NF-κB (7Norgard M.V.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). OspA is furthermore used as a vaccine against LD, and the first clinical trials show promising efficacies (10Steere A.C. Sikand V.K. Meurice F. Parenti D.L. Fikrig E. Schoen R.T. Nowakowski J. Schmid C.H. Laukamp S. Buscarino C. Krause D.S. N. Engl. J.

Since culture of B. burgdorferi is difficult, diagnosis of LD, in addition to clinical aspects, is based on the presence of antibodies in the patient's serum against a series of B. burgdorferi outer membrane proteins. LD diagnosis requires positive ELISA testing, confirmed by Western blotting (12Reed K.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The reaction pattern against different proteins yields information on the duration and course of the disease, since antibodies appear at different time points. Immunity against Borrelia flagellin (p41) appears early during disease and is often accompanied by antibodies recognizing OspC (13Robertson J. Guy E. Andrews N. Wilske B. Anda P. Granstrom M.

Later, a more complex pattern can be observed, including antibodies against p100 and p17 (13Robertson J. Guy E. Andrews N. Wilske B. Anda P. Granstrom M. Hauser U. Moosmann Y. Sambri V. Schellekens J. Stanek G. Gray J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 2097-2102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Wilske B. Fingerle V. Herzer P. Hofmann A. Lehnert G. Peters H. Pfister H.W. Preac-Mursic V.

Microbiol. 1997; 35: 1433-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, lipoproteins substantially vary among different B. burgdorferi subspecies, thus complicating the development of a diagnostic procedure suitable for all affected areas (16Wilske B. Busch U.

Immun. 1993; 61: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study reported MGalD in B. burgdorferi, and investigation of sera derived from patients suffering from LD revealed that this glycolipid may also be immunogenic (19Hossain H. Wellensiek H.J. Geyer R. Lochnit G. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), indicating that glycolipids in common may attribute to adaptive immunity against B. burgdorferi. The aim of this study was to elucidate the nature of complex glycolipids in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. We found that this strain, in addition to MGalD, also exhibits cholesteryl glycosides cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ACG) and cholesteryl β-d-galactopyranoside (CG), both containing galactose instead of glucose, as reported in B. hermsi (6Livermore B.P. Bey R.F. Johnson R.C. Infect. Immun. 1978; 20: 215-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus representing a novel class of glycolipids. All compounds investigated failed to induce proinflammatory responses in human cells. However, we observed a profound recognition of ACG by sera obtained from patients suffering from LD, whereas its nonacylated counterpart apparently was not immunogenic. These results indicate that adaptive immune responses against Borrelia are not exclusively directed against proteinaceous structures but also against a novel class of glycolipids, which may have implications for developing novel diagnostics and immunization strategies against LD. Cultivation of B. burgdorferi Sensu Stricto B31—Glycerol stocks of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto B31 stored at –80 °C (100 μl; kindly provided by B. Hammer, Institut für Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Berlin, Germany) were transferred to 5 ml of BSK-H medium supplemented with 6% rabbit serum (Sigma). After 3–4 days of culture at 34 °C, viability of bacteria was checked by darkfield microscopy, and cultures were transferred to 50 ml of medium. After another 4 days of culture, bacteria were transferred to the final volume of 500 ml. Borrelia were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by two washing steps with endotoxin-free water (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) under similar conditions. Preparation of Sonicates—For preparation of crude Borrelia sonicates, we employed a published protocol developed for cell wall preparation of Streptococcus pneumoniae with some modifications (20Schumann R.R. Pfeil D. Freyer D. Buerger W. Lamping N. Kirschning C.J. Goebel U.B. Weber J.R. Glia. 1998; 22: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Dried B. burgdorferi B31 (5 mg) were suspended in 5 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate and subsequently sonicated four times for 2 min. The sonicate then was centrifuged for 3 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were harvested and spun for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen) and stored at –20 °C. Butanol and Bligh/Dyer Extraction—Borrelia cells (6.5 g, wet weight) were suspended in 17.5 ml of endotoxin-free water, and the same volume of n-butyl alcohol was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min while shaking and subsequently spun at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The resulting butanol phase was saved, and the water phase and interphase were re-extracted under the same conditions. Both, butanol and water phase were excessively dialyzed against distilled water at 4 °C for 3 days, employing tubes with a molecular mass cut-off of 10–14 kDa (Roth, Braunschweig, Germany), followed by lyophilization. The butanol phase yielded 187.4 mg, and 98 mg were subjected to Bligh/Dyer extraction (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42855) Google Scholar), yielding 89 mg (representing 87% of the introduced butanol phase). The water phase of the butanol/water step was saved for other studies. 20 ml of BSK-H medium were also lyophilized and subjected to combined butanol-Bligh/Dyer extraction as described above as negative control. Analytical TLC and Preparative Layer Chromatography (PLC)—Analytical TLC was performed employing aluminum silica sheets (0.2 mm, Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck). 10–30 μg of the samples were loaded, and were run in CHCl3/MeOH/acetone/HOAc (100%)/H2O (65:10:20:10:3; v/v/v/v/v) (19Hossain H. Wellensiek H.J. Geyer R. Lochnit G. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and stained with EtOH and concentrated H2SO4 (85:15; v/v). Phospholipid-specific staining was performed as described (22Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For PLC, the Bligh/Dyer organic phase was loaded on three PLC plates (20 × 20 cm, 2-mm thickness, Kieselgel 60 F254; Merck) and run in CHCl3/MeOH (85:15; v/v). After wetting with distilled water, six fractions were visualized (F1a, F1b, F2, F3, F4, and F5), which were scraped off and eluted with CHCl3/MeOH (1:1; v/v) and extracted three times with chloroform/water. The resulting fractions were analyzed by TLC as described above. Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC) and Combined Gas-Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy (GLC-MS)—Compositional analysis employing GLC-MS was performed with 200 μg of each sample after methanolysis (1.5 ml of 2 m HCl/MeOH at 85 °C for 1 h) in sealed ampoules. The samples were subsequently dried and peracetylated with 1 ml pyridine/acetanhydride (2:1 (v/v), 80 °C, 1 h), concentrated, and analyzed. GLC-MS was performed employing a HP-5MS column (30 m; Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) with a temperature gradient from 150 °C (3 min) to 320 °C at 5 °C/min. Electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectra were recorded as described (23Sperling P. Zähringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28590-28596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 24Jorasch P. Warnecke D.C. Lindner B. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3770-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry—As indicated, fractions were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS performed with a Bruker-Reflex III (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in reflector (REF-) TOF configuration at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and delayed ion extraction. Samples were dispersed in CHCl3/MeOH (85:15; v/v) at a concentration of 10 μg/μl and mixed on the target with an equal volume of matrix solution. Mass spectra were recorded in positive ion mode. Mass scale calibration was performed externally with similar compounds of known chemical structure. NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR analysis, fractions were recorded on 0.5 ml of CHCl3-d/CH3OH-d 4 (9:1; v/v), F5 in Me2SO-d 6 (99.96 atom % D; Aldrich, Munich, Germany) at 300 K in 5-mm high precision NMR sample tubes (Promochem, Wesel, Germany). Proton (1H) and all proton-detected two-dimensional NMR spectra were run on a Bruker DRX600 Avance spectrometer at 600 MHz. One-dimensional carbon (13C) NMR and DEPT 135 spectra were measured on a Bruker DPX-360 spectrometer at 90.6 MHz. The chemical shift values were referenced to internal TMS (δH = 0.00 ppm) CDCl3 (δe = 77 ppm) or Me2SO (δH = 2.25 ppm; δ = 39.4 ppm). 1H/1H correlated spectroscopy (COSY), 1H/1H total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY), 1H/13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC), and 1H/13C heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity (HMBC) experiments were performed using standard Bruker software (XWinNMR 2.6). Stimulation of Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) Cells— HEK293 cells were cultivated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in 96-well tissue culture plates. Cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding for human Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (0.2 μg/well; kindly provided by P. Nelson (Seattle, WA)), for some experiments in combination with human CD14 (0.025 μg/well; kindly provided by D. T. Golenbock (Worcester, MA)) and human MD-2 (0.025 μg/well; kindly provided by K. Miyake (Tokyo, Japan)). After 24 h, cells were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and stimulated with Borrelia fractions, Pam3CysSK4 (EMC, Tübingen, Germany), or lipopolysaccharide from Salmonella enterica sv. Friedenau (kindly provided by H. Brade (Borstel, Germany)). For certain experiments, cells were stimulated with deacylated ACG. For this purpose, fraction F2 was de-O-acylated by transesterification in 3 ml of 50 mm NaOHMe at room temperature for 1 h. After neutralization with 0.5 m HCl/CH3OH, the product was extracted twice with CHCl3 and H2O (1:1; v/v), yielding one glycolipid (ACG-OH) and free fatty acids as detected by analytical TLC. F2-OH was further purified by PLC as described above. Stimulation was performed for 18 h, supernatants were harvested, and interleukin-8 content was estimated employing a commercial ELISA (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Patient Sera—Sera were obtained from the diagnostic serology department of the Institut für Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitätsklinikum Charité (Berlin, Germany). Twelve patients diagnosed as suffering from Lyme disease exhibiting positive serologic responses to Osps were investigated. All sera were positive in ELISA and IgG-Western blot. The sera of eight patients resembled a late stage of infection as revealed by the presence of p17 and p100 bands in IgG Western blot (24Jorasch P. Warnecke D.C. Lindner B. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3770-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). four patients displayed an earlier stage with a positive OspC-Western blot and positive IgM ELISA. As a control, four sera negative for Lyme disease as well as four sera from lues (syphilis) patients positive in TPPA and VDRL were investigated. Immunoblotting of Glycolipids—Polyacrylamide stacking gels (5%) and separating gels (16%) were cast with SDS. MGalD, ACG, and CG (1 μg each), dissolved in butanol/H2O (5:1), and Borrelia sonicate (30 μl, corresponding to 30 μg of dried bacteria) were mixed with 4× sample buffer and loaded on the gel, and electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli. BenchMark™ protein ladder (Invitrogen) was loaded to determine molecular weight. Gels were immersed in transfer buffer containing 25 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 200 mm glycine, and 20% MeOH and transferred to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by semidry blotting. Membranes were blocked with PBS plus 5% skim milk (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland), 0.05% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with sera diluted 1,000-fold in PBS, 5% skim milk, 0.05% Tween 20for3hat room temperature. After washing, a rabbit anti-human IgG antiserum (Santa Cruz, Palo Alto, CA) diluted 10,000-fold in PBS plus 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed with PBS, and bands were detected employing the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol using Hyperfilm ECL-films (Amersham Biosciences). Furthermore, dot blots were performed by pipetting 1 μg of glycolipids dissolved in PBS as well as 5 μl of sonicate directly on Hybond-C extra membranes previously immersed in PBS. Detection of spots was performed as described above. Lipid Composition of B. burgdorferi B31—The combined butanol/water-Bligh/Dyer extraction procedure yielded a mixture of different polar lipids within the final organic phase, comprising 1.67% of total wet weight, thus being in line with previous reports (19Hossain H. Wellensiek H.J. Geyer R. Lochnit G. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Employing TLC, we were able to distinguish six fractions (Fig. 1). In order to determine which fractions were derived from the BSK-H culture medium, TLC patterns of Borrelia extracts were compared with extracts derived from BSK-H alone, revealing that fractions F1a and F1b originated from culture medium (data not shown). Therefore, we focused on the remaining lipids within fraction F2 (19%), F3 (7%), F4 (2.2%), and F5 (22.5%). Upon analytical TLC, F5 co-migrated with and stained identical as compared with phosphatidylcholine, which was previously described to be present in B. burgdorferi (5Johnson R.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1977; 31: 89-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Hossain H. Wellensiek H.J. Geyer R. Lochnit G. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This fraction was analyzed by NMR in Me2SO-d 6, which gave excellent spectral resolution, and F5 showed identical NMR spectra as compared with commercial phosphatidylcholine (data not shown). Identification of MGalD—GLC-MS analysis of fraction F3 revealed the presence of one hexose, one glycerol, and several fatty acids, including 18:1 (45%), 16:0 (30%), 18:2 (15%), and 18:0 (10%). The MALDI-TOF MS (positive ion mode) revealed pseudomolecular ions [M + Na]+ of m/z = 779.5, 805.5, 807.6, and 809.6, being in agreement with monohexosyldiacylglycerol in which one hexose, one glycerol, and two fatty acids in combinations of 16:0/18:1, 18:1/18:1, 18:1/18:0, and 18:0/18:0 are present, with the monohexosyldioleylglycerol (18:1/18:1) m/z = 805.5 as the major peak. The 1H NMR spectrum yielded diagnostic signals of glycerol and galactose (Table I). One anomeric signal (H-1, doublet, 4.811 ppm) and its small coupling constant (J 1,2 = 3.7 Hz) indicated α-configuration of the galactosyl residue. In the COSY experiment, signals of the sugar ring protons were identified as galactopyranose, very similar to Me-α-d-Gal (25Bock K. Thogersen H. Webb G.A. Annual Reports on NMR Spectroscopy. Vol. 13. Academic Press, London1982: 1-57Google Scholar). In addition, the 13C NMR (24Jorasch P. Warnecke D.C. Lindner B. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3770-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) spectrum of F3 (Table I) further confirmed this interpretation. Besides proton sugar resonances, olefinic signals were identified from a non-resolved multiplet at ∼5.27 ppm showing cross-peaks to the allyl signals of -CH2-CH=CH-CH2 (1.975 ppm) with characteristic shape and chemical shift for E-configuration (23Sperling P. Zähringer U. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28590-28596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 25Bock K. Thogersen H. Webb G.A. Annual Reports on NMR Spectroscopy. Vol. 13. Academic Press, London1982: 1-57Google Scholar). In addition, one diagnostic signal of the methylene protons (H-11) in the α-linoleic acid (-CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-, 2.696 ppm, J 11,12 ∼ J 11,10 ∼ 6.6 Hz) and its 13C resonance (C-11, 25.53 ppm) was further in agreement with previous analyses (26Purcell J.M. Morris S.G. Susi H. Anal. Chem. 1966; 38: 588-592Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Frost D.J. Gunstone F.D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1975; 15: 53-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).

These data indicate the presence of an acylated cholesteryl glycoside, which could be confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Upon GLC-MS analysis, the unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (18:1 and 18:2) showed identical retention time and fragmentation pattern as compared with standard oleic acid (cis-Δ9-18:1) and α-lineoleic acid (cis,cis-Δ9,12-18:2) methyl esters. This interpretation was further corroborated by NMR data (see below) and MALDI-TOF MS analysis (positive ion mode), revealing pseudomolecular ions [M + Na]+ of m/z 809.6, 837.6, 835.6, and 833.9 with intensities identical to those determined by GLC-MS analysis for the different fatty acids. F2 was further investigated by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy at 600 and 90.6 MHz, respectively. The chemical shift of the anomeric signal of the hexose (H-1, δ 4.238) expressed a coupling constant J 1,2 of 7.3 Hz (Table II), thus showing β-configuration. The ring protons of the hexose could not be clearly separated, but the diagnostic coupling constants of (J 3,4 ∼ 2, J 4,5 2.9) were assigned to the β-d-galactopyranoside configuration. This interpretation was in full agreement with the 13C chemical shift data (Table III) and reference chemical shifts (28Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem.

Invaded intestinal epithelial cells are the major source of mediators recruiting the inflammatory infiltrate. To better characterize the global response of intestinal epithelial cells to Shigella invasion, Caco-2 cells were infected by an invasive isolate of S. flexneri 5a, and their transcriptome was analyzed by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) microarrays (12,000 genes) and compared with these elicited by a non-invasive Shigella mutant and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The invasive and non-invasive strains enhanced transcription of a common pattern of 240 genes, among which genes encoding isoforms of cytochrome P-450 were induced. These genes were not induced by TNF-α. Conversely, both the invasive strain and TNF-α induced a common set of 18 genes, mainly encoding proinflammatory molecules. They also induced specific sets of genes. The transcriptome induced by the invasive strain was characterized by the induction of early genes (i.e. expressed within the first 45 min of invasion) and late genes (i.e. after 60 min of invasion) whose pattern was strongly biased toward stimulation of granulopoiesis, chemoattraction, activation, and adherence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. When compared with a non-invasive Shigella and TNF-α, invasive Shigella induced a narrow transcriptome that seems to program infected epithelial cells to recruit a mucosal polymorphonuclear leukocyte to infiltrate. Dramatic increase in IL-8 gene transcription points to this chemokine as the major molecule orchestrating mucosal inflammation in shigellosis.

Dramatic increase in IL-8 gene transcription points to this chemokine as the major molecule orchestrating mucosal inflammation in shigellosis. Enteroinvasive bacteria stimulate mucosal inflammation that controls infection at the cost of severe tissue destruction. The acute recto-colitis that follows epithelial invasion by Shigella (1Mathan M.M. Mathan V.I. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 13: S314-SS318Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a Gram-negative invasive pathogen for humans and primates, is a paradigm of this process (2Sansonetti P.J. FEMS Microbiol.

In parallel, PMN achieve degradation of pathogenicity molecules and bacterial killing (5Mandic-Mullec I. Weiss J. Zychlinsky A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 110-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Weinrauch Y. Drugan D. Shapiro S.D. Weiss J. Zychlinsky A. Nature. 2002; 417: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A central theme in the study of Shigella pathogenesis is understanding the cross-talk between bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells that leads to mucosal inflammation, a topic common to the study of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Shigella may provide invaluable information by identifying common dysfunctions in signaling pathways. Recent studies point to infected intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) as major players in the inflammatory process, both as sentinels achieving bacterial sensing and as effectors producing mediators, particularly cytokines and chemokines, which initiate and orchestrate mucosal inflammation (7Jung H.C. Eckmann L. Yang S.K. Panja A. Fierer J. Morzycka-Wroblewska E. Kagnoff M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 55-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanisms of recognition of invasive pathogens by IEC are not yet fully understood. Although the signaling cascades that elicit invasion in response to bacterial invasions may also affect proinflammatory signals, current evidence indicates that recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns is likely to dominate (8Philpott D. Girardin S. Sansonetti P.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Extracellular recognition relies on Toll-like receptors (TLR) (9Kopp E.B. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), particularly TLR5, a receptor for flagellin, (10Gerwitz A.T. Simon P.O. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H.

Immun. 2000; 68: 7010-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). In the case of Shigella, which is non-flagellated, most recent evidence indicates that bacterial recognition by IEC occurs intracellularly via an “inside-in” signaling pathway involving intracellular pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition (14Philpott D.J Yamaoka S.

S., Bertin, J., Sansonetti, J. J., and Philpott, D. J. (2003) Science 300, 1584–1587. Both TLR and Nod lead to activation of the proinflammatory transcriptional factor, NF-κB (14Philpott D.J Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J.

Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that the proinflammatory potential of invaded IEC does not simply reflect NF-κB activation. The transcriptional pattern of these cells is likely to encompass a complex combination of activation and repression of several transcriptional systems. NF-κB dominates among these systems, as reflected by the release of IL-8, a common denominator to a variety of invasive microorganisms and epithelial cell types (19Eckman L. Kagnoff M.F. Fierer J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 61: 4569-4574Crossref Google Scholar). In vivo, the production of IL-8 is largely associated with infected IEC, as demonstrated in the rabbit-ligated loop model of shigellosis. In this model, neutralization of IL-8 causes massive decrease of PMN recruitment, resulting in protection of the epithelium against inflammatory destruction, but also in uncontrolled growth of bacteria in the lamina propria (20Sansonetti P.J. Arondel J. Huerre M. Harada A. Matsushima K. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in shigellosis, the innate immune response corresponds to a balance between bacterial eradication and destruction of the mucosa. IL-8 produced by IEC plays a major role in this process, although the complexities and subtleties of transcriptional regulation leading to this particular profile are currently unknown and probably vary depending on the nature of the invasive microorganism and timing of the infectious process. In addition, with time, the epithelial response is likely to increasingly reflect a response to the proinflammatory cytokines that are massively released, such as TNF-α, which plays a major role in epithelial destruction in experimental shigellosis (21D'Hauteville H. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Kussak A. Weintraub A. Mathison J. Ulevitch R.J. Wuscher N. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5240-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, when bacteria reach subepithelial tissues, they encounter other cell populations, particularly resident macrophages and recruited monocytes that will impose their own profile of response, which is dominated by CD14/TLR4 recognition of Shigella lipopolysaccharide, as shown by the dramatic changes in mucosal response observed either upon CD14 neutralization (22Wenneras C. Ave P. Huerre M. Arondel J. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3214-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or upon infection by a Shigella mutant that was genetically engineered to express a non-endotoxic lipid A (21D'Hauteville H. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Kussak A. Weintraub A. Mathison J. Ulevitch R.J. Wuscher N. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5240-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To provide a detailed analysis of the transcriptional response of IEC invaded by S. flexneri (i.e. 45 min to 4 h), we have applied the Affymetrix microarray technology. Thus, the transcriptome of the human colonic Caco-2 cell line was established upon its infection with strain M90T, which expresses an invasive phenotype, due to the presence of the 213-kb virulence plasmid (23Sansonetti P.J. Kopecko D.J. Formal S.B. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The M90T-induced transcriptome was compared with the transcriptomes obtained by infecting Caco-2 cells with strain BS176, a non-invasive, plasmid-less derivative of M90T, or by exposing cells to TNF-α. These experiments demonstrate that the transcriptome of Shigella-invaded IEC reflects the invasive phenotype and is significantly different from that induced by TNF-α in that it is almost exclusively devoted to the recruitment, activation, and adherence of PMN. This observation opens the way to studying the extent of transcriptional regulation achieved by the Nod1 cascade, upon stimulation by intracellular Shigella, and suggests that virulence proteins of Shigella, particularly those that are secreted through the type III secretory apparatus, may “remodel” this basic transcriptome. Cell Culture—The human IEC line Caco-2 derived from a colonic carcinoma (24Rousset M. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) was used in this study. Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C, 10% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acid, and antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin, respectively, 100 units/ml and 100 μg/ml). Before infection with bacteria, cells were washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in the same medium. Bacterial Strains and Infection—Two bacterial strains were used in this study: the wild-type Shigella flexneri 5a (M90T) that possesses the virulence plasmid and its plasmid-cured mutant BS176, which is non-invasive (23Sansonetti P.J. Kopecko D.J. Formal S.B. Infect. Immun. 1982; 35: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One isolated colony on Tris-buffered saline agar containing 0.01% Congo red (25Bahrani F.K. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4005-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was seeded in 7 ml of Tris-buffered saline broth for overnight culture. Before cell infection, bacteria were diluted in fresh broth for 2 h to be harvested in exponential phase of growth. Caco-2 cells were grown in 10-cm-diameter Petri dishes. To obtain an efficient cell invasion, non-confluent Caco-2 cell cultures were infected with bacteria with a multiplicity of infection of 100 bacteria/cell. After a 15-min-centrifugation at 2,000 rpm, cells and bacteria were incubated for 45 min and then washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and reincubated for 75 or 195 min with 50 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria. As confirmed by Giemsa staining, more than 70% of the cells were regularly infected. Preparation of mRNA and Hybridization on Affymetrix Chips—Following washing in cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed, and the total RNA was extracted by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Integrity and purity of RNA were checked by spectrophotometry and capillary electrophoresis, using the Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 LabChip kit from Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA). cDNA were synthesized using Superscript Choice system (Invitrogen). Biotin-labeled-cRNA was then synthesized with the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Biochem, New York, NY). After purification with Rneasy columns (Qiagen), 12.5 μg of fragmented cRNA were hybridized to an HG-U95Av2 array (Affymetrix), and the chips were automatically washed and stained with streptavidine-phy-coerythrin using a fluidics station. Finally, the arrays were scanned at 570 nm with a resolution of 3 μm/pixel, using a GeneArray scanner from Agilent Technologies. Analysis of Results—In the Affymetrix technology (26Lipshutz R.J. Fodor S.P. Gingeras T.R. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1847) Google Scholar), 25-mer oligonucleotides are directly synthesized on the glass slides. For each gene sequence, 16–20 different oligonucleotides are present, and for each oligonucleotide, the perfect match is the exact homology of the gene selected, whereas for the mismatch, the nucleotide in position 13 is wrong. For the analysis, two versions of MicroArray Suite from Affymetrix were used, MAS4.0 (27Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar) and MAS5.0 (28Hubbell E. Liu W.-M. Mei R. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 1585-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Expression algorithms compute two main metrics for each transcript, the absolute or detection call (present, marginal, or absent) determining whether the transcript is reliably detected by the probe array and the average difference or signal reflecting the relative level of expression of the transcript. In the first experiments, the fluorescence obtained was analyzed using MAS4.0 software, based on empirical algorithms. A normalization factor (the scaling factor) was applied, and then after background substraction and statistical comparison of the hybridations between perfect matches and mismatches, the presence or absence of the gene was provided, thus constituting the absolute call (present, marginal, or absent). Then the average difference, directly related to the expression of the transcripts, was determined. The comparative analysis, also performed by MAS, allowed the comparison between two samples, one used as baseline (in our case, the non-infected) and the experiment (infected with invasive or non-invasive bacteria). This analysis indicated whether there was a change in gene expression between the two samples. This was provided as the change call (increase, marginal increase, decrease, marginal decrease, or no change) and also by the -fold change (between the signal of the experimental sample and of the baseline sample). With MAS 5.0, the empirical algorithms are replaced by statistical algorithms; the major difference between the two versions of the software is that in the comparative analysis, the -fold change is shown as a logarithmic scale. The clustering analysis with Data Mining Tool (DMT version 3.0) of the microarray experiment allowed the identification of gene expression patterns. One of the methods used was the correlation coefficient clustering algorithm, which finds probe set patterns that have similar shapes. Three steps are successively performed for finding clusters of similar probe set patterns: (i) filtering to remove patterns mostly related to noise, (ii) seeding to define the expression patterns of the clusters using a nearest neighbor approach, and (iii) clustering to group patterns that are close to the cluster shape define in the previous step. Detection of Protein Expression—Caco-2 cells were infected with Shigella, as described above, in 12-well culture plates. At different time points (60, 120, 240, and 360 min), culture media were centrifuged (1,500 rpm, 10 min), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests for immunodetection of IL-8 and CXCL1 chemokines were performed, following the supplier's recommendations (Quantikine®, R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Chemokine concentrations were determined from the standard curve provided in the detection kit. The experiments were performed twice in duplicate. Patterns of Gene Expression in Non-infected and Shigella-infected Human Colonic Caco-2 Cells—To enable evaluation of the reproducibility among different experiments, 4–5 independent microarray hybridization experiments were performed either on non-infected cells or on cells infected by the wild-type strain M90T or on cells infected by its non-invasive plasmid-less derivative, BS176. Only half of the12,000 human genes displayed on the Affymetrix U95A chip were expressed by Caco-2 cells, based on the absolute calls determined by MAS software provided by Affymetrix for data analysis. The method of analysis by correlation coefficient clustering, using the nearest neighbor approach, provided by DMT allowed us to visualize the gene expression patterns by creating plots. Using this method, 18 different clusters were created, and the two most representative plots were designated Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, as shown in Fig. 1. Cluster 1 encompasses genes whose transcription was up-regulated by both M90T and BS176, and Cluster 2 encompasses genes whose transcription was up-regulated by M90T, but not by BS176, i.e. genes whose up-regulation reflected the IEC response to the Shigella invasive phenotype. The number of genes in each cluster was the result of the three steps involved in the correlation coefficient clustering analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” It should be noted that the other analysis performed, comparative analysis with MAS or T-test analysis provided by DMT, gives the same regulated genes. As we cannot shown in this manuscript all the methods used to analyze the data presented here, we only shown the clustering analysis because it is the most convenient to visualize distinct gene expression pattern. Moreover, no significant down-regulation of gene transcription was observed in this series of experiments. Cluster 1, Genes Up-regulated during a 2-h Infection with either M90T or BS176 —We identified a total of 240 genes whose transcription was up-regulated, regardless of the expression of the invasive phenotype by Shigella. Considering that a plasmid-less Shigella is devoid of any specific pathogenic factor (i.e. no adherence-invasive capacity, no protein secretion) and that the species has lost expression of flagella, a major stimulus eliciting a proinflammatory program in IEC via TLR5 recognition (11Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar), the cell response might reflect (i) the recognition of bacteria-associated molecular patterns (i.e. lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, lipoproteins) as well as (ii) the stress response to metabolic products released by infecting bacteria and to the conditions of competition for essential nutrients. Table I shows genes whose ratio of transcriptional up-regulation by Shigella infection, normalized to the background expression in non-infected cells, was over 1.5 with at least one of the two infecting organisms and with a significant absolute call. This ratio was computed from results obtained in four independent samples of cells infected by M90T or BS176 and five independent samples of non-infected cells. Data presentation in Fig. 1 has been organized according to sets of genes reflecting similar functions.

Open table in a new tab The pattern of gene expression was dominated by up-regulation of genes involved in cell detoxification processes, such as several isoforms of cytochrome P-450 (CYP) with ratios of up-regulation between 3- and 8-fold and aldehyde-dehydrogenase (∼5-fold) (29Sophos N.A. Pappa A. Ziegler T.L. Vasiliou V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130–132: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, genes regulating cell survival and proliferation were also induced, such as those encoding the caspase-like apoptosis-regulating protein (Clarp, Ref. 30Inohara N. Koseki T. Hu Y. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10717-10722Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), amphiregulin (31Piepkorn M. Pittelkow M.R. Cook P.W. J. Invest.

Physiol. 1998; 175: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), two EGF-related growth factors produced by epithelial cells that function as autocrine/paracrine factors activating cell proliferation. Both molecules are ligands for the EGF receptor (31Piepkorn M. Pittelkow M.R. Cook P.W. J. Invest. Derm. 1998; 111: 715-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the VIP receptor gene (34Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis O. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) may follow this logic of a protective program since VIP acts as a neuroendocrine mediator that not only stimulates water and electrolyte secretion in the gut but also promotes growth and proliferation of normal and malignant cells. Increased transcription of DNA repair genes, such as exonuclease Rec1 (35Schmutte C. Sadoff M.M. Kang-Sup S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33011-33018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and photolyase (36Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), probably also reflects this protective program. Concerning inflammation, it is interesting to note that within the 2-h period of infection, no evidence for induction of a proinflammatory program was observed, with the exception of the gene encoding IFN-γ treatment-inducible protein (37Fan X.D. Stark G.R. Bloom B.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 1922-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transcriptional induction of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ is a very stimulating observation since this nuclear receptor has been shown to elicit a potent anti-inflammatory signal (38Desreumaux P. Dubuquoy L. Nutten S. Peuchmaur M. Englaro W. Schoonjans K. Derijard B. Desvergnes B. Wahli W. Chambon P. Leibowitz M.D. Colombel J.-F. Auwerx J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In summary, BS176 induces a transcriptome reflecting a program of cell protection and survival and possibly of antiinflammation. This basic program was also induced by M90T, although as shown below, a proinflammatory program reflecting expression of the invasive phenotype quickly prevailed. Cluster 2, Genes Up-regulated during a 2-h Infection with M90T—Following a 2-h infection, we identified a total of 72 genes whose increased transcription was specifically related to expression of the invasive phenotype by Shigella. Table II reports genes whose transcriptional induction over non-infected cells showed a ratio superior to 1.5.Table IIGenes up-regulated during infection of Caco-2 cells with M90T, the invasive strain of S. flexnerCategory of genesAccession numberaThese accession numbers are GenBank™"
https://openalex.org/W2019440050,"Integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations are initiated by Cdc42 and Rac1 but little is known about mechanisms by which integrins activate these Rho GTPases. 14-3-3 proteins are adaptors implicated in binding and regulating the function and subcellular location of numerous signaling molecules. In platelets, the 14-3-3ζ isoform interacts with the glycoprotein (GP) Ibα subunit of the adhesion receptor GP Ib-IX. In this study, we show that integrin-induced activation of Cdc42, activation of Rac, cytoskeletal reorganizations, and cell spreading were inhibited in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing full-length GP Ibα compared with GP Ibα lacking the 14-3-3ζ binding site. Activation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal reorganizations were restored by expression of 14-3-3ζ. Spreading in cells expressing truncated GP Ibα was inhibited by co-expressing a chimeric receptor containing interleukin 2 receptor α and GP Ibα cytoplasmic domain. These results identify a previously unrecognized function of 14-3-3ζ, that of mediating integrin-induced signaling. They show that 14-3-3ζ mediates Cdc42 and Rac activation. They also reveal a novel function of platelet GP Ib-IX, that of regulating integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations by sequestering 14-3-3ζ. Signaling across integrins initiates changes in cell behavior such as spreading, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, or cell division. Thus, introduction of the 14-3-3ζ binding domain of GP Ibα into target cells might provide a method for regulating integrin-induced pathways in a variety of pathological conditions.

The 14-3-3 family of proteins are expressed in all eukaryotic cells. There are at least seven highly conserved isoforms encoded by different gene products. These proteins have molecular weights of 29,000–32,000 and bind numerous cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling molecules including signaling molecules such as Raf, protein kinase C, p130Cas, BAD, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (1Fu H.

Interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with signaling molecules can localize, activate, inhibit, or stabilize the target molecules.

Platelets contain high levels of the ζ, β, and γ isoforms and lower levels of the ϵ and η isoforms of 14-3-3 (2Wheeler-Jones C.P.D. Learmonth M.P. Martin H. Aitken A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The only isoform that has been shown to interact with GP Ibα is 14-3-3ζ. This interaction was first identified when a 29-kDa protein was found to copurify with GP Ib-IX from platelet membrane extracts (23Du X. Harris S.J. Tetaz T.J. Ginsberg M.H. Berndt M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18287-18290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein sequencing of internal fragments of the protein revealed that it was 14-3-3ζ. Subsequent studies have shown interaction between GP Ibα and 14-3-3ζ in a two-hybrid system (24Calverley D.C. Kavanagh T.J. Roth G.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 1295-1303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shown that 14-3-3ζ and GP Ib-IX interact in platelet lysate (14Du X. Fox J.E.B. Pei S. J. Biol.

Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Studies with CHO cells expressing GP Ib-IX complex with truncated forms of GP Ibα have shown that truncation of the C-terminal 19 amino acids of GP Ibα abolishes 14-3-3ζ binding to the GP Ib-IX complex (14Du X.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the use of synthetic peptides has located the binding site to the C-terminal five amino acids of GP Ibα (14Du X. Fox J.E.B. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). When GP Ib-IX binds to vWf, signals are induced across the adhesion receptor. One consequence of this signaling is activation of intracellular signaling pathways leading to activation of αIIbβ3, the β3-containing integrin that mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation (25Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Ruggeri Z.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 611: 611-616Google Scholar, 27Savage B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16779-16787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The finding that 14-3-3ζ interacted with the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα raised the possibility that 14-3-3ζ might serve to recruit signaling molecules involved in transmission of these signals from the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα. However, studies in which the GP Ib-IX complex containing full-length or truncated GP Ibα were expressed in CHO cells suggested that the GP Ib/14-3-3ζ interaction is not required for transmission of the signals that convert CHO cell αvβ3 from an inactive form to a form that can bind immobilized vWf (28Zaffran Y.

Integrins are another family of adhesion receptors that transmit signals upon ligand binding. Evidence from in vitro binding assays has suggested that 14-3-3 may also interact with the cytoplasmic domain of these adhesion receptors. In one study, β1- and β3-integrin subunits bound to 14-3-3β in a two-hybrid screen (29Han D.C. Rodriguez L.G. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In another study, 14-3-3αβ and 14-3-3ζδ in leukocyte extracts bound to phosphopeptides with the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of the β2-integrin (30Fagerholm S. Morrice N. Gahmberg C.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1728-1738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although there has been no clear evidence that any isoform of 14-3-3 interacts directly with integrin in intact cells, 14-3-3β has been reported to colocalize with β1-integrin in human foreskin fibroblasts spreading on fibronectin (29Han D.C. Rodriguez L.G. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The adhesion-induced signals transmitted across integrins induce cytoskeletal reorganizations that lead to cell spreading and migration and regulate pathways involved in development, inflammation, wound repair, cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis (31Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2822) Google Scholar, 32Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown that the integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations are initiated by the Rho GTPases, Cdc42, and Rac (33Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 34Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Whereas mechanisms by which these GTPases are recruited and activated following transmission of signals across other families of receptors have been well characterized, little is known about the way in which signals transmitted through integrin cytoplasmic domains activate these Rho GTPases. In the present study, we considered the possibility that 14-3-3ζ might be involved in mediating integrin-induced Rho GTPase activation. To investigate this possibility we sequestered endogenous 14-3-3ζ in CHO cells, observed the functional consequences on integrin-induced signaling, and then expressed additional 14-3-3ζ to determine whether normal integrin-induced events were restored. The approach that we used to sequester 14-3-3ζ was to express GP Ib-IX in CHO cells. Normal CHO cells spreading on an integrin substrate extended filopodia and membrane ruffles and eventually formed well spread cells filled with stress fibers. However, if the GP Ib-IX complex was present, integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations were inhibited. Cells expressing GP Ib-IX complex containing a truncated form of GP Ibα, which lacked the 14-3-3ζ binding site, spread normally and normal cytoskeletal reorganizations occurred. Overexpression of 14-3-3ζ in cells in which endogenous 14-3-3ζ had been sequestered by GP Ib-IX restored cell spreading. Sequestration of 14-3-3ζ inhibited integrin-induced Cdc42 and Rac activation; overexpression of 14-3-3ζ restored GTPase activation. These studies describe a previously unrecognized function of 14-3-3 proteins. They show that 14-3-3ζ has a critical role in inducing the cascades of signaling reactions that occur as integrins mediate cell adhesion. They show that 14-3-3ζ mediates step(s) upstream of Cdc42 and Rac activation. In addition, the studies show that the 14-3-3ζ binding domain on the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα can inhibit integrin-induced Cdc42 and Rac activation by a mechanism that involves sequestration of 14-3-3ζ. Thus, introduction of the 14-3-3ζ binding domain of GP Ibα into target cells might provide a method for regulating integrin-induced events such as migration, cell division, differentiation, or apoptosis in a variety of pathological conditions. Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics (Invitrogen). Cells were stably transfected with the cDNA encoding GP Ibβ, GP IX, and full-length or truncated GP Ibα as previously described (35Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The truncated form of GP Ibα was generated by introducing a stop codon at position 591 of the cytoplasmic domain of GP Ibα, utilizing Stratagene's Double Take double-stranded mutagenesis system (35Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The resulting protein lacked the C-terminal 19 amino acids. Expression of GP Ib-IX on the cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometric analysis using a monoclonal antibody against GP Ibα (Immunotech, Westbrook, ME). In some experiments, cells expressing truncated GP Ib-IX were cotransfected with a chimeric receptor consisting of IL2Rα extracellular and transmembrane domains linked to the GP Ibα cytoplasmic domain (kindly provided by Dr. Xiaoping Du, Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois, College of Medicine, Chicago, IL) along with pSV2-hph. Cells co-transfected with IL2Rα lacking a cytoplasmic domain were used as a control (kindly provided by Dr. Susan LaFlamme, Center for Cell Biology and Cancer Research, Albany Medical College, Albany, NY). Membrane expression of IL2Rα was assessed using flow cytometry after staining of the cells with a monoclonal antibody against IL2Rα (Immunotech). A FACScan flow cytometer was used for flow cytometry analysis (BD Biosciences, Advanced Cellular Biology, San Jose, CA) as described previously (36Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14693-14699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For transient transfection of an HA-tagged 14-3-3ζ construct encoded in the vector pCMV5 (kindly provided by Dr. Charles Abrams, Hematology-Oncology Division, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), cells were transfected for 3 h with 3 μg of the construct and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml botrocetin (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland) in serum-free media and plated on Lab-Tek glass chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) that had been previously coated with 5 μg/ml vWf (American Diagnostics, Greenwich, CT) and saturated with 3% bovine serum albumin (35Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In some experiments, as described in the text, suspensions of cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 4 mm Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide (Sigma) or 2 mm EDTA, prior to plating. The cells were fixed at various time points, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and stained as previously described (35Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol.

Actin filaments were stained with 1 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). For analysis of cells transiently expressing HA-tagged 14-3-3ζ, transfected cells were allowed to recover for 48 h in serum-containing medium. Cells were then replated onto vWf-coated dishes for 2 h and subsequently examined by immunofluorescence. Actin filaments were detected with TRITC-labeled phalloidin and HA-tagged 14-3-3ζ detected with monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) against HA epitope followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS-NT laser scanning confocal microscope as described previously (37Meyer S.C. Sanan D.A. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3013-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cell area measurement was performed using Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Data were presented as the mean ± S.D. and were compared using Student's t test. Biochemical Assay of Activated GTPases in CHO Cell Lysates—GST-p21 binding domain of PAK (PBD) was produced in DH5α cells transformed with pGEX plasmid containing PBD cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Martin Schwartz, Department of Microbiology, Cardiovascular Research Center, Mellon Prostate Cancer Research Center, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) and subsequently bound to glutathione-coupled agarose beads (Sigma) as previously described (38Ren X. Kiosses W. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). CHO cells were plated on vWf in the presence of botrocetin for 45 min, scraped off the dishes, and lysed in an ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 8 min and supernatants were incubated with GST-PBD beads for 45 min. Beads were washed four times in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris, protease inhibitors, 1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Proteins bound to the beads were solubilized by addition of an electrophoresis buffer containing 3% SDS and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and Western blots were prepared. Western Blot Analysis—For analysis of 14-3-3 isoforms normally expressed in CHO cells, cells were solubilized in an electrophoresis buffer containing 3% SDS and 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 10 min, electrophoresed through SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 10% polyacrylamide, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by standard Western blotting techniques (39Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against 14-3-3 α, β, γ, and ζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (Amersham Biosciences). To quantitate the amount of HA-tagged 14-3-3ζ in CHO cells transiently expressing this protein, Western blots of whole cell extracts were probed with a monoclonal antibody against HA epitope (Roche Diagnostics) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (Amersham Biosciences). For analysis of Cdc42 or Rac in whole cell extracts or activated Cdc42 or Rac bound to GST-coupled beads, Western blots were probed with monoclonal Cdc42 or Rac antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes on Western blots were detected by incubating the membranes with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing them to Kodak X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Quantitation of antigen-antibody complexes was performed by NIH Image 1.62 software. Western Blots to Identify 14-3-3 Isoforms Expressed in CHO Cells—To determine which isoforms of 14-3-3 were expressed in the CHO cells used for the studies, Western blots of whole cell extracts were probed with antibodies against 14-3-3 β, γ, and ζ. Examination of the blots showed that 4-3-3β, 14-3-3γ, and 14-3-3ζ were present (data not shown). Effect of the Cytoplasmic Domain of GP Ib-IX on Integrin-induced Signaling—GP Ibα interacts with 14-3-3ζ in platelets; it also interacts with CHO cell 14-3-3ζ when transfected into these cells (23Du X.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) retains its interaction with its other known binding partner, actin-binding protein (35Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but fails to interact with 14-3-3ζ (25Gu M. Xi X. Englund G.D. Berndt M.C. Du X. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the function of 14-3-3ζ in CHO cells, we transfected cells with cDNA for full-length GP Ibα or m591. Because GP Ibα is not efficiently expressed in the membrane of CHO cells unless all three subunits of the GP Ib-IX complex are present (40Lopez J.A. Leung B. Reynolds C.C. Li C.Q. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12851-12859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also transfected the cells with cDNA for GP Ibβ and GP IX. FACS analysis revealed that comparable amounts of full-length and truncated protein were expressed (Fig. 1). Many integrins cannot bind extracellular ligands until intracellular signals “activate” the integrins by inducing clustering or conformational changes (41Woodside D.G. Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Activation can be induced by signals transmitted across a variety of cytokine or adhesion receptors (41Woodside D.G. Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In platelets, activation is induced by signals transmitted as GP Ib-IX binds vWf (42De Marco L. Girolami A. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7424-7428Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that binding of vWf to GP Ib-IX expressed in CHO cells also induces signals that activate endogenous CHO cell integrins, converting them from a form that cannot interact with vWf to one that can (28Zaffran Y. Meyer S.C. Negrescu E. Reddy K.B. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16779-16787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These signals are transmitted across GP Ib-IX whether the GP Ibα cytoplasmic domain contains the 14-3-3ζ binding site or not (35Cunningham J.G. Meyer S.C. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Interaction of activated integrin with vWf activates pathways that induce cytoskeletal reorganizations, changes in cell shape, and cell spreading (28Zaffran Y. Meyer S.C. Negrescu E. Reddy K.B. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16779-16787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that 14-3-3ζ is involved in integrin-induced signal transmission by determining whether integrin-induced cytoskeletal reorganizations were different in cells expressing full-length GP Ibα (which sequesters CHO cell 14-3-3ζ) compared with cells expressing GP Ibα that lacked the 14-3-3ζ binding site. Cells were plated on vWf and allowed to spread for up to 2 h. As reported previously (28Zaffran Y. Meyer S.C. Negrescu E. Reddy K.B. Fox J.E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16779-16787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the initial adhesion of the cells was induced by GP Ib-IX as shown by inhibition of adhesion by antibodies against GP Ibα, whereas the spreading resulted from activation of integrins and signaling across ligand-occupied integrin, because RGDS, EDTA, and antibodies against αvβ3 inhibited cell spreading. Spreading was markedly inhibited in cells expressing full-length GP Ibα as compared with truncated GP Ibα (Fig. 2). The area of cells expressing full-length GP Ibα was 59% of the area of the cells expressing truncated GP Ibα after 20 min of spreading, 62% after 40 min, and 45.7% after 120 min of spreading (Fig. 3). The area of 100 cells was measured for each cell line and each time point. Typically, spreading of cells on integrin substrates leads to actin polymerization and formation of various actin filament organizations. The earliest changes are induced by Cdc42, which causes localized polymerization of filaments that push membranes outwards in fine filopodia (43Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3746) Google Scholar). Activation of Rac subsequently causes the formation of networks of submembranous filaments and the extension of lamellipodia (43Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3746) Google Scholar, 44Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar). At later times, activation of RhoA leads to the formation of stress fibers that mediate the stable attachment of spread cells (43Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3746) Google Scholar, 45Ridley A.J. Hall A.

https://openalex.org/W2076056873,"In Volvox carteri adults, reproductive cells called gonidia are enclosed within a spherical monolayer of biflagellate somatic cells. Embryos must ""invert"" (turn inside out) to achieve this configuration, however, because at the end of cleavage the gonidia are on the outside and the flagellar ends of all somatic cells point inward. Generation of a bend region adequate to turn the embryo inside out involves a dramatic change in cell shape, plus cell movements. Here, we cloned a gene called invA that is essential for inversion and found that it codes for a kinesin localized in the cytoplasmic bridges that link all cells to their neighbors. In invA null mutants, cells change shape normally, but are unable to move relative to the cytoplasmic bridges. A normal bend region cannot be formed and inversion stops. We conclude that the InvA kinesin provides the motile force that normally drives inversion to completion."

In previous work, we demonstrated that RNAP can exist in an unactivated state that catalyzes synthesis slowly and an activated state that catalyzes synthesis rapidly, with the transition from the unactivated to the activated state being induced by the templated NTP binding to an allosteric site on the RNAP. In this work, we investigate the effects of downstream DNA sequences on the kinetics of single nucleotide incorporation. We demonstrate that changing the identity of the DNA base 1 bp downstream (+2) from the site of incorporation (+1) can regulate the catalytic activity of RNAP. Combining these data with sequence and structural analyses and molecular modeling, we identify the streptolydigin-binding region (Escherichia coli β residues 543–546), which lies across from the downstream DNA, as the putative allosteric NTP binding site. We present a structural model in which the NTP binds to the streptolydigin loop and upon pairing with the +1 DNA base in the unactivated state or the +2 DNA base in the activated state facilitates translocation via a ratchet motion.

Transcription regulation can occur through accessory proteins that bind to RNAP and through particular sequence elements in the DNA or RNA chains that interact with the RNAP. These interactions dictate the rate and fidelity of RNA synthesis. During the elongation phase of transcription, RNAP can exist in multiple states or conformations. In particular, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNAPs have been shown to exist in slow or fast states of synthesis, and the distribution between these states is central to the regulation of transcription (1Foster J.E.

Pause and termination signals are multipartite and depend on a nascent RNA hairpin, the 3′-proximal region of the DNA, the 3′-RNA nucleotide, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), and the DNA sequence downstream from the 3′-end of the RNA (11Landick R.

In fact, downstream DNA and the 3′-proximal regions appear to play important roles in the formation of a paused complex (12Chan C.L. Wang D. Landick R. J. Mol.

Interestingly, changing the DNA downstream adjacent to pause and termination sites can affect their pause and termination efficiencies (14Lee D.N. Phung L. Stewart J. Landick R. J. Biol.

Even subtle single base pair changes in this downstream DNA can strongly affect these efficiencies (21Telesnitsky A. Chamberlin M.J.

As such, it is important to identify and examine downstream DNA sequences that may be important in the regulation of transcription elongation. In this report, we investigate the effects of downstream sequences on the detailed kinetics of nucleotide incorporation.We have previously presented compelling evidence for the existence of an allosteric binding site on Escherichia coli RNAP that is specific for the incoming NTP (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Binding of the templated NTP to the allosteric site shifts RNAP from an unactivated (slow) to an activated (fast) state. We demonstrated that the kinetics of nucleotide addition to the RNA chain follows a non-essential allosteric activation mechanism where nucleotide addition can occur in either the fast or slow states, with the transition to the fast state being induced by nucleotide binding to the allosteric site (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The allosteric site provides a means of regulation for the enzyme by “trapping” complexes into the slow state in the absence of or at low concentrations of the correct NTP.To assess the effects of downstream DNA sequences on the non-essential allosteric activation model and, therefore, on the distribution between the slow and fast states, we have constructed mutant DNA templates and examined the effects of different downstream DNA sequences on the rate of nucleotide addition to the RNA chain. We demonstrate that the DNA sequence 1 bp downstream of the site of incorporation (+2) can affect the rate of nucleotide incorporation. Functionally, these data implicate a conserved loop on the β subunit as being important in elongation. Detailed sequence and structural analyses reveal that this loop could comprise the allosteric nucleotide binding site. Combining our kinetic data with molecular modeling, we present a model for nucleotide synthesis and RNAP translocation involving this loop.MATERIALS AND METHODSSources of Protein and DNAHis-tagged RNAP was purified from log phase cells of strain RL916 (gift of R. Landick) as described previously (24Uptain S.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13548-13553Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The DNA templates were prepared from pDE13 (wild type template) (2Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and amplified by PCR. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene was used to obtain all of the DNA template mutants from the pDE13 template or the A27c template. After plasmid purification of the mutants, the one or more mutations were confirmed by analysis at an automated DNA sequencing facility at the University of North Carolina. All of the DNA templates were biotinylated on one end, were 540 nucleotides in length, contained the λPR promoter, and coded for a transcript in which the first cytosine is at +25.In Vitro Transcription ReactionsRNAP (60 nm) and 5′-biotinylated DNA template (60 nm) bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were incubated 10 min at 37 °C in 1× TB (30 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm Mg+2 glutamate, 200 mm K+ glutamate, 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) to form open complexes. Complexes stalled at +24 were formed by adding 15 μm UTP, 20 μm ATP, and 20 μm [α-32P]GTP (150 Ci/mmol) and incubating at room temperature for 1 min. The complexes were washed seven to ten times using ice-cold 1× TB by holding the reaction tube next to a strong magnet to retain the complexes. The complexes were then resuspended in ice-cold 1× TB. In some experiments, the complexes were then kept on ice until used in the rapid kinetic experiments. In most of the experiments, 10 μm CTP was added to “walk” the complexes to +25 at room temperature, and then the complexes were purified again after 1 min as described above and kept on ice until used in the rapid kinetic experiments. The rapid kinetic experiments were performed at room temperature (∼23 °C), using a KinTek Rapid Quench Flow apparatus. For each time point, 20 μl of the purified elongation complexes was injected into one reactant loop, and 20 μl of the designated NTP(s) was injected into the other reactant loop. The reactants were mixed for the indicated times and subsequently quenched with 0.5 m EDTA. Each time point represents a separate experiment. To assure that the results were not dependent on the length of time the complexes remained on ice, time points were taken in different orders. At designated times during the reactions, a portion of the purified elongation complexes was removed and extended to full-length by the addition of 1 mm of all four NTPs (chased) to establish that the complexes were still active. The NTP concentrations reported are final concentrations after mixing in the quench flow. Prior to running the samples on 8 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels, the EDTA was removed from the complexes with the aid of a magnet as described above, and the products were resuspended in 100% formamide.Data AnalysisQuantification and Normalization of Rate Data—The amount of radioactivity in each lane of the gel was measured on an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant software. The percentage of complexes at each position on the template was calculated by dividing the amount of radioactivity in the indicated band by the total amount of radioactivity in all the bands ≥24 nucleotides in length. To compare data from different experiments, it was necessary to normalize the data such that at 0 time, there was 0% incorporation, and, upon completion, there was 100% incorporation. The data were normalized to 100% by dividing each time point by the highest percentage of complexes that incorporated beyond either +24 or +25, as described previously (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The experiments were conducted two to six times for each concentration.Fits of the Kinetic Data to the Mechanism—For both the wild type and A27c templates, each data set was fit to both single- and double-exponential equations. The quality of the double-exponential fits was significantly better than that of the single-exponential fits, because the data were clearly biphasic. The data from the double-exponential fits of the individual rate curves were used as a starting point to obtain initial values for binding constants to the catalytic and allosteric sites and the rate constants for the unactivated and activated states as previously described (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Dynafit (26Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) was used to attempt to fit the data to the previously described non-essential allosteric activation mechanism in which all NTP binding steps were assumed to be in rapid equilibrium (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All [ATP] were fit simultaneously, and all binding constants and the polymerization rate constants were allowed to vary over several orders of magnitude. Despite these procedures, we were not able to find a single set of constants that produced reasonable fits to the data for all [ATP] using the published mechanism. This result is not surprising, because this mechanism does not account for the biphasic nature of the kinetics.To fit the biphasic curves, we needed to refine the mechanism (see text). Fig. 2A shows the fewest number of changes that could be made to the mechanism that would allow it to fit the biphasic data. We fit the data to this new mechanism both by computer using Dynafit (26Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar) and by hand using KinSim (27Anderson K.S. Sikorski J.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7395-7406Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) as previously described (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The rapid equilibrium-binding step to the allosteric site after the catalytic site is filled (gray reaction arrows) was removed. Simulations performed using KinSim (27Anderson K.S. Sikorski J.A. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7395-7406Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) demonstrated that including this step with all possible permutations of the constants destroyed the biphasic nature of the curves produced; therefore, it was essential to remove this step. The only rapid equilibrium step that remained was K allos (Fig. 2, A and B). Nucleotide binding to the catalytic site was no longer a rapid equilibrium step. There may have been a conformational change that occurred just before these binding steps; however, we could not observe it.Construction of Model Shown in Fig. 7 (A and B)The structures of Thermus thermophilus RNAP and the yeast RNAP II elongation complex were aligned in InsightII. The nucleic acids were removed from the RNAP II structure and placed into the T. thermophilus structure. All of the magnesium ions were removed from the T. thermophilus structure except for the ones near β residue 326 and at the catalytic site. This complex was then minimized using CNSsolve to remove any bad contacts. A UTP that would base pair with the +1 downstream DNA base (ATP) was then built using Sybyl and docked in to the model of the elongation complex. This complex was then minimized using Sybyl to remove bad contacts between the UTP and its binding loop. The same procedure was used to make a model with Thermus aquaticus RNAP.Fig. 7Model of the proposed allosteric NTP binding site and the ratchet mechanism of translocation. A, a stereo view of the overall allosteric NTP binding site in comparison with an ATPase. The graphic on the left is the putative allosteric NTP binding region. DNA bases are shown in stick form with a ribbon backbone, and tubes represent protein. The F helix is cyan, the β sheet is light green, the helices flanking the β sheet are pink, the proposed NTP binding loop is orange, the rifampicin regions that flank the loop are purple and blue, the allosteric NTP (a UTP here to base pair with the +1 (adenosine) base in the DNA) is space-filled in green, the DNA template is yellow (+1, +2, and +3 downstream bases are magenta (space-filled), green, and gray, respectively), the RNA transcript is red, and the magnesium (space-filled) chelated by D326 (red) is magenta. The allosteric NTP lies on top of the loop poised to base pair with the +1 DNA base. The γ-phosphate is chelated by the magnesium. The β sheet lies on top of the NTP binding site. The graphic on the right is taken from the crystal structure of the E. coli arsenite-translocating ATPase (60Zhou T. Radaev S. Rosen B.P. Gatti D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4838-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The representations are similar to the ones for the proposed NTP binding region on RNAP. The tubes represent protein. The ADP molecule is space-filled in green and lies on top of the orange loop. The β sheet is light green, and the helices flanking the β sheet are pink. The magnesium ion is shown as the space-filled magenta sphere and is chelated by several arginine residues (red). A comparison of the overall architecture of this ATPase with the proposed NTP binding region of RNAP shows that several of the motifs found in NTP-binding proteins are conserved in this region of RNAP. B, ratchet model of translocation. The view of the allosteric NTP binding region from a is rotated to the left by about 90°. The representations and color scheme are the same as in a. The connection of the rifampicin domains to the proposed NTP binding loop (orange) is clearly visible. The proximity of the rifampicin domains to the upstream RNA and DNA is evident. Arrows show the direction of movement that would occur upon translocation. Any movement in the putative P-loop would have a clear effect on the movement of the rifampicin domain and, therefore, on the movement of the RNA-DNA hybrid, resulting in a “ratcheting” type of translocation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequence and Structural AlignmentsThe alignments shown in Fig. 5 were first done using Vector NTI. These alignments were then checked by superimposing the structures of T. thermophilus, T. aquaticus, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II in InsightII. The specific areas that were analyzed are those that are described in Fig. 5. It was then discovered that these alignments were not correct and that the previously published alignments (28Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) were not correct. The Vector NTI alignments were then corrected accordingly based on the observed structural alignments.Fig. 5Sequence alignments of relevant portions of the β subunit. RNAP sequences from several prokaryotic (E. coli, T. aquaticus, T. thermophilus, B. subtilis, and Salmonella) and eukaryotic (RNAP II) (S. cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, mouse, and human) organisms are aligned as described under “Materials and Methods.” The consensus sequence is shown at the bottom. Important residues are boxed in black and labeled underneath. The disordered region of the S. cerevisiae RNAP II crystal structures is boxed in red. The β sheet sequence is shown at the top, and the loop region is shown in the bottom two panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAll experiments were performed on the DNA templates shown in Fig. 1. In all of these templates, the first cytosine to be incorporated is at position +25 (2Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). By omitting CTP from the initial transcription reaction, stable elongation complexes stalled at position +24 were generated. The NTPs were purified away from these complexes, and the purified complexes were used to measure the kinetics of correct nucleotide incorporation using rapid kinetic techniques. We have characterized the kinetics of adenosine incorporation at position +26 on each of these templates.Fig. 1RNA transcript sequences of the DNA templates employed in this study. The sequences shown are the RNA transcript sequences, and the numbers above the sequences correspond to the transcript number. Only the first 40 nucleotides of the sequence are shown. The mutations were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Blue letters indicate the mutation made from the DE13 template, and magenta letters indicate the mutation made from the A27c template. A, sequences of single base pair mutations; B, sequences of double base pair mutations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Refining the Kinetic Mechanism of Nucleotide Incorporation—Previously, we demonstrated the existence of an allosteric binding site by measuring the kinetics of CMP addition at position +25 and of AMP addition at position +26 on the DE13 template (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We characterized the kinetics of CMP addition at position +25 as a function of [CTP] (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The data were fit to a non-essential activation mechanism, in which the substrate acts both as a substrate and an allosteric effector. In this model, a rapid equilibrium between the activated (fast) and unactivated (slow) states was assumed. Although this mechanism (Fig. 2A and Ref. 1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) is sufficient to describe the concentration dependence of the kinetics, it can not reproduce the biphasic nature of the kinetic curves at intermediate concentrations of CTP, because the rapid equilibrium assumption produces single-exponential kinetics. Because the rate of synthesis in the slow state and the fast state differ by only ∼30-fold, single exponentials were sufficient to get reasonable fits. To further characterize the kinetic mechanism, we investigated the kinetics of AMP addition at position +26 as a function of [ATP] on the DE13 template and several variants of it.As can be seen from inspection of the data in Fig. 3, double-exponential fits were required to obtain reasonable fits to the kinetic data for AMP incorporation at position +26. The enhanced biphasic nature of the kinetic data at position +26 relative to position +25 results from greater differences between the rates of synthesis in the slow and fast states. The biphasic nature of the curves indicates that there is not a rapid equilibrium between the activated (fast) and unactivated (slow) states as was previously assumed (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, we were not able to find a set of rate and binding constants that could fit the data at all ATP concentrations using the previous mechanism. Accordingly, we set out to modify this rapid equilibrium non-essential activation mechanism to accommodate these new data. Fig. 2A shows one of the two simplest kinetic mechanisms that could fit the data. In this mechanism, like the previous one, there is still a rapid binding equilibrium of the templated NTP to the allosteric site; however, unlike the previous one, NTP binding to the catalytic site is not in rapid equilibrium, and once an NTP became bound in the catalytic site there is not a rapid equilibrium between the unactivated (E n:S C) and activated (E *n:S A:S C) states. The rapid equilibrium binding of the NTP to the allosteric site is required, because if binding were slow, a fast synthesis rate would not occur, and if dissociation of the NTP from the allosteric site were slow, all of the complexes would end up in the fast state. In contrast, if NTP binding to the catalytic site were in rapid equilibrium, biphasic kinetics would not be observed.Fig. 3Rates of AMP incorporation using different templates. The plots show the percentage of complexes appearing at position +26 as a function of time. Data for reactions at 5 μm ATP concentration are shown. The data are clearly biphasic, and the curves through the data are double-exponential fits. All reactions go to completion within 30 s. A, rates for wild type and single mutants. The rates of nucleotide incorporation are slower for the A27c and A27u templates. B, rates for double mutants and A27c. The rates of nucleotide incorporation are slow (similar to that of the A27c template) for all templates but the wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inspection of Fig. 4 (A and B) reveals that the new mechanism (Fig. 2A) could fit the data for all [ATP] (for position +26) and all [CTP] (for position +25) (taken from Ref.1Foster J.E.

Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), with a single set of rate and binding constants for each template position (shown in Table I). This mechanism fits the data for position +25 better than the previously published mechanism (Fig. 4B) (1Foster J.E. Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As a result of the better fits, we were able to fit more data sets for position +25 to this non-equilibrium non-essential activation mechanism than to the previous mechanism.Fig. 4Fits of the data to the kinetic mechanisms shown in Fig. 2 (A and B).

https://openalex.org/W2037699648,"The pacemaker channels HCN2 and HCN4 have been identified in cardiac sino-atrial node cells. These channels differ considerably in several kinetic properties including the activation time constant (τact), which is fast for HCN2 (144 ms at –140 mV) and slow for HCN4 (461 ms at –140 mV). Here, by analyzing HCN2/4 chimeras and mutants we identified single amino acid residues in transmembrane segments 1 and 2 and the connecting loop between S1 and S2 that are major determinants of this difference. Replacement of leucine 272 in S1 of HCN4 by the corresponding phenylalanine present in HCN2 decreased τact of HCN4 to 149 ms. Conversely, activation of the fast channel HCN2 was decreased 3-fold upon the corresponding mutation of F221L in the S1 segment. Mutation of N291T and T293A in the linker between S1 and S2 of HCN4 shifted τact to 275 ms. While residues 272, 291, and 293 of HCN4 affected the activation speed at basal conditions they had no obvious influence on the cAMP-dependent acceleration of activation kinetics. In contrast, mutation of I308M in S2 of HCN4 abolished the cAMP-dependent decrease in τact. Surprisingly, this mutation also prevented the acceleration of channel activation observed after deletion of the C-terminal cAMP binding site. Taken together our results indicate that the speed of activation of the HCN4 channel is determined by structural elements present in the S1, S1-S2 linker, and the S2 segment.

HCN4 is highly expressed in the sino-atrial node.

DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S. Tibbs G. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that crucial components for the activation of HCN channels are within the S1, S1-S2 linker, S2, and S6 C-terminal regions (19Ishii T.M. Takano M. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. 2001; 537.1: 93-100Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Chen S. Siegelbaum S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Exchanging these regions between HCN1 and HCN4 slows down and speeds up, respectively, the activation kinetics of these channels (19Ishii T.M. Takano M. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. 2001; 537.1: 93-100Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To observe these effects, several parts of the channels had to be exchanged together, presumably because the difference between HCN1 and HCN4 is rather pronounced as can be seen not only from the basic activation kinetics but also from their different reaction to intracellular cAMP. The different responses to cAMP have been analyzed by HCN1/HCN2 chimeras (18Wainger B. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S. Tibbs G. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Chen S. Siegelbaum S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly to the HCN1/HCN4 chimeras, parts of the C terminus and some as yet unknown transmembrane elements accounted for the activation kinetic differences. The channel subtype-specific cAMP modulation of the activation kinetics was always transferred with subtype-specific parts of the C terminus. Although HCN2 and HCN4 differ considerably in their activation kinetics, they share a relative high sequence homology and are both modulated by cAMP in the same way. In preliminary experiments, we found that the difference in the speed of activation between HCN2 and HCN4 was independent of the binding of cAMP to the C-terminal CNBD. This result suggested that just a short sequence may be responsible for this inherent difference between HCN2 and HCN4. HCN2 and HCN4 consist of 889 and 1203 residues, respectively (8Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The difference is primarily due to the significantly longer C terminus of HCN4. In the transmembrane region S1-S6, the homology of the human HCN2 and HCN4 is 90%, leaving only a few amino acids that could account for the differences in activation kinetics not modulated by the influence of the N- and C-terminal regions. We identified 5 amino acid residues in the S1-S2 region that contribute to the activation kinetics of HCN2 and HCN4. One of these amino acids is responsible for the difference in activation kinetics between HCN2 and HCN4. Molecular Biology—Human HCN2 and HCN4 cDNAs were originally cloned from the atrioventricular node region of a human heart (8Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). HCN2/4-chimeric channel mutants, and site-directed mutations were constructed in the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) using polymerase chain reaction and restriction sites. Briefly, the Bsu36I-BspLU11I-fragment of HCN4 or HCN2 (a Bsu36I restriction site had been introduced into the HCN2 sequence as a silent mutation at nt 537–543) was replaced by DNA fragments, generated in several overlap PCR steps, which contained the desired sequences and mutations. The correctness of the mutant channels and introduced point mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Nomenclature of Mutant Channels—Chimeras are named according to this nomenclature: H4, HCN4-wild type; H2, HCN2-wild type. First wild type in italics is the backbone. Second wild type in italics is the channel from which certain transmembrane segments or amino acids have been introduced into the first wild type. Bold numbers inbetween: transmembrane segments that have been exchanged. Superior or smallcap numbers in between: Single amino acids (numbering from the “backbone”-wild-type HCN) that have been exchanged. Thus, for example H4 1–2 H2 is a chimeric HCN4 channel that contains the transmembrane segments 1 and 2 from HCN2. H4 267 / 272 H2 is the HCN4 channel in which the amino acids 267 and 272 (HCN4 numbering) have been replaced by the respective amino acids from HCN2, in this example the two leucines have been exchanged for two phenylalanines. In Fig. 7, the classical nomenclature for point mutations is used since only leucine at position 272 in HCN4 has been exchanged for several other amino acids (L272X). Deletion of the C-terminal region of some channels (... ΔC) was achieved by exchanging the nucleotides encoding amino acid 535 for a STOP codon (E535STOP, HCN4 numbering) leaving a C terminus of only 14 amino acids, which lacks the CNBD. Consult Supplement Table 1, A–D for the exact crossover points and amino acid numbering for all chimeric channels. Functional Expression and Electrophysiology—HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding either wild-type or mutant HCN channels using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions (transfectant/DNA-ratio: 3/1 v/w). Cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and kept at 37 °C, 6% CO2. Currents were recorded 2–3 days after transfection with the whole cell patch recording technique at a temperature of 23 ± 1 °C. The extracellular (bath) solution contained (in mm): 120 NaCl, 20 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The intracellular (pipette) solution contained (in mm): 10 NaCl, 30 KCl, 90 K-Asp, 1 MgSO4, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. For determination of the effect of cAMP on the wild-type and mutant channels (“+ cAMP”), 100 μm cAMP (Roche Applied Science) was added to the intracellular solution. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had a resistance of 2–5 MΩ when filled with intracellular solution. Data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp7-software (Axon Instruments) and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter (LPBF-48DG, npi). The membrane potential was held at –40 mV. To elicit inward currents, step pulses of 5 s duration were applied from –140 mV to –30 mV, followed by a step to –140 mV as described in Fig. 1. For some raw data displays, longer or shorter pulses were applied to more clearly demonstrate the differences in activation kinetics between the (mutant) channels, but these measurements were not included into the voltage-dependent steady-state evaluation to obtain V max½. Further analysis was done offline with the Origin 6.0 software (Microcal). Time constants of activation (τact) were obtained by fitting the current traces of the –140 to –100 (–90) mV steps after the initial lag with the sum of two exponential functions y = A1e(–x/t1) + A2e(–x/t2), where τ1 and τ2 are the fast and slow time constants of activation, respectively; τ1 is consequently referred to as τact since the slow component (A2) of HCN channel activation generally accounts for <10% of the current amplitude; thus, the fast component is the major if not the exclusive kinetics-determining component of the HCN channels as has been discussed in Refs. 9Ishii T.M.

Physiol. 2001; 537.1: 93-100Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar. To obtain voltage dependent steady-state activation curves, tail currents measured immediately after the final step to –140 mV were normalized by the maximal current (I max) and plotted as a function of the preceding membrane potential. The curves were fitted with the Boltzmann function in Equation 1, (I-Imin)/(Imax-Imin)=(A1-A2)/(I+e(V-Vmax12)/k)+A2(Eq. 1) where I min is an offset caused by a nonzero holding current and is not included in the current amplitude, V is the test potential, V max½ is the membrane potential for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. All values are given as mean ± S.E.; n is the number of experiments. Statistical differences were determined using Student's unpaired t test; p values <0.05 were considered significant. HCN2 and HCN4 Differ in Their Activation Kinetics—For both human HCN2 and HCN4 channels expressed in HEK293 cells, non-inactivating inward currents upon hyperpolarizing steps can be measured (Fig. 1A). In addition, both channels are modulated by intracellular cAMP (Fig. 1B). Application of 100 μm cAMP shifted significantly the steady-state activation curves toward more positive potentials. The shift for both channels is about +13 mV resulting in V max½ of –86.3 mV and –84.9 mV for HCN2 and HCN4, respectively, compared with –98.7 mV and –99.1 mV without cAMP. The differences in V max½ between HCN2 and HCN4 are not significant. The slope factor k is generally larger for HCN4 (10.1 versus 7.8 for HCN2, without cAMP) meaning that HCN4 is activated over a more extended range of potentials around V max½. Determination of the activation time constants (τact) reveals a major difference between HCN2 and HCN4, as has been described earlier (8Ludwig A. Zong X. Stieber J. Hullin R. Hofmann F. Biel M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar): At a potential range from –140 to –100 mV, HCN2 is activated 3-fold faster than HCN4 (Fig. 1C). For both channels, τact is decreased by cAMP. At –140 mV, cAMP decreases τact for HCN4 from 461 to 165 ms, and τact for HCN2 from 144 to 91 ms. However, this difference becomes less dramatic if the relative change in τact induced by cAMP is evaluated. At –140 mV, τact decreases 2.8-fold and 1.6-fold for the HCN4 and HCN2 channel, respectively. This relation (± 0.4 for both) is maintained over the range of activation potentials from –140 to –100 mV. But even though τact for both channels are much faster in the presence of cAMP, there still remains an about 2-fold difference in τact between HCN2 and HCN4 that cannot be explained by a difference in the extend of the cAMP-induced conformational change. The C- and N-terminal Regions Do Not Account for the Inherent, cAMP-independent Difference in Activation Kinetics of HCN2 and HCN4 —Previously, it was reported that cAMP-dependent differences between HCN1 and HCN2 (17Chen S. Wang J. Siegelbaum S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 491-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 20Wang J. Chen S. Siegelbaum S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or HCN1 and HCN4 (19Ishii T.M. Takano M. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. 2001; 537.1: 93-100Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) depended on the nature of the C terminus. To test this possibility, we successively exchanged the N and C termini between HCN2 and HCN4 and determined τact with and without cAMP. Fig. 2A shows the main results for HCN4: H4 NC H2, i.e. HCN4 with both N and C terminus including the CNBD from HCN2, is still activated slowly (τact at –140 mV = 466 ms, compared with 461 and 144 ms for HCN4 and HCN2, respectively). This chimera is still modulated 2.2- to 3.5-fold by cAMP. The same results were obtained when only the N terminus (H4 N H2) or the C terminus (H4 C H2) were exchanged (data not shown). In addition, deleting the whole C terminus except for 14 amino acids adjacent to the S6 segments (H4ΔC) results in a channel that is activated almost exactly as fast as the cAMP-modulated HCN4 (τact at –140 mV = 177 ms compared with 165 ms for HCN4 + cAMP). In accordance with the report of Wainger et al. (18Wainger B. DeGennaro M. Santoro B. Siegelbaum S. Tibbs G. Nature. 2001; 411: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) that cAMP releases the inhibition exerted by binding to the C terminus, cAMP has no further stimulating effect on τact of the H4ΔC chimera. As for HCN4, the activation kinetics of HCN2 is not influenced by exchange of the N or C terminus (Fig. 2B) indicating that the slow activation kinetics of HCN4 is not transferred with its long C terminus. Deletion of the HCN2 C terminus 14 or 50 amino acids after S6 did not yield functional channels supporting the notion that the C terminus of HCN2 is essential for basic channel activity in addition to mediating cAMP-dependent regulation of channel functions. From these results, we concluded that the inherent difference in τact has to lie some-where in the transmembrane region. The Difference in Activation Kinetics Lies in the S1-S2 Transmembrane Region—Next, we constructed chimeras in which we exchanged the transmembrane regions between HCN2 and HCN4 to find the regions responsible for the difference. As can be seen in Fig. 3, replacing the S1-S2 region of HCN4 with the HCN2 counterpart (H4 1–2 H2) results in a faster activating channel with τact matching τact of HCN2. Applying cAMP accelerates this mutant channel to the same extend as the HCN2 wild type. Indeed, all mutant HCN4 channels that contain at least the S1-S2 region of HCN2 (H4 1–6 H2, H4 1–4 H2, H4 1–2 H2) show this fast activation. Interestingly, both H4 1 H2 and H4 2 H2 chimeras, in which only S1 or S2 plus the S1-S2 linker have been exchanged, also show faster activation kinetics. However, τact of H4 2 H2 is significantly slower than τact of HCN2 wild type (198 versus 144 ms at –140 mV, without cAMP; p < 0.05). In fact, τact of H4 2 H2 is within the cAMP-induced activation range of HCN4. H4 1 H2 on the other hand is as fast as HCN2 (τact at –140 mV = 135 versus 144 ms, without cAMP) and is accelerated by cAMP to almost the same extend as HCN2 (τact at –140 mV = 103 versus 91 ms; p > 0.05). The S1-S2 reverse chimera H2 1–2 H4 (Fig. 3, last row) in which the S1-S2 region of HCN4 has been introduced into HCN2 confirms the kinetic modulating function of this element: τact of H2 1–2 H4 is slow and matches quite exactly τact of HCN4, (462 versus 461 ms, and 194 versus 165 ms at –140 mV, without and with cAMP, respectively). Fig. 4 compares the electrophysiological behavior of the H4 1–2 H2 and H2 1–2 H4 chimeras. Both mutants are yielding inward currents comparable in size to the wild-type channels, but with activation kinetics of H4 1–2 H2 resembling HCN2 and H2 1–2 H4 resembling HCN4. The difference in τact between the chimeras and their respective wild-type channels is present over the whole range of activation potentials (–140 to –100 (–90) mV). The changes in τact are not the result of a changed steady-state voltage dependence (Fig. 4C). There is no shift in the activation curves. The V max½ do not differ significantly between any of the mutant and wild-type channels. A Single Amino Acid in S1 Accounts for the Inherent Kinetic Difference of HCN2 and HCN4 —The sequence comparison of the S1-S2 segment of HCN2 and HCN4 revealed five differing amino acids: two in S1, two in the S1-S2 linker and 1 in S2 (Fig. 5A). These five amino acids were replaced singly or together in the HCN4 channel by the corresponding amino acids from the HCN2 channel (Fig. 5, B and C). Leucine 272 plays a major role in controlling the activation kinetics. Replacing leucine 272 by phenylalanine (H4 272 H2, Fig. 5C, 6th row) results in an HCN2-like, fast activating channel whereas replacing leucine 267 by phenylalanine (H4 267 H2, 8th row) has no effect on activation kinetics. The double mutant that is identical to H4 1 H2 has the kinetics as chimera H4 272 H2 (Fig. 3). τact of H4 272 H2 is 149 ms at –140 mV compared with 144 ms for HCN2. In addition, the mutant channel is modulated by cAMP like HCN2 with a τact of 106 ms at –140 mV compared with 91 ms for the wild-type channel (p > 0.05). Deletion of the C terminus of H4 272 H2 results in a functional, fast activating channel with an activation time comparable to that of HCN2 plus cAMP, suggesting that the element for the inherent activation kinetics has been transferred with the mutation L272F. The importance of this amino acid is also shown by the reverse chimera. Replacing the phenylalanine 221 in HCN2 by leucine (amino acid 272 in HCN4 corresponds to amino acid 221 in HCN2) results in a significantly slower activating channel (τact = 353 ms for H2 221 H4 versus 144 ms for HCN2). This value is close to the activation range of HCN4 being 461 ms in the absence of cAMP (Figs. 5C, 9th row and 6A). In addition, activation of H2 221 H4 is accelerated 2.5–3-fold by 100 μm cAMP, a characteristic feature of the wild-type HCN4 channel (see Fig. 1 and above). As already shown for the S1-S2 chimeras (Fig. 4), exchanging the amino acids of S1 did not result in a left or right shift of the steady-state activation curves that could simply account for the changes in activation kinetics at a given potential (data not shown).Fig. 6Current traces of Leu-272 and Ile-308 chimeras.

This chimera is identical with the mutations of H4 291/293/308 H2 (see Fig. 3). This exchange results in a faster, but not quite HCN2-like fast activating channel. Replacing both amino acids of the linker together (H4 291/293 H2, Fig. 5C) yields a channel activating still faster than HCN4, but slower than H4 291/293/308 H. Replacing amino acids 291 and 293 individually (H4 291 H2 = N291T and H4 293 H2 = T293A) results in channels with activation kinetics not much different from HCN4. Finally, replacing amino acid 308 (H4 308 H2) results in a channel apparently activating even slower than the wild-type HCN4 channel (τact 507 versus 461 ms at –140 mV, p = 0.06). Interestingly, all the chimeras in which parts of the S1-S2 linker and/or S2 were mutated show an altered cAMP response. Most notably, the H4 308 H2 chimera can no longer be modulated by cAMP (τact 507 ms versus 520 ms at –140 mV without and with cAMP, respectively). Furthermore, deleting the C terminus of this mutant (H4 308 H2ΔC, Fig. 5C, second but last row and Fig. 6B) does not yield a fast activating channel as can be observed after deletion of the C terminus of the HCN4 wild-type channel (H4ΔC, Figs. 2A and 5C, last row and 6B). These phenotypes were observed for all chimeras at a voltage range from –140 mV to –100 (–90) mV (Fig. 6) ruling out that the differences in activation time constants were caused by an alteration of the voltage dependence of these channels. These results suggest, that isolated mutations in the S1-S2 linker and S2 segment interfere with the proper activation of HCN4 channels, independently from the presence or absence of cAMP or a C terminus. However, these effects are not present, if the corresponding mutation(s) is done in the S1 segment. All mutant channels show inward currents comparable in size to the wild-type HCN channels (50–250 pA/pF). The exchange of amino acid 272 between HCN2 and HCN4 changes HCN4 into an HCN2-like channel and vice versa with respect to the activation kinetics (Fig. 6A). Exchanging amino acid 308 in HCN4 for the respective amino acid of HCN2 channel does not alter significantly the basic activation kinetic of the channel, but renders it unresponsive to cAMP. Structural Requirements Determining the Effect of Amino Residue 272 of HCN4 —In a last set of experiments, we examined to which extent other amino acids can mimic the effect of phenylalanine at postion 272 in HCN4. We replaced leucine 272 with methionine, tryptophan, and alanine. Methionine is the amino acid found in HCN1 at the respective position, tryptophan is an aromatic, strongly hydrophobic amino acid like phenylalanine and alanine is a neutral amino acid with a short side chain. Methionine at position 272 is not able to speed up the activation of HCN4 (Fig. 7) supporting the previous notion (19Ishii T.M. Takano M. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. 2001; 537.1: 93-100Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that the activation speed of HCN1 depends on several factors including the S1-S2 transmembrane region and part of the S6 C-terminal region. A tryptophan at position 272 was able to accelerate the activation of the HCN4 channel significantly (τact at –140 mV: 186 versus 461 versus 144 ms, H4 272W versus HCN4 versus HCN2, respectively) (Fig. 7, B and C). However, introduction of tryptophan flattened the activation curve (k = 15.9 versus 10.1 for HCN4) and shifted the steady-state activation curve toward more positive potentials (V max½ = –90.8 versus –99.1 mV for HCN4). These changes could at least partly account for a faster τact at a potential of –140 mV (Fig. 7D). Replacement of leucine 272 by alanine had only a minor effect on τact (345 versus 461 ms, H4 272A versus HCN4) and induced a less pronounced shift of the steady-state activation curve without changing the slope factor (V max½ = –94.0 mV, k = 9.9). Both, the H4 272F (= H4 272 H2) and H4 272M mutations did not result in significant changes of V max½ (–99.1 mV and –101.4 mV, respectively). The slope factor of H4 272M is 10.2, thus equaling that of HCN4. The k value of H4 272F is shifted toward the HCN2 value (8.4 versus 7.8). HCN2 and HCN4 are structurally closely related pacemaker channels that are distributed partly in the same, partly in different tissues where they may have different functions (10Moosmang S.

A. 2002; 99: 9533-9537Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A characteristic difference of the two channels is their different speed of activation. Part of this difference is carried by their different responsiveness to intracellular cAMP, but apart from this, there is also an inherent difference in activation kinetics rendering HCN4 the slower activating channel. It has been suggested that the molecular basis for this inherent difference resides somewhere in the transmembrane region. In order to find this region, we constructed chimeric HCN4/2 channels. As a basic principle, we tried to turn HCN4 into a mutant channel with the activation kinetics of HCN2, i.e. we tried to speed up the activation of HCN4. We were able to demonstrate that several residues in the S1-S2 transmembrane region determine the activation kinetics of HCN2 and HCN4 channels. A Single Residue in the S1 Segment Determines the Difference in Activation Speeds—The amino acid at position 272 in the S1 segment of HCN4 is responsible for the difference in the inherent activation kinetics of HCN2 and HCN4. Exchanging this residue between the two channels transfers the activation kinetics to the respective other channel. Especially, HCN4 with a phenylalanine, the respective residue in HCN2, instead of a leucine at position 272 is activated almost exactly as fast as HCN2. The responsiveness to cAMP in this mutant channel is comparable to HCN2. Thus, we conclude that this single residue determines the distinct cAMP-independent activation time constant of HCN2 and HCN4. Replacement of leucine 272 by tryptophan, an aromatic and hydrophobic amino acid like phenylalanine, had a similar effect on the activation time of HCN4: The speed of activation was significantly increased and the response to cAMP was maintained. However, this mutant channel did not exactly result in an HCN2-like channel since the voltage dependence of activation was shifted toward more positive activation potentials indicating that tryptophan is not sufficient to preserve proper gating in HCN4. Although alanine at position 272 had no effect on the activation kinetic it affected as tryptophan the voltage dependence of activation supporting the notion that gating of HCN4 is rather sensitive to the nature of the amino acid at position 272. Methionine, the corresponding amino acid of the HCN1 channel, had no effect on the activation kinetics of HCN4. In agreement with Ishii et al. (19Ishii T.M. Takano M. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. 2001; 537.1: 93-100Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we had to replace the whole S1-S2 segment plus parts of the S6 C-terminal region to change HCN4 into an HCN1-like channel with regard to activation speed (data not shown). The need for this large replacement is not too surprising, if we consider that the effect of cAMP on the activation kinetics of HCN1 is rather modest compared with its effect on HCN4. Ishii et al. (19Ishii T.M. Takano M. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. 2001; 537.1: 93-100Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) already concluded that the functional and structural differences between HCN4 and HCN1 are pronounced and that exchanging single residues in the S1-S2 regions of HCN1 and HCN4 did not markedly affect activation kinetics. The inability of alanine or methionine to change the speed of activation indicates that other parts of the HCN4 channel must contribute to its slow activation time constant. HCN3, an HCN channel, which activates faster than HCN4 but considerably slower than HCN2 (10Moosmang S. Stieber J. Zong X. Biel M. Hofmann F. Ludwig A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1646-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) has a leucine at the position corresponding to 272. SPIH, an HCN channel from sea urchin testis (25Gauss R. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), also has a leucine at the corresponding position but is activated faster than the HCN4 channel. These considerations support the notion that additional elements are needed to affect fast or slow opening gating. Single Residues in the S2 Segment and in the S1-S2 Linker Influence cAMP Modulation—Replacing the S1-S2 linker and the S2 segment in HCN4 with the respective parts from HCN2 together renders the mutant channel almost as rapidly activated as HCN2 (H4 291/293/308 H2, Fig. 5C). However, activation is only weakly accelerated by cAMP and τact of the mutated channel is never faster than τact for the cAMP-modulated HCN4 channel. Replacing those three amino acids individually reveals the same principle: The activation time constants of the mutant channels are always within the HCN4 range and the responsiveness to cAMP is limited and even abolished as in the case of the I308M mutation. Most likely, Ile-308 interacts with Leu-272 since the negative effect of the single mutation I308M on cAMP decreased activation time is surmounted if the mutation L272F is combined with I308M. Interaction between these two amino acids are apparently also necessary to increase the activation speed by removal of the C terminus. The presented results show that mutation of the three amino acids in the S1-S2 linker and S2 segment do not contribute to the inherent τact difference between HCN2 and HCN4. Rather, the mutant channels are HCN4-like channels, which are arrested in some rigid state that does not relax if the conformation of the inhibitory C-terminal region is modulated by cAMP. In conclusion, the basic, cAMP-independent and -dependent activation kinetics of HCN2 and HCN4 channels reside in the S1-S2 transmembrane region. Residue 272 of the S1 segment determines the difference in activation kinetics between HCN2 and HCN4 whereas residues 291 and 293 of the S1–2 linker and 308 of the S2 segment are important for the proper activation gating of these HCN channels. Disrupting the structure in any of the described positions by inserting unsuitable residues results in functional but incorrectly gated channels. The relative ease with which the basic kinetic properties of HCN2 can be transferred to HCN4, and considering that these basic kinetic properties determines the function of the respective channel in its native environment, suggests that mutations occurring in the described segments of the HCN channels could be associated with diseases based on improper pacemaker activities such as certain cardiac arrhythmias (14Ludwig A.

There is increasing risk of misuse of infectious agents, such as Yersinia pestis, as weapons of terror as well as instruments of warfare for mass destruction. Because the phosphatase activity of the Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase, YopH, is essential for virulence in the Yersinia pathogen, potent and selective YopH inhibitors are expected to serve as novel anti-plague agents. We have identified a specific YopH small molecule inhibitor, p-nitrocatechol sulfate (pNCS), which exhibits a Ki value of 25 μm for YopH and displays a 13–60-fold selectivity in favor of YopH against a panel of mammalian PTPs. To facilitate the understanding of the underlying molecular basis for tight binding and specificity, we have determined the crystal structure of YopH in complex with pNCS at a 2.0-Å resolution. The structural data are corroborated by results from kinetic analyses of the interactions of YopH and its site-directed mutants with pNCS. The results show that while the interactions of the sulfuryl moiety and the phenyl ring with the YopH active site contribute to pNCS binding affinity, additional interactions of the hydroxyl and nitro groups in pNCS with Asp-356, Gln-357, Arg-404, and Gln-446 are responsible for the increased potency and selectivity. In particular, we note that residues Arg-404, Glu-290, Asp-356, and a bound water (WAT185) participate in a unique H-bonding network with the hydroxyl group ortho to the sulfuryl moiety, which may be exploited to design more potent and specific YopH inhibitors.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; pNCS, p-nitrocatechol sulfate; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; Yops, Yersinia outer membrane proteins.1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase; pTyr, phosphotyrosine; pNCS, p-nitrocatechol sulfate; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; Yops, Yersinia outer membrane proteins. are involved in the regulation of numerous cell functions including growth, differentiation, motility, cell-cell interactions, metabolism, gene transcription, and the immune response (1Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 2Zhang Z.-Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In vivo, tyrosine phosphorylation is a reversible and dynamic process. The phosphorylation states of proteins are governed by the opposing actions of protein tyrosine kinases, which catalyze protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and PTPs, which are responsible for dephosphorylation. Hundreds of protein kinases and protein phosphatases and their substrates are integrated within an elaborate signal-transducing network. The defective or inappropriate operation of this network is at the root of such wide-spread diseases including cancers and diabetes.The importance of PTP regulation in cellular function was highlighted by the identification of a PTP in the pathogenic bacteria Yersinia (3Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The genus Yersinia comprises three species of bacteria that are causative agents in human diseases ranging from gastrointestinal syndromes to bubonic plague (4Bulter T. Wyngaarden J.B. Smith L.H. Textbook of Medicine. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1985: 1600-1603Google Scholar). Yersinia pestis is the pathogen responsible for the bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, because it reduced the population of Europe by ∼25 million in the 15th century (4Bulter T. Wyngaarden J.B. Smith L.H. Textbook of Medicine. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA1985: 1600-1603Google Scholar). Credible estimates of the number of people killed by this bacterium during the course of human history approach 200 million (5Brubaker R.R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Although plague has long been considered a “vanquished” disease, the recent outbreak of the pneumonic plague caused by Y. pestis in Surat, India (6Jayaraman K.S. Nature. 1994; 371: 467Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) proves that its biological potential can be expressed under appropriate environmental conditions. Despite efforts to eradicate the disease, it has recently been recognized by the World Health Organization as a re-emerging public health concern. In addition, there is increasing risk of misuse of infectious agents, such as Y. pestis, as weapons of terror as well as instruments of warfare for mass destruction (7McGovern T.W. Christopher G.W. Eitzen E.M. Arch. Dermatol. 1999; 135: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, there is an urgent need to devise effective protective strategies that could be implemented soon after a bioterrorist attack.Pathogenic Yersinia contain a plasmid that encodes several of the bacterial virulence factors known as Yops (Yersinia outer membrane proteins) (8Portnoy D.A. Wolf-Watz H. Bolin I. Beeder A.B. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 108-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Yops is correlated with the capacity of the bacterium to avoid host defense mechanisms (9Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, one of the virulence factors, YopH, is homologous to eukaryotic PTPs with potent tyrosine phosphatase activity (3Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In fact, YopH is the most active PTP characterized to date (10Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Fischer M.W.F. Hume D.M. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23759-23766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yopH gene is obligatory for pathogenesis as plasmids that have a nonfunctional yopH gene are avirulent (11Bolin I. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Michielis T. Cornelis G. Microb. Pathogen. 1988; 5: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Straley S.C. Bowmer W.S. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 445-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, conversion of the essential cysteine residue to alanine in YopH abolishes the PTP activity in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and eliminates the virulence of the bacterium in a murine infection model (14Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 15Bliska J.B. Clemens J.C. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the Yersinia PTP activity is essential for the bacterial pathogenicity.Bacteria do not contain tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (16Foster R. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The fact that YopH possesses PTP activity and is essential for pathogenicity suggests that it mediates a novel mechanism of bacterial pathogenesis. YopH may act on target pTyr-containing proteins within infected eukaryotic cells to disrupt the normal signaling pathways and to disarm the immune responses. Indeed, production of YopH during Yersinia infection is associated with dephosphorylation of proteins in human epithelial cells and murine macrophages (14Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 15Bliska J.B. Clemens J.C. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. J. Exp.

Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Two of the major cellular targets of the Yersinia PTP have been identified as the focal adhesion kinase and the focal adhesion protein p130Cas (19Black D.S. Bliska J.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2730-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 20Persson C. Carballeira N. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2307-2318Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Because YopH is known to cause inhibition of phagocytic uptake of Yersinia and oxidative burst by cultured macrophages (18Andersson K. Carballeira N. Magnusson K.-E. Persson C. Stendahl O. Wolf-Watz H. Fallman M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21Rosqvist R. Bolin I. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2139-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bliska J.B. Black D.S. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 681-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the YopH-mediated dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and p130Cas or related proteins is probably of importance for the ability of the Yersinia to escape the host immune response.Because the PTP activity of YopH is essential for the virulence of Yersinia, specific inhibitors targeted to the Yersinia PTP are expected to render the bacteria avirulent. Thus, potent and specific inhibitors for the Yersinia PTP could serve as effective agents to block the spread and proliferation of Y. pestis infection. In this paper, we describe the identification of a specific small molecule YopH inhibitor, p-nitrocatechol sulfate (pNCS). We present the crystal structure of YopH in complex with pNCS solved to a 2.0-Å resolution. Finally, we report the binding interactions between YopH and pNCS probed with a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies. Together, our results reveal the structural basis of pNCS selectivity for YopH and lay the groundwork for the design of more potent and specific YopH inhibitors that may serve as powerful anti-plague agents.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—p-Nitrocatechol sulfate (2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl sulfate) was purchased from Sigma. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluke Co. All of the other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade available commercially.Protein Purification—The catalytic domain (residues 163–468) of YopH was expressed and purified as described previously (10Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Fischer M.W.F. Hume D.M. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23759-23766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was further purified using hydrophobic chromatography. The catalytic domain of CD45 and LAR (containing both D1 and D2) was expressed and purified as a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Other recombinant PTPs, PTP1B, VHR, T cell PTP, SHP1, and the N-terminal His6-tagged HePTP were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (23Shen K. Keng Y.-F. Wu L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13889-13899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of catalytic domain of Cdc14 will be published elsewhere. All of the mutants of YopH were expressed and purified using a procedure similar to the wild type enzyme.Site-directed Mutagenesis—All of the mutant forms of YopH were generated using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were from Sigma. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Determination of Kinetic Constants Using pNPP as a Substrate— PTP activity was assayed at room temperature (25 °C) in a reaction mixture (0.2 ml) containing pNPP concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 5 Km. The following buffered solution was used for activity measurements: pH 7, 50 mm 3,3-dimethyl glutarate, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and the ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted by the addition of NaCl. Initial rate measurements for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP were conducted as described previously (10Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Fischer M.W.F. Hume D.M. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23759-23766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steady state kinetic parameters were determined from a direct fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the nonlinear regression program KINETASYST (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA).Inhibition Studies—Inhibition constants were determined for the wild type and mutant PTPs by the inorganic phosphate assay (25Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.W. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature in 50 mm 3,3-dimethy glutarate buffer, pH 7, containing 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted with NaCl at various fixed concentrations of the inhibitor. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the phosphatase followed by the production of inorganic phosphate. The reaction (300 μl) was quenched after 2–3 min by the addition of 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. 62.5 μl of a mixture composed of 25 μl of 2% ammonium molybdate and 37.5 μl of 14% ascorbic acid in 50% trichloroacetic acid was then added to 75 μl of quenched solution. 1–2 min later, 125 μl of 2% trisodium citrate plus 2% sodium arsenite in 2% acetic acid was further added. The color was developed for 30 min before the absorption at 700 nm was measured. The nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by measuring the control without the addition of enzyme. The inhibition constant and inhibition pattern were evaluated using the direct curve-fitting program KINETASYST to the appropriate equations.Cocrystallization of YopH Catalytic Domain with the Inhibitor—All of the crystallization experiments were carried out at 4 °C using either hanging-drop or sitting-drop vapor diffusion. Native YopH crystals were grown as previously reported (10Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Fischer M.W.F. Hume D.M. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23759-23766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For cocrystallization, stock solutions of 40 mg/ml YopH in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol were prepared with 5 mm pNCS inhibitor. In each well, the protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of the precipitating solution (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 (Fluka)) and the mixture was equilibrated against 0.5 ml of the precipitating solution.Data Collection and Processing—Inhibitor complex crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant buffer consisting of the crystallization buffer, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm inhibitor for 30 min. After soaking, the crystals was washed in immersion oil type B several times and transferred directly to a loop and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 140 K. Diffraction from these crystals was consistent with the orthorhombic space group P212121 (a = 49.36 Å, b = 55.9 Å, and c = 97.84 Å). Data were collected to a 2.0-Å resolution using a wavelength of 0.98 Å, and 420 frames of 0.5° each were recorded on a MARCCD detector at beamline X9A of the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory). The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (26Otwinowski Z. Minow W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 176: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution—The YopH·pNCS complex crystal exhibits the same space group as the YopH·WO4 complex with a 2-Å reduction in the C axis. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the YopH·WO4 complex (27Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) without the solvent molecules and ions as the search model. All of the rotation and translation function calculations and further structure refinement were carried out by program CNS (28Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). After one cycle of rigid body refinement and simulated annealing, both 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc electron density maps showed clear density for pNCS binding to the active site of the enzyme. Subsequent refinement consisted of simulated annealing, energy minimization, and individual temperature factor refinement using all of the data from 30–2.0 Å. Model building was performed using the program O (29Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Program O, version 5.9. Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden1993Google Scholar). Composite simulated annealing OMIT maps were used to correct the model bias. R free values, Procheck, and WHAT IF were employed to ensure correct model building and stereochemistry. In the final model, the first 23 residues (163–185) and residues 389–392 of the polypeptide chain are not visible and are presumed disordered. The final model comprises 279 YopH residues, 1 pNCS molecule, and 219 ordered water molecules.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of p-Nitrocatechol Sulfate as a Specific Inhibitor for YopH—Structural and kinetic studies suggest that pTyr plays a major role in substrate binding by the PTPs, including YopH (25Zhang Z.-Y.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consequently, major efforts have been made to develop nonhydrolyzable pTyr surrogates that contain both a phosphate mimic that substitutes the phosphoryl group and an aromatic scaffold that can occupy the active site pocket in a manner reminiscent of the benzene ring in pTyr. A variety of nonhydrolyzable pTyr surrogates have been reported for the PTPs (34Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Z.-Y. Bradshaw R. Dennis E. Handbook of Cellular Signaling. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2003: 677-684Google Scholar). Because of the conserved nature of the pTyr-binding pocket, these nonhydrolyzable pTyr surrogates in general do not display any selectivity against different PTPs. However, inhibitor potency and selectivity can be achieved by incorporation of an appropriate structural element to the nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetic to target both the active site and a unique adjacent site (2Zhang Z.-Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 209-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).Because the YopH catalytic domain shares only 20–30% sequence identity with the mammalian PTPs (36Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it may seem quite feasible to acquire YopH specific inhibitors. Previous reported YopH inhibitors include suramin (37Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12281-12287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and α-ketocarboxylic acids (38Chen Y.T. Onaran M.B. Doss C.J. Seto C.T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2002; 11: 1935-1938Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, these compounds also inhibit mammalian PTPs with similar potency. As an initial effort to search for selective small molecule inhibitors for YopH, we screened several aryl phosphonate, sulfonate, and sulfate esters (Table II). The ability of these compounds to inhibit the YopH and PTP1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP was assessed at pH 7 and 25 °C (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown previously, sulfate monoesters were not hydrolyzed by the PTPs but instead inhibited the PTP reaction reversibly and competitively with respect to the substrate (Fig. 1). Similarly, the aryl phosphonate and sulfonate also inhibited the PTPs reversibly and competitively. Given the structural similarity of aryl sulfate/sulfonate/phosphonate moieties to pTyr, the competitive inhibition pattern observed for these compounds was expected. As shown in Table II, the Ki values for benzyl phosphonate, p-nitrophenyl sulfate, 2,4,6-nitrophenyl sulfate, and sulfosalicylic acid are in the millimolar range similar to the Km values for pNPP and pTyr (10Zhang Z.-Y. Clemens J.C. Schubert H.L. Stuckey J.A. Fischer M.W.F. Hume D.M. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23759-23766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Moreover, they failed to distinguish between YopH and PTP1B. This is perhaps not surprising because the majority of the invariant residues conserved in all of the PTPs from bacteria to mammals (36Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) is located in and around the enzyme active site (27Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E.

The lower affinity for 2,4,6-nitrophenyl sulfate may simply be caused by steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Remarkably, pNCS competitively inhibited YopH with a Ki of 25 μm, which ranks pNCS among the most potent pTyr mimetics identified to date. Furthermore, the Ki values of pNCS toward YopH and PTP1B differ dramatically (25 μm for YopH and 1.2 mm for PTP1B).Table IIKi values of benzyl phosphonate, p-nitrophenyl sulfate, 2,4,6-nitrophenyl sulfate, sulfosalicylic acid, and pNCS for YopH and PTP1BFig. 1The effect of pNCS on the YopH-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis. The Lineweaver-Burk plot displayed the characteristic intersecting line pattern, consistent with competitive inhibition. The experiment was performed at 25 °C and pH 7.0. pNCS concentrations were 0 (○), 30 (•), 60 (□), and 90 μm (▪), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the specificity of pNCS for YopH, its inhibitory activity toward a panel of PTPs including cytosolic PTPs, PTP1B, T cell PTP, HePTP, and SHP1, the receptor-like PTPs, CD45 and LAR, and the dual specificity phosphatases, Cdc14 and VHR, was determined. As shown in Table III, with the exception of Cdc14, pNCS acts as a competitive inhibitor for every PTP examined. In addition, pNCS is highly selective for YopH, exhibiting a 13–60-fold preference for YopH relative to all of the phosphatases examined. We recently showed that suramin, a molecule containing multiple aryl sulfonate moieties, is a competitive and reversible PTP inhibitor with Ki values in the low micromolar range (37Zhang Y.-L. Keng Y.-F. Zhao Y. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12281-12287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, suramin binds YopH and PTP1B with equal affinity. Thus, pNCS is the most specific YopH inhibitor reported to date. Considering its relatively modest structural framework, the inhibitory efficacy and specificity of pNCS for YopH is unprecedented. To determine the molecular basis for the selectivity of pNCS for YopH, we have crystallized YopH with pNCS and solved the three-dimensional structure of the complex.Table IIISelectivity of pNCS against a panel of PTPsPTPsKiMode of inhibitionμ mYopH25 ± 0.7CompetitiveSHP1750 ± 56CompetitiveHePTP1,500 ± 24CompetitivePTP1B1,200 ± 120CompetitiveTCPTP330 ± 42CompetitiveCD45500 ± 68CompetitiveLAR830 ± 270CompetitiveVHR350 ± 49CompetitiveCDC141,400 ± 60Uncompetitive Open table in a new tab Structure of YopH·pNCS Complex—Using conditions similar to those described previously (10Zhang Z.-Y.

The structure was solved by molecular replacement and was refined to an R factor of 22.6% (R free = 24.3%) for data from 30 to 2.0 Å (Table I). The final model for the YopH·pNCS complex included YopH residues 186–468 and all of the atoms in pNCS. pNCS was unambiguously fitted to well defined electron density (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the competitive inhibition pattern, pNCS occupies the YopH active site (Fig. 2B). The overall structure of YopH in the complex is quite similar to that observed in the complex between YopH and WO42- (27Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E. Zhang Z.-Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). As observed in the YopH·WO42- complex, the WPD loop (residues 351–359) adopts a closed conformation in the YopH·pNCS structure. The sulfate group in pNCS assumes the same position in the active site of YopH taken by tungstate in the YopH·WO42- complex. Consequently, the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop, residues 403–410) in YopH·pNCS is superimposable to that in the YopH·WO42- complex (Fig. 3). In the YopH·pNCS structure, the terminal nonbridge sulfate oxygens of pNCS form an extensive array of hydrogen bonds with the main-chain nitrogens of the P-loop and the guanidinium side chain of Arg-409 similar to that observed in the YopH·WO42- complex (Fig. 4A).Fig. 2The structure of YopH with pNCS bound.

We have developed a simple, sensitive (∼0.2 fmol on column) and specific GC-MS assay for the detection of 5-chlorouracil (5-ClUra), a signature product of HOCl-mediated damage to nucleobases. In this assay, 5-ClUra is released from isolated DNA by a digestion with nuclease P1, alkaline phosphatase, and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), or from chlorinated nucleosides in biological fluids by TP. The freed 5-ClUra is derivatized with 3, 5-bis-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl bromide, which is detected by negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. The assay can be used to simultaneously detect other halogenated uracils including bromouracil. Using this assay, we showed that 5-ClUra is generated by the reaction of low micromolar HOCl with (deoxy)cytidine, (deoxy)uridine, and DNA. In cell cultures, an increase of 5-ClUra was detected in DNA when cells were treated with sublethal doses of HOCl and allowed to proliferate. The elevation of 5-ClUra was markedly accentuated when physiologically relevant concentrations of (deoxy)uridine, (deoxy) cytidine, uracil, or cytosine were present in the medium during HOCl treatment. In the carrageenan-induced inflammation model in rats, chlorinated nucleosides was significantly increased, compared with controls, in the exudate fluid isolated from the inflammation site. Our study provides the direct evidence that chlorinated nucleosides are found in the inflammation site and can be incorporated in DNA during cell/tissue proliferation.

Barrette Jr., W.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 271-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, the amount of intraphagosomal production of HOCl during phagocytosis is estimated to be sufficient to exert potent bactericidal activity (4Jiang Q. Griffin D.A. Barofsky D.F. Hurst J.K. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and MPO knock-out mice are susceptible to infection (5Brennan M.L. Anderson M.M. Shih D.M. Qu X.D. Wang X. Mehta A.C. Lim L.L. Shi W. Hazen S.L. Jacob J.S. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, despite its protective role against infection, excessive HOCl released during inflammation can contribute to tissue damage. Several biomarkers specific for HOCl-caused damage have been identified. Chlorination of cholesterol gives rise to cholesterol chlorohydrin (6Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Bohrer A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 3-Chlorotyrosine, a protein oxidation marker from HOCl or molecular chorine (7Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M.

Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In addition to proteins and lipids, HOCl also oxidizes nucleobases, which are electron-rich. It has long been recognized that bleach, composed mainly of sodium hypochlorite, oxidizes uracil to 5-chlorouracil (5-ClUra) (10Pal B.C. Cumming R.B. Walton M.F. Preston R.J. Mutat. Res. 1981; 91: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Whiteman et al. (11Whiteman M. Jenner A. Halliwell B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that 5-ClUra can be produced by the reaction of HOCl with DNA, although relatively high concentrations of HOCl were used in the study. Henderson et al. (12Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) showed that under relatively acidic conditions (pH 4.5–6), HOCl, or MPO-H2O2-Cl– oxidizes cytosine mainly to 5-chlorocytosine. 5-Chlorocytosine appears to be relatively unstable and converts to 5-ClUra by spontaneous (13Chen H.J. Row S.W. Hong C.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or enzymatic deamination (14Hale J.T. Bigelow J.C. Mathews L.A. McCormack J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, 5-ClUra seems to be a specific marker of HOCl-caused damage to nucleobases in DNA. Although these in vitro studies suggest that excessive generation of HOCl may lead to an increase in 5-ClUra during inflammation, due to the lack of a suitable assay, no evidence shows that this adduct is present in DNA of living cells after an insult of sublethal doses of HOCl. Herein we describe a simple, sensitive, and reliable GC-MS assay for the measurement of 5-ClUra. Using this assay, we found that 5-ClUra can be detected in the DNA isolated from cells that were treated with sublethal doses of HOCl, or in the inflammation fluid in a rat model. Materials—Nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Thymidine phosphorylase (TP) (Sigma) was purified using a 10 kDa molecular cut-off filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA), followed by one-time washing with water and three times with 0.2 m KH2PO4 (pH 7.2), respectively. Triethylamine, acetonitrile, and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide (BTFMBzBr) were from Aldrich. RNase A and protease K were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). [D4]thymine and [15N 2,13 C]uracil were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc (Andover, MA). Sodium hypochlorite, Calf thymus DNA and other reagents were from Sigma. Synthesis of [15N2, 5-13C]chlorouracil—[15N2,13C]uracil (∼70 μmol) was added to an equimolar solution of sodium hypochorite in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and incubated at 4 °C for 25 min. 5-[15N2,13C]chlorouracil and non-reacted [15N2,13C]uracil were separated on a Supelcosil LC-18, semipreparative, reversed phase HPLC column (5-μm particle size, 10 mm × 25 cm, Supelco, Bellafonte, PA), which was washed at 1 ml/min with 50 mm ammonium acetate at pH 6.0 with 5% methanol. 5-[15N2,13C]chlorouracil was collected and dried by lyophilizer. Chemical identitiy of 5-[15N2,13C]chlorouracil was obtained by matching HPLC retention time with authentic standard and confirmed by mass spectrometry. This procedure yielded high chemical (>98%) and isotopic purity (>99%) of 5-[15N2,13C]chlorouracil. DNA Isolation—DNA was isolated from cells and tissues using a Qiagen kit (69504, Valencia, CA) or phenol-chloroform extraction. In the latter method, nuclei were isolated from tissue homogenate by a published protocol (15Wang L. Hirayasu K. Ishizawa M. Kobayashi Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1774-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), then digested with RNase A to remove RNAs, incubated with proteinase K to degrade proteins, and finally extracted with phenol and chloroform. DNA was then precipitated by ethanol in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate at pH 5.1. The amount of DNA was quantified by the picogreen assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Enzymatic Hydrolysis of DNA—20–150 μg of DNA, dissolved in 200 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.1, was digested to nucleotides by 3 μl, 3.3 mg/ml nuclease P1 under 65 °C for 10 min. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted to ∼8.0 using 40 μl of 0.1 m sodium borate at pH 8.7. Nucleosides were obtained on incubation with 2 μl of 4 units/μl alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 1 h. Thymine and 5-chlorouracil were released on incubation with 1 unit of purified thymidine phosphorylase (see “Experimental Procedures”) at 37 °C for 1 h, with the addition of 50 μl of 0.2 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). Extraction of Thymine and 5-ClUra—After enzymatic digestion, 128 pg of 5-[15N2,13C]chlorouracil and 95 ng of [D4]thymine were added as internal standards. 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added into the resulting mixture, and free bases were extracted by vigorously shaking on a vortex mixer for 30 s. After a brief centrifugation, 0.85 ml of ethyl acetate layer was collected, and the solvent was evaporated under N2. Complete dehydration of samples was achieved by further evaporation for 1 h in a speed vaccum (Savant, Farmingdale, NY). Derivatization—After extraction and drying, the residue was resuspended in 50 μl of acetonitrile, 5 μl of triethylamine, and 1 μl of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl bromide (BTFMBzBr). The resulting mixture was incubated by vigorously shaking in a G24 shaker (New Brunswick Scientific Co, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) at 37 °C for 25 min. After derivatization, 50 μl of water and 110 μl of isooctane were added. BTFMBz-5-chlorouracil and thymine derivative were extracted into isooctane by shaking vigorously on a vortex mixer for 30 s followed by a brief centrifugation. The top isooctane layer was collected and injected in a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry—One microliter of sample in isooctane was injected onto a 5890 II gas chromatograph (GC) with a 7673 autosampler (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). GC was set up in the splitless mode with a purge activation time of 1 min and split vent flow of 50 ml/min. Ultra-high purity helium (Praxair, CA) was used as the carrier gas at a linear velocity of 55 cm/s. The injection port was maintained at 280 °C. An adequate separation of thymine and 5-chlorouracil and a good peak shape were obtained on a capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter × 0.25 mm film thickness (HP-5MS), Hewlett Packard) by holding the oven at 100 °C for 1 min and then ramping to 220 °C at 20 °C/min and staying for 3 min, to 250 °C at 30 °C/min and staying for 2 min, and to 300 °Cat40 °C/min and staying for 3 min. A 5989A mass spectrometer (Hewlett Packard) was used for acquiring both electron impact (EI) and negative chemical ionization (NCI) mass spectra. EI data was obtained using an electron energy of 70 eV. NCI-MS was obtained using the following parameters: electron energy of 230 eV, ion source temperature of 250 °C, quadrapole temperature of 100 °C, high energy dynode on, and ultra high purity methane reagent gas (Matheson, Newark, CA) maintained at ion source pressure of 2.0–2.2 torr. The instrument was controlled using Hewlett Packard Chemstation 1034C version C.01.05 software. The maximum sensitivity was achieved by using the selective ion monitoring (SIM) in the NCI. In the SIM mode, m/z of 371 and 374 was used to detect and quantify BTFMBz-derivatized 5-ClUra and 5-[15N2,13C]chlorouracil. In order to measure thymine, a 2500-time dilution was made before injection and m/z at 351 and 355 was used to quantify BTFMBz-thymine and BTFMBz-[D4]thymine. The quantification was based on the ratio of the peak area of 5-ClUra and internal standard and the calibration curve. The level of 5-ClUra in DNA was expressed as the ratio of 5-ClUra and Thy (mol/106 mol). Cell Culture Experiments—Both human Hela cells and murine embryo C3H10T1/2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were routinely kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), split, and seeded with ∼60–70% confluence at 24 h before treated with HOCl. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 10–40 μm of HOCl in the Hank's Balanced Saline solution (HBSS) at 37 °C for 10–30 min and then immediately harvested. In other experiments, after HOCl treatment, cells were replenished by DMEM with 5% FBS, or cells were treated with HOCl in DMEM with 5% FBS, and then further incubated for 24 h before harvesting. Detection of 5-ClUra in the Air Pouch Inflammation Model in Rats— The animal use protocol was approved by the animal care committee at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute and was strictly followed. The details of the animal study was described elsewhere (16Jiang Q. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, male Wistar rats (250–330 g) (Charles River, CA) were caged singly and routinely fed ad libitum with Purina Chow with free access to the tap water. An air pouch was created by a subcutaneous injection of 12 ml of sterile air into the intrascapular area of the rat's back. Thirty hours later, 2 ml of 0.5% carrageenan (Sigma) or PBS was injected into the air pouch. Twenty hours after the induction of inflammation, the air pouch was lavaged with PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+ and the exudate fluid was collected. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and stored under –80 °C until use. To detect 5-ClUra in the isolated fluid, 400 μl of exudate was vigorously mixed with 2:5 ml of methanol/hexane, in the presence of 1 mm methionine, to remove most proteins or lipids. After a brief centrifugation, the methanol layer was collected and evaporated until the volume was reduced to ∼0.25 ml. 5-ClUra was extracted from the resulting aqueous phase into 1 ml of ethyl acetate after the addition of 128 pg of 5-[15N2,13 C]chlorouracil. To release 5-ClUra from nucleosides, the resulting aqueous phase (∼0.25 ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 1 unit of TP and 50 μl, 0.2 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.2). 5-ClUra was then extracted using 1 ml of ethyl acetate after the addition of internal standard. To detect 5-ClUra in DNA, tissues along the liner of the pouch was collected and DNA was isolated using Qiagen kit. Samples were then processed, derivatized, and analyzed by GC-MS as described above. Statistics—A non-paired Student's t test was used in all conditions. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Development of GC-MS Assay for the Detection of 5-ClUra— We previously developed a sensitive GC-MS method for the detection of uracil where uracil is derivatized with BTFMBzBr (17Blount B.C. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 219: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we directly adapted this technique for the assay of 5-ClUra. Derivatization of 5-ClUra with BTFMBzBr yields a volatile, electron-capture derivative that is readily detected by gas chromatography coupled with EI- or NCI-MS. Fig. 1A illustrates the EI spectrum and structure of the derivatized compound, 5-ClUra-diBEFMBz. A mass to charge ratio (m/z) at 598 corresponds to the molecular ion [M+] of this derivative. The major fragmented ions were found at 579 [M-F], 371 [MBTFMBz], 328 [M-BTFMBz-NCOH], and 227 [BTFMBz]. In the NCI mass spectrum (Fig. 1B), the predominate peak was found at m/z 371, which resulted from a cleavage of one BTFMBz from the parental ion. It is noticeable that the two major isotopes of choride atoms, i.e. 35 and 37 with natural isotopic abundance of 3:1, give rise to the characteristic peaks, as indicated, for instance, by the abundance ratio of 3:1 for the m/z at 371 to 373 [M-BTFMBz] (Fig. 1). The EI and NCI fragmentations of the internal standard, [15N2,13 C]5ClUra-BTFMBz, were shifted up three mass units as a result of three heavier atoms (not shown). In order to effectively release 5ClUra from DNA, we have tried several methods. Although DNA can be completely hydrolyzed by formic acid at high temperature (11Whiteman M. Jenner A. Halliwell B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (13Chen H.J. Row S.W. Hong C.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in order to achieve good sensitivity and reproducibility, multiple complicated purification and enrichment steps had to be subsequently performed (13Chen H.J. Row S.W. Hong C.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We also attempted to digest DNA using HF-pyridine at room temperature for 1 h. However, contaminates from this reagent showed a significant signal at 371, which co-migrates with 5-ClUra on the chromatograph, and thus interfered with 5-ClUra detection. We then turned to the enzymatic hydrolysis. Uracil glycosylase, which removes uracil from DNA, failed to recognize 5-ClUra. TP, an enzyme documented to excise thymine and its analog, bromouracil, from the corresponding nucleosides (18Stetson P.L. Maybaum J. Shukla U.A. Ensminger W.D. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 375: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was then tried. We found that TP is able to effectively remove 5-ClUra from nucleosides (5-CldU or 5-ClUridine), but the commercially available TP contains significant amounts of contaminate which interferes with 5-ClUra detection. To eliminate contaminates, we purified the commercial TP by filtration (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purified enzyme proved to be satisfactory for the current use. Because 5-bromouracil can also be removed by TP from the corresponding brominated nucleoside (18Stetson P.L. Maybaum J. Shukla U.A. Ensminger W.D. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 375: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), another halogenated adduct and inflammation-associated biomarker from eosinophile peroxidase-H2O2 -Br– (19Henderson J.P. Byun J. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the BTFMBz-derivatized 5-bromouracil and 5-ClUra were separated well on the GC chromatography (Fig. 2), these two adducts can be readily measured simultaneously using the current assay. Scheme I summarizes the assay for 5-ClUra from DNA or chlorinated nucleosides in biological fluids. For DNA, the procedure includes a digestion of isolated DNA to nucleotides using nuclease P1, a conversion of nucleotides to nucleosides by dephosphorylation using AP, and a release of 5-ClUra and thymine by TP. In biological fluids, 5-ClUra is freed from chlorinated nucleosides by an incubation of TP after a removal of proteins and lipids by methanol/hexane extraction (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because the reaction of TP is reversible, the complete excision of 5-ClUra from 5-CldU or 5-chlorouridine was achieved in the presence of excess amount of phosphate (with a final concentration of 50 mm). The complete release of 5-ClUra was confirmed by the quantitative excision of 5-ClUra from known amounts of 5-CldU (Table I) or 5-Cl-Uridine (not shown). The presence of various amounts of DNA did not interfere with the release of 5-ClUra (Table I). The quantitative removal of thymine is evident from the fact that the amount of DNA measured by picogreen assay is equal to that calculated from the GC-MS assay where thymine is assumed to represent 29% of the total base (Fig. 3A).Table IThymidine phosphorylase effectively removed 5-ClUra from 5-CldU, and the efficiency was not affected by the amount of DNA addedDNA5-CldU added5-ClUra measuredEfficiencyμgpgpg%07.23.997207.24.197*507.24.190*1007.24.490* Open table in a new tab Fig. 3A, thymine is quantitatively released by TP: DNA calculated from thymine (GC-MS) released by TP versus DNA by picogreen assay (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The minimum reliable detected value from DNA is 0.1–0.3 ClUra/106 Thy. A linear response curve was achieved from low picogram (Fig. 3B) to nanogram ranges (not shown). 5-ClUra Was Detected When Low Micromolar (1–10 μ m) HOCl Reacts with Nucleosides and DNA—To test whether low micromolar HOCl leads to the production of detectable 5-ClUra, deoxycytidine (dC), deoxyuridine (dU), and calf thymus DNA were incubated with 1–10 μm of HOCl in the presence of physiological concentrations of chloride ion. We observed a dose-dependent increase of 5-ClUra under the conditions examined (Fig. 4). At neutral pH, the reaction of HOCl with dU produced higher yields of 5-ClUra than with dC (Fig. 4A). This is likely due to the fact that dC may be primarily oxidized to the chloramine, in contrast to dU which can be directly converted to 5-ClUra (20Gould J.P. Richards J.T. Miles M.G. Water Res. 1984; 18: 205-212Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The yield from chlorination of dC is higher under slightly acidic conditions (pH 5), compared with pH 7, which is likely due to the formation of molecular chlorine from HOCl under acidic conditions, which then chlorinates dC to 5-chlorocytidine (12Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Chen et al. (13Chen H.J. Row S.W. Hong C.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) recently reported that 5-chlorocytidine is unstable and quickly deaminates to 5-chlorouridine. Besides dU and dC, uridine, and cytidine were oxidized by HOCl to generate 5-ClUra with a similar product yield (data not shown). A dose-dependent increase of 5-ClUra was detected from calf thymus DNA when treated with 1–10 μm of HOCl (Fig. 4B), presumably as a result of the chlorination of deoxycytidine. Elevated Levels of 5-ClUra Were Detected in the DNA of Proliferating Cells that Were Treated with Sublethal Doses of HOCl and Allowed to Proliferate, but not after an Immediate Insult—To test whether 5-ClUra can be generated by the direct insult of HOCl in live cells, both human Hela cells and murine embryo C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with non-lethal doses of HOCl. Immediately after HOCl (0–40 μm) treatment, no significant increase in 5-ClUra was detected from isolated DNA (Fig. 5A). At doses lower than 40 μm, no apparent cell death was observed as assayed by the trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). Even at higher dose of HOCl, e.g. 100 μm for 10 min, where substantial amounts of cells became detached or stained in the trypan blue exclusion assay, no significant increase of 5-ClUra could be found in isolated DNA (data not shown). On the other hand, after cells were treated with HOCl for 20 min, replenished with complete medium with FBS and further incubated for 20–24 h, a mild but significant increase in 5-ClUra was detected in the isolated DNA (Fig. 5A, similar results were also obtained with Hela cells, not shown). The elevation of 5-ClUra was markedly accentuated by the addition of 1 μm dU and dC during HOCl treatment (Fig. 5B). This intensified elevation of 5-ClUra in DNA was blocked up to ∼98% with the addition of 0.5 mm of methionine, a potent scavenger of HOCl. The presence of complete medium plus 5% FBS and dU or dC during HOCl treatment resulted in a reduction of 5-ClUra (Fig. 5C) compared with HBSS as the medium. Besides dU and dC, the addition of low micromolar uracil, cytosine, uridine, and cytidine to the culture medium during HOCl treatment also led to significant elevations of 5ClUra in the DNA (Fig. 5D). These observations suggest that although HOCl may not penetrate to the nuclei to directly oxidize DNA, it could modify dC, dU, uracil, cytosine, uridine, and cytosine in the surrounding tissues to generate chlorinated adducts, which might be incorporated into the DNA during cell growth. To test the incorporating efficiency of chlorinated adducts into the DNA, 10 pm to 10 μm of 5-CldU or 5-ClUra were added to the medium when cells were in their log growth phase. As low as 10 pm of 5-CldU was effectively incorporated into DNA with an overall efficiency of 30–40% (Table II). On the other hand, the direct incorporation yield for 5-ClUra was more than 104–105-fold lower than that of 5-CldU (Table II).Table IIPicomolar concentrations of 5-CldU, but not 5-ClUra, were efficiently incorporated into C3H10T1/2 cellsAdded bases5-ClUra/Thy5-ClUra calculatedIncorporationmol/106 molpg in 20 μg of DNA%5-CldU (pm)00.250.61-105.4512.24210043.798.2341000378850.4295-ClUra (μm)12.174.82.2 × 10-41017.438.91.8 × 10-4 Open table in a new tab Elevated Levels of Chlorinated Uracil Adduct(s) Were Detected in the Exudate Fluid at the Inflammation Site in a Rat Inflammation Model—To test whether 5-ClUra is elevated during inflammatory response in vivo, we measured this adduct in the exudate fluid and the DNA from tissues isolated at the inflammation site in the carrageenan-induced inflammation model in rats, which is believed to mimic joint diseases (16Jiang Q. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 21Sedgwick A.D. Lees P. Agents Actions. 1986; 18: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this model, a single injection of carrageenan in the precreated air pouch in the intrascapular area of rat backs led to localized inflammation as indicated by a marked increase in neutrophil infiltration, pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and oxidative damage (16Jiang Q. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 21Sedgwick A.D. Lees P. Agents Actions. 1986; 18: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A markedly enhanced neutrophil infiltration to the inflammation site has been previously reported (21Sedgwick A.D. Lees P. Agents Actions. 1986; 18: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and was also confirmed by us (16Jiang Q. Ames B.N. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). At the time when samples were collected, neutrophils accounted for >90% of the total cells in the exudate. Using the current GC-MS assay, we detected a significant increase in 5-ClUra in the isolated exudate fluid in carrageenan-treated rats, compared with PBS-injected controls (Fig. 6). It is important to note that the significant increase in 5-ClUra was observed only after the fluid was treated with TP, which releases 5-ClUra from 5-CldU or 5-Cl-uridine, suggesting that the predominate chlorinated adducts may be chlorinated nuclosides, but not 5-ClUra. We did not observe a statistically significant elevation of chlorination in the DNA that was isolated from the inflammation site tissues (data not shown). We have developed a simple, specific, and sensitive assay for the detection of 5-ClUra. The assay employs thymidine phosphorylase"

Mapping of this interaction indicated that the predicted fourth intracellular loop/helix VIII of the receptor interacts with the C-terminal rod and linker region of periplakin. Periplakin is widely expressed in the central nervous system of both man and rat and demonstrated an overlapping but not identical distribution with μ-opioid (MOP) receptors. Co-expression of periplakin with MOP-1 or a MOP-1-eYFP fusion construct in HEK293 cells did not interfere with agonist-mediated internalization of the receptor. When co-expressed with a MOP-1-Gi1α fusion protein periplakin significantly reduced the capacity of the agonist to stimulate binding of 35S-labeled guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTPγS) to the receptor-associated G protein. By contrast, periplakin did not interfere with agonist-stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding to either an α2A-adrenoreceptor-Gi1α fusion protein or a β2-adrenoreceptor-Gsα fusion protein, indicating its selectivity of function.

The basic module of G protein-mediated signal transduction has long been considered to be a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DOP, δ-opioid receptor; KOP, κ-opioid receptor; MOP, μ-opioid receptor; PPL, periplakin; PPLC, C terminus of PPL; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; DOP, δ-opioid receptor; KOP, κ-opioid receptor; MOP, μ-opioid receptor; PPL, periplakin; PPLC, C terminus of PPL; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a G protein, and an effector. However, in recent times a wide range of proteins has been identified that interacts with either GPCRs (1Milligan G. White J.H. Trends Pharmacol.

Although certain protein-protein interactions can be anticipated based on the presence of well characterized protein interaction motifs in the primary sequence of the GPCR (1Milligan G. White J.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 513-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), many of the reported interactions do not involve previously characterized motifs. A widely used strategy to identify such interactions is the yeast two hybrid system (7Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The core opioid GPCR family comprises the MOP, KOP, and DOP receptors (8Connor M. Christie M.D. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol.

These have been studied extensively in the search for non-addictive analgesics and particular interest centers on the MOP receptor because it mediates most of the actions of morphine and other clinically relevant analgesic agents as well as drugs of abuse such as heroin. Mice in which the genes for the various opioid receptors have been knocked out have contributed significantly to understanding (10Gaveriaux-Ruff C. Kieffer B. Neuropeptides. 2002; 36: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A number of MOP receptor subtypes have been defined pharmacologically (11Pasternak G.W.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but further potential variation has recently been indicated (22Abbadie C. Gultekin S.H. Pasternak G.W. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 1953-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated a number of opioid receptor-interacting proteins. These include the ezrin-radixin-moesin binding phosphoprotein-50/Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory protein that has been shown to interact with KOP and prevent agonist-induced down-regulation of the receptor by enhancing its recycling rate (23Li J.G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and a GPCR-associated sorting protein shown to interact with DOP and alter the recycling characteristics of this receptor (24Whistler J.L.

Further studies have recently indicated an interaction between the rat MOP and phospholipase D2 (25Koch T. Brandenburg L.O. Schulz S. Liang Y. Klein J. Hollt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This also appears to be involved in the regulation of agonist-induced internalization of the receptor (25Koch T. Brandenburg L.O. Schulz S. Liang Y. Klein J. Hollt V. J. Biol.

These interactions either did not produce significant effects on G protein activation by the receptors or this issue was not examined. By analysis of proteins identified to interact with the C-terminal tail of the human MOP-1 and MOP-1A isoforms herein we demonstrate the interactions of these receptors with periplakin (PPL). Periplakin does not significantly alter agonist-induced internalization of MOP-1, but by interacting with the postulated helix VIII of the receptor that likely runs parallel to the plasma membrane (26Palczewski K.

This interaction is selective because the presence of periplakin did not interfere with the ability of agonists at the α2A-adrenoreceptor or the β2-adrenoreceptor to activate their cognate G proteins.

Immunoblotting studies were performed on homogenates of dissected rat brain regions or on pre-prepared gel-ready Medley samples of human brain obtained from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The day before transfection, cells were seeded either in 10-cm dishes or on coverslips in 6-well plates at 50–70% confluency. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). 48 h later cells in the dishes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS in situ, harvested in 5 ml of PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation at 1,600 rpm at 4 °C. These pellets were kept at –80 °C until membrane preparation. For the cells in 6-well plates, 24 h after transfection they were fixed or subjected to immunostaining as follows. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 5% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized for 10 min in TM buffer (0.15% Triton X-100 and 3% nonfat milk in PBS). Coverslips were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with mouse anti-HA antibody (2.5 μg/ml, Roche Applied Science), washed in TM buffer and PBS, and then incubated for a further 1 h with Alexa-conjugated anti-mouse 594. After washing, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides and examined using a laser-scanning Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Preparation of Membranes—Cell pellets were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris HCl/0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and homogenized with 30–50 strokes of a Teflon-on-glass homogenizer. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in TE buffer at –80 °C until use. 3H Ligand Binding Assays—The level of expression of MOP-1 and the MOP-1-Cys351-Ile-Gi1α fusion protein was determined by the binding of [3H]diprenorphine (2 nm) in TEM buffer (75 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2). Nonspecific binding was defined with 50 μm naloxone. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h and stopped by adding 5 ml of cold TE buffer followed by immediate filtration through GF/C filters and washing. Binding assays to measure levels of expression of the α2A -adrenoreceptor-Cys351-Ile-Gi1α and the β2-adrenoreceptor-Gsα fusion proteins have been described previously (32Jackson V.N. Bahia D.S.

Cells were incubated with the MOP-selective agonist DAMGO (10 μm) for varying times and washed immediately 2× with PBS and 2× with PBS-CM (PBS containing1mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2). Biotin labeling was performed in a dark room under dim light. Cells were treated with ice-cold 10 mm sodium periodate in PBS-CM and then with ice-cold 1 mm Biotin-LC-hydrazide in acetate buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) for 30 min. After 3 washes with PBS, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5% ethylene glycol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). Solubilized proteins were cleared by a 15-min centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were used for immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the C terminus of human MOP-1 (anti-MT43). Immuno-complexes were immobilized by protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma), resolved in 4–12% Tris-Bis NuPAGE (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Biotin-labeled MOP-1 was detected by horseradish peroxide-conjugated streptavidin and visualized by ECL. Purification of His-tagged Proteins—Plasmids bearing the desired His fusion inserts were transformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5a cells. From an overnight culture, 10 ml was used to inoculate 500 ml of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C until the culture reached an A 600 of 0.4–0.6. 1 mm isopropyl-β,d-thiogalactopyranoside was added for 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer, and His-tagged proteins were purified according to the manufacturer (Qiagen). Eluted proteins were dialyzed against at least three changes of PBS containing 5% glycerol at 4 °C over a period of 2 days before storage at –80 °C. Purification of GST Fusion Proteins and GST Pull-down Assays— Bacterial cultures as above were harvested at 8,000 rpm for 15 min. The cell pellets were then lysed in 10 ml of BugBuster containing 10 μl of benzonase (Novagen) and a protease inhibitor mixture, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with rotation, and cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C after 2 × 1 min of sonication. The supernatants were either stored at –80 °C until used for GST pull-down assays or directly purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). For GST pull-down assays, 1–5 ml of the soluble lysates were incubated with 100 μl of 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation (1000 rpm, 2min), the beads were washed 3× with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS/Triton X-100 containing 50 μg of required His fusions. The mix was then incubated for an additional 2 h before collection of the beads. These were washed 5× with PBS/Triton X-100, washed again with PBS, and then eluted in 50 μl of 10 mm glutathione in a Tris·HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The eluates were resolved, and the Histagged protein was detected by immunoblotting. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—24 h after transfection with MOP-1-Cys351-Ile-Gi1α plus or minus HA-PPL cells were treated with 25 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 16 h before harvest. [35S]GTPγS binding experiments were initiated by the addition of membranes containing 25 fmol of MOP-1-Cys351-Ile-Gi1α, measured by the binding of [3H]diprenorphine, to an assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin,10 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate, 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS) containing the indicated concentrations of DAMGO. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The samples were centrifuged (16,000g, 15 min, 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% Nonidet P-40) plus 0.2% SDS. Samples were precleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and immunoprecipitated with an antiserum that identifies the C-terminal decapeptide of Gi1α. Finally, the immunocomplexes were washed twice with solubilization buffer, and bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Equivalent experiments were performed after transfection of fusion proteins between the α2A-adrenoreceptor and Cys351-Ile-Gi1α (32Jackson V.N. Bahia D.S. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or between the β2-adrenoreceptor and Gsα (33McLean A.J. Zeng F.Y. Behan D. Chalmers D. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of HA-PPL. End of assay immunocapture of the β2-adrenoreceptor-Gsα fusion protein utilized an antiserum that identifies the C-terminal decapeptide of Gsα (33McLean A.J. Zeng F.Y. Behan D. Chalmers D. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Protein Interaction Studies—Bio-informatic analysis of expressed sequence tags suggests only two forms of MOP are expressed in man. These differ only in the extreme C-terminal tail, resulting in MOP-1A being eight amino acids shorter than MOP-1. Based on the presence of a potential, weak coiled-coil domain in the C terminus of human MOP-1 we sought protein-interacting partners for the C-terminal tails of MOP-1 and MOP-1A. The C-terminal 75 amino acids of MOP-1 and 67 amino acids of MOP-1A were employed as bait for yeast two-hybrid screens using a human brain-derived cDNA library. Of 147 hits for the MOP-1 tail from 1.2 × 107-transformed cDNAs and 58 hits for the MOP-1A tail from 6 × 106-transformed cDNAs, multiple clones corresponded to PPL (36Leung C.L. Green K.J. Liem R.K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 37-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 37Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 38Aho S. McLean W.H. Li K. Uitto J. Genomics. 1998; 48: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). The interaction of PPL with both MOP-1 and MOP-1A eliminated the possibility that binding was to the extreme C terminus of MOP-1. The interaction with the C-terminal tails of the MOP-1 and MOP-1A receptors required the extreme C-terminal linker domain of PPL and/or part of the C-terminal region of its rod domain as all the characterized hits from the yeast two hybrid assays contained these regions. A series of fragments of the C-terminal tail of MOP-1 was generated (Fig. 1b) and used in further yeast two hybrid studies. These studies indicated the site of interaction must be in a region proximal to the plasma membrane because truncation to Ser358, just beyond the putative palmitoylated cysteine residues (Cys348 and Cys353), did not compromise the interaction. Given the similarity of sequence of the MOP and DOP receptors in this region, it was interesting to note that equivalent screens using the C-terminal tail of the DOP receptor also resulted in positive identification of PPL as an interacting protein (data not shown). To confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid analyses, a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 80 amino acids of MOP-1 was generated and linked to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. This was able to capture a His-tagged form of the C-terminal 208 amino acids of PPL (PPLC) (Fig. 2a). When GST fusion proteins of both the C-terminal 43 amino acids and the remaining 37 amino acids of the 80 amino acid MOP-1 fragment were generated, interaction with PPLC was preserved only for the membrane proximal 37-amino acid section (Fig. 2a). Elimination of 10 or 20 amino acids from the N terminus of the 80-amino acid fragment did not prevent interactions with PPLC (Fig. 2a). However, removal of a further 10 amino acids abolished the interaction (Fig. 2a). The combination of these data (Fig. 2b) delimited the site of interaction of the C-terminal 208 amino acids of PPL with the region between amino acids 341–351 (LDENFKRCFRE) of MOP-1. Based on the structure of bovine rhodopsin (26Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar) and comparisons of other related GPCRs (29Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), this sequence is likely to represent helix VIII of the MOP-1 and MOP-1A receptors. Further GST fusion proteins, including a 23-amino acid segment corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the human MOP receptors, failed to indicate interactions between PPLC and other linear, intracellular regions of the MOPs (data not shown). Importantly for subsequent studies, the addition of enhanced green fluorescent protein to the C-terminal end of the MOP-1 tail did not prevent interaction between the C-terminal tail of the receptor and PPLC (Fig. 2c). Reciprocal experiments demonstrated that a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 208 amino acids of PPL (amino acids 1548–1756) was able to capture a His-tagged form of the MOP-1 C-terminal tail (Fig. 2d). However, we were unable to define the region of PPLC responsible for this interaction in detail as two similar-sized sections derived from this C-terminal region (periplakin 1548–1666 and periplakin1667–1756) were both unable to capture the His-tagged form of the MOP-1 C-terminal tail (data not shown). Expression and Distribution of Periplakin—Low levels of MOP-1 transcripts were detected in a number of distinct regions of human brain using TAQMAN quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 3a). Although PPL has been most actively studied as a 195-kDa protein of the keratinocyte cytoskeleton and desmosomes (36Leung C.L. Green K.J. Liem R.K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 37-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 37Ruhrberg C. Hajibagheri M.A. Parry D.A. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1835-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), as noted previously (38Aho S. McLean W.H. Li K. Uitto J. Genomics. 1998; 48: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), its transcript was also highly and widely expressed in the central nervous system. High levels of mRNA were detected in regions of human brain including the frontal and temporal lobes, amygdala, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Fig. 3b). Immunoblotting studies with antibodies directed toward the C-terminal region of PPL identified a polypeptide of some 195 kDa in lysates of all available regions of human (Fig. 3c) and rat (Fig. 3d) brain. Immunodetected levels of PPL were relatively similar in individual, gross regions of human brain and were especially high in the pituitary and olfactory bulb from rat. Antibodies directed toward the N- (Fig. 3e) or C-terminal (data not shown) of PPL also easily detected a single 195-kDa protein in human keratinocytes. However, PPL expression in the neuron-derived cell lines, NG108–15 and SHSY-5Y, was below immunodetectable levels (Fig. 3e). Anti-PPL antibodies were also unable to detect protein expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3e). Periplakin Does Not Interfere with Internalization of MOP-1— Transient expression of full-length MOP-1-eYFP in HEK293 cells resulted in a predominantly plasma membrane-delineated distribution when examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4a). Exposure of these cells to the highly MOP selective enkephalin analogue DAMGO (10 μm) resulted in rapid redistribution of the eYFP signal to punctate intracellular vesicles that are likely to represent recycling endosomes (Fig. 4a). HA-tagged PPL was distributed more widely in cells but was excluded from the nucleus and showed a distinct corona of staining close to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4b). With co-expression, there was a clear overlap of the signals corresponding to the two proteins at the cell surface (Fig. 4c). The presence of HA-PPL did not prevent DAMGO mediated internalization of MOP-1-eYFP in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4c), but there was no evidence that DAMGO treatment altered the cellular distribution of HA-PPL. Indeed, the signals corresponding to the two polypeptides separated during exposure to the agonist (Fig. 4c). Unlike the receptor, HA-PPL did not move into an endocytic compartment after agonist treatment as there was no overlap of the signals in the MOP-1-eYFP-positive intracellular vesicles (Fig. 4c). The internalization of MOP-1 in intact HEK293 cells in response to DAMGO was also assessed by the removal from the cell surface of receptors available to be biotinylated (Fig. 5a). Biotinylated MOP-1 migrated in SDS-PAGE predominantly as an ∼80-kDa species. Higher molecular mass species may represent dimeric and aggregated forms of the receptor. Co-expression with HA-PPL did not prevent the agonist-induced removal of MOP-1 from the cell surface (Fig. 5). Over short time periods, removal of MOP-1 from the cell surface did not reflect a down-regulation of the total cellular levels of the receptor (Fig. 5b).Fig. 5Periplakin does not prevent removal of MOP-1 from the cell surface. a, HEK293 cells were transfected to express MOP-1 in the absence or presence of HA-PPL. Cell surface MOP-1 was monitored by biotinylation. Incubation of the cells with DAMGO for 0, 30, or 90 min resulted in extensive removal of MOP-1 from the cell surface in the absence or presence of PPL. b, at short time points this does not reflect down-regulation of MOP-1. HEK293 cells were transfected to express MOP-1 in the absence or presence of PPL. i, biotinylation experiments akin to those of panel a were conducted in the absence of DAMGO or after challenge for 20 min with 10 μm.

The PX domain mediates membrane association by interaction with phosphoinositides. The SNXs are generally believed to participate in membrane trafficking, but information regarding the function of individual proteins is limited. In this report, we describe the major characteristics of one member, SNX16. SNX16 is a novel 343-amino acid protein consisting of a central PX domain followed by a potential coiled-coil domain and a C-terminal region. Like other sorting nexins, SNX16 associates with the membrane via the PX domain which interacts with the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. We show via biochemical and cellular studies that SNX16 is distributed in both early and late endosome/lysosome structures. The coiled-coil domain is necessary for localization to the later endosomal structures, as mutant SNX16 lacking this domain was found only in early endosomes. Trafficking of internalized epidermal growth factor was also delayed by this SNX16 mutant, as these cells showed a delay in the segregation of epidermal growth factor in the early endosome for its delivery to later compartments. In addition, the coiled-coil domain is shown here to be important for homo-oligomerization of SNX16. Taken together, these results suggest that SNX16 is a sorting nexin that may function in the trafficking of proteins between the early and late endosomal compartments.

The cellular response to a myriad of external signals is known to be elicited by ligand binding to cognate cell surface receptors which in turn become activated and set in motion a variety of signaling cascades. Regulation of signaling pathways is of vital importance and is achieved at multiple levels. One chief mechanism is by the down-regulation of the activated receptors. This may be achieved by rapid internalization of the activated receptor into the endosomal system. For many of the receptors of nutritional macromolecules, entry into the endosomal system is brief and generally results in their recycling back to the cell surface for re-employment in another round of ligand binding (1Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the other hand, receptors of hormones and growth factors are often retained in the endosomal system and shunted through various intracellular membrane compartments on their way to the lysosome for degradation (2Felder S. Miller K. Moehren G. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 623-634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Trafficking through the endosomal system involves the use of membrane-bound intermediates such as vesicles, hence sorting of the correct cargo into the correct vesicle is critical. Many of the proteins involved in this sorting process are hydrophilic peripheral membrane proteins, and their interaction with the membrane is mediated by direct binding to lipids. This is a key event that has recently gained much support. Extensive research has shown that phosphoinositides, particularly the phosphorylated species of phosphatidylinositol (PI), 1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; SNXs, sorting nexins; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PI3-P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; ESTs, expressed sequence tags; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EGF-rh, rhodamine-labeled EGF; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor.1The abbreviations used are: PI, phosphatidylinositol; SNXs, sorting nexins; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PI3-P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; ESTs, expressed sequence tags; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; EGF-rh, rhodamine-labeled EGF; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor. play a role in multiple aspects of membrane trafficking (for reviews see Refs. 3Martin T.F.

Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 504-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and an increasing number of PI-binding motifs with specific lipid binding affinities have been identified. These include the pleckstrin homology domain (5Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), the FYVE domain (6Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar).In terms of endosomal transport and, in particular, receptor trafficking, the most interesting phosphoinositide is phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3-P). Existing predominantly in endosomal membranes, PI3-P is produced by the action of a family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinase). Three classes of PI 3-kinase are known. Class I PI 3-kinases are regulated by activated receptor tyrosine kinases and G-proteincoupled receptors and can produce PI3-P, PI3,4-P2, and PI3,4,5-P3 (9Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Khatereh A.

Class II PI 3-kinases contain PX and C2 domains in their C-terminal regions and can generate PI3-P and PI3,4-P2 (9Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Khatereh A. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Finally, class III PI 3-kinases consisting of Vps34 and p150 produce mainly PI3-P and are responsible for providing the bulk of the endosomal PI3-P as both of these proteins are located in the endosomes (10Schu P.V.

The PX domain is present in a large number of proteins, many of which exist in the GenBank™ data base, and contain either the PX domain alone or with C-terminal coiled-coil motifs (for review see Ref. 20Xu Y. Seet L. Hanson B. Hong W. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Collectively, they are now known as the sorting nexins (SNX), in accordance with the naming of the prototypic protein, SNX1 (21Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).SNX1 was first identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen using the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor as bait. The C-terminal region of SNX1 following the PX domain contains three coiled-coil domains, the last of which is responsible for binding to the lysosomal targeting information of the EGF receptor (21Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SNX1 has been shown to enhance the degradation of the EGF receptor (21Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, SNX1 and the related proteins SNX2 and SNX4 can co-immunoprecipitate not only the EGF receptor but also other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as receptors for insulin- and platelet-derived growth factor and the receptor for transferrin (22Renfrew Haft C. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). With the characterization of SNX6, a sorting nexin identified through its interaction with the transforming growth factor-β family of receptors (23Parks W.T. Frank D.B. Huff C. Renfrew Haft C.

SNX1, -2, and -4 were also found to bind to certain members of this receptor family. This is not surprising as SNX1, -2, -4, and -6 have the ability to interact with themselves and with each other (22Renfrew Haft C. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell.

All of these sorting nexins exhibit predominantly early endosomal localization and show high degrees of overlap with one another in immunofluorescence studies. Recently, SNX1 was also found to interact with the protease-activated receptor 1, a G-protein-coupled receptor (24Wang Y. Zhou Y. Szabo K. Renfrew Haft C. Trejo J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).

Another sorting nexin, SNX3, consisting of little more than a PX domain is structurally different from the sorting nexins 1, 2, 4, and 6 mentioned previously and is not able to interact with other members of the sorting nexin family or exhibit their receptor binding capabilities (22Renfrew Haft C. de la Luz Sierra M. Barr V.A. Haft D.H. Taylor S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7278-7287Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, SNX3 has been implicated in the recycling of the transferrin receptor and is localized to structures associated with the early and the recycling endosome (16Xu Y. Hortsman H. Seet L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, it would appear that sorting nexins are intimately involved in the trafficking of many different families of receptors, regardless of whether they are receptors that are recycled to the cell surface or those sent to the lysosome for degradation.In this paper we report our biochemical and cellular characterization of SNX16. This putative member of the SNX family was identified as part of a data base search using the PX domain sequence of SNX1. We described the ability of SNX16 to bind PI3-P and the importance of this interaction in mediating its endosomal recruitment. We also show that SNX16, unlike other characterized sorting nexins, is distributed between the early endosome and the later endosome/lysosome compartments. This cellular distribution is dependent on the presence of a single coiled-coil domain, which is also important for homo-oligomer formation and the normal segregation of a receptor tyrosine kinase from the early endosome on its way to the later structures of the pathway. Consistent with its unique distribution in the endocytic pathway, SNX16 does not associate with the SNX1 complex nor with SNX3. SNX16 is the first sorting nexin shown to have such a dual distribution, and the results suggest that it may regulate trafficking between the early and late endosome.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of SNX16 cDNA—By using the protein sequence of the PX domain of SNX1, we searched the NCBI data base using the BLAST algorithm (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59110) Google Scholar) and identified two homologous human expressed sequence tags (ESTs). The two ESTs (GenBank™ accession numbers AA280333 and AA329466) were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL), and plasmid DNA was isolated using miniprep DNA isolation products from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The full sequence of these two ESTs was determined, and the 5′ start site was not found. PCR was employed to amplify further the 5′ sequence from a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends human liver cDNA library, and sequencing of the amplified products identified the start codon. Standard molecular biology techniques were used to construct full-length cDNA. The identity of the full-length clone was confirmed by sequencing, and it contains a 1035-bp coding region, encoding a 343-amino acid residue sorting nexin, now designated SNX16.Expression Constructs—PCR using VENT polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used to introduce a 5′-XhoI site and a 3′-XmaI site at the beginning and ending of the SNX16 coding region. The full-length cDNA as well as truncated cDNAs were cloned via these restriction enzyme sites into pDMycneo, which is a modified version of the pCIneo vector (Stratagene). pDMycneo has an insert encoding two Myc epitope sequences inserted 5′ to the multiple cloning site (16Xu Y. Hortsman H. Seet L. Wong S.H. Hong W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 26Seet L.-F. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42445-42454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All of the deletion mutants were generated by PCR, and the Y145A point mutant was made by direct mutation of the codon using PCR. Full-length SNX16 was also cloned into pDHAneo, which has the two Myc epitope tags of pDMycneo replaced with two hemagglutinin (HA) sequence tags, as mentioned above. For expression of full-length SNX16 and selected mutants in bacteria as GST fusion proteins, the cDNA was excised from pDMycneo and cloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Antibodies—SNX16 was produced as a GST fusion protein in bacteria and then cleaved with thrombin. The released SNX16 was used to immunize rabbits with Freund's adjuvant (Invitrogen). To affinitypurify antibodies against SNX16, serum from the immunized rabbits was incubated with the antigen, GST-SNX16, chemically coupled to cyanogen bromide-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Bound antibody was eluted with Immuno-Pure IgG elution buffer (Pierce), neutralized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then dialyzed against the same solution. The goat antibody against GST was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal antibodies against EEA1, SNX1, and SNX2 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The mouse anti-LAMP1 monoclonal antibody (H4A3), developed by J. T. August and J.E.K. Hildreth, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA 52242. Polyclonal anti-Myc antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and monoclonal antibody against HA was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, Alexa Fluor 555-, or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch and Molecular Probes, respectively.Tissue Distribution of SNX16 mRNA—Specific primers representing the start and end of the human SNX16 coding region were used for PCR using first-strand cDNA generated from the indicated human tissues obtained from Clontech. PCR conditions were as instructed by the manufacturer, and primers for human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as control. PCR products were analyzed on 1.2% TAE-agarose gels.Tissue Distribution of Rat SNX16 —Lysates from the indicated rat tissues were prepared by homogenization of1gofthe appropriate organ in 4 ml of homogenization buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 50 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) with 25 strokes of a drill fitted Teflon glass homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to yield the post-nuclear supernatant which was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE prior to transfer to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting.Protein-Lipid Overlay Assay—Protein-lipid overlay assays were based on the procedure described by Dowler et al. (27Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes spotted with 100 pmol of the indicated lipids were obtained from Echelon Research Laboratories and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline) for 4 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of the relevant GST fusion protein in the blocking solution, after which the membranes were washed 12 times for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline. For detection of bound protein, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-GST polyclonal antibody, washed 6 times for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline, then incubated with rabbit anti-goat antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and finally washed again prior to being visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce).Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—A431 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v, Hyclone Laboratories) and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) and grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Transfection was carried out using EFFECTENE (Qiagen) for ∼5 h and processed for immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, or immunoprecipitation 24 h after transfection.Sucrose Density Gradient—A431 cells from four 10-cm plates were harvested by scraping into 500 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, and 8% (w/v) sucrose and lysed by 20 passes through a 26-gauge needle. Post-nuclear supernatant was obtained by centrifugation of the lysate at 1000 × g for 10 min, and 360 μl of the post-nuclear supernatant was loaded on the top of a tube containing 360-μl aliquots of 40, 37, 34, 31, 28, 25, 22, 19, 16, 13, and 10% (w/v) sucrose in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, sequentially overlaid. Following centrifugation at 55,000 rpm in an SW60Ti rotor, 250 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed with the indicated antibodies as described below.Cell Imaging—A431 cells were cultured onto 18 × 18-mm glass coverslips and transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids. All cells were washed twice with PBSCM (PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1mm MgCl2) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by two rinses with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBSCM. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) saponin in PBSCM containing 5% BSA for 30 min at room temperature prior to incubation with the indicated primary antibodies. All primary and secondary antibody incubations were performed in fluorescence dilution buffer (FDB: 5% fetal calf serum, 5% goat serum, and 2% BSA in PBSCM). After mounting the cells were viewed using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss).Internalization of EGF—A431 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids as described above and plated at 1:5 dilution on coverslips the following day. Cells were then serum-starved (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, and 0.2% BSA) 24 h after plating for 3 h. To label cell surface EGF receptors, cells were incubated with 1.6 μg/ml EGF conjugated with rhodamine (EGF-rh) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by several washes with starvation media to remove unbound EGF-rh. Surface-bound EGF-rh was internalized by incubation with normal growth media at 37 °C for the respective periods followed by fixation. Following permeabilization for 5 min with 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, cells were processed for triple labeling and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described above.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—A431 cells on 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with the indicated plasmids and then lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). After dilution to 0.5% Triton X-100, immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C with 25 μl of anti-Myc crosslinked to protein A-Sepharose for 4 h. The Sepharose was then washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunodetection. The blots were blocked for at least 1 h with 5% skimmed milk and 20% fetal calf serum in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Following several washes with PBST, the blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and washed again with PBST prior to detection of antibody complexes with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate.RESULTSIdentification and Tissue Distribution of SNX16 —To identify additional members of the sorting nexin family, we performed a Blast search of the NCBI human EST data base for proteins homologous/identical to the protein sequence of the SNX1 PX domain. A large number of ESTs were identified, two of which were homologous to each other and represent a partial clone of a novel SNX. A rapid amplification of cDNA ends library was used to PCR-amplify the missing 5′ region. Assembling the additional 5′ nucleotide sequence with the EST sequence results in the identification of a complete open reading frame of 1035 bp which we have deposited into GenBank™ as SNX16 (GenBank™ accession number AF305779). SNX16 is a 343-residue hydrophilic protein, which contains a central PX domain (residue 101–213) followed by a single putative coiled-coil domain (residue 230–278) and non-structural C-terminal region (residue 279–343) (Fig. 1A). Comparison of the human, mouse (GenBank™ accession number NM_029068), and rat (GenBank™ accession number AF305780) SNX16 protein sequences (Fig. 1B) showed that whereas SNX16 is highly conserved in the middle region of the protein, containing both the PX domain and the coiled-coil domain, both the N-terminal and especially the C-terminal regions show substantial difference, with many of the acidic residues present in the C-terminal region of the human protein absent in the rodent counterparts. Analysis of the human genome has shown 3 transcript variants of SNX16, variant 1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_022133) and 2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_152836) differ in their 5′-untranslated region and gives rise to isoform A, simply referred to as SNX16 here, whereas variant 3 (GenBank™ accession number NM_152837) results in a 29-residue deletion of part of the PX domain producing isoform B (Fig. 1B). SNX16 showed little homology to other proteins in regions outside the PX domain. The PX domain showed the highest homology (Fig. 1C) to the PX domains of the cytokine-independent survival kinase (CISK: GenBank™ accession number AF312007 (28Liu D. Yang X. Songyang Z. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1233-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)), the uncharacterized PXK protein which contains a kinase-like domain in addition to the PX domain (GenBank™ accession number AF399753), SNX1 (GenBank™ accession number U53225 (21Kurten R.C. Cadena D.L. Gill G.N. Science. 1996; 272: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar)), and the yeast sorting nexin Mvp1p (GenBank™ accession number U16137 (29Ekena K. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1671-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)).To obtain the full-length SNX16 cDNA, we performed high fidelity PCR on a human liver cDNA library. We obtained a PCR product ∼1050 bp in length, in agreement with the expected size of the SNX16 coding region. The identity of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. This 1050-bp fragment is present in diverse tissues, as first strand cDNA generated from eight human tissues subjected to PCR using the same primers employed for the initial cloning of SNX16, and revealed the presence of an ∼1050-bp band present in most of the tissues tested (Fig. 2A). The highest level of SNX16 was detected in pancreas, lung, liver, placenta, and heart, with little SNX16 detected in the brain and virtually no SNX16 present in skeletal muscle or kidney under these experimental conditions.Fig. 2SNX16 is present in multiple tissues. A, tissue distribution of human SNX16 transcripts as revealed by PCR (upper panel) using its specific oligonucleotides and first strand cDNA synthesized from the indicated tissues, a product of 1035 bp is expected. PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) (lower panel) was used as a control. B, antibodies produced against human SNX16 in rabbits were affinity-purified and used at 0.1 μg/ml to probe immunoblots containing human (lane 1) and rat (lane 2) SNX16 produced by in vitro translation (IVT); 70 μg of lysates prepared from the indicated tissue cultured cells of human (lanes 3, 4, and 6), monkey (lane 7), mouse (lane 5), and rat (lanes 8 and 9) origin; and 70 μg of lysates prepared from the indicated rat tissues (lanes 10–17). The antibodies detect a band of ∼49 kDa in samples of human origin and 40 kDa in samples of rodent origin, which is expected given the difference in acidic residues highlighted in the C-terminal region of SNX16 (Fig. 2). The lower (∼35 kDa) band observed in lanes 12–15 may represent SNX16 isoform B, which contains a deletion in the PX domain. The immunoblots were also probed with an antibody against β-tubulin as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to study endogenous SNX16, we prepared specific antibodies by immunizing rabbits with recombinant full-length human SNX16 produced in Escherichia coli.

https://openalex.org/W2026680892,"Activation-induced cell death (AICD), a term originally coined for the anti-CD3-induced apoptosis of T cell hybridomas and thymocytes, is predominantly driven by death receptors and has been involved in the control of autoreactive T cells in the periphery. In the Do-11.10 T cell hybridoma model of AICD, activation of the T cell receptor (TCR) results in Fas-dependent apoptosis. Here, we show that inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) in Do-11.10 cells resulted in increased sensitivity to TCR-mediated apoptosis, correlating with defective induction of the anti-apoptotic NFκB target gene A20. Stable expression of the zinc finger protein A20 in NFκB-negative Do-11.10 cells rescued the phenotype. TCR activation in NFκB-deficient Do-11.10 cells resulted predominantly in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 2 (TNFR2)-dependent bystander cell death rather than classical Fas-dependent AICD. Strikingly, A20 blocked TNF-mediated apoptosis and simultaneously restored TCR-induced Fas-dependent AICD. In addition, NFκB downstream of TNFR was required for up-regulation of Fas expression by endogenous TNF secreted in response to TCR stimulation. Together, these results suggest that NFκB can play both pro- and anti-apoptotic roles during AICD. We propose that NFκB controls the balance between Fas and TNF cell death pathways during AICD via the expression of the zinc finger protein A20. Activation-induced cell death (AICD), a term originally coined for the anti-CD3-induced apoptosis of T cell hybridomas and thymocytes, is predominantly driven by death receptors and has been involved in the control of autoreactive T cells in the periphery.

We propose that NFκB controls the balance between Fas and TNF cell death pathways during AICD via the expression of the zinc finger protein A20. T lymphocytes are highly specialized cells of the adaptive immune system. Individual T cells express distinct T cell receptors (TCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; AICD, activation-induced cell death; FasL, Fas ligand; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; RT, reverse transcriptase; FCS, fetal calf serum; Ab, antibody; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. able to recognize a particular antigen and initiate a properly directed immune response. The clonal deletion of auto-reactive T cells in thymus is essential for the discrimination between self and non-self (1Robey E. Fowlkes B.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 675-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 2Nossal G.J.V. Cell. 1994; 76: 229-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). This “central tolerance” is, however, incomplete, and healthy individuals harbor self-reactive T cells in the periphery (3Walker L.S. Abbas A.K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Normally, such self-reactive T cells fail to induce autoimmunity as a result of “peripheral tolerance” mechanisms, which involve either induction of anergy or apoptosis in self-reactive T cells. Peripheral deletion by induction of apoptosis is a major mechanism of controlling self-reactive T cells, and two distinct molecular pathways are now recognized, which result in the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes destined to die. Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is an antigen-dependent cell-autonomous process, which involves TCR-mediated sensitization to apoptosis followed by death receptor-dependent cell death (4Combadiere B. Reis e Sousa C. Trageser C. Zheng L.X. Kim C.R. Lenardo M.J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 305-313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AICD is insensitive to action of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and does not rely on cytochrome c released from mitochondria. The second pathway of peripheral T cell deletion has recently been termed activated T cell autonomous cell death (5Hildeman D.A. Zhu Y. Mitchell T.C. Kappler J. Marrack P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast to AICD, activated T cell autonomous cell death can be blocked by Bcl-2, is independent of death receptors, such as Fas, and is promoted by the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologue Bim. An important question in molecular immunology is the mechanism by which TCR induces apoptosis during AICD. T cell hybridomas represent a model system to study AICD in vitro (6Lenardo M. Chan K.M. Hornung F. McFarland H. Siegel R. Wang J. Zheng L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In this system TCR signaling triggers up-regulation of Fas ligand (FasL) at the cell surface, which leads to the engagement of Fas, followed by cell-autonomous cell death. Several transcription factors, such as c-Myc, NF-AT, Egr, and Nur77 (7Shi Y. Glynn J.M. Guilbert L.J. Cotter T.G. Bissonnette R.P. Green D.R.

A. 1996; 93: 5533-5538Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), have been shown to participate in the TCR-mediated FasL up-regulation and induction of apoptosis in T cells. Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) transcription factors are also involved in the regulation of TCR-induced cell death (11Dudley E. Hornung F. Zheng L. Scherer D. Ballard D. Lenardo M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 878-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Med. 1999; 189: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) but the molecular mechanisms by which Rel/NFκB proteins regulate TCR-induced apoptosis are still poorly understood. NFκB constitutes a family of evolutionary closely related transcription factors with important roles in immune and stress responses, inflammation, and cancer (14Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4610) Google Scholar, 15Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin.

Five members have been identified in vertebrates: p50, p52, RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel. DNA binding activity of Rel/NFκB complexes is regulated by members of the IκB family, and several distinct IκB molecules with conserved ankyrin repeats have been described. In most cell types, Rel/NFκB proteins are trapped in the cytoplasm by the IκB inhibitors. A wide range of stimuli activates the IκB kinase complex, resulting in phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBs. Consequently, Rel/NFκB proteins translocate to the nucleus and bind to so-called κB sequence motifs in regulatory regions of target genes (17Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar, 18Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). Abundant evidence has implicated Rel/NFκB transcription factors also in the control of apoptosis (19Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 20Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). It is well established that NFκB is required for protection from tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cell death in mouse embryonic fibroblast, T cells, and many other cell types (20Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 21Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 22Senftleben U. Li Z.W. Baud V. Karin M. Immunity. 2001; 14: 217-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). NFκB activation in response to TNF receptor (TNFR) signaling, for instance, results in the induction of diverse anti-apoptotic proteins, which interfere at different levels with the apoptotic signal transmitted through the TNFR (20Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). With respect to TCR-mediated apoptosis, most reports document an anti-apoptotic role for NFκB, but in some experimental systems NFκB can also promote TCR-induced cell death (12Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 987-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 13Hettmann T. DiDonato J. Karin M. Leiden J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, we show that in a widely used T cell hybridoma model of AICD NFκB function downstream of TCR is largely limited to the control of the anti-apoptotic zinc finger protein A20. In the absence of NFκB, hybridoma cells predominantly die in a cell non-autonomous TNF-dependent and Fas-independent fashion and overexpression of A20 completely reversed this phenotype. We propose that during AICD NFκB controls the balance between Fas and TNF cell death pathways via the expression of A20, enabling cells to maintain clonal specificity of AICD. Cell Culture, Induction, and Flow Cytometric Analysis of AICD—The murine T cell hybridoma Do-11.10 was obtained from the ATCC. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FCS (BioWhittaker), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) at 5% CO2, 37 °C. PMA (10 nm) and ionomycin (0.5 μm) were dissolved in Me2SO. Recombinant murine TNF (20 ng/ml) was from PromoCell. For induction of apoptosis, 24-well plates were precoated with 250 μl of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 145-2C11, Becton Dickinson) diluted to 0.5 μg/ml (unless otherwise stated) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, at 4 °C overnight. Plates were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 × 105 cells in 0.4 ml of medium were applied per well and incubated overnight (unless otherwise stated). Alternatively, cells were treated with agonistic anti-Fas mAb (clone Jo2, 1 μg/ml, Becton Dickinson). After incubation cells were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% FCS) containing 2 μg/ml propidium iodide. Cell death was measured by determining the fraction of propidium iodide-positive cells with a FACScan flow cytometer and CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson). Similar results were obtained when cells were stained for annexin V (data not shown). Antibodies and Blocking Reagents—For blocking experiments the following concentration of neutralizing mAbs (Becton Dickinson) were added to the wells at the beginning of the incubation: anti-TNFR1 (clone 55R-170, 2 μg/ml), anti-TNFR2 (clone TR75-54, 2 μg/ml), anti-FasL (clone MFL-3, 1 μg/ml), and anti-TNF (clone TN3-19.12, 30 μg/ml). Recombinant human TNFR1-Fc fusion protein (Alexis) was used at 5 μg/ml. Biotinylated anti-T7-tag mAb was purchased from Novagen; anti-FLAG mAb (clone M2) was obtained from Sigma; anti-IκBα, anti-RelA, and anti-RelB rabbit polyclonal Abs are described elsewhere (23Weih F. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3289-3297PubMed Google Scholar). Streptavidin-HRP, goat anti-rabbit Ig-HRP, and goat anti-mouse Ig-HRP secondary reagents were from Dako. To generate rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse A20 Abs, the C-terminal portion of A20 (amino acids 560–775) was amplified by PCR with recognition sites for NheI and XhoI incorporated into the 5′ and 3′ primers, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into NheI/XhoI sites of pET28a (Novagen), which resulted in an in-frame fusion of the A20 coding region to His6 tag sequences. His-tagged C-terminal A20 domain was expressed in BL21 (DE3) bacteria after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h. Recombinant protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions (8 m urea) according to recommendations from the manufacturer. Protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 m urea and used for rabbit immunizations (Moravian Biotechnology). Plasmid Constructs, Stable Transfection, and Retroviral Transduction of Do-11.10 Cells—A cDNA encoding non-degradable mIκBα carrying alanines instead serines at positions 32 and 36 was subcloned into the HindIII site of pRcCMV (Invitrogen) via blunt end cloning. Do-11.10 cells were electroporated (5 × 106 cells in 350 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 250 V, 960 microfarads, 0.4-cm cuvettes in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) and plated in 20 ml of fresh medium. After 48 h cells were counted and plated in 96-well plates at limiting dilution in medium containing 1.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Single clones were picked, expanded, and tested for NFκB induction in response to treatment with anti-CD3 mAb. Flag-tagged A20 cDNA (24Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W.

After 2 days supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Two million exponentially growing Do-11.10 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of virus-containing supernatant. After addition of Polybrene (Sigma, 5 μg/ml) cells were plated in 12-well plates and centrifuged for 3 h at 1000 × g at room temperature. Cells were replated in 20 ml of fresh medium and after 48 h replated in 96-well plates at limiting dilution in medium containing 300 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). Single clones were picked and screened for green fluorescent protein expression by flow cytometry. Green fluorescent protein-positive clones were analyzed for A20 expression by Western blotting or for resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis. Pools of A20-overexpressing clones were used for further experiments. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR Analysis of Steady State mRNA Levels— Preparation of total RNA and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis were performed as previously described (27Weih D.S. Yilmaz Z.B. Weih F.

Western Blotting and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Cells were lysed in ice-cold TEN-T buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Fifty μg of whole cell extract were loaded per lane and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed as described (23Weih F. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3289-3297PubMed Google Scholar). Dilutions of primary Abs were as follows: anti-T7 tag-biotin, 1:10,000; anti-FLAG (M2), 1:500; anti-IκBα, 1:2000; anti-A20, 1:200. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Ab supershifts were performed as described (23Weih F. Carrasco D. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3289-3297PubMed Google Scholar). Mice and Generation of T Cell Blasts—Double-knockout tnf – / – lta – / – mice (28Körner H. Cook M. Riminton D.S. Lemckert F.A. Hoek R.M. Ledermann B. Kontgen F. Fazekas de St. Groth B. Sedgwick J.D.

All animals were housed and bred under standardized conditions with water and food ad libitum in the SPF mouse facility of the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institute of Toxicology and Genetics. Total splenocyte suspensions were prepared according to standard procedures and plated in RPMI, 10% FCS, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Five ml of cell suspension were activated in anti-CD3 mAb precoated 6-well plates (5 μg/ml) for 48 h. Viable blasts were counted and plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml in medium supplemented with IL-2 (PromoCell, 10 ng/ml), and cells were expanded for an additional 48–72 h before being used for experiments. Inhibition of NFκB by a Non-degradable Mutant mIκBα Results in Increased Sensitivity to TCR-induced Apoptosis—To investigate the role of NFκB in the T cell hybridoma model of AICD, we blocked NFκB nuclear translocation by the stable expression of a non-degradable mutant mIκBα molecule (29Vallabhapurapu S. Ryseck R.-P. Malewicz M. Weih D.S. Weih F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2612-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in Do-11.10 cells. Several clones were isolated and two, termed Do/κBpos(1) and Do/κBpos(2), did not show any expression of the mIκBα transgene and were used as controls in all subsequent experiments. Two other clones, termed Do/κBneg(1) and Do/κBneg(2), showed strong mIκBα expression with a concomitant decrease in endogenous IκBα levels (Fig. 1A). The efficiency of NFκB inhibition was analyzed in EMSAs with nuclear extracts from anti-CD3-activated cells. Whereas NFκB was strongly induced in control cells (complex I), mIκBα-expressing clones showed no NFκB binding with the exception of p50-p50 homodimers (complex II, Fig. 1B). In control cells, the majority of NFκB binding was composed of p50-RelA heterodimers. At later time points (2–8 h), additional complexes containing c-Rel (complex III) and RelB (complex IV) were apparent in control but not in Do/κBneg cells (Fig. 1B). To demonstrate lack of NFκB transcriptional activity downstream of TCR, Do-11.10 cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb and induction of the classical NFκB target gene nfkb2 was determined by RT-PCR. Expression of nfkb2 mRNA was induced in control cells with kinetics matching NFκB binding as detected in EMSAs. In contrast, induction of nfkb2 was almost completely abolished in NFκB-negative clones (Fig. 1C). To analyze the role of NFκB in the regulation of AICD, TCR-induced cell death was compared in Do/κBpos and Do/κBneg cells. Anti-CD3 stimulation resulted in increased sensitivity to AICD in cells lacking NFκB. Moreover, in control cultures marked apoptosis was detected only after 10–12 h, whereas cell death occurred ∼2 h earlier in Do/κBneg cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, overexpression of the mIκBα transgene in Do-11.10 hybridoma cells results in a complete block of NFκB activation downstream of the TCR and in increased sensitivity to TCR-induced apoptosis. TCR Signaling Induces NFκB-dependent Expression of the Anti-apoptotic Zinc Finger Protein A20 —NFκB is a well documented principal regulator of genes protecting cells from TNF-mediated apoptosis (19Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar, 20Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed whether the increased TCR-induced apoptosis in NFκB-deficient Do-11.10 cells correlated with impaired expression of NFκB target genes. Pools of Do/κBpos and Do/κBneg clones were activated with anti-CD3 mAb or PMA/ionomycin and mRNA levels of 11 reported anti-apoptotic NFκB target genes were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of the egr3 gene, which is induced in an NFκB-independent manner, was measured as a control for efficient TCR signaling. Table I shows the genes analyzed and their dependence on NFκB. Interestingly, only c-IAP1 and A20 were both TCR-inducible and completely dependent on NFκB activation, whereas a partial dependence on NFκB was observed for the PMA/ionomycin-induced expression of the genes encoding Bfl-1/A1 and Bcl-XL (Table I and Fig. 2A). In addition, induction of egr3 gene expression was normal in all anti-CD3-treated samples, demonstrating specificity of the mIκBα inhibitor (Fig. 2A).Table IExpression of anti-apoptotic NFκB target genes in stimulated Do-11.10 T cell hybridomasGeneInduced by anti-CD3aIndicates either unaltered (-) or increased (+) mRNA levels upon anti-CD3 induction.NFκB-dependentbDependence on NFκB was determined by comparing Do/κBpos and Do/κBneg clones.Induced by PMA + ionomycinNFκB-dependentTRAF1-NDeND, not determined.TRAF2-NDc-IAP1++NDc-IAP2-NDXIAPNot expressedcXIAP mRNA was not detected (mouse brain cDNA served as a positive control).NDBfl-1/A1+-+±fInducibility by PMA plus ionomycin was only partially dependent on NFκB.Bcl-XL±dBcl-XL mRNA levels were only slightly increased upon anti-CD3 induction.+±fInducibility by PMA plus ionomycin was only partially dependent on NFκB.MnSOD-NDA20++NDGly96+-NDc-FLIP-NDa Indicates either unaltered (-) or increased (+) mRNA levels upon anti-CD3 induction.b Dependence on NFκB was determined by comparing Do/κBpos and Do/κBneg clones.c XIAP mRNA was not detected (mouse brain cDNA served as a positive control).d Bcl-XL mRNA levels were only slightly increased upon anti-CD3 induction.e ND, not determined.f Inducibility by PMA plus ionomycin was only partially dependent on NFκB. Open table in a new tab Because c-IAP1 has recently been shown to perform also pro-apoptotic functions (30Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), we focused on A20 as a genuine anti-apoptotic gene. Moreover, the fact that A20 expression was induced by TCR signaling was a surprising novel finding. Analysis of TCR-induced A20 mRNA levels in individual clones confirmed the impaired induction in pooled Do/κBneg cells, and a quantification of this experiment is shown in Fig. 2B. To demonstrate that A20 mRNA induction also results in increased A20 protein levels, we raised Abs directed against the C-terminal portion of mouse A20. Western blot analysis demonstrated that A20 protein levels were clearly induced after 4–8 h of anti-CD3 stimulation in control but not in NFκB-negative Do-11.10 cells (Fig. 2C). To address whether TCR stimulation also induces A20 expression in primary T lymphocytes, we generated T cell blasts from mouse splenocytes. Fig. 2D shows that TCR signaling strongly induced A20 expression on both mRNA and protein level. Similar results were obtained with purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell blasts (data not shown). To clearly demonstrate that TCR signaling also induces A20 expression independent of TNF, we analyzed T cell blasts from tnf – / – lta – / – double-knockout mice, which are deficient in any known TNFR ligand (28Körner H. Cook M. Riminton D.S. Lemckert F.A. Hoek R.M. Ledermann B. Kontgen F. Fazekas de St. Groth B. Sedgwick J.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2600-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Anti-CD3-induced A20 levels were comparable between wild-type and tnf – / – lta – / – T cell blasts, indicating that activation of the TCR induces A20 independent of TNFR signaling (Fig. 2E). Together, these data indicate that TCR-induced A20 expression is a general feature of mature T cells and that this response is, at least in Do-11.10 cells, under NFκB control. Overexpression of A20 in NFκB-negative Do-11.10 Hybridoma Cells Rescues Both Enhanced AICD and Sensitivity to TNF—To test whether A20 overexpression rescues Do/κBneg cells from increased sensitivity to AICD, we transduced both Do/κBpos and Do/κBneg clones with either empty vector or a full-length A20 cDNA. Consistent with data from other cell systems (20Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 21Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar), we found that Do/κBneg cells were very sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis and A20 completely rescued this phenotype (Fig. 3A). This result demonstrates that A20 levels in transduced cells were sufficient for effective protection from TNF. We also measured the influence of A20 on AICD. Overexpression of A20 had no apparent effect on AICD in Do/κBpos cells. In Do/κBneg cells, however, reconstitution with A20 reduced TCR-induced apoptosis to levels similar to the ones seen in control cells (Fig. 3B). A20 overexpression did not affect dexamethasone-induced apoptosis, indicating that apoptosis is not generally blocked in this system (data not shown). We conclude that expression of A20 in Do/κBneg cells is sufficient to rescue both TNF sensitivity and enhanced AICD in response to TCR signaling. To determine A20 protein levels at the onset of AICD in reconstituted Do/κBpos and Do/κBneg clones, Western blots were performed. The amount of A20 protein in control cells was much lower than in cells transduced with an A20 cDNA. Moreover, anti-CD3 treatment increased steady state levels of transgenic A20, even in the absence of NFκB. We also detected increased levels of endogenous A20 protein in anti-CD3-treated Do/κBpos, but not in Do/κBneg, clones (Fig. 3C). Pulse-chase experiments revealed that TCR signaling increased A20 protein synthesis ∼2.5-fold, whereas the half-life of A20 (∼3.5 h) was not affected (data not shown). Because it has been reported that high levels of A20 suppress NFκB (31Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), we analyzed anti-CD3-mediated activation of NFκB in Do/κBpos cells overexpressing A20. Activation of NFκB in A20-transduced Do/κBpos cells was clearly impaired (see Supplemental Fig. 1, available in the on-line version of this article). However, the cells were not NFκB-negative but instead showed a delayed activation, with NFκB DNA-binding levels being ∼33% reduced at 2- and 4-h time points compared with vector-transduced controls. Inhibition of NFκB in Do-11.10 Cells Results in a Switch from FasL- to TNF-dependent AICD, Which Is Reversed by A20 —In the Do-11.10 T cell hybridoma model of AICD, TCR signaling results in Fas/CD95-dependent apoptosis. Because Do/κBneg cells showed increased sensitivity to TCR-induced cell death with apoptotic cells occurring ∼2 h earlier than in controls, we asked whether cell death proceeds by a different molecular mechanism in Do/κBneg compared with Do/κBpos cells. Analyzing the involvement of different death receptors from the TNFR superfamily with specific blocking reagents confirmed FasL as principal inducer of cell death in anti-CD3-treated Do-11.10 cultures. Unexpectedly, anti-TNF reagents also consistently reduced the level of AICD in Do-11.10 cell by ∼50% (Fig. 4A). Reagents blocking TRAIL and TWEAK were ineffective (data not shown). In striking contrast to Do/κBpos cells, AICD in Do/κBneg cells was minimally reduced by anti-FasL mAb but very effectively blocked by anti-TNF reagents (Fig. 4A). Do/κBpos cells overexpressing A20 showed AICD very similar to cells transduced with empty vector. Interestingly, Do/κBneg cells reconstituted with A20 also showed normal AICD hardly distinguishable from Do/κBpos controls (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that, in the absence of NFκB, the FasL/Fas pathway operates inefficiently and instead cells die by endogenous TNF. Moreover, the reliance on the FasL/Fas pathway can be restored by A20 overexpression in Do/κBneg cells, demonstrating that A20 is a major target of NFκB downstream of the TCR. The involvement of TNF in AICD of Do-11.10 cells was unexpected because A1.1 hybridomas were reported to exclusively rely on the Fas and not the TNFR pathway (32Wang R. Zhang L. Zhang X. Moreno J. Luo X. Tondravi M. Shi Y. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1983-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Other studies, however, suggest that TNF sensitizes hybridoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (33Elzey B.D. Griffith T.S. Herndon J.M. Barreiro R. Tschopp J. Ferguson T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3049-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We therefore stimulated Do-11.10 cells with TNF and agonistic anti-Fas mAb. Neither of these reagents alone was ca"
https://openalex.org/W1973291880,"The concept that the tumor suppressor p53 is a latent DNA-binding protein that must become activated for sequence-specific DNA binding recently has been challenged, although the “activation” phenomenon has been well established in in vitro DNA binding assays. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we analyzed the binding of “latent” and “activated” p53 to double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing or not containing a p53 consensus binding site (DNAspec or DNAunspec, respectively). In the absence of competitor DNA, latent p53 bound DNAspec and DNAunspec with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner. Activation of p53 by the addition of the C-terminal antibody PAb421 significantly decreased the binding affinity for DNAunspec and concomitantly increased the binding affinity for DNAspec. The net result of this dual effect is a significant difference in the affinity of activated p53 for DNAspec and DNAunspec, which explains the activation of p53. High affinity nonspecific DNA binding of latent p53 required both the p53 core domain and the p53 C terminus, whereas high affinity sequence-specific DNA binding of activated p53 was mediated by the p53 core domain alone. The data suggest that high affinity nonspecific DNA binding of latent and high affinity sequence-specific binding of activated p53 to double-stranded DNA differ in their requirement for the C terminus and involve different structural features of the core domain. Because high affinity nonspecific DNA binding of latent p53 is restricted to wild type p53, we propose that it relates to its tumor suppressor functions.

Because high affinity nonspecific DNA binding of latent p53 is restricted to wild type p53, we propose that it relates to its tumor suppressor functions. The tumor suppressor p53 is a DNA-binding protein with several DNA binding activities. Of those, sequence-specific DNA binding is the most important one because it mediates the transcriptional activity of p53 (1Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5744) Google Scholar). Sequence specificity of DNA binding is determined by the recognition of sequences that share homology to the consensus sequence 5′-(RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY)n-3′, where R is a purine nucleotide, and Y is a pyrimidine nucleotide (3El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Although sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 has been analyzed in great detail since its discovery in 1991 (4Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), the detailed molecular interaction of p53 with its target sequences in promoter elements is still a matter of debate. In particular, the question of whether sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 requires an activation step is discussed controversially (Ref. 5Ahn J. Prives C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 6Kim E. Deppert W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Earlier observations had indicated that unmodified p53 seems to be inactive for sequence-specific DNA binding, whereas various posttranslational modifications in the p53 C-terminal domain, binding of the monoclonal antibody PAb421 that recognizes an epitope within the p53 C terminus, or deletion of the 30 C-terminal amino acids strongly enhance sequence-specific DNA binding under certain in vitro conditions (7Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The data imply that the C terminus negatively regulates sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The inhibiting effects of the C terminus were explained by the “conformation” model, which postulates that the p53 protein exists in two distinct conformations termed “latent” (for DNA binding inactive p53) and “activated” (for DNA binding active p53). According to this model, the C-terminal domain in “latent” p53 directly interacts with the core domain, thereby inhibiting sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). A conformational switch that converts latent p53 into an “activated” form relieves the allosteric inhibition. However, recent evidence strongly argues against the conformation model, because the overall conformation of p53 in a DNA binding active or inactive form seems to be quite similar (9Ayed A. Mulder F.A.A. Yi G.-S. Lu Y. Kay L.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although the latency concept could also be explained by other models (like e.g. the “competition” or “interference” model (10Anderson M.E. Woelker B. Reed M. Wang P. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6255-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the most critical argument against p53 latency is that activation of p53 does not seem to be required in vivo (11Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) or in different in vitro settings (11Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Heinrichs S. Gimnopoulos D. Meibner H. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7310-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Activation thus seems to be restricted to certain in vitro assays.Several features have been delineated that might account for the apparent discrepancies, like type of binding assay (12Kim E. Albrechtsen N. Deppert W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Espinosa J. Emerson B. Mol.

In particular, the need for activation of p53 for sequence-specific DNA binding seems to be restricted to the interaction of p53 with short linear DNA and the application of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; CRD, C-terminal regulatory domain; DBD, DNA binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; CRD, C-terminal regulatory domain; DBD, DNA binding domain. for the analysis of sequence-specific DNA binding. Therefore, the concern has been raised that the “activation phenomenon” may be an artifact (11Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 14Espinosa J. Emerson B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, numerous laboratories have reproducibly observed the activation phenomenon in various assays. Therefore, its disqualification as an “artifact” could be shortsighted, as it might reflect an important and biologically relevant feature of p53-DNA interactions that, for some reasons, is only revealed under certain experimental conditions.To further address the issue of p53 latency and activation, we employed EMSA and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to the analysis of the binding of p53 to double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. FCS is based on the measurement of translational diffusion of fluorescent-labeled molecules through a confocal detection volume (10–15 liter). The method focuses on the detection of single particles rather than on averages over large numbers of particles as conventional macroscopic fluorescence detection methods. The fluorescence emission from the small detection volume is recorded in a time-resolved manner. Thus, the fluorescence quanta that belong to one fluorescing species can easily be identified by auto-correlating the time-resolved signals. Autocorrelation is a function of the diffusion times and the fractions of the different fluorescing species (17Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 18Weiss S. Science. 1999; 283: 1676-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). For the setup used in FCS readers, the optimal concentration range of the fluorescing species is between 1 and 10 nm, guaranteeing a good fluctuation of the fluorescence signal. At higher concentrations the spontaneous fluorescence fluctuation decreases and, thus, the measured signal as well. Differences in size and/or shape of free (unbound) or protein-bound fluorescent-labeled DNA molecules result in different translational diffusion times, thereby allowing quantitative analysis of protein-DNA interactions (e.g. K D and K I measurements) in solution. Specifically, the DNA-bound p53 protein (∼192 kDa for the p53 tetramer) can be quantitatively discriminated from unbound oligonucleotide DNA (∼20 kDa) in solution because of a 10-fold difference in molecular mass. Importantly, FCS enables a quantitative analysis of p53-DNA interactions in the absence or presence of various modifiers of p53 DNA binding without the need to “quench” unspecific DNA interactions using competitor DNA.Here we provide evidence that latent and activated p53 are able to bind to short double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides with high affinity. However, high affinity DNA binding of latent p53 is not sequence-specific. Sequence-specific recognition of the target DNA requires activation of p53 by PAb421. Activation is accompanied by a moderate increase in binding affinity for specific DNA and a significant drop in the affinity for nonspecific DNA. We propose that high affinity sequence-specific and nonspecific interactions of p53 with DNA require different modes of DNA recognition by the p53 core domain that are regulated by the p53 C terminus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—Recombinant p53 proteins (human and mouse) expressed in insect cells were isolated as described in Bessard et al. (19Bessard A.C.H. Garay E. Lacronique V. Legros Y. Demarquay C. Houque A. Portefaix J.M. Granier C. Soussi T. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and purified by ion-exchange chromatography as described previously (20Janus F. Albrechtsen N. Knippschild U. Wiesmueller L. Grosse F. Deppert W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2155-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).EMSA—DNA binding experiments were performed using 50 ng of recombinant p53 proteins in a reaction mixture containing 5 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl. After a 20-min preincubation at room temperature 20,000 cpm of the labeled DNA probe was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 25 min. Samples were loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.25 mm sodium acetate, and 8 mm acetic acid at 200 V for 2.5 h at room temperature. After electrophoresis gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography.DNA Binding Assay Using FCS—A confocal microscope (ConfoCor; EVOTEC BioSystems and Carl Zeiss, Germany) was used for FCS studies. An attenuated (to about 800 microwatts) beam from an argon ion laser, wavelength 543 nm, was focused to a spot of ∼0.25-μm radius, resulting in a diffusion time of ∼60 μs for 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). The excitation intensity had generally been kept lower than or equal to a level characterized by about 15% amplitude of the triplet term of the autocorrelation function. Fluorescence emission was detected through a pinhole on the focal plane of the microscope using an avalanche photodiode detector SPCM-AQ 131 (EG&G) at 590 nm (bandwidth 35 nm).For the binding and the competition experiments human or mouse p53 was incubated with the TAMRA-labeled DNA for 15 min at 20 °C. In the case of competition titrations, the competitor was added together with the labeled DNA. In the case of activation of the sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 the protein was preincubated with PAb421 for 15 min at 20 °C before the addition of the DNA. All experiments were performed in 15-μl binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6.9), 0.05% Tween 20). Virtually identical results were obtained with human and mouse wild type p53. Binding data were fitted according to the standard hyperbolic binding model or according to the Hill equation (where mentioned), applying the fitting program Origin 6.0.RESULTSHigh Affinity Nonspecific DNA Binding Is a Specific Feature of Unmodified Wild Type p53 Protein—Sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 is commonly assessed by EMSA in the presence of competitor DNA to inhibit nonspecific DNA interactions. Depending on the kind of competitor DNA, its effects on sequence-specific DNA binding may greatly vary (10Anderson M.E. Woelker B. Reed M. Wang P. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6255-6264Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nonspecific DNA binding of p53 thus may represent an important parameter influencing sequence-specific DNA binding. We first analyzed by EMSA sequence-specific DNA binding and nonspecific DNA binding of p53 in the absence or presence of the antibody PAb421 (“unmodified” and “PAb421-modified” p53, respectively). PAb421 recognizes an epitope within the p53 C terminus (21Stephen C.W. Helminen P. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 58-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and its binding is thought to mimic the binding of cellular proteins or posttranslational modifications that activate p53 for sequence-specific DNA binding. Unmodified wild type p53 bound with similar apparent affinities to both specific and unspecific DNA (DNAspec and DNAunspec, respectively) in the absence of competitor DNA (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 2, complex A and A′, respectively). The addition of PAb421 strongly enhanced binding to DNAspec (Fig. 1A, lane 3, complex B′), in accordance with the proposed ability of PAb421 to activate sequence-specific DNA binding (7Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). With DNAunspec, PAb421 only supershifted the complex p53·DNAunspec (Fig. 1B, lane 3, complex B) but did not enhance its formation.To estimate the impact of unspecific competitor DNA on sequence-specific DNA binding, we analyzed the effects of poly(dI-dC) on DNA binding of p53. Depending on whether or not p53 was modified by PAb421, poly(dI-dC) competed with specific and unspecific DNA with a different dose dependence. Although already the presence of 10 ng poly(dI-dC) almost completely abolished binding of PAb421-modified p53 to DNAunspec (Fig. 1B, lane 7, complex B), complete inhibition of binding of unmodified p53 to DNAunspec required much higher amounts (100 ng) of poly(dI-dC) (Fig. 1B, lane 11, complex A). The data suggest that PAb421-modified p53 binds weaker to unspecific DNA than unmodified p53. A reversed pattern was observed with DNAspec, as poly(dI-dC) much more efficiently competed out binding of unmodified p53 compared with binding of PAb421-modified p53 to DNAspec (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–17, complex A′ or B′, respectively).The results indicate that unmodified and PAb421-modified p53 differ in their binding to DNAspec and to DNAunspec. Whereas unmodified p53 binds DNAunspec and DNAspec equally well, the binding affinity of PAb421-modified p53 is shifted toward DNAspec. The weaker binding of PAb421-modified p53 to DNAunspec compared with unmodified p53 suggests that the p53 C terminus is involved in the high affinity interaction of unmodified p53 with DNAunspec. The conclusion is supported by the finding that nonspecific DNA binding of p53 was completely abolished by deletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain (CRD), as the deletion mutant p53-(1–360) lacking the CRD strongly bound to DNAspec (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–9) but completely failed to bind DNAunspec (Fig. 1D, lanes 2–9) even in the absence of competitor DNA (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Thus, high affinity nonspecific DNA binding of unmodified p53 requires the CRD.Importantly, mutant p53 proteins R248P and G245S not only were unable to bind DNAspec but also did not bind DNAunspec regardless of whether poly(dI-dC) was present or not (EMSA data not shown). Thus, the ability to bind unspecific double-stranded DNA with high affinity is an intrinsic biochemical property of wild type p53 that correlates with its potential to bind DNA sequence-specifically.Unmodified Wild Type p53 Does Not Discriminate between Specific and Unspecific DNA—To quantitatively analyze p53-DNA interactions in solution, we next examined by FCS the effects of PAb421 on DNA binding of wild type p53. Two types of TAMRA-labeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were used, DNAspec, containing a p53 specific binding site, or DNAunspec, lacking such a sequence (see Table I for oligonucleotides used in FCS). The same DNAspec oligonucleotide had been used in the initial study describing the phenomenon of p53 latency and activation (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). We first analyzed DNA binding of unmodified purified wild type p53 in the absence of poly(dI-dC). Binding titrations were performed at a constant concentration of TAMRA-DNA and increasing p53 concentration. Very similar dissociation constants (K D) of 17.7 ± 2.1 and 18.5 ± 2.2 nm were determined for the binding of tetrameric unmodified wild type p53 to TAMRA-DNAspec and to TAMRA-DNAunspec, respectively (Fig. 2A and Table II).Table IOligonucleotides (ODNs) used for binding analysis of p53ODNSequence (from 5′ to 3′)26-mer TAMRA-DNAspecTAMRA-AGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCTADNAspecAGCTTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCTA35-mer DNAunspecTATGTCTAAGGGACCTGCGGTTGGCATTGATCTTG26-mer TAMRA-DNAunspecTAMRA-TATGTCTAAGGGACCTGCGGTTGGCA Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Characterization of DNA binding specificity of unmodified wild type p53 by FCS.

Open table in a new tab The minimal size of p53-specific binding sites corresponds to 20 base pairs and accommodates a single p53 tetramer (1Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 4Kern S.E. Kinzler K.W. Bruskin A. Jarosz D. Friedman P. Prives C. Vogelstein B. Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Although the oligonucleotides used here were only slightly larger (26 base pairs; see Table I), we still considered the possibility that more than one p53 tetramer could bind to a single oligonucleotide molecule. Such a binding behavior would influence the interpretation of the binding data shown above. To analyze the binding mode of p53 to DNA with respect to stoichiometry and cooperativity, we alternatively fitted the binding data applying the Hill equation y = n × [p53]n/(K D + [p53]n), where y is the portion of DNA bound to p53, and n is the number of p53 binding sites on the DNA (see Table II). The fitting results clearly show that for both, specific and unspecific DNA, the binding stoichiometry is 1:1 for the interaction partners and that no cooperativity is observed. In accordance with our EMSA experiments, mutant p53 R248P did not bind to either DNA, indicating that high affinity unspecific binding to linear DNA is a specific property of wild type p53 (Fig. 2A).The binding of unmodified wild type p53 to both DNAspec and to DNAunspec with similar high affinity suggested that such p53 was not able to discriminate between specific and unspecific DNA. The conclusion was corroborated by competition experiments which showed that TAMRA-DNAspec bound by unmodified p53 was displaced from the p53·DNA complex by unlabeled DNAspec and DNAunspec with comparable efficiencies (K I = 19.2 ± 6.0 and 21.1 ± 4.5 nm, respectively, Fig. 2B and C, Table II). The results of our FCS experiments are in accordance with our EMSA data and show that unmodified wild type p53 does not discriminate between sequence-specific and unspecific DNA and binds with high affinity to double-stranded linear DNA independent of the presence of a cognate binding motif.PAb421 Increases the Binding Affinity of Wild Type p53 for DNA spec While Concomitantly Decreasing the Binding Affinity for DNAunspec—We next analyzed the effects of PAb421 on the binding of p53 to DNAspec and to DNAunspec. Fig. 3A and Table II show that the affinity of PAb421-modified p53 for TAMRA-DNAspec increased only moderately, i.e. by a factor of ∼15 (K D = 1.1 ± 0.2 nm). In accordance, the K I for DNAspec also dropped to 0.7 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. 3B, Table II). In contrast to the increase in affinity for TAMRA-DNAspec by PAb421, the affinity of PAb421-modified p53 for TAMRA-DNAunspec was greatly reduced (K D = 169 ± 17 nm, Fig. 3A and Table II). The net outcome of these adverse effects of PAb421 on the respective p53-DNA interactions is a drastic (150-fold) difference in the affinity of PAb421-modified p53 for DNAspec compared with DNAunspec. Competition experiments using the 35-mer DNAunspec, used in the initial study describing the latency phenomenon (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), showed an even larger (∼3,000-fold) difference in the affinity of PAb421-modified p53 to unspecific DNA. The 35-mer DNAunspec was only able to effectively displace TAMRA-DNAspec from the complex with PAb421-modified p53 with a KI of 2700.0 ± 1300 nm (Fig. 3C, Table II). The results imply that modification of p53 by PAb421 leads to a significant reduction of its binding affinity for unspecific DNA, with the degree of reduction possibly varying with DNA length. Further analysis of the binding data using the Hill equation showed that PAb421 did not influence stoichiometry or cooperativity of binding (Table II). As expected, mutant p53 R248P did not bind to DNAspec even in the presence of PAb421 (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3DNA binding specificity of PAb421-modified wild type p53 analyzed by FCS. A, protein titration experiments were performed to determine the binding affinity of wild type (wt) p53 to DNAspec and DNAunspec after the addition of PAb421 (250 nm). Titrations were performed at a constant concentration of TAMRA-labeled DNA (1 nm). The concentration of tetrameric p53 was varied. ▪, wild type p53 + TAMRA-DNAspec; ▴, wild type p53 + 26-mer TAMRA-DNAunspec; •, mutant p53 R248P + TAMRA-DNAspec. B, displacement of TAMRA-DNAspec bound to PAb421-modified wild type p53 with DNAspec. The concentrations of tetrameric p53 (2 nm), of TAMRA-DNAspec (1 nm), and PAb421 (250 nm) were constant. The concentration of DNAspec was varied. C, displacement of TAMRA-DNAspec bound to PAb421-modified wild type p53 with DNAunspec. The concentrations of tetrameric p53 (2 nm), TAMRA-DNAspec (1 nm), and PAb421 (250 nm) were constant. The concentration of DNAunspec was varied.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Again, the results of the FCS analyses are concordant with our EMSA data (Fig. 1). The data suggest that PAb421 modulates the specificity of p53 DNA binding rather than increasing its binding affinity for DNAspec. We propose that PAb421 has a dual effect on p53, leading to sequence-specific recognition of DNAspec accompanied by a significant decrease in the affinity of p53 for DNAunspec.Fig. 4A demonstrates another important aspect of the activation of p53 DNA binding by PAb421. At low molar ratios of p53:DNAspec (2:1 nm in Fig. 4A), DNA binding by unmodified p53 was hardly detectable because the concentrations of the binding partners were much below the K D of ∼17.7 ± 2.1 nm (see Fig. 2A). Under such conditions, the addition of PAb421 strongly enhanced the fraction of DNAspec bound by p53. The enhancement, however, can be solely explained by the moderately higher affinity of PAb421-modified p53 to DNAspec (K D = 1.1 ± 0.2 nm) compared with that of unmodified p53 (K D = 17.7 ± 2.1 nm). Fig. 4A thus exemplifies that under certain conditions even a moderate difference in the binding affinity of p53 to a given DNA substrate can be relevant. In addition, Fig. 4A, as an important control, shows that PAb421 as such does not bind DNA. Furthermore, activation of p53 is specific for PAb421, because the addition of PAb1801, binding to an epitope in the p53 N terminus (22Leppard K. Totty N. Waterfield M. Harlow E. Jenkins J. Crawford L. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1993-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), did not have an effect on p53 binding to DNAspec.Fig. 4Influence of p53 specific antibodies on p53 binding to DNAspec.

Proliferation of eukaryotic cells requires sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (1Harper J.W. Curr.

The activity of these enzymes is regulated positively and negatively by transcriptional, translational, and post-translational mechanisms. p27 is a negative regulator of Cdk2-cyclin E and Cdk2-cyclin A, the activities of which are required for G1 to S transition and for triggering DNA replication (3Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The levels of p27 fluctuate during cell cycle progression. In quiescent cells, p27 is metabolically stable and accumulates. When quiescent cells begin to divide and enter the cell division cycle, p27 is rapidly degraded, thereby releasing Cdk2-cyclin E (4Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Increased Cdk2-cyclin E activity drives cells from G1 phase into S phase of the cell cycle. Numerous studies have established that the stability of p27 is primarily controlled by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Polyubiquitinated p27 is targeted to the 26 S proteasome and degraded (4Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of p27 occurs when it is phosphorylated by Cdk2-cyclin E kinase at Thr-187 during the G1 to S transition (5Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E.

It has been shown previously that the SCFSkp2 complex containing Skp1, Skp2, Cul1, Rbx/Roc1 is responsible for recognizing phosphorylated p27 and catalyzing its ubiquitination (9Sutterluty H.

Skp2 activity is required for S phase entry because a neutralizing antibody against Skp2 blocks cell cycle progression (11Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that Skp2 is a member of a diverse family of proteins that share a common sequence motif named the F-box. Skp1 directly binds to the F-box motif and mediates assembly of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase complex (12Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) offers an unprecedented view of the molecular organization of this complex. At the center of the complex is the cullin, which interacts with all three subunits and serves as a scaffold. Skp2, which contains a carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that has been implicated in binding to the substrate phosphorylated p27, is located ∼50 Å away from the charged E2 enzyme based on the structure model (15Zheng N. Schulman B.A. Song L. Miller J.J. Jeffrey P.D. Wang P. Chu C. Koepp D.M. Elledge S.J. Pagano M. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Harper J.W. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how substrates are recognized and ubiquitin chains are formed. One way to fill this gap is to recruit an “adapter” protein to bridge the E3 and substrates (1Harper J.W. Curr.

Indeed, ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27 requires an accessory protein called Cks1 (17Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat.

Cks1 was originally discovered as an essential gene product in yeast that forms a complex with Cdks (19Hayles J. Beach D. Durkacz B. Nurse P. Mol. Gen.

They have identified two essential amino acid residues in Cks1 that are required for interaction with Skp2 and ubiquitination of p27. However, the regions of Skp2 that are involved in binding to Cks1 remain unknown. Here we have used deletion and a site-specific mutagenesis approach to elucidate the regions of Skp2 that are required for Cks1 interaction and ubiquitination of p27. Our results indicate that Cks1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 and that Asp-331 is essential for binding. Mutation of Asp-331 to Ala abrogates Skp2-Cks1 interaction. An Asp-331 to Glu mutation does not affect Skp2-Cks1 interaction, suggesting that the specificity of this interaction depends on the presence of a negatively charged amino acid at this position. Cell Lines and Transfection—Human 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). 293T cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). DNA Expression Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—Mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3-Skp2 and Skp2ΔF were kindly provided by Drs. Pagano and Zhou. Human Skp2 and Skp2ΔF were subcloned into pEXL, a mammalian expression vector that has been described previously (25Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). All Skp2 deletion or point mutations were constructed by the QuikChange site-specific mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pCMV-Sport6-Skp1 expression vector was purchased from ATCC. Human Myc-tagged CUL1 and HA-Roc1 were kindly provided by Zhou. Human Cks1 and Cks2 expression vectors were purchased from ATCC and subcloned into pGEX4T-1-His-Tev, an expression vector derived from pGEX-4T-1 by inserting a cassette containing a 6 × His tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site. Recombinant Cks1 and Cks2 were purified as GST fusion protein using glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were subsequently released from beads by incubation with a TEV protease (Invitrogen) overnight at 4 °C. Untagged native proteins were further purified using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions corresponding to Cks1 or Cks2 were collected and stored in QA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus 10% glycerol. A similar procedure was used to purify the recombinant Cks1 mutant proteins. FLAG-tagged Cks1 and Cks2 were constructed by inserting the coding region of the sequences into pMX-FLAG-IRES-GFP vector described previously (25Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E.

Recombinant baculoviruses expressing GST-Skp1, Cul1, Roc1, FLAG-Skp2, GST-cyclin E, and Cdk2 were kindly provided by Dr. Wade Harper. Baculoviruses were amplified in Sf9 cells and co-infections were carried out in Hi-Five cells (Invitrogen). SCF complex and Cdk2-cyclin E were purified using GST affinity chromatography and stored in QA buffer at –80 °C. To reconstitute the mutant SCF complex, Skp2 mutants were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pFASTBacHTA vector (Invitrogen), and recombinant baculoviruses were generated following the manufacturer's instructions. Binding Assays—Wild type and Skp2 mutants were prepared and labeled with [35S]Met using a TNT in vitro translation kit (Promega). Binding assays were performed by incubating 10 μl of [35S]Met-Skp2 with 1 μg of GST-Cks1 or GST-Cks2 in 0.5 ml of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h. 20 μl of glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the mixture and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. GST beads were retrieved by brief centrifugation and washed three times with 0.5 ml of NETN buffer. 30 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer were added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The results of binding were expressed as the percentage of labeled proteins retained on the beads relative to total input. The binding efficiency of Skp2 mutants was expressed as the strength relative to the wild type Skp2. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Five microliters of in vitro translated [35S]Met-p27 were phosphorylated by incubation with 0.5 μg of GST-Cdk2-cyclin E in 10× ER (10 mm ATP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgOAc, 300 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase) at 30 °C for 45 min. GST-Cdk2-cyclin E was affinity-purified from insect cells that had been infected previously with the recombinant baculovirus. The ubiquitination reaction was carried out by adding the following to the phosphorylation reaction in a final volume of 30 μl: 250 ng of E1 (Boston Biochemical), 3 μg of 6×-His-cdc34, 5 μg of SCFSkp2 complex, 1 μg of ubiquitin, 1.5 μg of methylated ubiquitin (Boston Biomedical), 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 2 μl of MG 132, 2.5 μlof10× ER,1mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of Cks1. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. SDS-PAGE and phosphoimaging analyses were used to evaluate the results. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Protein extracts were prepared from cell lines by lysing equal numbers of cells directly in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol). The protein concentrations were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were resolved on 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis was performed using the FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-Skp2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p27 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. The proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) with an ECL DuraWest detection kit (Pierce). To assay protein binding in cultured cells, Skp2, Skp1, Cul1, Rbx1/Roc1, and FLAG-Cks1 or FLAG-Cks2 expression vectors were cotransfected into 293T cells. Protein extracts were prepared as described above. Immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the indicated antibodies to bring down the protein complex, followed by immunoblotting analysis. The Carboxyl Terminal Region of Skp2 Is Involved in Binding to Cks1 in Vitro—Previous studies have established that human Cks1 binds to Skp2 in vitro and interaction between Cks1 and Skp2 is required for ubiquitination of p27 (17Ganoth D.

To determine the region of Skp2 that is involved in binding to Cks1, we constructed several deletion mutants lacking various regions of Skp2. These deletion mutants were synthesized and labeled with 35S by in vitro translation and incubated with recombinant GST-Cks1 or GST-Cks2 prepared in bacteria. As shown in Fig. 1, wild type Skp2 shows strong binding to Cks1 but not to Cks2, in good agreement with previous reports (17Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 18Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol.

Although deletion of the amino-terminal region of Skp2 or the F-box had little effect on their association with Cks1, removal of the last 105 amino acids completely abolished Skp2-Cks1 interaction. This experiment suggests that the carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 is required for its association with Cks1 and this region may contain a specific binding site for Cks1 (Fig. 1). Asp-331 Is Required for Skp2-Cks1 Interaction in Vitro—To identify the potential Cks1 binding surface in Skp2, we studied the crystal structures of the Skp1-Skp2 complex determined by Pavletich and coworkers (14Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 15Zheng N.

Nature. 2002; 416: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar) as well as the structure of the Cks1-Cdk2 complex solved by Tainer and coworkers (27Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 28Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Arvai A.S. Bernstein S.L. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 consists of seven LRRs followed by a 30-amino acid residue carboxyl-terminal tail that extends backward and packs loosely into the concave surface of the LRR domain. On the other hand, Cks1 is folded into four antiparallel β-strands and two short α-helices and interacts with the GDSEID and (ST)FPXW motifs of Cdk2. The concave side of Skp2 appears to be an ideal surface binding based on observations in other systems (29Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 30Hsiung Y.G. Chang H.C. Pellequer J.L. La Valle R. Lanker S. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2506-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Another striking feature of Skp2 structure is the unusual distribution of surface electrostatic potential. A patch of surface located near the carboxyl terminus of Skp2 is significantly more electronegative than the rest of the protein surface (Fig. 2A). Coincidentally, this negative patch is located in the area of the concave surface of Skp2. The amino acids that contribute to this negative patch are two negatively charged aspartates (Asp-328 and -331). Both of them are on the surface and exposed to solvent in the crystal structure (Fig. 2B). Alignment of Skp2 from different species indicates that these two residues are highly conserved (Fig. 2C), raising the question whether the electronegative nature of the surface is important for its function. To determine whether these two negatively charged aspartates are important for Skp2-Cks1 association, we mutated these two residues to alanines (DLSD → ALSA). As shown in Fig. 3 and Table I, mutation of these two aspartates completely abolished the interaction between Cks1 and Skp2. Next, to test whether either one of the two aspartates or both are required for binding, single amino acid substitution mutants were generated. Mutation of Asp-328 to Ala caused a slight drop in binding efficiency; on the other hand, mutation of Asp-331 abrogates Skp2 binding to Cks1 just like the double mutant (Fig. 3 and Table I). Mutation of other residues in this area such as Ser-330 does not affect Cks1-Skp2 interaction (Fig. 3, lanes 16–18). Therefore, Asp-331 appears to play an important role in Cks1-Skp2 interaction.Fig. 3Asp-331 is required for Skp2-Cks1 interaction in vitro. Skp2 mutants were constructed by the Quik-Change XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and labeled with [35S]Met by in vitro translation. Association between Skp2 mutants and Cks1 or Cks2 was measured by binding assays described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKey amino residues of Skp2 involved in binding to Cks1Cks1 bindingWT+++D328A/D331A-D328A++-D328E++-D331A-D331E+++S330A+++ Open table in a new tab If negative charge is important for Cks1-Skp2 interaction, we would expect that an aspartate to glutamate change should have minimal effects on Cks1 and Skp2 interaction. To test this, Asp-331 was changed to Glu. As shown in Fig. 3, Skp2 D331E binds to Cks1 comparable with the wild type (lanes 13–15). Taken together, the mutagenesis results indicate that a negatively charged residue at position 331 of Skp2 plays an important role in mediating interaction with Cks1. Asp-331 Is Required for Skp2-Cks1 Interaction in Vivo—The above experiment established the importance of Asp-331 in Skp2-Cks1 interaction in vitro. To test whether this region is also important for association between Skp2 and Cks1 in cultured cells, we transfected the wild type and various Skp2 mutants along with FLAG-Cks1 into 293T cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using cell lysates prepared from transiently transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, all Skp2 mutants expressed at a level virtually identical to Skp2 as determined by immunoblotting with the anti-Skp2 antibody. When immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody, both transiently transfected and endogenous Skp2 were able to associate with FLAG-Cks1 (Fig. 4, lane 1 versus lane 9). However, the Skp2 carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant and the Skp2 D328A/D331A double mutant fail to precipitate efficiently (lanes 2 and 3). Only the endogenous Skp2 was precipitated in this assay (compare lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 9). Asp-331 single mutant showed a decrease in Cks1 association in vivo but not as dramatic as observed in vitro (lane 6 and Fig. 3, lane 11). This could be attributed to other factors influencing Skp2-Cks1 interaction in vivo. Just as we observed in vitro, the Asp-331 to Glu change has no effect on Skp2-Cks1 binding in vivo (lane 7). Therefore, the co-immunoprecipitation experiment not only confirms the binding results in vitro but also suggests that this interaction was maintained in intact cells. Significance of Skp2 Asp-331 in p27 Ubiquitin Ligation— Previous studies indicate that Cks1-Skp2 interactions are required for p27 ubiquitination by SCFSkp2 p27 (17Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K.

Cks2, which is a closely related human homologue and shares 85% homology with Cks1, is unable to substitute for the function of Cks1. The key difference between Cks1 and Cks2 documented by Hershko and coworkers (24Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) lies in the α2-helix of Cks1. Cks1 → Cks2 mutation at Ser-41 → Glu or Asn-45 → Arg abolishes the ability of Cks1 to support p27 ubiquitination and binding to Skp2. To confirm these observations, we constructed S41E and N45R Cks1 mutants and measured their binding to Skp2 (Table II. In agreement with previous observations, the N45R mutation completely disrupted the interaction between Cks1 and Skp2 (Fig. 5A, lane 5); however, the S41E mutant still bound Skp2 but at a reduced level (Fig. 5A, lane 4).Table IIKey amino residues of Cks1 involved in binding to Skp2Skp2 bindingCks1+++Cks2-Cks1S41E++-Cks1N45R- Open table in a new tab To determine the effect of the Cks1-Skp2 interaction on p27 ubiquitination, we performed in vitro p27 ubiquitin ligation assays using a reconstituted system. SCF complex was expressed and purified using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant p27 was phosphorylated by a recombinant Cdk2-cyclin E complex purified from Hi-Five cells prior to incubation with E1, E2(Cdc34), and SCFSkp2. As shown in Fig. 5B, ubiquitination of p27 depends on phosphorylation by cyclin E/Cdk2 and occurs in the presence of Cks1 but not Cks2. Addition of S41E Cks1 can partially support ubiquitination of p27, but not the N41R mutant (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). These results are consistent with previous data suggesting that the interactions between Cks1 and Skp2 are required for p27 ubiquitination. To determine the effects of Skp2 Asp-331 mutation on assembly of the SCF complex and its ability to cause p27 ubiquitination, we prepared SCFSkp2DLSD→ALSA by co-expressing Cul1, Rbx1, Skp1, and the Skp2 ALSA mutant in insect cells. First, we determined whether the Skp2 double mutant affects the ability of Skp2 to assemble the SCF complex. As shown in Fig. 6A, recombinant mutant SCF complex prepared from insect cells is indistinguishable from its wild type counterpart (Fig. 6A, lane 1 versus 2). Judging from Skp1 affinity purification and immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 6B), mutant Skp2 is still able to interact with Skp1 and form a core complex with Cul1 as well as Rbx/Roc1. As a control, a complex lacking Skp2 expression was also prepared (Fig. 6A, lane 3). Equal amounts of the wild type SCF or mutant SCF or Skp2-deficient SCF were incubated with phosphorylated p27 in the presence of E1 and E2. As shown in Fig. 6C, the wild type SCF was able to catalyze strong ubiquitination of p27, whereas the mutant SCF or Skp2-deficient SCF failed to convert any p27 at appreciable levels (Fig. 6C, lanes 2–4). Taken together, these data suggest that Asp-331 is required for SCF E3 activity and this activity is correlated with its ability to interact with p27. Asp-331 of Skp2 Is Not Required for Skp2 Self-ubiquitination—Skp2 can undergo self-ubiquitination in the absence of substrates (31Wirbelauer C. Sutterluty H. Blondel M. Gstaiger M. Peter M. Reymond F. Krek W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5362-5375Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that self-ubiquitination of the F-box is a mechanism for facilitating dynamic exchange of the SCF complex (32Zhou P. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 571-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 33Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). To determine whether Asp-331 of Skp2 plays a role in self-ubiquitination, we measured the efficiency of the wild type or mutant Skp2 ubiquitination in the SCF complex. As shown in Fig. 7, the wild type Skp2 is capable of undergoing self-ubiquitination as judged by the presence of high molecular weight Skp2 bands in the reaction (Fig. 7, lane 1). Self-ubiquitination of Skp2 requires the activity of E1 and E2, because reactions without these two components did not exhibit significant modification of Skp2 (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3). The Skp2 double mutant SCF is also capable of self-ubiquitination in a manner indistinguishable from the wild type. This experiment suggests that Asp-331 is only required for SCFSkp2 to transubiquitylate p27 but not required for Skp2 self-ubiquitination. In addition, this provides independent proof that Asp-331 mutation does not adversely affect the integrity of SCFSkp2. Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases is required for cell cycle progression. Removal of the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase such as p27 through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is one of the major mechanisms that eventually leads to kinase activation. It has been well established that the SCFSkp2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex recognizes phosphorylated p27 and catalyzes its polyubiquitination prior to targeting degradation by the 26 S proteasome. The molecular mechanism underlying p27 recognition and entrance into the SCF complex remains unclear. Here we identified a key amino acid residue in Skp2 that is required for p27 ubiquitination. We showed that Asp-331 in Skp2 mediates physical interaction with Cks1, an essential adapter protein for bringing in phosphorylated p27. In addition, our results suggest that a negatively charged amino acid at this position is important for binding specificity between Cks1 and Skp2. Thus, substrate recognition specificity of a given E3 ubiquitin ligase may be governed by additional interactions between the F-box protein and an accessory protein. Skp2 is a member of a large family of F-box proteins whose primary function is thought to be mediating ubiquitination of a variety of substrates that are destined for degradation. In addition to the three helices that constitute the F-box motif, Skp2 also contains 10 LRR that form a sickle-shaped concave structure and a 30-amino acid unstructured carboxyl-terminal tail. It has been suggested that the concave LRR of another F-box protein, Grr1, may be involved in recognition of the substrate (30Hsiung Y.G. Chang H.C. Pellequer J.L. La Valle R. Lanker S. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2506-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Potential roles of the concave surface of Skp2 in recognition of other proteins have not been defined. Here we provide evidence that the Asp-331 located on the surface of the concave LRR is required for Skp2 recognition of Cks1. Mutation of Asp-331 to alanine negates the interaction. It is unlikely that the effect we observed is due to disruption of the general structure of Skp2. First, Asp-331 → Ala or Asp-328 → Ala/Asp → Ala double mutants are expressed at levels indistinguishable from the wild type Skp2 in vivo. Second, these mutants are still able to bind Skp1 and can assemble into the SCF complex in Hi-Five cells similarly to the wild type protein, indicating mutation of these residues does not appear to affect molecular interactions within the SCF core complex. Third, Skp2 with mutations of Asp-328 and -331 to alanine undergoes self-ubiquitination just as the wild type. Together these provide strong arguments for the structural and functional integrity of Skp2 mutants. Crystallographic analysis of Cks1 and closely related homologs indicates that the Cks1 family of proteins forms a four-stranded β-sheet surface. They all contain an anion-binding site, which could potentially bind to a phosphate, sulfate, or to acidic residues in proteins (27Bourne Y. Watson M.H. Hickey M.J. Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I.

Ser-41 and Asn-45, Leu-31 and Ala-29 appear to be involved in direct binding to Skp2. These amino acids are located on a convex surface of Cks1 formed by the α2- and α1-helices (24Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We have constructed similar mutations in Cks1 in this study. In agreement with the results of Sitry et al. (24Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the N45R mutation completely abolishes the interaction between Skp2 and Cks1; however, the S41E mutation displays much higher affinity than previously reported and still is capable of supporting ubiquitination of p27 in vitro at a reduced efficiency (Fig. 5, lane 3). Despite this minor discrepancy, our data are consistent with the view that the α2-helix of Cks1 may be directly involved in binding to Skp2. Extensive mutagenesis analysis near Asp-331 indicates that this amino acid appears to be the only one that has a significant impact on Skp2-Cks1 interaction. In support of our original hypothesis that the electronegative surface potential near Asp-331 is important for protein-protein interaction, we found that a conservative change of Asp-331 → Glu has apparently no effect on Skp2-Cks1 interaction. It is very likely that this negatively charged amino acid in Skp2 is recognized directly by Cks1. Assuming this could be the case, it is tempting to speculate that the anion-binding site in Cks1 could be involved in recognizing Asp-331. Further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis. Our identification of the essential residues involved in the Skp2-Cks1 interaction was aided by examination of the surface electrostatic properties of the Skp2 crystal structure utilizing the GRASP program (34Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). The impact of our mutations on the Skp2 surface electrostatic potential was also investigated by modeling Fig. 8. Although the D328A mutation in Skp2 has a modest and localized effect on the surface electrostatic potential, D331A mutation appears to have a much more dramatic effect, changing the surface potential from negative to positive relative to the rest of the protein surface. (The comparison of surface electrostatic potential is made on the same scale in the modeling). This modeling is consistent with the experimental observation that D331A mutation had a much more pronounced effect on Skp2 function. It would be interesting to test whether this type of analysis is generally applicable to design mutagenesis strategies to dissect the mechanism of protein-protein interaction. We have identified a critical amino acid that is required for Skp2-Cks1 interaction. It is possible that this negatively charged amino acid is responsible for the specificity of the interaction. Other regions of Skp2, in particular, hydrophobic amino acids on the surface of Skp2, may provide the main source of binding energy. We are working on identifying additional amino acid residues that are required for the Skp2-Cks1 interaction. We thank Drs. Wade Harper, Michele Pagnao, and Pengbo Zhou for the generous supply of the cDNA clones and reagents used in this study, Jim Goodrich and Ming Lei for advice on baculovirus expression and recombinant protein purification, and members of the Liu laboratory for helpful discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2005760588,"O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase is a homodimeric enzyme catalyzing the last step of cysteine biosynthesis via a Bi Bi ping-pong mechanism. The subunit is composed of two domains, each containing one tryptophan residue, Trp50 in the N-terminal domain and Trp161 in the C-terminal domain. Only Trp161 is highly conserved in eucaryotes and bacteria. The coenzyme pyridoxal 5′-phosphate is bound in a cleft between the two domains. The enzyme undergoes an open to closed conformational transition upon substrate binding. The effect of single Trp to Tyr mutations on O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase structure, function, and stability was investigated with a variety of spectroscopic techniques. The mutations do not significantly alter the enzyme secondary structure but affect the catalysis, with a predominant influence on the second half reaction. The W50Y mutation strongly affects the unfolding pathway due to the destabilization of the intersubunit interface. The W161Y mutation, occurring in the C-terminal domain, produces a reduction of the accessibility of the active site to acrylamide and stabilizes thermodynamically the N-terminal domain, a result consistent with stronger interdomain interactions.

The biosynthesis of cysteine in bacteria and plants is accomplished by the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) 1The abbreviations used are: PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; OASS, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase; OAS, O-acetyl-l-serine; TNB, 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate; Ches, 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; SAT, serine acetyltransferase; WT, wild type.-dependent enzyme O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS). PLP-dependent enzymes are currently classified into three functional families, depending on the mechanism of the catalyzed reaction, and into 5-fold types, depending on the structural arrangement. OASS belongs to the β-family and to the fold type II, with the overall reaction catalyzed by the enzyme being a β-replacement. Members of the β-family include, among others, the β-subunit of tryptophan synthase, cystathionine β-synthase, and threonine dehydratase. Depending on the subcellular compartment and on the growth conditions, many isoforms of OASS have been described (1Kuske C.R. Hill K.K. Guzman E. Jackson P.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2Tai C.H. Nalabolu S.R. Jacobson T.M. Minter D.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In Salmonella typhimurium, the OASS-A isoform is responsible for the synthesis of l-cysteine from sulfide and O-acetylserine (OAS). Catalysis follows a Bi Bi ping-pong kinetic mechanism (2Tai C.H. Nalabolu S.R. Jacobson T.M. Minter D.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2023-2029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is accompanied by large conformational changes that result in the transition from an open to a closed form of the enzyme (4Burkhard P. Tai C.H. Ristroph C.M. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5McClure G.D. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1674-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The conformational changes are triggered by the hydrogen bonding of the α-carboxylate group of the substrate OAS to Asn69 and to other residues belonging to the “asparagine loop.” The rearrangement of the side chain of Asn69 is transmitted to a subdomain of the N-terminal domain that rotates by 13° from the position occupied in the native enzyme. The conformational changes result in the formation of new hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the N-and C-terminal domains. The microenvironment generated by these structural rearrangements stabilizes and orients the external aldimine for the elimination reaction and protects the highly reactive α-aminoacrylate intermediate formed upon acetate elimination. A low thermodynamic stability was evidenced for holo-OASS (6Bettati S. Benci S. Campanini B. Raboni S. Chirico G. Beretta S. Schnackerz K.D. Hazlett T.L. Gratton E. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40244-40251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Most of the stabilization free energy was demonstrated to derive from the binding of the cofactor to the active site, with a more pronounced effect on the C-terminal domain (7Bettati S. Campanini B. Vaccari S. Mozzarelli A. Schianchi G. Hazlett T.L. Gratton E. Benci S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which appears to be more stable than the N-terminal domain. The lower stability of the N-terminal domain supports the notion of a relationship between a marginal structural stabilization and the flexibility required for catalysis. OASS possesses two tryptophan residues: Trp50 in the N-terminal domain and Trp161 in the C-terminal domain. Both residues are exposed to solvent, with Trp161 located in a more hydrophilic environment than Trp50 (Fig. 1) (8Burkhard P. Rao G.S.J. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Upon excitation at 298 nm, an energy transfer process takes place between the tryptophans and PLP. Structural data (8Burkhard P.

Tryptophan residues are often well conserved in protein sequences (9Uchiyama T. Katouno F. Nikaidou N. Nonaka T. Sugiyama J. Watanabe T. J. Biol.

Recently, it has been observed that often tryptophan residues are preferentially located in stable regions of proteins (21Wrabl J.O. Larson S.A. Hilser V.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1032-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and their substitution with other amino acids commonly results in the destabilization of the structure and in the modification of the folding/unfolding mechanism (see Ref. 14Fulton K.F. Jackson S.E. Buckle A.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and references therein) (22Honda Y. Fukamizo T. Okajima T. Goto S. Boucher I. Brzezinski R.

J. 2001; 357: 269-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we prepared two single tryptophan mutants of OASS: W50Y and W161Y. The presence of a single tryptophan residue in the mutants allows separate probes of the structure and dynamics of the N- and C-terminal domains. The aim of the present work was to characterize the role of the tryptophans in the structure, function, and stability of OASS and to gain insight into the unfolding processes of the N- and C-terminal domains. Chemicals and Molecular Biology Reagents—Hepes, O-acetyl-l-serine, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), PLP, LB broth, citric acid, magnesium chloride, KH2PO4, Na(NH4)HPO4, thiamine, l-tryptophan, reduced glutathione, l-leucine, ampicillin, and streptomycin sulfate were from Sigma. Dithiothreitol and guanidine hydrochloride were from Fluka, and p-terphenyl was from Aldrich. Restriction enzymes and DNA ligase were from Amersham Biosciences, Promega, or U.S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis and sequencing were from Invitrogen or MWG-Biotech AG. All of the reagents were of the best commercially available quality and were used without further purification. Bacterial Strains and Expression Vectors—The single tryptophan mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli NK3 cells that lack cysK and cysM genes. The cysK gene encodes for OASS-A, whereas cysM encodes for OASS-B (24Tai C.H. Cook P.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 185-234PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pRSM40 (25Rege V.D. Kredich N.M. Tai C.H. Karsten W.E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13485-13493Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was used as the expression vector for the W50Y mutant. The plasmid pCKM3, used for the expression of the W161Y mutant, contains the cysK gene and its natural promoter on an EcoRI/SphI fragment from pRSM40. The expression of S. typhimurium OASS-A in both pRSM40 and pCKM3 constructs is under the control of the natural promoter for cysK. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutation Trp50 → Tyr was introduced using a PCR-based method with the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-GCCGTATCGGCGCCAACATGATTTATGATGCCGAAAAGCG-3′ and 5′-GCAGCAACCGCGGCGCCGGAAG-3′. The sequence coding for the tyrosine residue is indicated in boldface type, and the restriction sites for the enzyme NarI are underlined. WT pRSM40 was digested with NarI and purified from agarose gel to generate the vector. The amplified fragment from the PCR carrying the mutation TGG → TAT was digested with NarI, and the insert was purified from agarose gel and cloned into the vector. The W161Y mutant was obtained using the kit Altered Sites® II (Promega). The mutation was introduced using the following primer: 5′-GGCCCGGAAATCTATGAAGACACCGAT-3′. The EcoRI/SphI fragment from pRSM40 was cloned into the mutagenesis vector pALTER. E. coli strain ES1301 was used for plasmid propagation and plasmid isolation. E. coli strain JM109 was used for plasmid long term maintenance. Following mutagenesis, the EcoRI/SphI fragment carrying the mutation was cloned into pBR322 to generate the expression vector pCKM3. Single Tryptophan Mutants Expression and Purification—Cultures of E. coli NK3 transformed with mutagenized pCKM3 or pRSM40 were grown at 37 °C in a fermentor using a medium composed of Vogel Bonner E supplemented with 0.5% glucose, 5% LB, 50 μm thiamine, 40 μml-tryptophan, 0.5 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm l-leucine, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the protein was partially purified by streptomycin and ammonium sulfate precipitation as described previously (26Hara S. Payne M.A. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1990; 1: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The chromatographic procedure for the purification of the W50Y mutant was similar to that of the WT enzyme (2Tai C.H. Nalabolu S.R. Jacobson T.M. Minter D.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and was followed by a final size exclusion chromatographic step on an Ultrogel-AcA 44 column (IBF Biotechnics). The purification of the W161Y mutant was carried out through a three-step chromatographic procedure on a HiTrap DEAE FF column (Amersham Biosciences), an Ultrogel-AcA 44 column (IBF Biotechnics), and a HiTrap Q Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Based on SDS-PAGE, the W50Y and W161Y mutants were 99% and 90–95% pure, respectively. Buffers—Absorbance, steady-state, and time-resolved fluorescence experiments were carried out in a buffer solution containing 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, in the absence and presence of defined concentrations of GdnHCl. Circular dichroism measurements were carried out in buffer solutions containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and different concentrations of GdnHCl. Denaturant-containing solutions were prepared according to Pace (27Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997Google Scholar). GdnHCl concentration was determined by measuring the solution refractive index. Absorption, Steady-state Fluorescence, and Circular Dichroism Measurements—Absorption measurements were carried out using a Cary 400 Scan or, for the activity assays, a Cary 219 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were collected on either a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B or a SPEX Fluoromax-2 photon-counting fluorometer (Jobin-Yvon). Circular dichroism measurements were carried out using a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. Each spectrum is the average of three measurements. Fractions of α and β structure were calculated by deconvoluting the spectra with CD Spectra Deconvolution software, version 2.1 (Gerald Böhm; see Ref. 28Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired at 20 ± 0.5 °C and were corrected for solvent contribution. Spectra of the single tryptophan mutants, equilibrated at different GdnHCl concentrations, were acquired after an incubation of 24 h at 20 °C. Fluorescence Quenching Measurements—The accessibility of the cofactor of WT and W161Y OASS was assessed by fluorescence quenching with acrylamide. Acrylamide was chosen due to its neutral nature and the absence of ionic strength effects on the fluorescence properties of the cofactor. Experiments on the WT protein were performed both for the open and the closed form of the enzyme. Experiments were carried out on solutions containing 40 μm OASS and either 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, for the open form of the enzyme or 100 mm Ches, pH 9.0, in the presence of 100 mm l-Ser for the closed form. Spectra, collected upon excitation at 330 nm, were corrected for solvent contribution. Data were analyzed according to a modified Stern-Volmer equation (29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar), assuming two fluorescent and noninteracting species, where only species A is quenchable by acrylamide, F0F=1+KSVA[Q](1+KSVA[Q])(1-fA)+fA(Eq. 1) where F 0 is the fluorescence intensity in the absence of the quencher, F is the fluorescence at each given quencher concentration, KSVA is the Stern-Volmer constant relative to the accessible site A, [Q] is the concentration of the quencher, and fA is the fraction of initial fluorescence emitted by species A. Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence intensity decays were measured by the phase and modulation technique (30Spencer R.D. Weber G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 158: 361-376Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 31Gratton E. Limkeman M. Biophys. J. 1983; 44: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The instrument set up was described previously (7Bettati S. Campanini B. Vaccari S. Mozzarelli A. Schianchi G. Hazlett T.L. Gratton E. Benci S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence lifetimes of the single tryptophan mutants were measured at a protomer concentration of 3.3 μm, upon excitation at 295 nm. A p-terphenyl solution in ethanol (1.05 ns) was used as a lifetime standard reference. To eliminate polarization artifacts in the intensity decay, data were collected under magic angle conditions with the excitation light polarized normal to the laboratory plane, 0°, and the emission polarizer oriented at 54.7° (30Spencer R.D. Weber G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 158: 361-376Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Samples were equilibrated at 20 ± 0.5 °C using a jacketed cell holder and a circulating water bath. Data were fitted to a sum of discrete exponentials (32Jameson D.M. Hazlett T.L. Dewey T.G. Biophysical and Biochemical Aspects of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 106-133Google Scholar) with lifetime τ i and fractional intensity fi by the Marquardt algorithm of the Globals Unlimited software (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL) (33Beechem J.M. Gratton E. Lakowicz J.R. Time-Resolved Laser Spectroscopy in Biochemistry, SPIE Proceedings Vol. 909. International Society for Optical Engineering, Bellingham, WA1988: 70-81Google Scholar). A short component of 1 ps was introduced to account for any Rayleigh or Raman scattering contributions (32Jameson D.M. Hazlett T.L. Dewey T.G. Biophysical and Biochemical Aspects of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 106-133Google Scholar). The fractional contribution of the short component to the total emission was always less than 3%. Frequency-independent S.E. values of 0.2° for phase data and 0.004 for modulation data were routinely applied. The χ2 minimization was the criterion used to select the best fits (31Gratton E. Limkeman M. Biophys. J. 1983; 44: 315-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 32Jameson D.M. Hazlett T.L. Dewey T.G. Biophysical and Biochemical Aspects of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1991: 106-133Google Scholar). Equilibrium Denaturation Curves—The dependence of signal intensity I on denaturant concentration [D] was fitted to a two-state model according to the equation, I=IN+(IU+SU[D])e([D]-D50)mRT1+e([D]-D50)mRT(Eq. 2) where I is either the fluorescence emission intensity at a given wavelength or the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, IN and IU are the extrapolated signal values for the native and denatured protein, respectively, SU is a post-transitional slope reflecting the dependence of the signal on denaturant concentration, D 50 is the denaturant concentration at half-transition, and m is the denaturant index. The experimental data points were converted to fraction of total effect FU by using the fitting parameters previously determined, according to the equation, FU=IN-IIN-(IU+SU[D])(Eq. 3) The equilibrium unfolding constants KU at each denaturant concentration were calculated from the equation, KU=FU1-FU(Eq. 4) The KU values were used to calculate the unfolding free energies. ΔGU0=-RTlnKU(Eq. 5) ΔG0,U0, the free energy change in the absence of denaturant, and m were calculated using the linear extrapolation method (34Greene R.F. Pace C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5388-5393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ΔGU0=ΔG0,U0-m[D](Eq. 6) D 50 was calculated as follows: D50=ΔG0,U0m(Eq. 7) Reversibility of the Denaturation Reaction—The calculation of thermodynamic parameters from equilibrium denaturation curves requires that the denaturation reaction is fully reversible (27Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1997Google Scholar). The reversibility of the denaturation of WT holo-OASS and of W161Y and W50Y mutants was assessed diluting a solution of the unfolded enzyme in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and monitoring the kinetics of the refolding reaction via fluorescence emission spectroscopy upon excitation at 298 nm. The native emission spectrum of WT holo-OASS was recovered within 1 h. A similar result was obtained for W161Y mutant. On the contrary, the reversibility of the unfolding of the W50Y mutant appears to be only partial, since the enzyme never recovers the fluorescence emission spectrum typical of the native protein. For this reason, the fitting of the equilibrium denaturation curves of W50Y mutant only provides indicative D 50 values, useful for comparison with the WT enzyme but devoid of any thermodynamic significance. Enzyme Activity—A schematic mechanism for the OASS-A reaction is given in Scheme 1. where A, B, and P represent OAS, TNB, and acetate, respectively; E is the free enzyme, E(SB1) is the OAS external Schiff base, E(SB2) is the S-(3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyl)-l-cysteine external Schiff base, and E(AA) is the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base. For the reported kinetic mechanism, when k 5 is fast compared with k 3 and k 4 (see also Refs. 35Hwang C.C. Woehl E.U. Minter D.E. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F.

Enzyme activity was assayed using OAS and TNB as substrates in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, at 20 °C (2Tai C.H. Nalabolu S.R. Jacobson T.M. Minter D.E. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). OAS and TNB concentrations were varied over a range of 0.5–2 mm and 25–100 μm, respectively. Since under these conditions neither substrate inhibits OASS activity, the initial velocity patterns were fitted to the equation for a simple Bi Bi ping-pong kinetic mechanism (37Segel I.H.

Absorbance Spectra of W50Y and W161Y Mutants—The UV-visible spectra of the single tryptophan mutants are qualitatively similar to the spectrum of the WT protein, showing two peaks centered at 278 and 412 nm (Fig. 2). Both mutations cause a decrease of the intensity of the peak at 278 nm, due to the lower extinction coefficient of the tyrosine residue with respect to tryptophan. The peak at 412 nm, attributed to the ketoenamine tautomer of the PLP internal aldimine (3Cook P.F. Wedding R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2023-2029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Becker M.A. Kredich N.M. Tomkins G.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2298-2303Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), is still present, indicating that the mutation has not hampered the binding of PLP to the protein active site. The ratio between the intensity at 280 nm and at 412 nm is 3.4–3.6 in WT OASS and 2.8 and 2.6 in W161Y and W50Y mutants, respectively. The spectrum of the W161Y mutant shows a slightly higher absorbance at 330 nm with respect to the WT OASS and to the W50Y mutant, suggesting the presence of an increased population of the enolimine tautomer of the internal aldimine (43Faeder E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1041-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Emission Spectra of Single Tryptophan Mutants—Emission spectra of the single tryptophan mutants were collected upon excitation at 298 nm (Fig. 3). The spectra are characterized by a major peak, centered at about 335 nm, due to the direct tryptophan emission, and a minor peak centered at 500 nm that, in the WT enzyme, was attributed to the energy transfer process occurring predominantly between Trp50 and the cofactor (8Burkhard P. Rao G.S.J. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 44Strambini G.B. Cioni P. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8392-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the WT enzyme, the ratio between the tryptophans and the cofactor emissions is about 7. The peak intensity at 500 nm for the W161Y mutant and the WT protein is the same, thus reinforcing the concept of an energy transfer process that involves Trp50 as the principal donor. Unexpectedly, also the W50Y mutant shows a band at 500 nm, which exhibits an intensity about half of that of the wild type protein, indicating the occurrence of an energy transfer process between Trp161 and PLP. The ratio between the emission at 330 nm and the emission at 500 nm for the W161Y mutant is about 2.6, whereas the ratio increases to 5.7 for the W50Y mutant. The sum of the spectra of the two mutants gives a spectrum that is not superimposable with that of the WT enzyme (Fig. 3). In particular, the tryptophan emission intensity is lower, and the cofactor emission is about twice that measured for the wild type protein. Fluorescence Lifetimes of W50Y and W161Y Mutants and Comparison with the WT Holo-OASS—The effect of the mutations on the local environment of the remaining tryptophan residue was examined by measuring the fluorescence emission lifetimes of the native protein (Table I). Fluorescence lifetimes are very sensitive to tryptophan microenvironment, allowing the detection of small changes in their solvent exposure. The fluorescence emission decay of WT holo-OASS is well described by three discrete species (7Bettati S. Campanini B. Vaccari S. Mozzarelli A. Schianchi G. Hazlett T.L. Gratton E. Benci S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The longer lifetime (5.5 ns) was mainly attributed to Trp50 emission, whereas the intermediate (2.1 ns) lifetime was mainly attributed to Trp161 emission (Table I) (7Bettati S. Campanini B. Vaccari S. Mozzarelli A. Schianchi G. Hazlett T.L. Gratton E. Benci S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission decays of single tryptophan mutants were fitted to a sum of two exponentials plus a fixed short component (1 ps), accounting for the scattered light (Table I). The W50Y mutant is characterized by a lifetime of 2.3 ns, accounting for 91% of the total emission, and a short lifetime of about 0.8 ns. The W161Y mutant fluorescence decay is dominated by a short lifetime (0.9 ns), accounting for 75% of the emission, accompanied by a longer lifetime (4.7 ns), accounting for 25% of the emission. This finding confirms the lifetime attribution carried out on the WT enzyme (7Bettati S. Campanini B. Vaccari S. Mozzarelli A. Schianchi G. Hazlett T.L. Gratton E. Benci S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and indicates that the substitution of the tryptophan residue in one domain has no significant long range effects on the microenvironment of the tryptophan in the other domain.Table IFluorescence lifetimes and fractional intensities for WT OASS, W50Y mutant, and W161Y mutantOASSτ1τ2τ3f1f2f3nsnsnsWT5.5 (Trp50"
https://openalex.org/W1963950954,"The immunosuppressant Tacrolimus (FK506) has increased the survival rates of organ transplantation. FK506 exerts its immunosuppressive effect by inhibition of the protein phosphatase calcineurin in activated T-cells. Unfortunately, FK506 therapy is associated with undesired non-therapeutic effects involving targets other than calcineurin. To identify these targets we have addressed FK506 cellular toxicity in budding yeast. We show that FK506 increased cell sensitivity upon osmotic challenge independently of calcineurin and the FK506-binding proteins Fpr1p, -2p, -3p, and -4p. FK506 also induced strong amino acid starvation and activation of the general control (GCN) pathway. Tryptophan prototrophy or excess tryptophan overcame FK506 toxicity, showing that tryptophan deprivation mediated this effect. Mutation of the GCN3 and -4 genes partially alleviated FK506 toxicity, suggesting that activation of the GCN pathway by FK506 was also involved in osmotic tolerance. FK506 enhanced osmotic stress-dependent Hog1p kinase phosphorylation that was not accompanied by induction of a Hog1p-dependent reporter. Interestingly, deletion of the GCN2 gene suppressed FK506-dependent Hog1p hyperphosphorylation and restored Hog1p-dependent reporter activity. Conversely, deletion of the HOG1 gene impaired FK506-dependent activation of Gcn2p kinase and translation of a GCN4-LacZ reporter, highlighting functional cross-talk between the Gcn2p and Hog1p protein kinases. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both FK506-induced amino acid starvation and activation of the GCN pathway contribute to cell sensitivity to osmotic stress and reveal a positive regulatory loop between the Hog1p and Gcn2p pathways. Given the conserved nature of Gcn2p and Hog1p pathways, this mechanism of FK506 toxicity could be relevant to the non-therapeutic effects of FK506 therapy.

FK506 and cyclosporin A (CsA) 1The abbreviations used are: CsA, cyclosporin A; HOG, High-Osmolarity-Glycerol; GCN, general amino acid control; eIF-2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CRE, cAMP-response element; WT, wild type. are immunosuppressants used to prevent allograft rejection after organ transplantation. FK506, by complexing with the immunophilin FK506-binding protein, blocks the activity of the calcium-calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase calcineurin (1Dumont F.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 731-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Inhibition of calcineurin impedes nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-AT, which controls interleukin-2 gene expression. CsA also inhibits the NF-AT/interleukin-2 pathway through complex formation with another immunophilin, cyclophilin (1Dumont F.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 731-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). FK506 and CsA therapies are associated with non-therapeutic toxicities (2Vanrenterghem Y.F. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1999; 8: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Among them, posttransplant diabetes mellitus is frequently observed (3Weir M.R. Fink J.C. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1999; 34: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Recent studies have confirmed the greater diabetogenic potential of FK506 versus CsA in transplant patients (3Weir M.R. Fink J.C. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1999; 34: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4Duijnhoven E.M. Boots J.M. Christiaans M.H. Wolffenbuttel B.H. Van Hooff J.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 583-588PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that calcineurin inhibition does not mediate this effect. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms of FK506-induced posttransplant diabetes mellitus still remain obscure. Because of its tractable genetics and ease of manipulation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent eukaryotic model to identify target(s) for drugs that have unknown mechanisms of action (5Matthews D.J. Kopczynski J. Drug Discov. Today. 2001; 6: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). High osmolarity in yeast triggers the HOG mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, leading to increased transcription of stress-responsive genes and to intracellular accumulation of glycerol (6Mager W.H. Varela J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Kultz D. Burg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 3015-3021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in external osmolarity are sensed by two transmembrane proteins acting independently and converging at the level of the MAP kinase kinase Pbs2p, which controls dual phosphorylation and activation of Hog1p (8Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). Active Hog1p translocates to the nucleus and regulates part of the osmotic gene expression by direct phosphorylation of transcriptional activators like Hot1p (9Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and repressors like Sko1p (10Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Arino J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Sko1p binds to CRE-like sequences found in the promoters of several genes involved in adaptation to high osmolarity such as the ENA1 gene, encoding an Na+-ATPase (10Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Additionally, nuclear Hog1p associates with the transcriptional machinery and modulates promoter binding of these transcription factors (12Alepuz P.M. Jovanovic A. Reiser V. Ammerer G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Proft M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1307-1317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Hog1p also regulates its own intracellular distribution by induction of its nuclear export mediated by its kinase activity (14Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Other responses to osmotic stress include inhibition of nutrient uptake, protein synthesis, and the expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins in yeast (6Mager W.H. Varela J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Posas F. Chambers J.R. Heyman J.A. Hoeffler J.P. de Nadal E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17249-17255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear how osmotic stress transiently down-regulates protein synthesis, recent evidence suggests that it might be mediated by the Hog1p MAP kinase pathway itself (16Teige M. Scheikl E. Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5625-5630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 17Uesono Y. Toh E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13848-13855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). FK506 inhibits amino acid uptake in yeast and induces translation of the transcriptional activator Gcn4p (18Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GCN4 translation is controlled by a regulatory pathway activated by amino acid or purine starvation and called the general control pathway (GCN) (19Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). In response to nutrient deprivation, S. cerevisiae induces phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) at serine 51 by the Gcn2p protein kinase (19Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Translational regulation of GCN4 is mediated by four short open reading frames located in the 5′-untranslated region of GCN4 (uORFs). In cells without nutrient limitation, the uORFs block GCN4 translation efficiently (19Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 20Abastado J.P. Miller P.F. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Upon amino acid or purine deprivation, Gcn2p-dependent phosphorylation of eIF-2α leads to reduced active eIF-2 levels, thus allowing increased GCN4 translation because of bypassing the uORFs. High levels of Gcn4p stimulate expression of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis (21Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We report here that FK506 increased the sensitivity of yeast cells to osmotic stress by inducing amino acid starvation and strong activation of the GCN pathway. We found that activation of the GCN pathway regulated the activity of the Hog1 MAP kinase pathway by distinct mechanisms. At least one of these mechanisms involved a positive regulatory loop between the Gcn2p and Hog1p protein kinases that has not been described previously. These results also suggest that transient inhibition of protein synthesis by osmotic stress might be regulated by Hog1p and Gcn2p at the initiation step. Given the conserved nature of the Gcn2p and Hog1p pathways, these FK506-dependent events could be of significance to the secondary effects of FK506 treatment. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The fpr1, -2, -3, and -4 strains, lacking the corresponding immunophilins and the quadruple fpr1–4 mutant strain, have the JK93.da genetic background (MATa his4 HMLa leu2–3, 112 rme1 trp1 ura3–52). These mutants together with their isogenic parental strain have been described previously (22Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The rest of the strains used in this study have the W3031a genetic background (MATa, ade2–1, can1–100, his3–11, leu2–3, trp11–1, ura3.1). The cnb1 strain, harboring a disruption of the calcineurin regulatory subunit CNB1, has been described (23Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The LEU2, URA3, HIS3, and TRP1 strains were generated by transformation of the W3031a strain with the YCpIF1 (LEU2), YCpIF4 (URA3), YCpIF7 (HIS3), and YCpIF15 (TRP1) plasmids, respectively (24Foreman P.K. Davis R.W. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The gcn1, -2, -3, and -4 strains have also been described (25Goossens A. Dever T.E. Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30753-30760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Likewise the hog1 strain, lacking the HOG1 gene, has been described (26Eberhardt I. Hohmann S. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed by standard procedures (27Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Willems A.R. Woods R.A. Yeast. 1995; 11: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). The URS CREENA1-CYC1-LacZ pMP224 reporter plasmid has been described previously (10Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The plasmid p180, expressing a GCN4-LacZ fusion including the entire GCN4 5′-non-coding region with four upstream open reading frames inserted into YCp50, a low copy-number plasmid marked with URA3, has also been described (28Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The HIS4-LacZ p377 reporter plasmid has been described previously (29Pinson B. Sagot I. Borne F. Gabrielsen O.S. Daignan-Fornier B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3977-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—Yeast cells transformed with the appropriate reporter plasmids were grown selectively in S.D. medium and then diluted in YPD. Exponential cultures were treated with FK506 and/or sorbitol as indicated. β-Galactosidase activity was determined at the indicated times as described elsewhere (30Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and represented as β-ga-lactosidase activity units. Data are the mean ± S.E. from three independent transformants, each one measured in duplicate. Yeast Growth Assays—Standard methods for yeast culture and manipulations were used (31Prinz W. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 315: 289-290Crossref Google Scholar). Synthetic medium (S.D.) contained 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), and the amino acids, purine, and pyrimidine bases required by the strains of interest. YPD medium contained 2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract. FK506 was kindly provided by Fujisawa Inc., dissolved in ethanol, and diluted in YPD at the corresponding doses. For analysis of cell growth by drop test, logarithmically growing cells in liquid YPD medium were 10-fold serially diluted, and volumes of around 3 μl were dropped with a stainless steel replicator (Sigma) on solid plates containing 2% Bacto-Agar (Difco) and YPD medium with the corresponding doses of FK506 and/or sorbitol (Sigma) as indicated. Growth was recorded after 2–5 days in all cases. For viability assays, exponentially growing cultures in liquid YPD were collected by centrifugation, and an equal number of cells were plated onto YPD plates containing the corresponding doses of FK506 and/or sorbitol. Colonies were quantitated after 2–5 days in all cases. Data represented are the mean ± S.E. of at least two independent experiments, each one done in duplicate. The ability of yeast cells to grow in various liquid conditions was tested by adding equal amounts of cells from overnight cultures in YPD to 3 ml of YPD supplemented with the corresponding doses of FK506 and/or sorbitol. OD660 was measured at the indicated time points. Growth inhibition (%) for a given strain in FK506-containing medium was expressed as the ratio of the OD660 obtained for this strain to the OD660 of the control culture. Immunoblotting—Strains were grown in liquid YPD medium to midlog phase and then treated with the corresponding doses of FK506 and/or sorbitol at the indicated times. After treatment, equal numbers of cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were lysed by glass-beads vortexing. Insoluble protein extracts were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in alkaline Laemmli buffer. 20 μg of total cellular protein was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran®, Schleicher & Schüll) filters. Uniform gel loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of membranes after transfer. Phosphorylated Hog1p was detected with an antiphospho-p38 antibody (Thr180-Tyr182) from New England Biolabs (NEB). Phosphorylated eIF-2α was detected with an antiphospho-eIF-2α antibody (Ser51) from New England Biolabs. Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) using a HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad). The figures show an experiment representative of at least two independent ones with essentially identical results. FK506 Confers Sensitivity to Osmotic Stress in Yeast Independently of Calcineurin and FK506-binding Proteins—Previous evidence has revealed the existence of new targets of FK506 other than calcineurin in budding yeast (32Marton M.J. DeRisi J.L. Bennett H.A. Iyer V.R. Meyer M.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Burchard J. Slade D. Dai H. Bassett Jr., D.E. Hartwell L.H. Brown P.O. Friend S.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). To identify these targets, we screened for FK506 effects on yeast cell growth under different conditions. We used the WT W303.1a strain and the cnb1 mutant, which lacks the calcineurin regulatory subunit CNB1 and has no detectable calcineurin activity. Interestingly, we found that FK506, in addition to inhibiting growth under normal conditions, dramatically increased cell sensitivity to sorbitol in both strains (Fig. 1A). CsA did not induce any detectable osmotic sensitivity at doses 20-fold higher than those used for FK506 (Fig. 1A). Other candidate targets mediating this sensitivity could be one or some of the immunophilins known to be intracellular targets of FK506. S. cerevisiae has four of these proteins encoded by the FPR1, -2, -3, and -4 genes, respectively (22Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that neither fpr1, -2, -3, and -4 nor the quadruple fpr1–4 mutants were resistant to FK506 toxicity at high doses (22Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the effect of FK506 on the growth under osmotic shock of immunophilin single mutants and the fpr1–4 quadruple mutants. As shown in Fig. 1B, disruption of the immunophilin genes did not improve cell growth in the presence of sorbitol and FK506, in agreement with previous findings (22Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33Lorenz M.C. Muir R.S. Lim E. McElver J. Weber S.C. Heitman J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Therefore, FK506-induced sensitivity to high osmolarity in yeast was independent of the known targets calcineurin and immunophilins. Tryptophan Prototrophy or Excess Tryptophan Overcomes FK506-induced Osmotic Stress Sensitivity in Yeast—FK506 impairs S. cerevisiae cell growth by inhibition of tryptophan, histidine, and leucine import in yeast strains auxotrophic for these amino acids (18Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Koller A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6597-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Accordingly, prototrophy for one of these amino acids or an excess of tryptophan or histidine added exogenously to the growth medium rescued the growth defect (34Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Koller A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6597-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We assessed whether amino acid prototrophy was also able to modulate the FK506 osmotic phenotype in a set of WT strains prototrophic for histidine, leucine, tryptophan, or uracil by testing the growth of these strains in sorbitol-containing medium with FK506. As shown in Fig. 2A, only the WT-TRP1 strain was able to grow in the presence of FK506. Consistent with this, excess tryptophan in the growth medium also relieved FK506 osmotic sensitivity in the WT and the cnb1 mutant (Fig. 2B). Therefore, these results confirm that tryptophan availability alleviates the FK506 sensitivity to osmotic stress in a calcineurin-independent manner. FK506-induced Tryptophan Deprivation Activates the General Control Pathway—FK506 blocks amino acid import, generating starvation of amino acids, and stimulates GCN4 translation (18Heitman J. Koller A. Kunz J. Henriquez R. Schmidt A. Movva N.R. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5010-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Koller A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6597-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To determine whether GCN4 translation was dependent on general control pathway activation, we tested the effect of FK506 on the p180 GCN4-lacZ reporter in the WT and gcn1, -2, -3, and -4 yeast strains. The p180 reporter contains the entire GCN4 5′-untranslated region driving expression of the LacZ gene. GCN1 together with GCN20 encode adaptor proteins, which bind to ribosomes and interact with GCN2 kinase mediating its activation by uncharged tRNAs (35Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Marton M.J. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3184-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 36Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ufano S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1887-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GCN3 encodes the α subunit of eIF-2B, a multisubunit guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates levels of GTP-bound eIF-2α. Phosphorylated eIF-2α binds to Gcn3p and blocks eIF-2B exchange function favoring selective translational induction of GCN4 (37Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6603-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38Pavitt G.D. Yang W. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1298-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 39Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). When expression from the GCN4-LacZ reporter was measured 3 h after FK506 addition, 3-fold induction was seen in the WT strain but was absent in all of the gcn mutants tested (Fig. 3A). We also tested a HIS4-LacZ reporter containing the HIS4 promoter driving the LacZ gene in the WT and gcn1, -2, and -3 strains. Expression of HIS4-LacZ increases after amino acid starvation in a Gcn4p-dependent manner (40Lucchini G. Hinnebusch A.G. Chen C. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1326-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As expected, following FK506 addition there was a 4-fold increase in HIS4-LacZ expression after 3 h in the WT strain, which was abolished in the gcn mutants (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, tryptophan prototrophy or addition of excess tryptophan also abolished GCN4-LacZ induction by FK506 (Fig. 3C). Therefore, these data show that FK506 induces GCN4 control by activating the GCN pathway. Furthermore, these findings confirm that starvation for tryptophan is the most relevant event triggering GCN4 expression in response to FK506. Disruption of the GCN Pathway Alleviates FK506-induced Osmotic Sensitivity—Recently, a functional connection between the GCN pathway and tolerance to salt stress has been described (25Goossens A. Dever T.E. Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30753-30760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Disruption of the GCN pathway increased tolerance to NaCl suggesting that (over)activation of this pathway had toxic effects on cell growth under salt stress. If the same was true for FK506, then its toxicity should be modulated by inactivation of the GCN pathway. To test this possibility, we analyzed the growth of the gcn1, -2, -3, and -4 mutants in the presence of sorbitol and/or FK506. Deletion of GCN1 and -2 did not affect FK506 sensitivity to high osmolarity. Remarkably, FK506-induced sensitivity to osmotic stress was substantially reduced in the gcn3 and -4 mutants (Fig. 4A). We further characterized the gcn3 and -4 suppression of FK506 osmotic sensitivity by measuring the growth of the WT and the gcn1, -2, -3, and -4 mutants under osmotic stress in the presence or absence of FK506. As a control we used the WT-TRP1 strain, which is resistant to FK506 toxicity. Unexpectedly, FK506 inhibited cell growth to the same extent in all the strains tested (Fig. 4B), suggesting that resistance to FK506 toxicity in the gnc3 and -4 mutants was due to increased cell viability rather than improved cell growth under stress conditions. To test this hypothesis we measured the ability of each mutant to form viable colonies in sorbitol-containing plates with or without FK506. As shown in Fig. 4C, the colony-forming ability of the WT-TRP1 strain remained unaffected in the presence or absence of FK506. The number of viable colonies in FK506-containing medium was substantially higher in the gcn3 and -4 mutants than in the WT-trp1, gcn1, and gcn2 mutants as expected. Interestingly, deletion of GCN3 and -4 did not fully rescue FK506 toxicity as tryptophan prototrophy did in the WT strain. Therefore, inactivation of the GCN pathway only partially suppressed FK506 toxicity, and tryptophan starvation also contributed to FK506 osmotic sensitivity. Overall, these findings indicate that FK506 activation of the GCN pathway somehow modulates cell sensitivity to osmotic stress. FK506 Enhances Hog1p Phosphorylation by Osmotic Stress via Gcn2p—Osmotic stress leads to activation of the HOG MAP kinase pathway through dual phosphorylation of the Thr-174 and Tyr-176 residues of the Hog1p MAP kinase by its dual specificity kinase Pbs2p. These phosphorylation events are necessary and sufficient to allow nuclear translocation of Hog1p, leading to induction of expression of target genes (14Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1147-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and tolerance to osmotic stress. Phosphorylation of Hog1p can be monitored by Western blot analysis using a commercially available antibody specifically recognizing the phosphorylated forms of the p38-type kinase Hog1p Tyr-176 and Thr-174 residues. We explored whether the HOG pathway was involved in the resistance to FK506 toxicity observed in some GCN pathway mutants. WT and gcn1, -2, -3, and -4 cells were preincubated or not with FK506 for 1 h, osmostressed for 45 min, and harvested for total protein extraction. Western blot analysis of the Hog1p phosphorylation status revealed an unexpected result. FK506 strongly augmented Hog1p phosphorylation by osmotic stress in the WT and the gcn1, -3, and -4 mutants (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, hyperphosphorylation of Hog1p was fully abolished in the gcn2 mutant, suggesting that Gcn2p mediated this effect. To further confirm this result we tested the effect of FK506 on the pMP224 reporter, containing a CRE-like sequence driving expression of the LacZ gene (see “Experimental Procedures”). This sequence is the binding site for the transcriptional repressor Sko1p, known to be a direct substrate of the Hog1p MAP kinase (11Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Arino J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hog1p phosphorylation inactivates Sko1p repressor function, leading to transcriptional derepression of some HOG pathway-dependent genes (10Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Proft M. Pascual-Ahuir A. de Nadal E. Arino J. Serrano R. Posas F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Expression of this reporter was measured in the different mutants used previously for the Hog1p phosphorylation study. As shown in Fig. 6, osmotic stress induction of the pMP224 reporter was blocked by FK506 in the WT and the gcn1,-3, and -4 mutants, despite the fact that Hog1p was hyperphosphorylated under these conditions. Interestingly, sorbitol induction of the reporter was unaffected by FK506 in the gcn2 mutant, further reinforcing the hypothesis that Gcn2p was mediating FK506 effects. The absence of reporter expression in the WT and gcn1, -3, and -4 mutants was not due to a transient delay in transcriptional activation as we obtained the same results up to 3 h later (data not shown). Therefore, these data demonstrate that FK506 augmented Hog1p phosphorylation and perturbed Hog1p-dependent transcriptional induction via Gcn2p, revealing a functional link between Hog1p and Gcn2p kinases. In addition these results suggest that suppression of FK506 toxicity by deletion of GCN3 and -4 genes was mediated by other unrelated mechanisms.Fig. 6FK506 abolishes Hog1p-dependent transcriptional induction via Gcn2p.

These results identify the minimal upstream cis-acting elements, and point to a complex regulatory mechanism involved in the lineage-specific control of NKR-P1C expression in NK lymphocytes. The classic NK1.1 antigen (NKR-P1C) is one member of a group of disulfide-linked homodimeric type II transmembrane C-type lectin-like receptors encoded by the NKR-P1 gene family (1Giorda R. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1701-1708PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ryan J.C. Turck J. Niemi E.C. Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1631-1635PubMed Google Scholar). The NKR-P1 gene cluster is found within a single genetic region designated the natural killer gene complex (NKC), 1The abbreviations used are: NKC, natural killer gene complex; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HS, DNaseI hypersensitive site; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GFP, green fluorescent protein. which is located on chromosome 6 in mice, chromosome 4 in rats, and chromosome 12 in humans (2Ryan J.C. Turck J. Niemi E.C. Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1631-1635PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ryan J.C. Seaman W.E. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The NKC region is strikingly conserved among species, even though not all NKC-encoded molecules have been identified in all species (4Brown M.G. Scalzo A.A. Matsumoto K. Yokoyama W.M. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The NKC can be divided into several families of genes: NKRP1, Ly49, CD69, NKG2, and CD94. The prototype of the NKR-P1 family, NKR-P1A, was first cloned in rats using a mAb screened for its ability to redirect NK cell lysis of Fc receptor (FcR)+ targets (5Giorda R. Rudert W.A. Vavassori C.

In mice, the NKR-P1 gene family consists of at least five distinct genes: NKR-P1A, NKR-P1B, NKR-P1C, NKR-P1D, and NKR-P1F (while the NKR-P1E locus represents a pseudogene) (1Giorda R. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1701-1708PubMed Google Scholar, 7Giorda R. Weisberg E.P. Ip T.K. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. Annu. Rev.

Immunogenetics. 2001; 53: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The initial cloning of the mouse NKR-P1 genes revealed that they consist of six exons separated by five introns (7Giorda R. Weisberg E.P. Ip T.K. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). The first exon of the NKR-P1C gene encodes the N-terminal region of the protein, corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain. The second exon encodes the transmembrane region, exon 3 encodes a variable stalk region, and exons 4–6 contain the putative carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (7Giorda R. Weisberg E.P. Ip T.K. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). Although NKR-P1C had been originally cloned as the NK1.1 antigen (2Ryan J.C. Turck J. Niemi E.C. Yokoyama W.M. Seaman W.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1631-1635PubMed Google Scholar), we and others have recently demonstrated that the mouse “NK1.1 antigen” actually represents the products of at least two distinct genes, NKR-P1B and NKR-P1C, differentially expressed across mouse strains (10Carlyle J.R. Martin A. Mehra A. Attisano L. Tsui F.W. Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5917-5923PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kung S.K. Su R.C. Shannon J. Miller R.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5876-5887PubMed Google Scholar). NKR-P1C is expressed by all functional NK cells (7Giorda R. Weisberg E.P. Ip T.K. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar) and by a subset of mature T cells termed NKT cells (12Bendelac A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In selected strains of mice, virtually all NK activity is contained within the NKR-P1C+ subset (13Hackett Jr., J. Tutt M. Lipscomb M. Bennett M. Koo G. Kumar V. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 3124-3131PubMed Google Scholar), and in vivo administration of anti-NK1.1 mAb eliminates NK activity but has no effect on cell-mediated or humoral immunity (14Seaman W.E. Sleisenger M. Eriksson E. Koo G.C. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4539-4544PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, engagement of NKR-P1C with a mAb mediates NK cell redirected lysis of FcR-expressing targets (15Karlhofer F.M. Yokoyama W.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 3662-3673PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that NKR-P1C is capable of activating and directing the cytolytic process. To date, however, physiological NKR-P1 ligands on target cells have not yet been identified although recombinant NKR-P1 proteins were suggested to bind synthetic carbohydrates (16Bezouska K.

Thus, the NKR-P1 proteins remain orphan receptors. In addition, our recent work has shown that a population of CD117+ progenitor thymocytes expressing NK1.1 is capable of giving rise to the cells of T and NK cell lineages (21Carlyle J.R. Michie A.M.

Importantly, a single CD117+ NK1.1+ cell was shown to give rise to both T and NK cells, establishing that NK1.1 expression can serve to identify a common progenitor for both lineages (24Michie A.M.

To address this, we investigated the molecular cis-acting elements responsible for their transcriptional regulation. This report describes the cloning and detailed analysis of the upstream region of the mouse NKR-P1C gene. We have identified the location of the major NKR-P1C transcriptional initiation site; two new noncoding exons in the 5′-region of the gene (exons 1.1 and 1.2); three promoters; and putative transcription factor binding sites in the upstream flanking region. Furthermore, we describe the detection and analysis of a DNaseI hypersensitive site (HS1), located 9-kb upstream of the major transcriptional initiation site, which exhibits promoter and enhancer-like activity. Taken together, our present findings identify the minimal functional promoter and a unique enhancer/promoter element, HS1, which appear to confer NK lineage-specific expression of the NKR-P1C gene. Screening of a Mouse Genomic Library—A mouse λ-phage genomic library derived from C57Bl/6xC3H F1 mice (generously provided by Dr. Gillian Wu, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada) was screened using an NKR-P1C gene-specific probe corresponding to the B6 NKR-P1C cDNA coding sequence. Three clones were identified spanning various regions within the mouse NKR-P1C locus and were subcloned. Clone P13 was characterized in this study. Primer Extension Analysis—mRNAs used in primer extension assays were generated from two different cell lines: CTLL-2, and MNK-19.76kb/GFP. For the CTLL-2 mRNA, primer extension assays were performed using two 18-bp NKR-P1C antisense primers: E1A (5′-CAGGGTTGGATAAGACAG-3′) complementary to bases –403 to –420; and E1B (5′-GTGTCCTGGGTGGCTTTA-3′) complementary to bases +28 to +45 (both primer locations are relative to the initiator methionine codon ATG in exon 1, Fig. 2, underlined, bold). For MNK-19.76kb/GFP mRNA, the same E1A primer was used in addition to a GFP primer (5′-CTCCTCGCCCTTGCTCACCA-3′) complementary to bases +2 to +20 of GFP coding sequence. Primers were labeled using [γ-32P]dATP (specific activity ≥6000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) to a specific activity of 1 × 109 cpm/μg. 1 × 105 cpm of each primer (0.1 ng) was mixed with 1.5 μg of oligo(dT)-selected RNA from CTLL-2 cells or 2 μg of MNK-19.76kb/GFP mRNA. 10 μg of total yeast RNA or 2 μg of MNK-1 mRNA were used as negative controls. The RNA samples were reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 1 h using AMV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Radioactive primer extension products were resolved in a sequencing gel. The same primers were used for sequencing reactions using Sequenase Version 2 Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The template for sequencing reactions was a genomic fragment corresponding to the upstream region of the NKR-P1C gene. Rapid Amplification of 5′-cDNA Ends (5′-RACE)—5′-RACE was performed using Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA from NK1.1+ cell line, CTLL-2, or from recombination activating gene-2 (RAG-2)-deficient splenocytes (NK cell enriched by anti-CD24 mAb/complement-mediated depletion) were reverse transcribed as recommended by the manufacturer. Products of the nested 5′-RACE were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The clones were sequenced using Cy5/Cy5.5 Sequencing Kit (Visible Genetics, Suwanee, GA), and utilizing Visible Genetics Sequencer, Model 701094 (Visible Genetics). RT-PCR—mRNA from CTLL-2 cells was prepared using GeneElute Direct mRNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma). Total RNA from C57Bl/6 (B6) day 15 fetal liver, fetal thymus, sorted NK1.1+ fetal thymus, or RAG2–/– splenocytes was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. 10 μg total RNA or 1 μg of mRNA was reverse-transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase, 0.5 μg oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen), 1 mm dNTPs, and the supplied buffer. First strand cDNA was amplified by PCR according to the following protocol: 94 °C, 2 min.; 30 cycles at (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s); 72 °C, 10 min.; in a 25 μl final reaction volume cycled using an MJ Research Thermal Cycler (Waltham, MA). After amplification, the PCR products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The sequences of primers used in the PCR amplification are: F1A, 5′-AACTAGGGGGAAAATAGTTGA-3′ (position –8428 to –8448); F1B, 5′-AATCATCTAAGCAGGGCTCAT-3′ (position –595 to –615 upstream of ATG in exon 1; Fig. 2, underlined, bold); F1C, 5′-AACCCTCAGAGACAGGAATCA-3′ (position –117 to –137 upstream of ATG in exon 1); and R1A/B 5′-TGTGTCCATTTCACAGGA-3′ (position –8 to +9 relative to ATG in exon 1). RT-PCR products were normalized using β-actin as an internal standard. Construction of Reporter Vectors—A PCR approach was used to generate all of the reporter constructs from the P13 λ-phage clone. All forward primers contain an Mlu I linker at the 5′-end, while reverse primers contain a SalI linker at the 3′-end. The following is a list of primers used as well as the size/location of constructs: 9.76-kb construct (position –9746 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTGATTTAGGTGACACTAT-3′; 9-kb construct (position –9013 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTCCACAGAAGGATGGACTG-3′; 8-kb construct (position –8012 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTACACAAAAGTGGAAGGAG-3′; 7-kb construct (position –7012 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTATCTGTAATGGCCAGAG-3′; 6-kb construct (position –6012 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTGCAGGCTCTGTGAAATTC-3′; 5kb construct (position –5012 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTCTGGAATTCAATCTATAA-3′; 4kb construct (position –4012 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTAATACCAGTATGGCTCTA-3′; 3-kb (position –3016 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTAATGGGGCCATCTTTCCC-3′; 2-kb construct (position –2013 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTCTTTCTAACGCATCTCCA-3′; 1-kb construct (position –1013 to –1), 5′-ACGCGTGGAGGATCTTAGAGCTTC-3′; 600 bp (position –600 to –1). The 3′-primer for all of the constructs is 5-GTCGACTTTCACAGGAGATGCAACA-3′ (positions –1 to –18). All of the positions are relative to the starting ATG codon in exon 1 (Fig. 2; underlined, bold). PCR fragments were digested with Mlu I and SalI and ligated into pGL-2/Basic (promoterless and enhancerless luciferase construct; Promega, Madison, WI). The λ-phage genomic clone P13 was used as the template for PCR, and all constructs were sequenced to confirm insert orientation and sequence fidelity. Control plasmids included pGL-2/Basic vector alone (promoterless, enhancerless) and pGL-2/SV40 (containing both the SV40 promoter and enhancer; Promega). The CMV-based β-galactosidase reporter vector, pCMV-β-gal (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA), was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. 500-bp promoter 2 fragment was generated by PCR using the forward primer (containing a SacI site): 5′-GAGCTCGTGTGAATGTGTGTGACTCG-3′ (–1293 to –1310) and the reverse primer (containing an Mlu I site): 5′-ACTTTCATGGGGCTCCTGTGCTCTGC-3′ (positions –685 to –704), and it was positionally cloned into the pGL-2/Basic vector backbone (Fig. 5C). The HS1 fragment (∼500 bp) was generated by PCR using the following primers: forward primer (FHS1; Fig. 7) 5′-TTTCACATCTATCACCAGT-3′ (position –8977 to –8995 upstream of starting ATG; Fig. 2, underlined, bold); reverse primer (RHS1; Fig. 7) 5′-TATGTGTTATTTTTATCCCA-3′ (positions –8484 to –8502 upstream of starting ATG). This product was cloned into the pGL-2/Basic vector backbone (HS1 construct), the pGL-2/600bp vector backbone (HS1/600bp construct), and in front of a TATA box (TATA construct) in the TATA box containing luciferase construct (MCS-luc; Stratagene). Luciferase, β-Galactosidase, and Protein Assays—Cells transfected with the luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter plasmids were assayed using the Dual-Light reporter system (Tropix Inc. Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA), as previously described (25Michie A.M. Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. Kearse K.P. Methods in Molecular Biology: Protocols in T Cell Development and Activation. Vol. 52. Humana Press Inc., Totawa, NJ1999: 34Google Scholar). Results represent the average luciferase activity indexed for β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration per sample. Cell Lines—CTLL-2 (an IL-2-dependent NK1.1+ mouse cytotoxic T cell line) (26Arase H. Arase N. Nakagawa K. Good R.A. Onoe K. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 5917-5923PubMed Google Scholar), MNK-19.76kb/GFP (MNK-1 cell line stably transfected with a construct containing 9.76 kb of NKR-P1C upstream region cloned in front of the GFP gene), SL-12 (a mouse pre-T cell line), and BW5417 (a TCR-deficient mouse T cell line) were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in complete DMEM (medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-ME, and 10 mm HEPES, pH7.4). Human rIL-2 (10 units/ml) was added to the culture medium for CTLL-2, MNK-1, and MNK-19.76kb/GFP cells. DNA Transfections—Cells were electroporated using a BTX ECM600 Electroporation system (San Diego, CA). Electroporations were performed using 4 mm gap cuvettes (BioRad). Cells in 20% FBS RPMI 1640 media were electroporated using the following conditions: MNK-1 and CTLL-2 (300 V, 186 Ω, and 1600 μF); SL-12 (300 V, 186 Ω, and 450 μF); BW5147 (300 V, 186 Ω, and 1500 μF). DNaseI Hypersensitivity Assay—MNK-19.76kb/GFP cells (108) were pelleted and resuspended in reticulocyte standard buffer (RSB; 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2). Cells were lysed in 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and nuclei were collected and resuspended in RSB buffer. Digestions were carried out at 37 °C with 0.25–8.0 units of DNaseI (Invitrogen) for 3 min then terminated with an equal volume of DNaseI stop buffer (0.6 m NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA). Samples were treated with proteinase K overnight, and DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, then resuspended in 100 μl of dH2O. 10 μg of each sample was digested with NotI followed by Southern blotting and hybridization using a 32P-labeled GFP probe overnight at 65 °C. Blots were exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Kodak, Rochester, NY) overnight, and scanned using a PhosphorImager (BioRad). Computational Analysis of the 5′-Flanking Region Sequence—Putative regulatory elements in the 5′-flanking regions of the mouse NKR-P1C gene were identified by searching the transcription factor binding site data base (TRANSFAC 4.0 and MatInspector V2.2; transfac.gbf.de/TRANSFAC/). Parameters used were: core similarity, 1.0; matrix similarity, 0.85. The numerical position of each cis-element corresponds to the 5′-end of each motif relative to the major transcriptional initiation site (bold arrow, Fig. 2). Isolation of Genomic Clones Containing the 5′-Flanking Region of Mouse NKR-P1C—A λ-phage mouse genomic library was screened by Southern hybridization using a PCR-generated genomic probe complementary to the NKR-P1C 5′-coding region. Three positive clones were obtained. One clone, P13, had a 13-kb genomic insert (GenBank™ accession number AY316227), which was further characterized with restriction enzymes. To exclude recombination artifacts, restriction enzyme digestion patterns of mouse genomic DNA from C57Bl/6 splenocytes were compared with those of the P13 phage clone and found to be identical (data not shown). To subclone the 5′-flanking region, subgenomic plasmid libraries were generated and screened with a probe corresponding to the NKR-P1C coding region. Identification of the Major NKR-P1C Transcriptional Initiation Site—To define the transcriptional initiation site of the NKR-P1C gene, primer extension was performed on RNA from CTLL-2 cells (an IL-2-dependent mouse T cell line that expresses NKR-P1C) (26Arase H. Arase N. Nakagawa K. Good R.A. Onoe K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and MNK-19.76kb/GFP (a mouse pre-NK cell line, MNK-1 (27Carlyle J.R. Mehra A. Martin A. Attisano L. Tsui F. Zúñiga-Pflücker J.C. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5917-5923PubMed Google Scholar), expressing GFP under the control of the 9.76 kb NKR-P1C 5′-upstream region; see Fig. 6A). Extended products were separated on a denaturing polyacrylamide/urea gel alongside a sequence of the genomic clone to measure the size of extended products. Results depicted in Fig. 1A shows that transcription in MNK-19.76kb/GFP cells is initiated at a single site 156 bp upstream of the starting ATG codon (Fig. 2 underlined, bold). This site is also observed in CTLL-2 cells (Fig. 1B, upper strong band). In CTLL-2 cells, transcription is also initiated, although at a much lower level, from another site (Fig. 1B; lower band). The specificity of the primer was confirmed using untransfected MNK-1 cells and yeast RNA as a negative controls (Fig. 1A, right lane and Fig. 1B, left lane).Fig. 1Mapping of the mouse NKR-P1C transcriptional initiation site. A, primer extenstion was performed using MNK-19.76kb/GFP mRNA. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′-end of the GFP gene was hybridized to MNK-1–9.76/GFP mRNA and extended with reverse transcriptase. Extension products were size fractioned on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside a Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing ladder primed as above. mRNA from untransfected MNK-1 cells was used as a negative control. The major transcription initiation site is indicated with an arrow placed next to the corresponding genomic sequence. B, primer extension was performed using CTLL-2 mRNA. An oligonucleotide corresponding to the 5′ end of the mouse NKR-P1C cDNA (shown in Fig. 2) was hybridized to CTLL-2 mRNA, and extended as described above. Total yeast RNA was used as a control for the specificity of the reaction. The major and minor transcription initiation sites are indicated with the arrows placed next to the corresponding genomic sequence. C, mapping of the transcription initiation sites by 5′-RACE. The nucleotide sequence for the genomic portion of mouse 5′-flanking region and part of exon 1 (starting ATG is underlined) is shown. The symbols * and # denote the transcription initiation sites of unique clones obtained by 5′-RACE and characterized by DNA sequence analysis from CTLL-2 cell line, and RAG-2-deficient splenocytes (NK cell-enriched), respectively. The major transcription initiation site as defined by primer extension analysis (A and B, bold) is shown and numbered +1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Similar results were obtained utilizing the 5′-RACE technique (Fig. 1C). Here, RNA sources included CTLL-2 cells and splenocytes (NK cell-enriched) obtained from RAG-2-deficient mice (Fig. 1C). Although both major and minor initiation sites were detected by this technique, a set of shorter transcripts was also detected. These shorter fragments are likely due to inefficient reverse transcriptase function during the first strand synthesis. Thus, two complementary techniques independently confirmed that the major NKR-P1C transcriptional initiation site is located at position –156 (relative to the translational initiator methionine ATG codon). Analysis of the NKR-P1C Promoter Region for Putative DNA Binding Sites—The 5′-flanking region of mouse NKR-P1C is TATA-less (Fig. 2). The transcriptional initiation site, containing the sequence 5′-TCA(+1)GTCA-3′, shows striking homology to the initiator (Inr) element consensus sequence (5′-PyPyA(+1)N(A/T)PyPy-3′) (28Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Analysis of the 5′-flanking region of NKR-P1C highlights multiple Ets-1 consensus sequences at positions –94, –98, –102, –104, –108, –117, and –123 relative the to major transcriptional start site (Fig. 2; large right arrow). Several Ikaros binding sites are evident at positions –57, –111, –183, and –328. In addition, unique binding sites are observed for the following transcription factors with more complex sequence elements: GATA, position –203; TCF-1, position –73; Sp1, position –18; NFAT, position –105; Oct-1, position –237 (Fig. 2). It is likely that at least some of these binding sites play a significant role in recruiting transcription factors to mediate lineage-specific expression of NKR-P1C. Detection of NKR-P1C mRNAs-containing Novel 5′-Exons— Both 5′-RACE (Fig. 1C) and primer extension (Fig. 3A) analyses revealed the presence of a novel exon, designated exon 1.1 (E1.1), located upstream of the originally described exon 1 (E1) (7Giorda R. Weisberg E.P. Ip T.K. Trucco M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1957-1963PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the transcriptional initiation site for this novel exon (small thin right arrow) and the location of the novel splice donor/acceptor sites (N|gt...ag|N) corresponding to exons 1.1/2.1. To confirm the physiological existence of exon 1.1, we performed RT-PCR analysis with specific primers (F1B and F1C) in Fig. 2. The results demonstrate that exon 1.1 is transcribed significantly, albeit to a lesser extent than exon 1 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, transcripts containing exon 1.1 could be detected among adult tissues (CTLL-2 cells, splenic NK cells), but not during fetal ontogeny (day 15 fetal liver and thymus are shown) (Fig. 3B). Moreover, primer extension analysis revealed that NKR-P1C transcripts initiated from the upstream site are not very abundant (Fig. 3A). Although exon 1.1 contains one in-frame ATG start codon (Fig. 2, italicized), no easily discernable structural motifs are present within this sequence. To investigate whether a transcript containing exon 1.1 could encode for a protein, we generated plasmids containing either transcript 2 cDNA or the native NKR-P1C cDNA (transcript 1) (Fig. 4A). Transfection of these vectors into Jurkat cells (human T cell line) yielded detectable surface expression (as determined by NK1.1 staining) only with the original NKR-P1C exon 1-containing cDNA (Fig. 4B). Notably, even the addition of a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) could not allow for the detection of a product from the novel exon 1.1-containing cDNA, either on the surface or intracellularly (data not shown). The lack of detectable surface or intracellular staining suggests that the newly identified exon 1.1 is non-coding. In this regard, it is interesting to note that although exon 1.1 possesses an ATG (Fig. 2, italicized) that is in-frame with the rest of the gene, several other start sites, which are followed by multiple in-frame stop codons, precede the in-frame ATG in exon 1.1 (Fig. 4A). The presence of multiple stop codons downstream of the first ATG in exon 1.1 is likely to contribute to the failure to detect NK1.1 expression encoded by transcripts containing exon 1.1. Promoter/Enhancer Activity of the NKR-P1C 5′-Flanking Region—The functional promoter activity of the NKR-P1C upstream region was assessed by transient expression of luciferase reporter constructs (Fig 5A). Initially, a genomic fragment containing a full 9.76 kb of the NKR-P1C upstream region was cloned into the"
