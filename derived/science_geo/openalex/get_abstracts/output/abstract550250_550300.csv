https://openalex.org/W2232971833,"Cell-cell contact inhibition and the mechanical environment of cells have both been shown to regulate YAP nuclear localization to modulate cell proliferation. Changes in cellular contractility by genetic, pharmacological, and matrix stiffness perturbations regulate YAP nuclear localization. However, because contractility and F-actin organization are interconnected cytoskeletal properties, it remains unclear which of these distinctly regulates YAP localization. Here we show that in the absence of cell-cell contact, actomyosin contractility suppresses YAP phosphorylation at Ser112, however, neither loss of contractility nor increase in YAP phosphorylation is sufficient for its nuclear exclusion. We find that actin cytoskeletal integrity is essential for YAP nuclear localization, and can override phosphoregulation or contractility-mediated regulation of YAP nuclear localization. This actin-mediated regulation is conserved during mechanotransduction, as substrate compliance increased YAP phosphorylation and reduced cytoskeletal integrity leading to nuclear exclusion of both YAP and Ser(P)112-YAP. These data provide evidence for two actin-mediated pathways for YAP regulation; one in which actomyosin contractility regulates YAP phosphorylation, and a second that involves cytoskeletal integrity-mediated regulation of YAP nuclear localization independent of contractility. We suggest that in non-contact inhibited cells, this latter mechanism may be important in low stiffness regimes, such as may be encountered in physiological environments.

https://openalex.org/W2236957533,"To report globe salvage rates, patient survival and adverse events of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) for International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) group D retinoblastoma (naive and after prior failures).Single institution retrospective review of all Group D eyes treated with OAC from 5/2006-12/2012. Patients were treated according to our previously-published techniques. Primary outcome was globe retention without need for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Demographics, prior treatments, OAC agents used, and adverse events were also recorded.112 group D eyes (103 patients) that underwent OAC were included (average follow-up was 34 months, range: 2-110 months). 47 eyes were treatment-naïve, 58 eyes received prior treatments elsewhere, and 7 young infants (7 eyes) underwent our published ""bridge therapy"" (single agent intravenous carboplatin) until old enough to undergo OAC. Median number of OAC sessions/eye was 3 (range 1-9). 110/112 eyes received intra-arterial melphalan, but only 31 eyes received melphalan alone. 43 eyes received carboplatin, and 78 eyes received topotecan (never as a single agent). 80/112 eyes received >1 drug over their treatment course, and 39 eyes received all three agents. 24 eyes (16 pretreated, 7 treatment-naïve, 1 bridge) failed treatment and required enucleation during the study period. Enucleation and EBRT were avoided in 88/112 eyes (78.6%; including 40/47 [85.1%] treatment-naïve eyes, 42/58 [72.4%] previously-treated eyes, and 6/7 eyes [85.7%] among bridge patients). By Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, globe salvage rate was 74% at 110 months among all patients, and 85% at 110 months in the treatment-naïve subgroup. Transient grade 3/4 neutropenia was more common in patients receiving OAC bilaterally. No child died of metastatic disease.OAC is effective for curing group D retinoblastoma, achieving rates of globe salvage many times higher than systemic chemotherapy (10-47%), even in eyes that previously failed other treatments. OAC can be performed multiple times, using multiple agents, on one or both eyes of patients."

The crystal structure of PSII from cyanobacteria has been solved at an atomic level, but the structure of eukaryotic PSII has not been analyzed. Because eukaryotic PSII possesses additional subunits not found in cyanobacterial PSII, it is important to solve the structure of eukaryotic PSII to elucidate their detailed functions, as well as evolutionary relationships. Here we report the structure of PSII from a red alga Cyanidium caldarium at 2.76 Å resolution, which revealed the structure and interaction sites of PsbQ′, a unique, fourth extrinsic protein required for stabilizing the oxygen-evolving complex in the lumenal surface of PSII. The PsbQ′ subunit was found to be located underneath CP43 in the vicinity of PsbV, and its structure is characterized by a bundle of four up-down helices arranged in a similar way to those of cyanobacterial and higher plant PsbQ, although helices I and II of PsbQ′ were kinked relative to its higher plant counterpart because of its interactions with CP43. Furthermore, two novel transmembrane helices were found in the red algal PSII that are not present in cyanobacterial PSII; one of these helices may correspond to PsbW found only in eukaryotic PSII.

https://openalex.org/W2233148118,"The physiological role of the TGR5 receptor in the pancreas is not fully understood. We previously showed that activation of TGR5 in pancreatic β cells by bile acids induces insulin secretion. Glucagon released from pancreatic α cells and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal L cells regulate insulin secretion. Both glucagon and GLP-1 are derived from alternate splicing of a common precursor, proglucagon by PC2 and PC1, respectively. We investigated whether TGR5 activation in pancreatic α cells enhances hyperglycemia-induced PC1 expression thereby releasing GLP-1, which in turn increases β cell mass and function in a paracrine manner. TGR5 activation augmented a hyperglycemia-induced switch from glucagon to GLP-1 synthesis in human and mouse islet α cells by GS/cAMP/PKA/cAMP-response element-binding protein-dependent activation of PC1. Furthermore, TGR5-induced GLP-1 release from α cells was via an Epac-mediated PKA-independent mechanism. Administration of the TGR5 agonist, INT-777, to db/db mice attenuated the increase in body weight and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. INT-777 augmented PC1 expression in α cells and stimulated GLP-1 release from islets of db/db mice compared with control. INT-777 also increased pancreatic β cell proliferation and insulin synthesis. The effect of TGR5-mediated GLP-1 from α cells on insulin release from islets could be blocked by GLP-1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that TGR5 activation mediates cross-talk between α and β cells by switching from glucagon to GLP-1 to restore β cell mass and function under hyperglycemic conditions. Thus, INT-777-mediated TGR5 activation could be leveraged as a novel way to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. The physiological role of the TGR5 receptor in the pancreas is not fully understood.

https://openalex.org/W2234152391,"Objective To verify the reliability and clinical feasibility of a self-developed navigation system based on an augmented reality technique for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery. Materials and Methods In this study we performed a head phantom and cadaver experiment to determine the display effect and accuracy of our navigational system. We compared cadaver head-based simulated operations, the target registration error, operation time, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores of our navigation system to conventional navigation systems. Results The navigation system developed in this study has a novel display mode capable of fusing endoscopic images to three-dimensional (3-D) virtual images. In the cadaver head experiment, the target registration error was 1.28 ± 0.45 mm, which met the accepted standards of a navigation system used for nasal endoscopic surgery. Compared with conventional navigation systems, the new system was more effective in terms of operation time and the mental workload of surgeons, which is especially important for less experienced surgeons. Conclusion The self-developed augmented reality navigation system for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery appears to have advantages that outweigh those of conventional navigation systems. We conclude that this navigational system will provide rhinologists with more intuitive and more detailed imaging information, thus reducing the judgment time and mental workload of surgeons when performing complex sinus and skull base surgeries. Ultimately, this new navigational system has potential to increase the quality of surgeries. In addition, the augmented reality navigational system could be of interest to junior doctors being trained in endoscopic techniques because it could speed up their learning. However, it should be noted that the navigation system serves as an adjunct to a surgeon’s skills and knowledge, not as a substitute."
https://openalex.org/W2237564533,"The nucleolus serves as a principal site of ribosome biogenesis but is also implicated in various non-ribosomal functions, including negative regulation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor p53. Although disruption of the nucleolus may trigger the p53-dependent neuronal death, neurotoxic consequences of a selective impairment of ribosome production are unclear. Here, we report that in rat forebrain neuronal maturation is associated with a remarkable expansion of ribosomes despite postnatal down-regulation of ribosomal biogenesis. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, inhibition of the latter process by knockdowns of ribosomal proteins S6, S14, or L4 reduced ribosome content without disrupting nucleolar integrity, cell survival, and signaling responses to the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Moreover, reduced general protein synthesis and/or formation of RNA stress granules suggested diminished ribosome recruitment to at least some mRNAs. Such a translational insufficiency was accompanied by impairment of brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated dendritic growth. Finally, RNA stress granules and smaller dendritic trees were also observed when ribosomal proteins were depleted from neurons with established dendrites. Thus, a robust ribosomal apparatus is required to carry out protein synthesis that supports dendritic growth and maintenance. Consequently, deficits of ribosomal biogenesis may disturb neurodevelopment by reducing neuronal connectivity. Finally, as stress granule formation and dendritic loss occur early in neurodegenerative diseases, disrupted homeostasis of ribosomes may initiate and/or amplify neurodegeneration-associated disconnection of neuronal circuitries."
https://openalex.org/W2236297534,"Senecavirus A (SV-A), formerly, Seneca Valley virus (SVV), has been detected in swine with vesicular lesions and is thought to be associated with swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SIVD), a vesicular disease syndrome that lacks a defined causative agent. The clinical presentation of SIVD resembles that of other more contagious and economically devastating vesicular diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease (SVD), and vesicular stomatitis (VS), that typically require immediate rule out diagnostics to lift restrictions on animal quarantine, movement, and trade. This study presents the development of a sensitive, SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay suitable for detection of SV-A in diagnostic swine specimens. After testing 50 pigs with clinical signs consistent with vesicular disease, 44 (88%) were found to be positive for SV-A by RT-qPCR as compared to none from a negative cohort of 35 animals without vesicular disease, indicating that the assay is able to successfully detect the virus in an endemic population. SV-A RNA was also detectable at a low level in sera from a subset of pigs that presented with (18%) or without (6%) vesicular signs. In 2015, there has been an increase in the occurrence of SV-A in the US, and over 200 specimens submitted to our laboratory for vesicular investigation have tested positive for the virus using this method. SV-A RNA was detectable in all common types of vesicular specimens including swabs and tissue from hoof lesions, oral and snout epithelium, oral swabs, scabs, and internal organ tissues such as liver and lymph node. Genome sequencing analysis from recent virus isolates was performed to confirm target amplicon specificity and was aligned to previous isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2234024148,"Surgical site infection (SSI) remains a significant risk for any clean orthopedic surgical procedure. Complications resulting from an SSI often require a second surgery and lengthen patient recovery time. The efficacy of antimicrobial agents delivered to combat SSI is diminished by systemic toxicity, bacterial resistance, and patient compliance to dosing schedules. We submit that development of localized, controlled release formulations for antimicrobial compounds would improve the effectiveness of prophylactic surgical wound antibiotic treatment while decreasing systemic side effects. Our research group developed and characterized oligo(poly(ethylene glycol)fumarate) / sodium methacrylate (OPF/SMA) charged copolymers as biocompatible hydrogel matrices. Here, we report the engineering of this copolymer for use as an antibiotic delivery vehicle in surgical applications. We demonstrate that these hydrogels can be efficiently loaded with vancomycin (over 500 μg drug per mg hydrogel) and this loading mechanism is both time- and charge-dependent. Vancomycin release kinetics are shown to be dependent on copolymer negative charge. In the first 6 hours, we achieved as low as 33.7% release. In the first 24 hours, under 80% of total loaded drug was released. Further, vancomycin release from this system can be extended past four days. Finally, we show that the antimicrobial activity of released vancomycin is equivalent to stock vancomycin in inhibiting the growth of colonies of a clinically derived strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In summary, our work demonstrates that OPF/SMA hydrogels are appropriate candidates to deliver local antibiotic therapy for prophylaxis of surgical site infection."
https://openalex.org/W2236926495,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential co-enzyme mediating various enzymatic reactions. Mitochondrial NAD particularly occupies a considerable amount of total NAD in cells, and serves as a co-enzyme in tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), β-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Despite the importance of mitochondrial NAD, its synthesis pathway remains unknown. It has been proposed that NAD synthesis enzyme, Nmnat3, was localized in mitochondria, but its physiological relevance to the metabolism in mitochondria was not fully elucidated. Previously, we have reported that murine Nmnat3 protein was strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of mature erythrocytes, in which mitochondria were absent, and Nmnat3-deficient mice (Nmnat3-KO mice) exhibited splenomegaly and hemolytic anemia due to reduced NAD levels in mature erythrocytes. These results challenged the role of Nmnat3 in mitochondrial NAD synthesis. In this study, we demonstrated that mitochondrial NAD levels in various tissues, except for red blood cells, were unchanged in Nmnat3-KO mice. We also analyzed the metabolites in glycolysis and TCA cycle and found that there were no differences between Nmnat3-KO and WT mice. In addition, the aged Nmnat3-KO mice had comparable NAD levels to that observed in WT mice. Our results indicated that Nmnat3 is dispensable in the maintenance of mitochondrial NAD levels, and that other NAD regulatory pathways may exist in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2238643726,"Bone degenerative pathologies like osteoporosis may be initiated by age-related shifts in anabolic and catabolic responses that control bone homeostasis. Here we show that sulforaphane (SFN), a naturally occurring isothiocyanate, promotes osteoblast differentiation by epigenetic mechanisms. SFN enhances active DNA demethylation viaTet1andTet2and promotes preosteoblast differentiation by enhancing extracellular matrix mineralization and the expression of osteoblastic markers (Runx2,Col1a1,Bglap2,Sp7,Atf4, andAlpl). SFN decreases the expression of the osteoclast activator receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) in osteocytes and mouse calvarial explants and preferentially induces apoptosis in preosteoclastic cells via up-regulation of theTet1/Fas/Caspase 8 and Caspase 3/7 pathway. These mechanistic effects correlate with higher bone volume (∼20%) in both normal and ovariectomized mice treated with SFN for 5 weeks compared with untreated mice as determined by microcomputed tomography. This effect is due to a higher trabecular number in these mice. Importantly, no shifts in mineral density distribution are observed upon SFN treatment as measured by quantitative backscattered electron imaging. Our data indicate that the food-derived compound SFN epigenetically stimulates osteoblast activity and diminishes osteoclast bone resorption, shifting the balance of bone homeostasis and favoring bone acquisition and/or mitigation of bone resorptionin vivo Thus, SFN is a member of a new class of epigenetic compounds that could be considered for novel strategies to counteract osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2237286771,"Background The two major obstacles in the successful transplantation of islets for diabetes treatment are inadequate supply of insulin-producing tissue and immune rejection. Induction of the differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into insulin-producing cells (IPCs) for autologous transplantation may alleviate those limitations. Methods hMSCs were isolated and induced to differentiate into IPCs through a three-stage differentiation protocol in a defined media with high glucose, nicotinamide, and exendin-4. The physiological characteristics and functions of IPCs were then evaluated. Next, about 3 × 106 differentiated cells were transplanted into the renal sub-capsular space of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic nude mice. Graft survival and function were assessed by immunohistochemistry, TUNEL staining and measurements of blood glucose levels in the mice. Results The differentiated IPCs were characterized by Dithizone (DTZ) positive staining, expression of pancreatic β-cell markers, and human insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. Moreover, 43% of the IPCs showed L-type Ca2+ channel activity and similar changes in intracellular Ca2+ in response to glucose stimulation as that seen in pancreatic β-cells in the process of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Transplantation of functional IPCs into the renal subcapsular space of STZ-induced diabetic nude mice ameliorated the hyperglycemia. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that transplanted IPCs sustainably expressed insulin, c-peptide, and PDX-1 without apparent apoptosis in vivo. Conclusions IPCs derived from hMSCs in vitro can ameliorate STZ-induced diabetic hyperglycemia, which indicates that these hMSCs may be a promising approach to overcome the limitations of islet transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2236356099,"Objectives In the present study, we aimed to determine the effect of both active and passive smoking on the prevalence of the hearing impairment and the hearing thresholds in different age groups through the analysis of data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Study Design Cross-sectional epidemiological study. Methods The KNHANES is an ongoing population study that started in 1998. We included a total of 12,935 participants aged ≥19 years in the KNHANES, from 2010 to 2012, in the present study. Pure-tone audiometric (PTA) testing was conducted and the frequencies tested were 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz. Smoking status was categorized into three groups; current smoking group, passive smoking group and non-smoking group. Results In the current smoking group, the prevalence of speech-frequency bilateral hearing impairment was increased in ages of 40−69, and the rate of high frequency bilateral hearing impairment was elevated in ages of 30−79. When we investigated the impact of smoking on hearing thresholds, we found that the current smoking group had significantly increased hearing thresholds compared to the passive smoking group and non-smoking groups, across all ages in both speech-relevant and high frequencies. The passive smoking group did not have an elevated prevalence of either speech-frequency bilateral hearing impairment or high frequency bilateral hearing impairment, except in ages of 40s. However, the passive smoking group had higher hearing thresholds than the non-smoking group in the 30s and 40s age groups. Conclusion Current smoking was associated with hearing impairment in both speech-relevant frequency and high frequency across all ages. However, except in the ages of 40s, passive smoking was not related to hearing impairment in either speech-relevant or high frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2237004296,"Indirect transmission of influenza A virus (IAV) in swine is poorly understood and information is lacking on levels of environmental exposure encountered by swine and people during outbreaks of IAV in swine barns. We characterized viral load, viability and persistence of IAV in air and on surfaces during outbreaks in swine barns. IAV was detected in pigs, air and surfaces from five confirmed outbreaks with 48% (47/98) of oral fluid, 38% (32/84) of pen railing and 43% (35/82) of indoor air samples testing positive by IAV RT-PCR. IAV was isolated from air and oral fluids yielding a mixture of subtypes (H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2). Detection of IAV RNA from air was sustained during the outbreaks with maximum levels estimated between 7 and 11 days from reported onset. Our results indicate that during outbreaks of IAV in swine, aerosols and surfaces in barns contain significant levels of IAV potentially representing an exposure hazard to both swine and people."
https://openalex.org/W2234775767,"HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) has been found to be efficacious in preventing HIV acquisition among seronegative individuals in a variety of risk groups, including men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. To date, however, it remains unclear how socio-cultural norms (e.g., attitudes towards HIV; social understandings regarding HIV risk practices) may influence the scalability of future PrEP interventions. The objective of this study is to assess how socio-cultural norms may influence the implementation and scalability of future HIV PrEP interventions in Vancouver, Canada.We conducted 50 interviews with young men (ages 18-24) with a variety of HIV risk behavioural profiles (e.g., young men who inject drugs; MSM). Interviews focused on participants' experiences and perceptions with various HIV interventions and policies, including PrEP.While awareness of PrEP was generally low, perceptions about the potential personal and public health gains associated with PrEP were interconnected with expressions of complex and sometimes conflicting social norms. Some accounts characterized PrEP as a convenient form of reliable protection against HIV, likening it to the female birth control pill. Other accounts cast PrEP as a means to facilitate 'socially unacceptable' behaviour (e.g., promiscuity). Stigmatizing rhetoric was used to position PrEP as a tool that could promote some groups' proclivities to take 'risks'.Stigma regarding 'risky' behaviour and PrEP should not be underestimated as a serious implementation challenge. Pre-implementation strategies that concomitantly aim to improve knowledge about PrEP, while addressing associated social prejudices, may be key to effective implementation and scale-up."

While koalas in care can generally be treated, a vaccine is considered the only option to effectively reduce the threat of infection and disease at the population level. In the current study, we vaccinated 30 free-ranging koalas with a prototype Chlamydia pecorum vaccine consisting of a recombinant chlamydial MOMP adjuvanted with an immune stimulating complex. An additional cohort of 30 animals did not receive any vaccine and acted as comparison controls. Animals accepted into this study were either uninfected (Chlamydia PCR negative) at time of initial vaccination, or infected (C. pecorum positive) at either urogenital (UGT) and/or ocular sites (Oc), but with no clinical signs of chlamydial disease. All koalas were vaccinated/sampled and then re-released into their natural habitat before re-capturing and re-sampling at 6 and 12 months. All vaccinated koalas produced a strong immune response to the vaccine, as indicated by high titres of specific plasma antibodies. The incidence of new infections in vaccinated koalas over the 12-month period post-vaccination was slightly less than koalas in the control group, however, this was not statistically significant. Importantly though, the vaccine was able to significantly reduce the infectious load in animals that were Chlamydia positive at the time of vaccination. This effect was evident at both the Oc and UGT sites and was stronger at 6 months than at 12 months post-vaccination. Finally, the vaccine was also able to reduce the number of animals that progressed to disease during the 12-month period. While the sample sizes were small (statistically speaking), results were nonetheless striking. This study highlights the potential for successful development of a Chlamydia vaccine for koalas in a wild setting."
https://openalex.org/W2234374119,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular (CV) death. Whether modifiable lifestyle risk factors are associated with these CV outcomes in AF is unknown. Among Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants with incident AF, we estimated the risk of composite endpoint of ischemic stroke or CV death associated with candidate modifiable risk factor (smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, or high body mass index [BMI]), and computed the C-statistic, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) of incorporating each factor into the CHA2DS2-VASc. Among 1222 ARIC (mean age: 63.4) and 756 CHS (mean age: 79.1) participants with incident AF, during mean follow-up of 6.9 years and 5.7 years, there were 332 and 335 composite events respectively. Compared with never smokers, current smokers had a higher incidence of the composite endpoint in ARIC [HR: 1.65 (1.21–2.26)] but not in CHS [HR: 1.05 (0.69–1.61)]. In ARIC, the addition of current smoking did not improve risk prediction over and above the CHA2DS2-VASc. No significant associations were observed with alcohol consumption or BMI with CVD outcomes in AF patients from either cohort. Smoking is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke or CV death in ARIC, which comprised mostly middle-aged to young-old (65–74 years), but not in CHS, which comprised mostly middle-old or oldest-old (≥75 years) adults with AF. However, addition of smoking to the CHA2DS2-VASc score did not improve risk prediction of these outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2234161494,"Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a serious zoonotic disease in humans with a worldwide distribution. Many species of animals are capable of transmitting C. burnetii, and consequently all veterinary workers are at risk for this disease. An effective Q fever vaccine has been readily available and used in Australia for many years in at-risk groups, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has recently also called for the use of this vaccine among at-risk groups in Europe. Little is known about attitudes towards this vaccine and vaccine uptake in veterinary workers. This study aimed to determine the Q fever vaccination status of veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia and to assess and compare the knowledge and attitudes towards Q fever disease and vaccination of each cohort. An online cross-sectional survey performed in 2014 targeted all veterinarians and veterinary nurses in Australia. Responses from 890 veterinarians and 852 veterinary nurses were obtained. Binary, ordinal and multinomial logistic regression were used to make comparisons between the two cohorts. The results showed that 74% of veterinarians had sought vaccination compared to only 29% of veterinary nurses. Barriers to vaccination among those not vaccinated did not differ between cohorts, and included a lack of perceived risk, financial expense, time constraints, and difficulty in finding a vaccine provider. Poor knowledge and awareness of Q fever disease and vaccination were additional and notable barriers for the veterinary nursing cohort, suggesting veterinary clinics and veterinarians may not be meeting their legal responsibility to educate staff about risks and risk prevention. Further evaluation is needed to identify the drivers behind seeking and recommending vaccination so that recommendations can be made to improve vaccine uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2238247511,"The porcine pluripotent cells that can generate germline chimeras have not been developed. The Oct4 promoter-based fluorescent reporter system, which can be used to monitor pluripotency, is an important tool to generate authentic porcine pluripotent cells. In this study, we established a porcine Oct4 reporter system, wherein the endogenous Oct4 promoter directly controls red fluorescent protein (RFP). 2A-tdTomato sequence was inserted to replace the stop codon of the porcine Oct4 gene by homogenous recombination (HR). Thus, the fluorescence can accurately show the activation of endogenous Oct4. Porcine fetal fibroblast (PFF) lines with knock-in (KI) of the tdTomato gene in the downstream of endogenous Oct4 promoter were achieved using the CRISPR/CAS9 system. Transgenic PFFs were used as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Strong RFP expression was detected in the blastocysts and genital ridges of SCNT fetuses but not in other tissues. Two viable transgenic piglets were also produced by SCNT. Reprogramming of fibroblasts from the fetuses and piglets by another round of SCNT resulted in tdTomato reactivation in reconstructed blastocysts. Result indicated that a KI porcine reporter system to monitor the pluripotent status of cells was successfully developed."

The aim of the study was to address whether Plasmodium falciparum and HIV infections in pregnancy affect the secretion, microRNA content and function of trophoblast microparticles.Microparticles were isolated and characterized from 122 peripheral plasmas of Mozambican pregnant women, malaria- and/or HIV-infected and non-infected. Expression of placenta-related microRNAs in microparticles was analysed by qPCR and the effect of circulating microparticles on dendritic cells assessed by phenotype analysis and cytokine/chemokine measurement.Concentrations of total and trophoblast microparticles detected by flow cytometry were higher in HIV-positive (P = 0.005 and P = 0.030, respectively) compared to non-infected mothers, as well as in women delivering low birthweight newborns (P = 0.032 and P = 0.021, respectively). miR-517c was overexpressed in mothers with placental malaria (P = 0.034), compared to non-infected. Microparticles from HIV-positive induced a higher expression of MHCII (P = 0.021) and lower production of MCP1 (P = 0.008) than microparticles from non-infected women.In summary, alterations in total and trophoblast microparticles associated with malaria and HIV in pregnant women may have an immunopathogenic role. The potential for placental-derived vesicles and microRNAs as biomarkers of adverse outcomes during pregnancy and malaria infection should be confirmed in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2234100137,"Mutual interference involves direct interactions between individuals of the same species that may alter their foraging success. Larvae of aphidophagous coccinellids typically stay within a patch during their lifetime, displaying remarkable aggregation to their prey. Thus, as larvae are exposed to each other, frequent encounters may affect their foraging success. A study was initiated in order to determine the effect of mutual interference in the coccinellids' feeding rate. One to four 4th larval instars of the fourteen-spotted ladybird beetle Propylea quatuordecimpunctata were exposed for 6 hours into plastic containers with different densities of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, on potted Vicia faba plants. The data were used to fit a purely prey-dependent Holling type II model and its alternatives which account for interference competition and have thus far been underutilized, i.e. the Beddington-DeAngelis, the Crowley-Martin and a modified Hassell-Varley model. The Crowley-Martin mechanistic model appeared to be slightly better among the competing models. The results showed that although the feeding rate became approximately independent of predator density at high prey density, some predator dependence in the coccinellid's functional response was observed at the low prey-high predator density combination. It appears that at low prey densities, digestion breaks are negligible so that the predators do waste time interfering with each other, whereas at high prey densities time loss during digestion breaks may fully accommodate the cost of interference, so that the time cost may be negligible."
https://openalex.org/W2240014735,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the benefit of chemotherapy, combined with palliative radiotherapy (PRT) and other local treatments to the metastatic sites, for patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who had a performance status 0–2. We conducted a retrospective review of available data from 197 biopsy-proven NPC patients who developed metastasis after their initial definitive treatment. These patients were grouped into three categories according to the different treatment paths that were followed: the best supportive care (64 patients), chemotherapy alone (55 patients), and multimodality treatment with chemotherapy combined with PRT and other local treatments to metastatic sites (78 patients). The 2-year metastatic survival rate of patients in the multimodality treatment group was 57.7%, which was significantly better than that of the patients in both the chemotherapy alone group and the best supportive care group (32.7% and 1.6%, respectively). The independent significant factors affecting survival were the disease-free interval prior to the detection of metastatic disease, the number of metastases, the number of chemotherapy cycles and the biological effective dose of PRT. In conclusion, multimodality treatment may improve survival of select patients with recurrent NPC with distant metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2235765005,"Streptococcus pyogenes is a human commensal and a bacterial pathogen responsible for a wide variety of human diseases differing in symptoms, severity, and tissue tropism. The completed genome sequences of >37 strains of S. pyogenes, representing diverse disease-causing serotypes, have been published. The greatest genetic variation among these strains is attributed to numerous integrated prophage and prophage-like elements, encoding several virulence factors. A comparison of isogenic strains, differing in prophage content, would reveal the effects of these elements on streptococcal pathogenesis. However, curing strains of prophage is often difficult and sometimes unattainable. We have applied a novel counter-selection approach to identify rare S. pyogenes mutants spontaneously cured of select prophage. To accomplish this, we first inserted a two-gene cassette containing a gene for kanamycin resistance (KanR) and the rpsL wild-type gene, responsible for dominant streptomycin sensitivity (SmS), into a targeted prophage on the chromosome of a streptomycin resistant (SmR) mutant of S. pyogenes strain SF370. We then applied antibiotic counter-selection for the re-establishment of the KanS/SmR phenotype to select for isolates cured of targeted prophage. This methodology allowed for the precise selection of spontaneous phage loss and restoration of the natural phage attB attachment sites for all four prophage-like elements in this S. pyogenes chromosome. Overall, 15 mutants were constructed that encompassed every permutation of phage knockout as well as a mutant strain, named CEM1ΔΦ, completely cured of all bacteriophage elements (a ~10% loss of the genome); the only reported S. pyogenes strain free of prophage-like elements. We compared CEM1ΔΦ to the WT strain by analyzing differences in secreted DNase activity, as well as lytic and lysogenic potential. These mutant strains should allow for the direct examination of bacteriophage relationships within S. pyogenes and further elucidate how the presence of prophage may affect overall streptococcal survival, pathogenicity, and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2238686973,"Species distribution models are widely used for stream bioassessment, estimating changes in habitat suitability and identifying conservation priorities. We tested the accuracy of three modelling strategies (single species ensemble, multi-species response and community classification models) to predict fish assemblages at reference stream segments in coastal subtropical Australia. We aimed to evaluate each modelling strategy for consistency of predictor variable selection; determine which strategy is most suitable for stream bioassessment using fish indicators; and appraise which strategies best match other stream management applications. Five models, one single species ensemble, two multi-species response and two community classification models, were calibrated using fish species presence-absence data from 103 reference sites. Models were evaluated for generality and transferability through space and time using four external reference site datasets. Elevation and catchment slope were consistently identified as key correlates of fish assemblage composition among models. The community classification models had high omission error rates and contributed fewer taxa to the 'expected' component of the taxonomic completeness (O/E50) index than the other strategies. This potentially decreases the model sensitivity for site impact assessment. The ensemble model accurately and precisely modelled O/E50 for the training data, but produced biased predictions for the external datasets. The multi-species response models afforded relatively high accuracy and precision coupled with low bias across external datasets and had lower taxa omission rates than the community classification models. They inherently included rare, but predictable species while excluding species that were poorly modelled among all strategies. We suggest that the multi-species response modelling strategy is most suited to bioassessment using freshwater fish assemblages in our study area. At the species level, the ensemble model exhibited high sensitivity without reductions in specificity, relative to the other models. We suggest that this strategy is well suited to other non-bioassessment stream management applications, e.g., identifying priority areas for species conservation."

On the other hand, second-to forth digit ratio (2D/4D) has been used as an indirect method to investigate the putative effects of prenatal exposure to androgen. In the present study, we herein investigated the relationship between gender-role play behavior and the second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D/4D), which has been used as an indirect method to investigate the putative effects of prenatal exposure to androgens, in school-aged children. Among 4981 children who became 8 years old by November 2014 and were contactable for this survey by The Hokkaido Study of Environment and Children's Health, 1631 (32.7%), who had data for 2D/4D and Pre-school Activities Inventory (PSAI) as well as data for the survey at baseline, were available for analysis. Parents sent reports of PSAI on the sex-typical characteristics, preferred toys, and play activities of children, and black and white photocopies of the left and right hand palms via mail. PSAI consisted of 12 masculine items and 12 feminine items, and a composite score was created by subtracting the feminine score from the masculine score, with higher scores representing masculine-typical behavior. While composite scores in PSAI were significantly higher in boys than in girls, 2D/4D was significantly lower in boys than in girls. Although the presence or absence of brothers or sisters affected the composite, masculine, and feminine scored of PSAI, a multivariate regression model revealed that 2D/4D negatively correlated with the composite scores of PSAI in boys, whereas no correlation was found in girls. Although 2D/4D negatively correlated with the masculine score in boys and girls, no correlation was observed between 2D/4D and the feminine score. In conclusion, although social factors, such as the existence of brother or sisters, affect dimorphic brain development and behavior in childhood, the present study revealed that the prenatal hormonal environment was an important factor influencing masculine-typical dimorphic brain development and behavior in school-aged children."

Analysis of complex metatranscriptome datasets of these communities poses a considerable bioinformatic challenge since they are non-restricted with a varying number of participating strains and species. For RNA-Seq data a standard approach is to align the generated reads to a set of closely related reference genomes. This only works well for microbial communities for which a near complete catalogue of reference genomes is available at a small evolutionary distance. In this study, we focus on the design of a validated de novo metatranscriptome assembly pipeline for single-end Illumina RNA-Seq data to obtain functional and taxonomic profiles of murine microbial communities.The here developed de novo assembly metatranscriptome pipeline combined rRNA removal, IDBA-UD assembler, functional annotation and taxonomic classification. Different assemblers were tested and validated using RNA-Seq data from an in silico generated mock community and in vivo RNA-Seq data from a restricted microbial community taken from a mouse model colonized with Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF). Precision and recall of resulting gene expression, functional and taxonomic profiles were compared to those obtained with a standard alignment method. The validated pipeline was subsequently used to generate expression profiles from non-restricted cecal communities of four C57BL/6J mice fed on a high-fat high-protein diet spiked with an RNA-Seq data set from a well-characterized human sample. The spike in control was used to estimate precision and recall at assembly, functional and taxonomic level of non-restricted communities.A generic de novo assembly pipeline for metatranscriptome data analysis was designed for microbial ecosystems, which can be applied for microbial metatranscriptome analysis in any chosen niche."
https://openalex.org/W2309057440,"TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potential cancer therapy that selectively targets cancer cell death while non-malignant cells remain viable. Using a panel of normal human fibroblasts, we characterized molecular differences in human foreskin fibroblasts and WI-38 TRAIL-resistant cells and marginally sensitive MRC-5 cells compared with TRAIL-sensitive human lung and colon cancer cells. We identified decreased caspase-8 protein expression and protein stability in normal fibroblasts compared with cancer cells. Additionally, normal fibroblasts had incomplete TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation compared with cancer cells. We found that normal fibroblasts lack the ubiquitin modification of caspase-8 required for complete caspase-8 activation. Treatment with the deubiquitinase inhibitor PR-619 increased caspase-8 ubiquitination and caspase-8 enzymatic activity and sensitized normal fibroblasts to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, posttranslational regulation of caspase-8 confers resistance to TRAIL-induced cell death in normal cells through blockade of initiation of the extrinsic cell death pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2236957651,"Glioblastoma multiforme is a malignant brain tumor with poor prognosis and high morbidity due to its invasiveness. Hypoxia-driven motility and concentration-driven motility are two mechanisms of glioblastoma multiforme invasion in the brain. The use of anti-angiogenic drugs has uncovered new progression patterns of glioblastoma multiforme associated with significant differences in overall survival. Here, we apply a mathematical model of glioblastoma multiforme growth and invasion in humans and design computational trials using agents that target angiogenesis, tumor replication rates, or motility. The findings link highly-dispersive, moderately-dispersive, and hypoxia-driven tumors to the patterns observed in glioblastoma multiforme treated by anti-angiogenesis, consisting of progression by Expanding FLAIR, Expanding FLAIR + Necrosis, and Expanding Necrosis, respectively. Furthermore, replication rate-reducing strategies (e.g. Tumor Treating Fields) appear to be effective in highly-dispersive and moderately-dispersive tumors but not in hypoxia-driven tumors. The latter may respond to motility-reducing agents. In a population computational trial, with all three phenotypes, a correlation was observed between the efficacy of the rate-reducing agent and the prolongation of overall survival times. This research highlights the potential applications of computational trials and supports new hypotheses on glioblastoma multiforme phenotypes and treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W2239477826,"The mammalian circadian clock influences most aspects of physiology and behavior through the transcriptional control of a wide variety of genes, mostly in a tissue-specific manner. About 20 clock-controlled genes (CCGs) oscillate in virtually all mammalian tissues and are generally considered as core clock components. One of them is Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (Usp2), whose status remains controversial, as it may be a cogwheel regulating the stability or activity of core cogwheels or an output effector. We report here that Usp2 is a clock output effector related to bodily Ca2+ homeostasis, a feature that is conserved across evolution. Drosophila with a whole-body knockdown of the orthologue of Usp2, CG14619 (dUsp2-kd), predominantly die during pupation but are rescued by dietary Ca2+ supplementation. Usp2-KO mice show hyperabsorption of dietary Ca2+ in small intestine, likely due to strong overexpression of the membrane scaffold protein NHERF4, a regulator of the Ca2+ channel TRPV6 mediating dietary Ca2+ uptake. In this tissue, USP2-45 is found in membrane fractions and negatively regulates NHERF4 protein abundance in a rhythmic manner at the protein level. In clock mutant animals (Cry1/Cry2-dKO), rhythmic USP2-45 expression is lost, as well as the one of NHERF4, confirming the inverse relationship between USP2-45 and NHERF4 protein levels. Finally, USP2-45 interacts in vitro with NHERF4 and endogenous Clathrin Heavy Chain. Taken together these data prompt us to define USP2-45 as the first clock output effector acting at the post-translational level at cell membranes and possibly regulating membrane permeability of Ca2+."

DNA lesions within CRE modulate CREB1 binding negatively and positively. Because appropriate DNA lesions also interact with base excision repair proteins, we investigated whether CREB1 and repair glycosylases compete with each other. We incubated 39-mer CRE-containing double-stranded oligonucleotides with recombinant CREB1 alone or with UNG2 or OGG1, followed by EMSA. The CpG islet within CRE was modified to contain a G/U or 8-oxoG (°G)/C mispair. OGG1 and CREB1 reversibly competed for CRE containing an °G/C pair. Also, OGG1 blocked CREB1 from dimerizing by 69%, even when total CREB1 binding was reduced only by 20–30%. In contrast, bound CREB1 completely prevented access to G/U-containing CRE by UNG2 and, therefore, to base excision repair, whereas UNG2 exposure prevented CREB1 binding. CREB1 dimerization was unaffected by UNG2 when CREB1 bound to CRE, but was greatly reduced by prior UNG2 exposure. To explore physiological relevance, we microinjected zebrafish embryos with the same oligonucleotides, as a sink for endogenous CREB1. As predicted, microinjection with unmodified or lesion-containing CRE, but not scrambled CRE or scrambled CRE with a G/U mispair, resulted in increased embryo death.

https://openalex.org/W2239086392,"Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that cardiovascular risk is not only determined by conventional risk factors in adulthood, but also by early life events which may reprogram vascular function. To evaluate the effect of maternal diabetes on fetal programming of vascular tone in offspring and its evolution during adulthood, we investigated vascular reactivity of third order mesenteric arteries from diabetic mother offspring (DMO) and control mother offspring (CMO) aged 3 and 18 months. In arteries isolated from DMO the relaxation induced by prostacyclin analogues was reduced in both 3- and 18-month old animals although endothelium (acetylcholine)-mediated relaxation was reduced in 18-month old DMO only. Endothelium-independent (sodium nitroprusside) relaxation was not affected. Pressure-induced myogenic tone, which controls local blood flow, was reduced in 18-month old CMO compared to 3-month old CMO. Interestingly, myogenic tone was maintained at a high level in 18-month old DMO even though agonist-induced vasoconstriction was not altered. These perturbations, in 18-months old DMO rats, were associated with an increased pMLC/MLC, pPKA/PKA ratio and an activated RhoA protein. Thus, we highlighted perturbations in the reactivity of resistance mesenteric arteries in DMO, at as early as 3 months of age, followed by the maintenance of high myogenic tone in older rats. These modifications are in favour of excessive vasoconstrictor tone. These results evidenced a fetal programming of vascular functions of resistance arteries in adult rats exposed in utero to maternal diabetes, which could explain a re-setting of vascular functions and, at least in part, the occurrence of hypertension later in life."
https://openalex.org/W2239177589,"A considerable body of sensory research has addressed the rules governing simultaneity judgments (SJs) and temporal order judgments (TOJs). In principle, neural events that register stimulus-arrival-time differences at an early sensory stage could set the limit on SJs and TOJs alike. Alternatively, distinct limits on SJs and TOJs could arise from task-specific neural events occurring after the stimulus-driven stage. To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a novel reaction-time (RT) measure and tested it in a perceptual-learning procedure. The stimuli comprised dual-stream Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) displays. Participants judged either the simultaneity or temporal order of red-letter and black-number targets presented in opposite lateral hemifield streams of black-letter distractors. Despite identical visual stimulation across-tasks, the SJ and TOJ tasks generated distinct RT patterns. SJs exhibited significantly faster RTs to synchronized targets than to subtly asynchronized targets; TOJs exhibited the opposite RT pattern. These task-specific RT patterns cannot be attributed to the early, stimulus-driven stage and instead match what one would predict if the limits on SJs and TOJs arose from task-specific decision spaces. That is, synchronized targets generate strong evidence for simultaneity, which hastens SJ RTs. By contrast, synchronized targets provide no information about temporal order, which slows TOJ RTs. Subtly asynchronizing the targets reverses this information pattern, and the corresponding RT patterns. In addition to investigating RT patterns, we also investigated training-transfer between the tasks. Training to improve SJ precision failed to improve TOJ precision, and vice versa, despite identical visual stimulation across tasks. This, too, argues against early, stimulus-driven limits on SJs and TOJs. Taken together, the present study offers novel evidence that distinct rules set the limits on SJs and TOJs."
https://openalex.org/W2236269327,"Light signals from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) entrain the circadian clock and regulate negative masking. Two neurotransmitters, glutamate and Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Polypeptide (PACAP), found in the ipRGCs transmit light signals to the brain via glutamate receptors and the specific PACAP type 1 (PAC1) receptor. Light entrainment occurs during the twilight zones and has little effect on clock phase during daytime. When nocturnal animals have access to food only for a few hours during the resting phase at daytime, they adapt behavior to the restricted feeding (RF) paradigm and show food anticipatory activity (FAA). A recent study in mice and rats demonstrating that light regulates FAA prompted us to investigate the role of PACAP/PAC1 signaling in the light mediated regulation of FAA. PAC1 receptor knock out (PAC1-/-) and wild type (PAC1+/+) mice placed in running wheels were examined in a full photoperiod (FPP) of 12:12 h light/dark (LD) and a skeleton photoperiod (SPP) 1:11:1:11 h L:DD:L:DD at 300 and 10 lux light intensity. Both PAC1-/- mice and PAC1+/+ littermates entrained to FPP and SPP at both light intensities. However, when placed in RF with access to food for 4–5 h during the subjective day, a significant change in behavior was observed in PAC1-/- mice compared to PAC1+/+ mice. While PAC1-/- mice showed similar FAA as PAC1+/+ animals in FPP at 300 lux, PAC1-/- mice demonstrated an advanced onset of FAA with a nearly 3-fold increase in amplitude compared to PAC1+/+ mice when placed in SPP at 300 lux. The same pattern of FAA was observed at 10 lux during both FPP and SPP. The present study indicates a role of PACAP/PAC1 signaling during light regulated FAA. Most likely, PACAP found in ipRGCs mediating non-image forming light information to the brain is involved."

Apple (‘Golden Delicious’) pulp discs prepared from pre-climacteric fruit were treated with 50 mg L-1 CHA and incubated in flasks with 10 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0, 11% sorbitol). Compared to the control samples, treatment with CHA significantly reduced ethylene production and respiration rate, and enhanced levels of firmness and soluble solids content of the pulp discs during incubation at 25°C. These results suggested that CHA could retard senescence of the apple pulp discs. Proteomics analysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) revealed that the expressions of several key proteins correlated to fruit ripening and senescence were affected by the treatment with CHA. Further study showed that treating the pulp discs with CHA remarkably reduced levels of lipoxygenase, β-galactosidase, NADP-malic enzyme, and enzymatic activities of lipoxygenase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, all of which are known as promoters of fruit ripening and senescence. These results could provide new insights into the functions of endogenous phenolic compounds in fruit ripening and senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2238644429,"Fish spawning is often used as an integrated measure of reproductive toxicity, and an indicator of aquatic ecosystem health in the context of forecasting potential population-level effects considered important for ecological risk assessment. Consequently, there is a need for flexible, widely-applicable, biologically-based models that can predict changes in fecundity in response to chemical exposures, based on readily measured biochemical endpoints, such as plasma vitellogenin (VTG) concentrations, as input parameters. Herein we describe a MATLAB® version of an oocyte growth dynamics model for fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) with a graphical user interface based upon a previously published model developed with MCSim software and evaluated with data from fathead minnows exposed to an androgenic chemical, 17β-trenbolone. We extended the evaluation of our new model to include six chemicals that inhibit enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis: fadrozole, ketoconazole, propiconazole, prochloraz, fenarimol, and trilostane. In addition, for unexposed fathead minnows from group spawning design studies, and those exposed to the six chemicals, we evaluated whether the model is capable of predicting the average number of eggs per spawn and the average number of spawns per female, which was not evaluated previously. The new model is significantly improved in terms of ease of use, platform independence, and utility for providing output in a format that can be used as input into a population dynamics model. Model-predicted minimum and maximum cumulative fecundity over time encompassed the observed data for fadrozole and most propiconazole, prochloraz, fenarimol and trilostane treatments, but did not consistently replicate results from ketoconazole treatments. For average fecundity (eggs•female-1•day-1), eggs per spawn, and the number of spawns per female, the range of model-predicted values generally encompassed the experimentally observed values. Overall, we found that the model predicts reproduction metrics robustly and its predictions capture the variability in the experimentally observed data."

Methods Formulation of noscapine (Nos) self-emulsifying solid dispersible microparticles (SESDs) was afforded by emulsification using an optimized formula of Labrafil M1944, Tween-80, and Labrasol followed by spray-drying with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), with and without mannosamine (Mann-Nos_SESDs and Nos_SESDs respectively); self-microemulsifying liquid dispersions (SMEDDs) with and without mannosamine (Mann-Nos_SMEDDs and Nos_SMEDDs respectively) were also prepared. SMEDDs and SESDs were characterized for size, polydispersity, surface charge, entrapment efficiency, in vitro permeability, in vitro release kinetics, and oral pharmacokinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats (10 mg/kg p.o). The antitumor efficacy of Mann-Nos_SESDs on the basis of chemosensitization to cisplatin (2.0 mg/kg, IV) was investigated in a chemorefractory lung tumor Nu/Nu mouse model up to a maximal oral dose of 300 mg/kg. Results The oil/surfactant/co-surfactant mixture of Labrafil M1944, Tween-80, and Labrasol optimized at weight ratios of 62.8:9.30:27.90% produced stable self-microemulsifying dispersions (SMEDDs) at a SMEDD to water ratio of 1–3:7–9 parts by weight. SMEDDs had hydrodynamic diameters between 231 and 246 nm; surface charges ranged from -16.50 to -18.7 mV; and entrapment efficiencies were between 32 and 35%. SESDs ranged in size between 5.84 and 6.60 μm with surface charges from -10.62 to -12.40 mV and entrapment efficiencies of 30.96±4.66 and 32.05±3.72% (Nos_SESDs and Mann-Nos_SESDs respectively). Mann-Nos_SESDs exhibited saturating uptake across Caco-2 monolayers (Papp = 4.94±0.18 × 10−6 cm/s), with controlled release of 50% of Nos in 6 hr at pH 6.8 following Higuchi kinetics. Mann-Nos_ SESDs was 40% more bioavailable compared to Nos_SESDs; and was effective in sensitizing H1650 SP cells to Cisplatin in vitro and in an orthotopic lung tumor model of H1650 SP origin. Conclusions Mannosylated noscapine self-emulsifying solid dispersions (Mann-Nos_SESDs) are bioavailable and potentiate the antineoplastic effect of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC."

Although the absence of upper incisors is rare in proboscideans (occurring only in deinotheres), the independent losses of lower incisors are recognized for most of its lineages (dibelodont condition). The presence of lower incisors in the Pan-American gomphothere Cuvieronius hyodon was reported a few times in literature, but it was neglected in systematic studies. We analyzed several specimens of Cuvieronius hyodon from the Americas and recognized that immature individuals had lower incisors during very early post-natal developmental stages. Subsequently, these are lost and lower incisors alveoli close during later developmental stages, before maturity. Moreover, for the first time in a formal cladistic analysis of non-amebelodontine trilophodont gomphotheres, Rhynchotherium and Cuvieronius were recovered as sister-taxa. Among several non-ambiguous synapomorphies, the presence of lower incisors diagnoses this clade. We recognize that the presence of lower incisors in Cuvieronius and Rhynchotherium is an unique case of taxic atavism among the Elephantimorpha, since these structures are lost at the origin of the ingroup.

As part of a group, individuals spend less time being vigilant, and vigilance decreases with increasing group size. This phenomenon, called ""the many-eyes effect"", together with the ""encounter dilution effect"", is considered among the most important factors determining individual vigilance behavior. However, in addition to group size, other social and environmental factors also influence the degree of vigilance, including disturbance from human activities. In our study, we examined vigilance behavior of Khulans (Equus hemionus) in the Xinjiang Province in western China to test whether and how human disturbance and group size affect vigilance. According to our results, Khulan showed a negative correlation between group size and the percentage time spent vigilant, although this negative correlation depended on the groups' disturbance level. Khulan in the more disturbed area had a dampened benefit from increases in group size, compared to those in the undisturbed core areas. Provision of continuous areas of high-quality habitat for Khulans will allow them to form larger undisturbed aggregations and to gain foraging benefits through reduced individual vigilance, as well as anti-predator benefits through increased probability of predator detection."

Soluble ClyA monomers spontaneously assemble into annular dodecameric pore complexes upon contact with membranes or detergent. At ClyA monomer concentrations above ∼100 nm, the rate-limiting step in detergent- or membrane- induced pore assembly is the unimolecular reaction from the monomer to the assembly-competent protomer, which then oligomerizes rapidly to active pore complexes. In the absence of detergent, ClyA slowly forms soluble oligomers. Here we show that soluble ClyA oligomers cannot form dodecameric pore complexes after the addition of detergent and are hemolytically inactive. In addition, we demonstrate that the natural cysteine pair Cys-87/Cys-285 of ClyA forms a disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions and that both the oxidized and reduced ClyA monomers assemble to active pores via the same pathway in the presence of detergent, in which an unstructured, monomeric intermediate is transiently populated. The results show that the oxidized ClyA monomer assembles to pore complexes about one order of magnitude faster than the reduced monomer because the unstructured intermediate of oxidized ClyA is less stable and dissolves more rapidly than the reduced intermediate.

Some of the most potent bacterial toxins are PFTs, such as anthrax toxin (2Blaustein R.O. Koehler T.M. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A.

A common feature of all PFTs is the conversion from a soluble, monomeric form into a membrane-embedded oligomeric pore complex (1Gonzalez M.R. Bischofberger M. Pernot L. van der Goot F.G. Frêche B.

The membrane-spanning region of the pore can be formed either by α-helices or β-strands; therefore, PFTs are classified as α-PFTs and β-PFTs (4Parker M.W. Feil S.C.

The tail domain contains a conserved cysteine pair (Cys-87 and Cys-285 in α-helix B and G, respectively) that form a disulfide bond (12Wallace A.J. Stillman T.J. Atkins A. Jamieson S.J. Bullough P.A.

During pore formation, ClyA undergoes major structural rearrangements involving more than 50% of all of its amino acids (11Mueller M. Grauschopf U. Maier T. Glockshuber R. Ban N. The structure of a cytolytic α-helical toxin pore reveals its assembly mechanism.Nature. 2009; 459: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The head domain of the monomer forms elongations of the flanking α-helices (C and F) of the tail domain, and the β-hairpin undergoes a β-to-α transition. The N-terminal α-helix (αA), which is part of the five-helix bundle of the tail domain in the monomer, swings around by 180°, elongating the flanking α-helix B and leaving a four-helix bundle in the protomer (Fig. 1). The remaining four α-helices of the tail domain rearrange to close the gap left by αA (11Mueller M. Grauschopf U. Maier T. Glockshuber R. Ban N. The structure of a cytolytic α-helical toxin pore reveals its assembly mechanism.Nature. 2009; 459: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of αA forms the channel through the target cell membrane. The cysteine pair Cys-87/Cys-285 in the reduced protomer remains in spatial proximity with a Cα-Cα distance of 6.8 Å (Fig. 1), which would still enable the formation of a disulfide bond (15Fass D. Disulfide bonding in protein biophysics.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2012; 41: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The formation of the assembly-competent protomer is the rate-limiting step (14Eifler N. Vetsch M. Gregorini M. Ringler P. Chami M. Philippsen A. Fritz A. Müller S.A. Glockshuber R. Engel A.

Characterization of variants of the pore-forming toxin ClyA from Escherichia coli controlled by a redox switch.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6357-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) for pore formation. Recently, a new study on ClyA activation and pore assembly proposed an alternative mechanism of pore assembly (17Fahie M. Romano F.B. Chisholm C. Heuck A.P. Zbinden M. Chen M. A non-classical assembly pathway of Escherichia coli pore-forming toxin cytolysin A.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31042-31051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The authors discovered two distinct, homo-oligomeric species of ClyA that are formed in the absence of detergent or membranes (termed soluble oligomers below). These oligomers were interpreted as prepores, similar to soluble, oligomeric intermediates in the pore formation of many β-PFTs (18Degiacomi M.T. Iacovache I. Pernot L. Chami M. Kudryashev M. Stahlberg H. van der Goot F.G. Dal Peraro M. Molecular assembly of the aerolysin pore reveals a swirling membrane-insertion mechanism.Nat. Chem.

Crystal structure of the anthrax toxin protective antigen.Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Here we examined this alternative pore formation mechanism of ClyA further. We found no evidence for pore formation or efficient target cell lysis when these soluble oligomers were mixed with detergent or horse erythrocytes, respectively. In fact, the soluble ClyA oligomers showed only 1–2% hemolytic activity relative to ClyA monomers. In addition, no pores could be observed by electron microscopy after incubation of soluble oligomers with detergent (n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM)) under conditions where the majority of ClyA monomers assembled into dodecameric pore complexes. We therefore interpreted the soluble oligomers as off-pathway products of ClyA pore formation. This conclusion is supported by the finding that the kinetics of soluble oligomer formation coincided with loss in hemolytic activity. In addition, we compared oligomer formation and hemolytic activity of the reduced, dithiol form of ClyA (ClyAred) with pore formation of the oxidized, disulfide form (ClyAox) to address contradictory reports in the literature, which had described ClyAox either as assembly-incompetent and inactive (13Atkins A.

Cytotoxin ClyA from Escherichia coli assembles to a 13-meric pore independent of its redox-state.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2652-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that ClyAox monomers have essentially the same specific hemolytic activity compared with monomeric ClyAred but form inactive, soluble oligomers 13–14 times faster than ClyAred upon incubation in the absence of detergent or membranes. The results provide a plausible explanation for previous, contradictory reports on the assembly competence of ClyAox. Finally we also investigated the mechanism of the DDM-induced monomer-to-protomer formation of ClyAox with single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, demonstrating that ClyAox follows the same reaction pathway as ClyAred, in which an unstructured off-pathway intermediate (Iox) is formed (21Benke S. Roderer D. Wunderlich B. Nettels D. Glockshuber R. Schuler B. The assembly dynamics of the cytolytic pore toxin ClyA.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Due to the lower stability of Iox compared with Ired, assembly-competent protomers are even formed one order of magnitude faster from monomeric ClyAox compared with monomeric ClyAred. Chemicals of the highest available purity were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma-Aldrich. Dithiothreithol (DTT), EDTA and β-mercaptoethanol were obtained from AppliChem. DDM was purchased from Anatrace. Brain total lipid extract was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, and horse erythrocytes were obtained from Oxoid AG. To exclude any influence of an N- or C-terminal polyhistidine purification tag on the activity and assembly of ClyA, we introduced a TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease cleavage site between the N-terminal His6 tag and the natural ClyA sequence into the previously described ClyA expression plasmid derived from pET11a (14Eifler N. Vetsch M. Gregorini M. Ringler P. Chami M. Philippsen A. Fritz A. Müller S.A. Glockshuber R. Engel A. Grauschopf U. Cytotoxin ClyA from Escherichia coli assembles to a 13-meric pore independent of its redox-state.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2652-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ClyA production in E. coli was carried out at 20 °C for 15 h, as described (16Roderer D. Benke S. Müller M. Fäh-Rechsteiner H. Ban N. Schuler B. Glockshuber R. Characterization of variants of the pore-forming toxin ClyA from Escherichia coli controlled by a redox switch.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6357-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ClyA was purified from the soluble fraction of the cell extract by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography followed by chromatography on hydroxyapatite as described (14Eifler N. Vetsch M. Gregorini M.

Cytotoxin ClyA from Escherichia coli assembles to a 13-meric pore independent of its redox-state.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2652-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The N-terminal His6 tag of ClyA was then cleaved by recombinant His6-tagged TEV protease (22Finder V.H. Vodopivec I. Nitsch R.M. Glockshuber R. The recombinant amyloid-β peptide Aβ1–42 aggregates faster and is more neurotoxic than synthetic Aβ1–42.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and the resulting wild-type ClyA (residues Thr2-Val 303) was obtained in the flow-through of a second Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography as described (16Roderer D. Benke S. Müller M. Fäh-Rechsteiner H. Ban N. Schuler B. Glockshuber R. Characterization of variants of the pore-forming toxin ClyA from Escherichia coli controlled by a redox switch.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6357-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All purification steps and the proteolytic cleavage were performed under reducing conditions with buffers containing 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (when Ni2+-NTA columns were used) or 2 mm DTT. The yield of reduced wild-type ClyA (ClyAred) was 16 mg of ClyA/liter of bacterial culture. The concentration of ClyA was determined via its specific absorbance at 280 nm (30370 m−1cm−1 for ClyAred). The ClyAred monomer was stored in PBS buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) with 2 mm DTT at 4 °C and showed no oligomerization within 7 days. To generate the disulfide-bonded oxidized form of ClyA, ClyAred (40 μm) was incubated in PBS buffer with 0.5 mm CuCl2 (i.e. 0.4 mm free CuCl2) as a catalyst of air oxidation for 3–4 h at 22 °C. These conditions guaranteed complete oxidation of the Cys-87/Cys-285 pair of ClyA (see below). Oxidized ClyA (ClyAox) was subsequently dialyzed at 4 °C against PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with PBS to separate oxidized monomers from oxidized oligomers. The absence of free thiols in the purified oxidized monomers was confirmed by Ellman's assay (23Ellman G.L. A colorimetric method for determining low concentrations of mercaptans.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) under denaturing conditions (4.0 m guanidinium chloride, pH 8.0) and by analytical reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) at 30 °C on a Zorbax SB300 C8 column (Agilent) using a water-acetonitrile gradient from 50 to 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (see Fig. 2A). The ClyAox monomer was stored in PBS buffer without DTT at 4 °C and showed no oligomerization within 1.5 days. The reduction of ClyAox (monomer, oligomer, or assembled pore complex in 0.1% DDM) was performed in PBS with 100 mm DTT, pH 7.3, at 37 °C and quantified by RP-HPLC as described previously (16Roderer D. Benke S. Müller M. Fäh-Rechsteiner H. Ban N. Schuler B. Glockshuber R. Characterization of variants of the pore-forming toxin ClyA from Escherichia coli controlled by a redox switch.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6357-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The reduction of unfolded ClyAox was carried out in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, 4.0 m guanidinium chloride, pH 7.3, with 20 mm DTT at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched after different time intervals by the addition of formic acid (12% final concentration), and samples were analyzed via RP-HPLC. The peaks corresponding to oxidized and reduced ClyA were integrated, and the data were evaluated according to pseudo first-order kinetics. The reaction between monomeric ClyAred (4 μm) and oxidized DsbAox (86 μm, corresponding to the periplasmic DsbA concentration in E. coli (24Crespo M.D. Puorger C. Schärer M.A. Eidam O. Grütter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. Quality control of disulfide bond formation in pilus subunits by the chaperone FimC.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) at pH 7.3 and 37 °C, was analyzed in the same way. A ClyA variant with cysteine residues introduced at positions 56 and 252 (ClyACys) was expressed, purified, and labeled at Cys-56 with Alexa Fluor 488 and at Cys-252 with Alexa Fluor 594 as described previously (21Benke S. Roderer D. Wunderlich B. Nettels D. Glockshuber R. Schuler B. The assembly dynamics of the cytolytic pore toxin ClyA.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Air oxidation of the natural cysteine pair Cys-87/Cys-285 in the labeled ClyACys variant (4 μm) was performed by incubation in 50 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4 pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 mm CuCl2 for 5 h at 22 °C. Oligomers formed during this reaction were removed from the monomers by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 10/300 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in PBS. The quantitative formation of the disulfide bonded Cys-87–Cys-285 was confirmed by reversed phase HPLC on an XTerra RP8 (30 × 4.6 mm) column (Waters) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid using a gradient from 30 to 60% acetonitrile. Oligomers of reduced or oxidized ClyA were formed in the absence of detergents or lipids by incubation at 37 °C (17Fahie M. Romano F.B. Chisholm C. Heuck A.P. Zbinden M. Chen M. A non-classical assembly pathway of Escherichia coli pore-forming toxin cytolysin A.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31042-31051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For preparative purposes, ClyAred (40 μm) was incubated overnight at 37 °C in PBS, pH 7.3, and subsequently subjected to gel filtration (Superdex 200) to separate the oligomer from the remaining monomer. In the case of ClyAox, a 4-h incubation at 22 °C (conditions of oxidation of ClyA) resulted in a sufficient amount of oligomeric ClyA (Fig. 2A). The kinetics of oligomerization of ClyAox and ClyAred in PBS at 4 °C or 37 °C were determined by quantification of the respective amount of monomeric or oligomeric ClyA via gel filtration on a ProSEC 300S column (Agilent) after different incubation times, starting with ClyA monomer at 5 μm concentration. The decrease in the monomer over time was fitted mono-exponentially, assuming a unimolecular rate-limiting step, which is consistent with previous findings that oligomer formation is concentration-independent at micromolar monomer concentrations (17Fahie M. Romano F.B. Chisholm C. Heuck A.P. Zbinden M. Chen M. A non-classical assembly pathway of Escherichia coli pore-forming toxin cytolysin A.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 31042-31051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To trigger pore formation from monomers, ClyA (2 μm in PBS) was incubated in 0.1% DDM for 1 h at 22 °C. Samples were adsorbed on glow-discharged 300-mesh carbon-coated copper grids (Quantifoil) and negatively stained with 2 mm uranyl acetate. Images were recorded by a KeenView CCD camera using a FEI Morgagni electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The kinetics of ClyA-dependent lysis of horse erythrocytes were measured as described previously (25Rennie R.P. Freer J.H. Arbuthnott J.P. The kinetics of erythrocyte lysis by Escherichia coli haemolysin.J. Med. Microbiol. 1974; 7: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by following the decrease in optical density at 650 nm using a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Agilent). Horse erythrocytes at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in PBS, pH 7.3, were lysed at 37 °C by the addition of ClyA (final monomer concentrations of 2–100 nm). Reactions with ClyAred additionally contained 2 mm DTT. Hemolysis kinetics were evaluated by linearly fitting the data points in the middle of the lysis reaction between 35 and 75% of the initial optical density. The slope of the linear decrease in optical density was defined as the maximum lysis velocity. The linear dependence of the maximum lysis velocity on the concentration of ClyA was defined as the specific hemolytic activity of the different ClyA species (16Roderer D. Benke S. Müller M. Fäh-Rechsteiner H. Ban N. Schuler B. Glockshuber R. Characterization of variants of the pore-forming toxin ClyA from Escherichia coli controlled by a redox switch.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6357-6369Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The monomer-to-protomer transition and pore assembly of ClyAox and ClyAred (9 μm) in PBS at 22 °C was initiated by the addition of DDM (final concentration, 0.1% (w/v)) and followed via the CD signal change at 225 nm using a temperature-controlled J715 CD spectrometer (Jasco). Samples of reduced ClyA additionally contained 2 mm DTT. Before and after assembly, the CD spectra of ClyAox and ClyAred were recorded. The rate-limiting step of the monomer-to-protomer conversion was fitted according to a first-order reaction. Kinetic single-molecule FRET measurements were performed and evaluated essentially as described for the reduced ClyACys variant (21Benke S. Roderer D. Wunderlich B. Nettels D. Glockshuber R.

The measurements were recorded on a modified MicroTime 200 instrument (PicoQuant) using a setup for pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE (26Müller B.K. Zaychikov E. Bräuchle C. Lamb D.C.

The initial phase of protomer formation was measured in a microfluidic mixer (27Wunderlich B. Nettels D. Benke S. Clark J. Weidner S. Hofmann H. Pfeil S.H. Schuler B. Microfluidic mixer designed for performing single-molecule kinetics with confocal detection on timescales from milliseconds to minutes.Nat.

All measurements were done at a nominal concentration of labeled ClyACys of 300 pm in PBS with 0.001% (w/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (w/v) DDM at 22 °C. For recording pore formation kinetics with FRET, excess unlabeled oxidized WT ClyA was added at 10 or 100 nm to achieve the concentrations required to observe the oligomerization of protomers.TABLE 1Single-molecule FRET data sets collected for the kinetic analysis for ClyA protomer and pore formationTotal ClyA concentrationTotal measurement timeRepeats usedTime window lengthBurst min/maxs100 pm60 s (microfluidics)NANA40/300100 pm10 min216080/250100 pm30 min918080/250100 pm60 min290080/25010 nm15 min83080/25010 nm60 min430080/250100 nm5 min243080/250100 nm15 min136080/250100 nm30 min430080/250100 nm60 min260080/250 Open table in a new tab The model fitting of the protomer formation was performed as described for the reduced variant (21Benke S.

The three populations in the transfer efficiency histograms were fitted with Gaussian distributions, once with free amplitudes and once with the amplitudes determined by the kinetic model. Due to the extensive overlap of the peaks, the position and width of the monomer peak function were fixed to the values from the first histogram measured in the microfluidic chip and to those of a reference measurement for the microfluidic mixing and manual mixing data, respectively. As the intermediate is not sufficiently populated in the manual mixing experiments, the position and width of the peak function of the intermediate were fixed to those of the fit of the microfluidic mixing data. The uncertainties of the fitted rate coefficients were estimated with a bootstrap analysis on the level of the individual photon bursts. New sets of photon bursts were synthesized by random sampling with replacement from the original data. One thousand synthetic data sets were created, and the resulting histogram time series were fitted as described above. The resulting distributions of the fit parameters are well described by normal distributions.

https://openalex.org/W2239325772,"Introduction and Purpose of the Study Immigrants in Chile have diverse characteristics and include socioeconomically deprived populations. The location of socioeconomically deprived immigrants is important for the development of public policy intelligence at the local and national levels but their areas of residence have not been mapped in Chile. This study explored the spatial distribution of socioeconomic deprivation among immigrants in Chile, 1992–2012, and compared it to the total population. Material and Methods Areas with socioeconomically deprived populations were identified with a deprivation index which we developed modelled upon the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) for England. Our IMD was based upon the indicators of unemployment, low educational level (primary) and disability from Census data at county level for the three decades 1992, 2002 and 2012, for 332, 339 and 343 counties respectively. We developed two versions of the IMD one based on disadvantage among the total population and another focused upon the circumstances of immigrants only. We generated a spatial representation of the IMD using GIS, for the overall IMD score and for each dimension of the index, separately. We also compared the immigrants´ IMD to the total population´s IMD using Pearson´s correlation test. Results Results showed that socioeconomically deprived immigrants tended to be concentrated in counties in the northern and central area of Chile, in particular within the Metropolitan Region of Santiago. These were the same counties where there was the greatest concentration of socioeconomic deprivation for the total population during the same time periods. Since 1992 there have been significant change in the location of the socioeconomically deprived populations within the Metropolitan Region of Santiago with the highest IMD scores for both the total population and immigrants becoming increasingly concentrated in the central and eastern counties of the Region. Conclusion This is the first study analysing the spatial distribution of socioeconomic deprivation among international immigrants and the total population in a Latin American country. Findings could inform policy makers about location of areas of higher need of social protection in Chile, for both immigrants and the total resident population in the country."

Methods Prospective, interventional, randomized, single-blinded, crossover design study. Patients with newly diagnosed NTG that had not been treated with a glaucoma medication in the most recent 2 months were recruited. In total, 44 patients with NTG were randomly allocated to one of two groups. Patients in group A were treated with DTFC, lubricant, and latanoprost for 4 weeks each, whereas patients in group B were treated with latanoprost, lubricant, and DTFC for 4 weeks each. Patients were examined on day 1 (without medication), week 4 (under medication), week 8 (without medication), and week 12 (under medication). At weeks 4 and 12, diurnal IOP, systolic and diastolic BP, and OPP were measured at 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Results Baseline demographic characteristics showed no difference in terms of age, sex, central corneal thickness, spherical equivalent, or stage of glaucoma between the groups. The between-group difference was -0.19 ± 0.18 mmHg (mean ± SE, upper bound of one-sided 95% CI, 0.12). Diurnal IOP showed no difference between the groups with an average IOP reduction of 13.1% using latanoprost and 12.3% using DTFC. Diurnal systolic and diastolic BP were lower in the DTFC group than the latanoprost group; however, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Diurnal OPP and DOPP also showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. Conclusions IOP lowering efficacy of DTFC was noninferior to that of latanoprost in newly diagnosed NTG patients. There was no difference in BP, OPP, or DOPP between the latanoprost and DTFC groups. This prospective, randomized, single-blinded, crossover study demonstrated the noninferiority of DTFC versus latanoprost in terms of IOP in patients with NTG.

There is a lack of evidence on managerial aspects of the MNCH program management and implementation.This study used qualitative methods to explore the challenges national, provincial and district program managers have faced in implementing a community midwifery program in province of Punjab while also exploring future directions for the program under a devolved health system. While the program had been designed in earnest, the planning lacked critical elements of involving relevant stakeholders in design and implementation, socio-demographic context and capacity of the existing health system. Financial limitations, weak leadership and lack of a political commitment to the problem of maternal health have also had an impact on program implementation.Our study results suggest that there is a need to re-structure the program while ensuring sustainability and collaboration within the health sector to increase uptake of skilled birth attendance and improve maternal health care in Pakistan."

The role of adjuvant treatment after surgery is unknown because of limited available data. The present study evaluated the efficacy of post-surgery adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy in patients with thymic carcinoma. Methods To evaluate the role of adjuvant therapy in patients with thymic carcinoma, we retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with thymic carcinoma who were diagnosed and treated between 2004 and 2014. Results Among 78 patients with thymic carcinoma, 30 patients received surgical resection. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer among these patients than among patients who received other treatments (PFS: 88.4 months vs 9.1 months, p<0.001; OS: 134.9 months vs 60.9 months; p = 0.003). Patients with stage III thymic carcinoma who received surgery had a longer OS than patients who did not receive surgery (70.1 months vs 23.9 months; p = 0.017, n = 11). Among 47 patients with stage IV carcinoma, 12 patients who received an extended thymothymectomy had a longer PFS than 35 patients who did not receive surgery (18.9 months vs 8.7 months; p = 0.029). Among 30 patients (with stage I- IV carcinoma) who received primary lesion surgery, 19 patients received an R0 resection and 9 patients of the 19 patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. These patients had longer PFS (50.3 months) than 2 patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (5.9 months) or 4 patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy (7.5 months) after surgery (p = 0.003). Conclusions Surgical resection should be considered for patients with thymic carcinoma, even for patients with locally advanced or stage IV carcinoma. Adjuvant radiotherapy resulted in a better PFS after R0 resection."

Aside from producing antibodies, B cells are efficient antigen-presenting and cytokine-secreting cells. Diverse polyclonal stimuli have been used to study cytokine production by B cells, but here we used the physiologically relevant self-antigen myelin basic protein (MBP) to stimulate B cells from untreated patients with RRMS and healthy donors. Moreover, we took advantage of the unique ability of the monoclonal antibody MK16 to recognize the immunodominant peptide MBP85-99 presented on HLA-DR15, and used it as a probe to directly study B-cell presentation of self-antigenic peptide. The proportions of B cells producing TNF-α or IL-6 after stimulation with MBP were higher in RRMS patients than in healthy donors, indicating a pro-inflammatory profile for self-reactive patient B cells. In contrast, polyclonal stimulation with PMA + ionomycin and MBP revealed no difference in cytokine profile between B cells from RRMS patients and healthy donors. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) as well as multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS) correlated with reduced ability of B cells to produce IL-10 after stimulation with MBP, indicative of diminished B-cell immune regulatory function in patients with the most severe disease. Moreover, EDSS correlated positively with the frequencies of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 producing B cells after polyclonal stimulation. Patient-derived, IL-10-producing B cells presented MBP85-99 poorly, as did IL-6-producing B cells, particulary in the healthy donor group. B cells from MS patients thus present antigen to T cells in a pro-inflammatory context. These findings contribute to understanding the therapeutic effects of B-cell depletion in human autoimmune diseases, including MS."
https://openalex.org/W2236931892,"Objective Serum bilirubin level has shown to be inversely associated with coronary atherosclerosis, and may serve as a protective biomarker of coronary artery disease. Serum bilirubin has also been shown to be negatively associated with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in men without a history of hypertension, and in men with hypertension. It is unknown whether such associations can be observed in the pre-hypertensive or normotensive population. This study thus aimed to investigate the relationship between serum bilirubin level and increased arterial stiffness in subjects with pre-hypertension and normotension for both genders. Methods A cross-sectional sample of 3,399 apparently healthy subjects undergoing a medical check-up at National Cheng Kung University Hospital was enrolled between October 2006 and August 2009, after excluding subjects with serum total bilirubin level greater than 20.52 μmol/L. Increased arterial stiffness was defined as baPWV of 1,400 cm/s or higher as the dichotomous variable and bilirubin as the continuous variable. Results Based on multiple linear regression analysis, serum bilirubin level was inversely associated with baPWV in non-hypertensive men (β = -0.066, p < 0.001) but not in non-hypertensive women. In addition, the inverse relationship between bilirubin level and baPWV was found statistically significant only in pre-hypertensive men (β = -0.110, p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that serum bilirubin was inversely associated with increased arterial stiffness in men with pre-hypertension (odds ratio = 0.955, 95% confidence interval = 0.916–0.996, p < 0.05) but not normotension after adjustment for other confounding factors. However, the relationship between total bilirubin level and increased arterial stiffness did not reach statistical significance for female subjects with pre-hypertension and normotension. Conclusion Serum bilirubin is inversely associated with increased arterial stiffness in men with pre-hypertension but not normotension. The association between bilirubin level and arterial stiffness was not found significant in women."
https://openalex.org/W2238091472,"Autoantibodies and the immunoreceptors to which they bind can contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (Syk) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with a central role in immunoreceptor (FcR) signaling and immune cell functionality. Syk kinase inhibitors have activity in antibody-dependent immune cell activation assays, in preclinical models of arthritis, and have progressed into clinical trials for RA and other autoimmune diseases. Here we describe the characterization of a novel triazolopyridine-based Syk kinase inhibitor, CC-509. This compound is a potent inhibitor of purified Syk enzyme, FcR-dependent and FcR-independent signaling in primary immune cells, and basophil activation in human whole blood. CC-509 is moderately selective across the kinome and against other non-kinase enzymes or receptors. Importantly, CC-509 was optimized away from and has modest activity against cellular KDR and Jak2, kinases that when inhibited in a preclinical and clinical setting may promote hypertension and neutropenia, respectively. In addition, CC-509 is orally bioavailable and displays dose-dependent efficacy in two rodent models of immune-inflammatory disease. In passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), CC-509 significantly inhibited skin edema. Moreover, CC-509 significantly reduced paw swelling and the tissue levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines RANTES and MIP-1α in the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. In summary, CC-509 is a potent, moderately selective, and efficacious inhibitor of Syk that has a differentiated profile when compared to other Syk compounds that have progressed into the clinic for RA."
https://openalex.org/W2234134859,"The maternal environment has been shown to influence female olfactory preferences through early chemosensory experience. However, little is known about the influence of the maternal environment on chemosignals. In this study, we used two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6 (C57) and BALB/c (BALB), and explored whether adoption could alter male chemosignals and thus influence female olfactory preferences. In Experiment 1, C57 pups were placed with BALB dams. Adult BALB females then served as the subjects in binary choice tests between paired male urine odours (BALB vs. C57, BALB vs. adopted C57 and C57 vs. adopted C57). In Experiment 2, BALB pups were placed with C57 dams, and C57 females served as the subjects in binary choice tests between paired male urine odours (C57 vs. BALB, C57 vs. adopted BALB, and BALB vs. adopted BALB). In both experiments, we found that females preferred the urine of males from different genetic backgrounds, suggesting that female olfactory preferences may be driven by genetic compatibility. Cross-fostering had subtle effects on female olfactory preferences. Although the females showed no preference between the urine odours of adopted and non-adopted males of the other strain, the BALB females preferred the urine odour of BALB males to that of adopted C57 males, whereas the C57 females showed no preference between the urine odour of C57 and adopted BALB males. Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and stepwise discriminant analysis, we found that the ratios of volatile chemicals from urine and preputial gland secretions were altered in the fostered male mice; these changes may have resulted in the behavioural changes observed in the females. Overall, the results suggest that female mice prefer urine odours from males with different genetic backgrounds; this preference may be driven by genetic compatibility. The early maternal environment influences the chemosignals of males and thus may influence the olfactory preferences of females. Our study provides additional evidence in support of genotype-dependent maternal influences on phenotypic variability in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2236213177,"Visual processing of emotional stimuli critically depends on the type of cognitive appraisal involved. The present fMRI pilot study aimed to investigate the cerebral correlates involved in the visual processing of emotional scenes in two tasks, one emotional, based on the appraisal of personal emotional experience, and the other motivational, based on the appraisal of the tendency to action. Given that the use of spatial frequency information is relatively flexible during the visual processing of emotional stimuli depending on the task’s demands, we also explored the effect of the type of spatial frequency in visual stimuli in each task by using emotional scenes filtered in low spatial frequency (LSF) and high spatial frequencies (HSF). Activation was observed in the visual areas of the fusiform gyrus for all emotional scenes in both tasks, and in the amygdala for unpleasant scenes only. The motivational task induced additional activation in frontal motor-related areas (e.g. premotor cortex, SMA) and parietal regions (e.g. superior and inferior parietal lobules). Parietal regions were recruited particularly during the motivational appraisal of approach in response to pleasant scenes. These frontal and parietal activations, respectively, suggest that motor and navigation processes play a specific role in the identification of the tendency to action in the motivational task. Furthermore, activity observed in the motivational task, in response to both pleasant and unpleasant scenes, was significantly greater for HSF than for LSF scenes, suggesting that the tendency to action is driven mainly by the detailed information contained in scenes. Results for the emotional task suggest that spatial frequencies play only a small role in the evaluation of unpleasant and pleasant emotions. Our preliminary study revealed a partial distinction between visual processing of emotional scenes during identification of the tendency to action, and during identification of personal emotional experiences. It also illustrates flexible use of the spatial frequencies contained in scenes depending on their emotional valence and on task demands."
https://openalex.org/W2237652153,"Biomechanical research relies heavily on laboratory evaluation and testing with osseous animal structures. While many femora models are currently in use, including those of the European red deer (Cervus elaphus), the Odocoileus virginianus femur remains undocumented, despite its regional abundance in North America. The objective of this study was to compare biomechanical and morphological properties of the Odocoileus virginianus femur with those of the human and commonly used animal models. Sixteen pairs of fresh-frozen cervine femora (10 male, 6 female, aged 2.1 ± 0.9 years) were used for this study. Axial and torsional stiffnesses (whole bone) were calculated following compression and torsion to failure tests (at rates of 0.1 mm/sec and 0.2°/sec). Lengths, angles, femoral head diameter and position, periosteal and endosteal diaphyseal dimensions, and condylar dimensions were measured. The results show that the cervine femur is closer in length, axial and torsional stiffness, torsional strength, and overall morphology to the human femur than many other commonly used animal femora models; additional morphological measurements are comparable to many other species’ femora. The distal bicondylar width of 59.3mm suggests that cervine femora may be excellent models for use in total knee replacement simulations. Furthermore, the cervine femoral head is more ovoid than other commonly-used models for hip research, making it a more suitable model for studies of hip implants. Thus, with further, more application-specific investigations, the cervine femur could be a suitable model for biomechanical research, including the study of ballistic injuries and orthopaedic device development."
