During an investigation in which the properties of red cells from cases of acute acquired hæmolytic anæmia were compared with red cells ‘changed’ by a filtrate of a broth culture of cholera vibrio, it was found that red cells previously sensitized by an incomplete antibody, and washed, were agglutinated after incubation with the cholera filtrate. Normal cells when so treated do not show any alteration until they are in contact with serum, when they show panagglutination as in the Hubener Thomsen phenomenon5. The ‘T’ agglutinin responsible for the panagglutination is present in all normal sera and can be specifically absorbed by ‘changed’ cells; when incomplete anti-Rh sera are so absorbed and incubated with red cells, together with cholera filtrate, they show specific agglutination of Rh-positive cells. These reactions are shown in the accompanying table."

https://openalex.org/W1996753260,"THE demonstration that purified and apparently homogeneous specimens of ‘A-substance’ prepared from commercial hog gastric mucin possess both A and O blood-group specificity, whereas A-substance isolated from the fluid contents of human pseudomucinous ovarian cysts1 shows no significant O activity, suggested that a closer and more detailed examination of the hog mucin “A-substance” for homogeneity should be undertaken. The best specimens of A-substance of animal origin examined so far have been obtained from commercial preparations of hog gastric mucin or pepsin2, each batch of which contains material from the stomachs of many hogs. In view of the differences known to exist in the serological specificity of the gastric secretions of man3, it seems not improbable that similar serological differences exist in the mucin preparations derived from individual hog's stomachs, and an examination of the serological properties of the mucoids isolated from single stomachs was therefore undertaken."

https://openalex.org/W2044170040,"MANY chemical compounds which inhibit the growth of certain bacteria are structurally related to compounds which are growth stimulators for the same bacteria. This relationship makes of interest the vitamin content of pathogenic bacteria grown on vitamin-free media, since this may give a clue to the structure of compounds which are important in the metabolism of the micro-organism under study and indicate a starting point for the synthesis of possible growth inhibitors. Thus, Ekstrand and Sjögren have reported on the production of p-aminobenzoic acid by the tubercle bacillus1."

Further studies were undertaken to find out if heparin exerted a similar action on the venom of the other common Indian viper, Echis carinatus. The venom used in the experiments was obtained through the courtesy of the director of the Haffkine Institute, Bombay. It was a well-dried sample composed of a mixture of the venom extracted from several Echis vipers."

https://openalex.org/W3147998094,"THE catalytic effect of small amounts of pyridine in the reaction between thionyl chloride and carboxylic acids is well known; Carre and Libermann1 have shown further that it is of great advantage to use equimolar quantities of acid, pyridine, and thionyl chloride, the acid chloride then being formed rapidly at lower temperatures, in high yield. This convenient method apparently has not been very widely used, and instructions for making acid chlorides generally call for the use of excess thionyl chloride and ‘a few drops’ of pyridine."

https://openalex.org/W1996135656,"DURING the course of an investigation on the microbiology of composts made from fresh grass cuttings, it was noticed that a dark brown liquid oozed from the material. A large volume of this liquid is produced, and it is very rich in ammonia nitrogen. Under normal conditions of composting it would be lost, and therefore some knowledge of its production is of considerable interest. The liquid first appears when the compost is at a temperature of 65°55° C."

https://openalex.org/W184251845,"THE future historian of science will certainly characterize the first half of the twentieth century as an age of unsurpassed progress of discovery in physics. He will also note the crescendo in the elaboration of physical techniques and the decisive part they played in the dramatic developments of the sister sciences. Examples are the commonplaces of our scientific practice, and could be culled from almost any active region of investigation. That almost self-evident fact is well illustrated by the record of the Royal Society's medallists of 1946, and I invite reflexion on the extent to which their distinguished experimental contributions have been rendered possible by a quick appreciation of the potentialities of new physical methods. The therm ionic valve, the photo-electric cell, high-vacuum technique, high-pressure technique, production and management of very low and very high temperatures, X-rays, and the use of isotopic and radioactive tracers, are but a few of the tools which modern physics has placed at our disposal."

https://openalex.org/W2033201402,"THE development of stamens in pistillate plants of Melandrium under the influence of Ustilago violacea (Pers.) Fuckel is well known. Recently, this action has been simulated by treatment of plants with the animal hormone testosterone, while the reverse change has been caused by cestrone1,2. None of the authors responsible for accounts of the reversal, whether natural or artificial, has remarked upon the fact that, when such a change from the pistillate to the staminate condition occurs, some characters of pistillate plants are replaced by those typical of staminate plants while others are not. Thus, the copious branching and diminution in size of the leaves which is produced in the region of the inflorescence, and the grouping of the flowers into more or less sessile clusters, all of which are characteristics of staminate plants, appear after infection. On the other hand, the calyx retains the inflated shape characteristic of pistillate plants and, although infection of originally pistillate and staminate plants reduces the length of the calyx-teeth, they retain the characteristic difference in shape, and those of the pistillate plants remain the longer. These characters are seen best in M. album, where the differences between pistillate and staminate plants are more extreme."
https://openalex.org/W2047258802,"IN previous communications, it has been shown that the action of fluorine on the dentin of the rat's incisor tooth depends on the Ca: P ratio of the diet1. With low Ca: P ratio diets, fluorine causes a fine hypercalcified line in the predentin forming at the time of the injection, but on normal or high Ca: P ratio diets, this does not happen, and the effects of fluorine on the predentin are not seen until it starts to calcify. It was suggested that this difference was due to the differences in the blood calcium level, as this is low with low Ca: P ratio diets and normal or high with the other diets. This supposition has been tested in two ways: by raising the blood calcium of animals on the low Ca: P ratio diet, and by lowering the blood calcium of animals on the high Ca: P ratio diet, and observing the effects of fluorine after this has been done."
https://openalex.org/W1980386215,"THE restrictions in the national diet during recent years have encouraged the search for foodstuffs rich in particular nutrients, and considerable attention has been paid to sources of vitamin C. But while many rare or unusual fruits and plants have been examined, the typical English fruit, the apple, has been practically neglected. For it has been generally assumed that most varieties, with the exception of Bramley's Seedling, are very poor sources of the vitamin. For example, the value given by the Medical Research Council tables1 is only 5 mgm. ascorbic acid/100 gm. of edible tissue. The tables of Fixen and Roscoe2, however, quote values lying within the wide range 0.1–31.8 mgm./lOO gm., and even higher values have recently been reported for Bramley's Seedling and Sturmer Pippin3,4,5."

https://openalex.org/W2985439301,"IN 1936 there appeared an admirable book “Histochemie Animale”, by L. Lison. In this book, Lison tried to teach chemistry to the histologists, and by the weight of his own reasoning he was forced to discard a great many time-honoured histological methods the validity of which had never been really investigated. Recently, in an article entitled “Establishment of Cytochemical Techniques”1, J. F. Danielli endeavours to do a similar thing for cytochemistry, and, since some of his criticisms concern techniques which form the backbone of modern cytochemistry, it might, perhaps, be feared that his remarks will leave the cytochemist with a gloomy feeling of being suspended in mid-air without any reliable method to cling to. There is no doubt, however, that Dr. Danielli's plea for more exactness in cytochemistry is necessary and justified, and it is to be hoped that his article will have the same wholesome effect as Lison's book."

https://openalex.org/W1999155523,"ERYTHROCYTES, when suspended in blood plasma, form ‘rouleaux’, in which the single erythrocytes lie parallel like a pile of coins. This phenomenon is dependent on the presence of a specific substance in the plasma. When suspended in an isotonic sugar solution, the erythrocytes settle to the bottom very slowly, without forming any characteristically shaped aggregation. On the other hand, the same suspension of blood cells, when exposed to the influence of a powerful electric field (approximately 100 V./cm.), rapidly forms macroscopically visible aggregations of red blood cells, quickly settling to the bottom. In this way, all erythrocytes are separated from the supernatant sugar solution in a few minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2026869208,"A NUMBER of theories have emerged from time to time attempting to visualize the exact mechanism involved during crossing-over, which is now known to be the sole agent conditioning the formation of the cytologically visible chiasma. Among these the one proposed by Darlington1 based on torsions is the most elaborate, in the sense that it offers an explanation for the long and intricate succession of events. His hypothesis, however, implies a few assumptions for which there are formidable physical objections. The most important of these are: (1) the existence of a pairing force which brings homologues together in the zygotene of meiosis, and (2) the postulate that a break at a particular level in one chromatid under strain induces a break in a non-identical chromatid at precisely the same spot due to transfer of stress. In regard to (1), every cytologist is aware of the physical difficulties which are inherent in suggesting the existence of specific attractions operating over any thing more than extramolecular ranges. However, Delbruck's2 theory of autocatalytic synthesis of poly-peptides appears to provide a physico-chemical basis for this force of attraction. In order to test the validity of the second assumption, an attempt is now made to examine the forces operating in a helical system which is in equilibrium under torsion."

It has been customary to compute the result in such cases by the direct-reading method, which from the statistical point of view is unsatisfactory in more than one respect, while further examination of the data is difficult or impossible."
https://openalex.org/W2043824269,"STATISTICAL analysis and the logic of inductive inference are taking a part of increasing importance in many branches of scientific research and technology. Evidence of this is provided by the wide range of scientific journals and meetings in which there is frequent discussion of points of statistical technique. A few years ago, the statistical aspect of problems under consideration at scientific meetings was seldom mentioned; to-day there is a welcome tendency for societies to keep their members informed of developments in statistical methodology important to their field of study. At a well-attended joint meeting of the Society of Public Analysts and Other Analytical Chemists and of the Food Grqup of the Society of Chemical Industry, held on December 4, papers on “The Application of Statistical Methods to Food Problems” were read and discussed. The president of the Society of Public Analysts, Dr. G. W. Monier-Williams, was in the chair."

https://openalex.org/W2411645889,"IN his three Salmon Memorial Lectures before the New York Academy of Medicine, Dr. D. M. Levy traced the growth of modern psychiatry and showed its influence on psychiatric thought. Dr. Levy commenced his career in the Illinois Institute for Juvenile Research in 1920. The study of delinquency was then very much under the influence of the work of Dr. William Healy, and was beginning to be applied to criminology. Healy himself was building upon the foundations laid by Meyer, Binet and Freud. Meyer had developed the view that behaviour is a reaction to environment, and under him psychiatry became the study of purpose and response. Binet had opened the way to the measurement of mental powers by his work on school-children, and Freud had stripped away illusions to show the real motivation behind conduct. The result of their impact upon Healy was his book, “Mental Conflict and Misconduct”."
